Pursuant to CCP § 430.41, before filing a
demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to. Defendant’s counsel asserts that they tried to
telephone and email Plaintiff based on the information provided in the Complaint,
but the telephone number has been disconnected and the email returned as
undeliverable. (Phillips Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.) The court notes that Plaintiff was
served with notice of this demurrer at the address listed in the Complaint, but
no opposition has been filed. “Any determination by the court that the meet and
confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).)
