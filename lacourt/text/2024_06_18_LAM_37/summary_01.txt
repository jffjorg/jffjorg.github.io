Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has ruled that Defendant Quality Loan Service Corporation's demurrer to Plaintiff Sandra D. Gaslin's Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff's claims under the Homeowner Bill of Rights (HBOR) are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff's claims for wrongful foreclosure, quiet title, and set aside sale of Deed of Trust are also barred by the statute of limitations. The court found that the plaintiff failed to allege facts to show that the statute of limitations has not accrued. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to tender the amount of secured indebtedness as required by law. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend.
