Background
 
On January 29, 2024,
Sanda D. Gaslin (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against First Guaranty
Financial Corporation dba Hillcrest, Fund; Marmat Peterson Inc.; and Quality
Loan Service Corporation (“Quality Loan”). 
 
The Complaint alleges
four causes of action: (1) To Set Aside Sale, (2) Cancel Deed of Trust , (3)
Quiet Title, and (4) Wrongful Foreclosure. 
 
Defendant Quality
Loan now demurs to the Complaint. The Demurrer is unopposed. 
 
 
 
 
demurrer
to complaint[1]
 
I.               
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient
to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form
part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861,
872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.            
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant Quality Loan requests
judicial notice of the following: 
 
The court may take judicial notice of “official acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of
any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or
(2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of the United States,”
and “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and
are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, § 452(c), (d), and (h).) 
 
1)    
Exhibit A: Deed of Trust recorded on
3/4/2002, in LOS ANGELES County Recorder’s Office as Instrument Number
02-0497791.
 
2)    
Exhibit B: Assignments of Deed of Trust. 
 
3)

judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin
v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        Summary of Allegations in Complaint
 
Plaintiff alleges she
was the owner of the real property located at 6709 S. Victoria Avenue, located
in Los Angeles, CA (the “Property”). (Compl., ¶ 1.) On September 27, 2018,
Defendant Marmat Peterson (“Marmat”) bought the deed from Quality Loan in
response to a notice of intent to sell the Deed of Trust of Property at auction
on October 25, 2018. (Compl., ¶ 9.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges
that the Sale of the Deed of Trust was improper because the sale occurred while
Plaintiff’s appeal time of a repayment plan for the mortgage was occurring.
(Compl., ¶ 10.) Midland Mortgage rejected Plaintiff’s chosen payment plan on
September 7, 2018, so from that date to October 7, 2018, Plaintiff had a month
to appeal, and the trustee was required to halt foreclosure proceedings during
the time of appeal. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff asserts that posting the sale of
the Deed of Trust during the time of appeal was dual tracking and in violation
of the Homeowner Bill of Rights (“HBOR”). (Compl., ¶ 10.) Accordingly, the dual
tracking made the sale of the Deed of Trust invalid.  (Compl., ¶¶ 10, 11, 15.) 
 
B.        First and Second Causes of Action – Set
Aside Sale and Cancel Deed of Trust
 
The Homeowner Bill of Rights
(“HBOR”) was enacted “to ensure that, as part of the nonjudicial foreclosure
process, borrowers are considered for, and have a meaningful opportunity to
obtain, available loss mitigation options, if any, offered by or through the
borrower's mortgage servicer, such as loan modifications or other alternatives
to foreclosure.” (Civ. Code, § 2923.4.)[2]  
 
Among
other things, HBOR prohibits “dual tracking,” which occurs when a bank
forecloses on a loan while negotiating with the borrower to avoid foreclosure.
(§ 2923.6.) HBOR provides for injunctive relief for statutory violations that
occur prior to foreclosure (§ 2924.12, subd. (a)), and monetary damages when
the borrower seeks relief for violations after the foreclosure sale has
occurred. (§ 2924.12, subd. (b).)


(Valbuena v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1272.) 
In other words, under section 2942.12 of
the HBOR, a Plaintiff may seek injunctive relief to stop the sale of the deed
of trust, but not to undo the sale. (Civ Code, § 2924.12(a)(1) [“(a)(1) If a
trustee's deed upon sale has not been recorded, a borrower may bring an action
for injunctive relief to enjoin a material violation of Section” 2923.6].)
“After a trustee's deed upon sale has been recorded, a mortgage servicer,
mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent shall be liable to a
borrower for actual economic damages pursuant to Section 3281, resulting from a
material violation of Section” 2923.6. (Civ. Code, § 2924.12.) Therefore, as
the Sale of the Deed of Trust occurred on October 25, 2018, Plaintiff cannot
seek to have the Sale set aside under the HBOR and can only sue for damages. 
 
The Complaint fails to allege facts to
show that other provisions of the HBOR permit the court to Set Aside the Sale
of the Deed of Trust and Cancel the Deed of Trust. “We hold that the
availability of injunctive relief under the HBOR is governed exclusively by its
two provisions—sections 2924.12, subdivision (a)(1) and 2924.19, subdivision
(a)(1) (sections 2924.12(a)(1) and 2924.19(a)(1))—in which the Legislature
authorized the courts to interpose such relief into the nonjudicial foreclosure
scheme.” (Lucioni v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th
150, 155.) 
 
Defendant Quality Loan further
asserts that Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.
Under CCP § 338, a three-year statute of limitation applies for “[a]n action
upon liability creates by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture.” (CCP §
338(a).) Therefore, because the sale on the Deed of Trust occurred on October
25, 2018, Plaintiff’s claims brought under the HBOR are time-barred because
this action was not filed until January 29, 2024. (Compl., ¶ 10.) 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
first and second causes of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
C.        Third Cause of Action – Quiet Title
 
In an action for quiet title, a
plaintiff must plead: 1) a description of the property that is the subject of
the action, specifically the location of tangible personal property and the
legal description and street address or common designation of real property, 2)
the title of the plaintiff as to which a determination under this chapter is
sought and the basis of the title, 3) the adverse claims to the title of the
plaintiff against which a determination is sought, 4) the date as of which the
determination is sought, and 5) a prayer for the determination of the title of
the plaintiff against the adverse claims. (See CCP § 761.020.) This cause of
action also requires tender of indebtedness. (Aguilar v. Bocci (1974) 39
Cal.App.3d 475, 477.) A lis pendens must be filed in a quiet title action.
(CCP, § 741.010(b); see also Carr v. Rosien (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 845,
851.) 
 
Defendant Quality Loan asserts
that because Plaintiff’s third cause of action is premised on violation of the
HBOR, a three-year statute of limitations applies and Plaintiff’s claim for
quiet title is time-barred. (See Salazar v. Thomas (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 467, 476 [For a quiet title action “courts refer to the underlying
theory of relief to determine the applicable period of
limitations”].) Defendant Quality Loan further asserts that a claim for quiet
title cannot be alleged against it because it does not have title or hold
ownership in the Property, only Defendant Marmat does. (Compl., ¶ 14, Ex. 2.) 
Moreover, while a cause of action for violation
of the HBOR does not require tender, a claim for wrongful foreclosure does. “In short, we agree with plaintiffs that a
tender of the amount due under section 2923.6.” (Valbuena, supra,
237 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.) “A borrower may not, however, quiet title against
a secured lender without first paying the outstanding debt on which the
mortgage or deed of trust is based.” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 86.) Lastly, Plaintiff
failed to file a lis pendens. (CCP § 741.010(b).) 
Based on the above, the demurrer to the
third cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
D.        Fourth Cause of Action – Wrongful
Foreclosure
 
“The basic elements of a tort cause of
action for wrongful foreclosure track the elements of an equitable cause of
action to set aside a foreclosure sale. They are: ‘(1) the trustee or mortgagee
caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property
pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust;
(2) the party attacking the sale (usually but not always the trustor or
mortgagor) was prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or
mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of
the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.’ ” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 394, 408 quoting Lona v. Citibank, N.A. (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 89, 104.) 
 
Defendant Quality Loan again asserts that
the third cause of action is barred by the three-year statute of limitations.
(CCP § 338(a); see Engstrom v. Kallins (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 773, 781 [Applying the three-year statute of limitations to a
wrongful foreclosure action].) Plaintiff has not opposed this demurrer nor does
the Complaint cite facts to show that the statute of limitations has not
accrued. Therefore, the demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained
without leave to amend. 
 
Based on the above, the demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Quality Loan’s demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. Defendant to give
notice.
