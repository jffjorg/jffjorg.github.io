Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one, and has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objection within 20 days. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in part, ordering the plaintiff and his counsel to pay $510.00 to the defendant's counsel within 20 days. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to serve a timely response to the defendant's interrogatories, which waived any objection to the interrogatories and gave the defendant the right to move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.
