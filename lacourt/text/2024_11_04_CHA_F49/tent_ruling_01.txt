BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs Bobby Burgess Sr. (“Burgess Sr.”) and Bobby
Burgess Jr. (“Burgess Jr.”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act lawsuit over alleged defects in their 2020 Ford
Ranger, VIN 1FTER1EH6LLA77085 (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured
by Defendant Ford Motor Company (“Ford”). Plaintiffs purchased the Subject Vehicle
on or about December 28, 2020, entering into a warranty contract with Ford. (Compl.
¶¶ 10, 58.)
 
On July 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against Defendants Ford, AutoNation Ford
Valencia (“AutoNation”), and
Does 1 through 10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Violation of
Subdivision (D) of Civil Code Section 1793.2 (against Ford), (2) Violation of
Subdivision (B) of Civil Code Section 1793.2 (against Ford), (3) Violation of
Subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2 (against Ford), (4) Breach of
The Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civ. Code, § 1791.1; § 1795.5)
(against Ford), (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment (against Ford), and (6)
Negligent Repair (against AutoNation). Subsequently, on November 8, 2023, Ford
and AutoNation filed their Answer to the Complaint.
 
On August 1, 2024, Ford filed the instant Motion to Compel
Burgess Jr.’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (the
“Motion”). Subsequently, Burgess Jr. filed his Opposition to the Motion on
October 15, 2024, and Ford replied on October 22, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Timeliness
of the Motion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300
provides that “[u]nless notice of [a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories] is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.”
(§ 2030.300,
subd. (c).)
 
The 45-day limitation is
“‘jurisdictional’ in the sense that it renders the court without authority to
rule on [untimely] motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410, fn. omitted (Sexton).) But nothing in section 2030.300 precludes a
party who misses the deadline for compelling further responses to one form of
discovery from attempting to obtain the same information by a different form of
discovery. (See Carter v. Superior Court (1990) 218
Cal.App.3d 994, 997 (Carter).) 
 
            Here, it is
undisputed that Burgess Jr.’s responses to the Special Interrogatories, Set
One, were served on March 22, 2024, and verifications were subsequently served via
email on April 29, 2024. (Weiser Decl. ¶
4, Moawad Decl. ¶
4.) The 45-day clock started to tick when the verifications were served, establishing
the 45-day deadline as June 17, 2024, with an extension of two additional court
days based on the service method, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(3)(B).
 
However, Ford served and filed the
instant Motion on August 2, 2024, failing to meet the deadline. Nevertheless,
Ford asserts that Burgess Jr.’s counsel agreed to extend Ford’s deadline to
notice the Motion. (Mot. at p. 6, Moawad Decl. ¶ 5.) More, in its Reply, Ford states that “the
parties came to an agreement to provide Plaintiffs with additional time to
serve supplemental responses to Ford’s Interrogatories. [] In this agreement,
Plaintiffs likewise agreed to provide an extension to Ford’s deadline to notice
a motion to compel to August 1, 2024.” (Reply at p. 4, Amin Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, subdivision (c) specifies that any of such extension requires “the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.”
 
Ford’s counsel presents a copy of
its June 17, 2024 email to Burgess Jr.’s counsel, stating, in part, “This
email is to confirm and summarize our discussion and mutual agreement
reached earlier today.... Therefore, you have until July 11, 2024, to provide
supplemental responses in the following matters [including the present case]. Accordingly,
Ford’s motion to compel deadlines will be extended the same to August 1, 2024.”
 (Moawad Decl. Ex.  “G.”) (Underlines added.) No correspondence
from Burgess Jr.’s counsel in response to this email has been presented to the
Court
 
In response, Plaintiff Burgess Jr.
argues that Ford waived its right to file the Motion by failing to meet the 45-day
deadline. Furthermore, Burgess Jr. contends that the discussion on June 17,
2024 involves no subsequent agreement to extend the filing deadline was made
between the parties. (Opp’n. at pp. 2-4.) 
 
Specifically, Burgess Jr.’s counsel, Anna Weiser (“Wiser”),
attests that “[o]n June 17, 2024, I had a call with Defendant’s counsel, Zack
Amin, regarding Plaintiffs’ responses to Defendant’s discovery requests.
Defendant’s counsel requested supplemental responses for a few matters.
Following our call, Defendant’s counsel sent an email of 24 cases. However,
nowhere in the conversation did I agree to supplement 24 cases. I never
confirmed in writing to extend Defendant’s Motion to Compel deadline in this
matter. The previous phone conversation took approximately 2 minutes.”
(Weiser Decl. ¶
8.)
 
The issue before the Court is whether a
confirming email from one party alone satisfies the statutory requirement that
both parties “have agreed in writing.” It notes that as with any issue of statutory interpretation, “[w]e begin ...
with the statute's actual words, the ‘most reliable indicator’ of legislative
intent, ‘assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings, and
construing them in context. If the words themselves are not ambiguous, we
presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the statute's plain meaning
governs. On the other hand, if the language allows more than one reasonable
construction, we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the
measure and maxims of statutory construction. In cases of uncertain meaning, we
may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation, including
its impact on public policy.” (Wells v. One2One Learning
Foundation (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1164, 1190.)
 
Here, the language of Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, subdivision (c) is clear: a valid extension requires written
agreement by both the propounding and responding parties. This indicates that oral or
implied consent is insufficient, even if a party’s actions suggest
acceptance. Affirmative written consent from both parties is required.   
 
            Ford does
not contend that Burgess Jr. or his counsel has “agreed in writing” to the
extension. Nor does Ford suggest that the statute’s language is ambiguous or
allows more than one reasonable construction. On the contrary, the Court finds
that the statute’s ordinary meaning aligns with the Legislature’s intent to require
clear, definitive written consent from both sides to avoid precisely this type
of dispute over extension agreements beyond the statutory 45-day limit.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court finds that Ford’s claim of a mutually agreed extension to file this
Motion is not supported by the evidence required under the statute.
Consequently, the 45-day limit applies in this case. 
 
            Since the
Motion was filed on August 2, 2024, failing to meet the statutory deadline of
June 17, 2024, this failure to meet the 45-day limit renders the Court without
authority to rule on the untimely Motion, other than to deny it. 
 
            Therefore,
the Motion is DENIED.
            
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Ford also requests the imposition of monetary
sanctions against Burgess Jr. in the amount of $560.00 (Mot. at p. 13.)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300,
subdivision (d), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”
 
However, as the Court has denied the Motion, it finds
that the monetary sanctions are inapplicable in this instance. 
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Ford’s request for sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, filed
by Defendant Ford Motor Company, is DENIED.
 
Defendant
Ford Motor Company’s request for monetary sanctions
is DENIED.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
