And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents filed by the plaintiff, Verneshia Ingram. The plaintiff alleges that a Jaguar Land Rover Velar vehicle suffers from defects in the electronic system impacting connectivity and vehicle monitoring. The defendant, Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, has produced 1,093 pages of documents, but the plaintiff claims they are inadequate.

The judge grants the motion and orders the defendant to produce further responses to certain requests for production of documents. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer on certain issues within 15 days of this order.

The judge notes that it generally adheres to a policy limiting discovery to the make, model, and year of the vehicle. The judge also declines to allow open-ended, broad-based discovery spanning multiple years and other makes and models under the Jaguar umbrella of vehicles.

The judge finds that the relevance objections, form of question, burdensome, equally available, and premature expert opinion objections lack merit and support in either the objections themselves or opposition. The judge also notes that the defendant's objections to certain requests for production of documents are disingenuous and intentionally obstreperous.

The judge orders the parties to refine database search terms to items such as trouble codes, reports, similar defect reports, and recalls, and production shall occur no later than 30 days after the lapse of the meet and confer period. The judge also orders the defendant to provide a privilege log to each and every withheld item.

If necessary, the court can appoint a discover referee in order to facilitate any extensive review required of the thousands of pages of documents. The judge notes that sanctions may be imposed in the future if the parties do not comply with the court's orders.
