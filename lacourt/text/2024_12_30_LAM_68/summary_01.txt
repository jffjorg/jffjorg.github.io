And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiffs, Adan Marin and Claudia Fernandez, are seeking $50,887.50 in attorney fees and $4,024.216 in costs. The defendant, General Motors, LLC, has opposed the motion, arguing that it is untimely and the fees are excessive. The judge has ruled that the motion must be denied unless and until a judgment is entered, as the court cannot consider the merits of the motion without a preceding judgment. The court has also declined to consider the argument that the motion was timely filed and served under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b). The judge has continued the action for 90 days pending entry of a judgment, and has ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs if they wish to argue the propriety of the action.
