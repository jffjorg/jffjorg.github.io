BACKGROUND
This is an involuntary dissolution action. On May 21, 2021, Plaintiff Maria Angela Rodriguez (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants Mercado Latino, Inc. (Mercado Latino), Grosac, Inc. (Grosac), Richard Yarruths Rodriguez (Richard), Roberto Rodriguez (Roberto), Jorge Rodriguez (Jorge) (collectively, Defendants) and Does 1 through 50 for involuntary dissolution of Mercado Latino, involuntary dissolution of Grosac, breach of fiduciary duty, and an accounting.

On March 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s First Request for Production of Documents to Richard and Roberto, respectively. On July 13, 2023, Richard and Robert opposed the motions. On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff replied.

LEGAL STANDARD
“(a) On receipt of a response to a request for production of documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses if:
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following:
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (a), (b).)

MEET AND CONFER
	Plaintiff has provided a declaration regarding the parties’ meet and confer efforts in connection with this motion. Counsel for Plaintiff indicates having sent a meet and confer letter to counsel for Richard and Roberto but that no response was received. (Ehrlich Decls., ¶¶ 7-9, Ex. C.) However, counsel for Richard and Roberto indicated in their oppositions that, contrary to Plaintiff’s counsel’s assertion, they did respond to Plaintiff’s counsel’s meet and confer letter. (Leight Decls., Exs. 1 & 2.) The Court finds the parties have minimally met and conferred but admonishes counsel for Plaintiff for having either misstated or misrepresented the extent of the parties’ meet and confer efforts. For this reason, the Court declines to award Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions. 

DISCUSSION
	Request Nos. 6-19
	For Request Numbers 6 through 19, both Richard and Robert provided the following response:

Objection. Violates CCP § 2031.030(c)(1) in that it does not specifically describe the items to be produced or reasonably particularize the category of item, thereby rendering this demand vague and ambiguous.

	The Court finds these objections to be without merit. There is nothing about Request Numbers 6 through 19 that render them vague, ambiguous, or insufficiently particularized. (See Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1286 [affirming trial court’s finding that the objection to the term “economic damages” on grounds of vagueness and ambiguity was “preposterous”].)

	Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motions as to Request Numbers 6 through 19.

	Request Nos. 20-29
	For Request Numbers 20 through 29, Richard and Roberto responded as follows:

Objection. Violates Art. I, Section 1 of the California Constitution, which establishes an individual’s right to privacy. California courts have consistently held that an individuals’ financial information constitutes private and confidential information. Harris vs. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal. App. 4th 661, 664; Babcock vs. Superior Court (1994) 29 Cal. App. 4th 721 ’ “ [i]t is elementary that a party has a privacy interest in his or her personal financial records”. Id. at 726. 
It is also burdensome and oppressive in that it seeks ten years of documents from multiple institutions, which would require Defendant to spend multiple hours on the phone and/or online to determine if documents still exist going back ten years and to collect such documents. It is also overbroad as to scope. It is irrelevant.”

The Court finds the objections of burdensome and oppressive to be without merit. As Plaintiff correctly contends, all discovery responses impose some burden. (See West Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 418.) However, the Court does find there to be some merit to Richard and Roberto’s privacy objections, as Plaintiff is seeking documents regarding their respective compensations received from Mercado Latino and Grosac and other matters related to this action. (5. [8:293] Privacy Protection:, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 8C-5, citing Cobb v. Sup.Ct. (Tleel) (1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 543, 550 [“A right of privacy exists as to a party's confidential financial affairs, even when the information sought is admittedly relevant to the litigation.”]) The Court also notes, however, that much of this information is also necessary for Plaintiff’s claims in this action.

The Court finds that the appropriate solution here would be a protective order (see Cobb, supra, 99 Cal.App.3d at p. 550), which the parties can find on the website for the Los Angeles County Superior Court or they can craft separately if necessary. Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions as to Request Numbers 20 through 29, subject to the parties entering into such a protective order.

Request Nos. 30-33
For Request Numbers 30 through 33, Richard and Roberto responded as follows:

To the extent they are in the possession or under the control of Responding Party, these documents will be produced.

The Court agrees with Plaintiff that these responses are incomplete and evasive. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2); see also Id., § 2031.230 [“A representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.”])

Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motions as to Request Numbers 30 through 33.

Request Nos. 34-35
For Request Numbers 34 through 35, Richard and Roberto responded as follows:

Objection. Violates CCP § 2031.030(c)(1) in that it does not specifically describe the items to be produced or reasonably particularize the category of item, thereby rendering this demand vague and ambiguous. 
Without waving this objection, all business records of Mercado are in the possession of Mercado and they are not in my “personal possession, custody, or control.”

The Court finds the term “business records” to be vague and insufficiently particularized. The Court also finds that Richard and Roberto were named in their individual capacities and as such are not required to produce business records of the corporations, unless such records are in their personal possession, custody or control. However, as noted above, Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230 requires a statement from the responding party affirming that a diligent search and reasonable inquiry have been conducted in an effort to comply with the demands, and if they are unable to comply, the reasons for that inability, plus the contact information of the persons believed to have possession, custody, or control of the responsive documents. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)

Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motions as to Request Numbers 34 and 35 so that Richard and Roberto can comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230.

For the reasons set forth above, the Court denies Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions. The Court also denies Richard’s and Roberto’s reciprocal requests for monetary sanctions since the Court has otherwise granted Plaintiff’s motions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).)

CONCLUSION
	The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel further responses.

The Court orders Richard to provide further responses with the corresponding responsive documents to Plaintiff’s First Request for Production of Documents, Request Numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35. The Court orders Richard to also provide further responses with the corresponding responsive documents to Request Numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, subject to the parties entering into a protective order. The Court DENIES the parties’ requests for monetary sanctions.

The Court orders Roberto to provide further responses with the corresponding responsive documents to Plaintiff’s First Request for Production of Documents, Request Numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35. The Court orders Richard to also provide further responses with the corresponding responsive documents to Request Numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, subject to the parties entering into a protective order. The Court DENIES the parties’ requests for monetary sanctions.

Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
