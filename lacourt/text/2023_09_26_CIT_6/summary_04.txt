**Case Name:** Benjamin Chui v. Scott Warmuth, et al.

**Case Number:** 22PSCV01588

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Court's Ruling:**

* **Sustains** the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action with leave to amend. This means the Plaintiff's original complaint is not sufficient to proceed with these claims, but they have a chance to fix it.
* **Denies** the motion to strike as moot.


**Key Points:**

* **Legal Claims:** The case involves professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent concealment.
* **Plaintiff's Argument:**  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants, a law firm and its lawyer, provided inadequate legal advice regarding post-marital agreements, leading to financial harm.
* **Defendant's Argument:** Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims lack specificity and fail to establish causation and damages.
* **Judge's Reasoning:** The Judge agrees with Defendants, finding that Plaintiff's complaint doesn't provide enough detail to support the claims.  Specifically, Plaintiff needs to:

    * **Professional Negligence:** Clearly show how Defendants' actions caused Plaintiff's financial losses.
    * **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Explain how Defendants had a duty to disclose information to Plaintiff and how they breached that duty.
    * **Fraudulent Concealment:** Identify specific facts that were concealed, when they were concealed, and how Plaintiff was harmed by the concealment.

* **Next Steps:** Plaintiff has 10 days to file an amended complaint addressing the Judge's concerns.

The case involves Plaintiff Benjamin Chui, who filed a complaint against Defendants Scott Warmuth, Law Offices of Scott Warmuth, and Yesenia Acosta, alleging professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. Defendants filed a demurrer and motion to strike to the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and motion to strike, and Defendants replied. The Court finds that the demurrer is sustained as to the First Cause of Action for professional negligence because Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts establishing that but for the alleged malpractice, it is more likely than not he would have obtained a more favorable result. The demurrer is also sustained as to the Second Cause of Action for breach of fiduciary duty because Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts showing that Defendants’ alleged breach of fiduciary duty caused Plaintiff’s alleged damages. The demurrer is sustained as to the Third Cause of Action for fraud based on concealment because the FAC lacks the specificity necessary to support a claim for fraudulent concealment. The motion to strike is denied as moot because the basis for Plaintiff’s punitive damages and emotional distress damage claims were from the Second Cause of Action and Third Cause of Action, which the Court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve an amended pleading and provide proof of service of same within ten calendar days of the Court’s order. The Court grants Defendants’ requests for judicial notice as to the existence, content, and authenticity of public records and other specified documents, but not as to the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents.

## Case Summary: Benjamin Chui v. Scott Warmuth et al.

**Case Number:** 22PSCV01588
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Court:** Department 6

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** Benjamin Chui
* **Defendants:** Scott Warmuth, Law Offices of Scott Warmuth (dba), Scott Warmuth, Yesenia Acosta, and Does 1 through 100

**Legal Action:** Professional negligence

**Summary:**

This case involves a professional negligence claim filed by Benjamin Chui against attorney Scott Warmuth and his firm. Chui alleges that Warmuth provided inadequate legal advice regarding two post-marital agreements (PMAs) he signed with his now deceased spouse, Sinora Chan. 

The court **sustained the demurrer** (a procedural challenge to the legal sufficiency of the complaint) to all three causes of action in Chui's complaint with leave to amend:

* **First Cause of Action (Professional Negligence):** The court found that Chui failed to adequately allege that Warmuth's alleged negligence directly caused his damages. 
* **Second Cause of Action (Breach of Fiduciary Duty):** The court found that Chui failed to provide sufficient factual support for his claim of a breach of fiduciary duty by Warmuth.
* **Third Cause of Action (Fraud Based on Concealment):** The court ruled that Chui's allegations of fraud lacked the necessary specificity and factual detail required to state a valid claim.

**Key Points:**

* The court **denied the motion to strike** as moot, as the substantive issues raised by the demurrer were more relevant.
*  Chui was given **leave to amend** his complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court.
* The court **admonished** the defendants for failing to properly meet and confer before filing their demurrer and motion to strike.

**Next Steps:**

Chui now has **ten days** to file an amended complaint addressing the court's concerns.
