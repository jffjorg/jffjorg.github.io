And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for entry of default judgment against Shujan Zhang, the defendant, without prejudice. The plaintiff, Puente Hills Business Center II, L.P., had sought default judgment in the amount of $125,702.52, including $122,075.61 in damages, $3,110.76 in attorney's fees, and $516.15 in costs. However, the judge found that the amount of damages requested was not supported by the evidence, specifically the "Unamortized Commission" and "Unamortized Tenant Improvement Costs" claimed by the plaintiff. Additionally, the judge noted a minor discrepancy between the amount of damages listed in the Request for Entry of Default Judgment and the proposed judgment. As a result, the request for entry of default judgment was denied without prejudice, allowing the parties to re-file or continue with the case.
