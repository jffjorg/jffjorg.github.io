And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's motion to strike the settlement agreement. The court finds that the motion is defective on multiple grounds, including that it seeks to strike a settlement agreement, which is not a pleading subject to a motion to strike, and that it fails to comply with the requirements of rule 3.1113 of the California Rules of Court. The court also admonishes the plaintiff for failing to meet and confer with the defendant before filing the motion. The court orders the plaintiff to provide notice and proof of service of the order within five calendar days.
