 Case Number:  22PSCV00314    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  6 Case Name: Puente Hills Business Center II, L.P. v. Shujan ZhangTENTATIVE RULING DENIED  without prejudice. BACKGROUND Plaintiff  Puente Hills Business Center II, L.P. (Plaintiff) entered into a commercial  lease agreement with Defendant Shujan Zhang (Defendant) for certain real  property located at 17800 Castleton Street, Suite 445, City of Industry,  California, 91748 (the Property). In February 2022, Defendant abandoned the  Property and defaulted under the lease agreement.  On March 30, 2022, Plaintiff  filed this action against Defendant and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of action  for breach of the written lease agreement and common counts. On May 5, 2022,  default was entered against Defendant, but the parties later stipulated to  setting aside the default. On May 3, 2023, after a series of failed court  appearances by Defendant, the Court struck Defendant’s answer to the complaint.  Plaintiff obtained entry of default against Defendant on the same day, and  later filed a request for entry of default judgment on June 19, 2023. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible  evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as  necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of  judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or  an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,  supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary;  and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement  of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $125,702.52,  including $122,075.61in damages, $3,110.76 in attorney’s fees, and  $516.15 in costs. The Court finds the amount of damages requested to not be  supported by the evidence. Plaintiff claims $6,602.15 in “Unamortized Commission”  and $15,624.49 in “Unamortized Tenant Improvement Costs.” (Igo Decl., ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff cites to nowhere in the lease agreement that entitles Plaintiff to  recover those costs in connection with this matter or otherwise showed how  those amounts were calculated.  The  Court also notices a minor discrepancy between the amount of damages listed in  the Request for Entry of Default Judgment (Form CIV-100) and the proposed  judgment (Form JUD-100) by the amount of $1.00. Form CIV-100 indicates  $122,075.61 while Form JUD-100 indicates $122,076.61.   Accordingly,  the Court DENIES the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. CONCLUSION   The request for entry of  default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
