sur-reply. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)


[2]           Defendant
Prestige also argues that res judicata applies based on a small claims action
filed by Plaintiff. On January 5, 2022, while the Prior Action was proceeding,
Plaintiff filed an action in the small claims division of the Los Angeles
Superior Court against Michelle Ghidotti (Ghidotti), Case No. 22STSC00039.
(Def.’s RJN, Ex. H.) Ghidotti is principal of Defendant Prestige. (Def.’s RJN,
Ex. I.) Plaintiff’s small claims action against Ghidotti resulted in entry of
judgment for Ghidotti and a finding that Plaintiff is not owed any money from
Ghidotti. (Def.’s RJN, Ex. J.) The Court need not address this other action
having already found the Complaint was barred by the Prior Action.
