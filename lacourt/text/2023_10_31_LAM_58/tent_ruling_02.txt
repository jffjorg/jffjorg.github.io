Hearing Date:             October 31,
2023
Case Name:                Davis
v. Hoorizadeh  
Case No.:                    23STCV13327
Motion:                       Demurrer
and Motion to Strike
Moving Party:             Defendant
Prestige
Default Services, LLC

Opposing Party:          Plaintiff
Salome Davis

Tentative Ruling:      The
Demurrer to the Complaint is sustained in its entirety without leave to amend. The
Motion to Strike is moot.

             
            This case arises from the foreclosure
of real property located at 1842 W. 50th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90062
(Property). Plaintiff Salome Davis (Plaintiff) alleges that Defendant
Prestige Default Services (Prestige), the foreclosure trustee, embezzled
property by recording different title documents and that Defendant Prestige committed
fraud by not providing notice of the Property sale.
 
            On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff sued Defendants
Mikel Hoorizadeh, Jospeh Trenk, and Prestige Default Services, LLC, alleging causes
of action for (1.) embezzlement of real property, (2.) embezzlement of real
property, (3.) embezzlement of real property, (4.) embezzlement of real
property, (5.) fraud, (6.) embezzlement of real property, and (7.) grand theft.

 
Defendant Prestige
demurs to the entire Complaint. Defendant also filed a motion to strike. Plaintiff
opposes the demurrer and motion to strike. Defendant filed a reply. Plaintiff
filed a “rebuttal” to the reply.[1]

 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint must be
dismissed because he has previously litigated the same issues in this court and
lost. Accordingly, the doctrine of claim preclusion disposes of this action. The
Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The motion to strike is
moot. 
 
Evidentiary Issues
 
         Defendant Prestige’s
unopposed request for judicial notice of Exhibits A-J is
granted. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (d).) 
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
Defendant
Prestige demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it is barred by the
doctrine of res judicata and Plaintiff has failed to state a claim. 
 
The
Complaint alleges, October 26, 2007, Plaintiff obtained a mortgage loan from
Flagstar Bank, FSB in the original amount of $380,750.00; the loan was secured
by a deed of trust against the Property. (Compl., ¶ 8, Ex. 1.) On June 24,
2021, Defendant Prestige recorded a Notice of Default, listing a past due amount
of $64,232.40 as of June 22, 2021. (Compl., Ex. 3.) On January 3, 2022, the
Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale was recorded indicating that the Property had been
sold at a public auction, on December 1, 2021, to Defendant Mikel Hoorizadeh.
(Compl., Ex. 5.) 
 
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant Prestige engaged in acts that constituted
embezzlement under Penal Code section 504 and fraud, with respect to various
foreclosure related recordings and filings. (Compl., ¶ 9-12, 14, Ex. 2
[Substitution of Trustee], Ex. 3 [Notice of Default], Ex. 4 [Notice of
Trustee’s Sale], Ex. 5 [Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale], Ex. 7 [Hoorizadeh’s
Complaint for Unlawful Detainer against Plaintiff].) 
 
On
demurrer, Defendant argues that Davis’s claims are all barred by the doctrine
of res judicata. Plaintiff Davis previously sued, among others, Defendant Prestige
in Los Angeles Superior Court asserting the same claims he raises here.  He lost that case. (Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 21STCP02447 [Prior Action].) As a result, Davis is barred from asserting
the same claims in this action.
“ ‘The
doctrine of res judicata rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,
or some other with whom he is in privity, has litigated, or had an opportunity
to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent
jurisdiction, and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the
harassment and vexation of his opponent.’ [Citation.]” (Pollock v.
University of Southern California (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1427.) “The
application of the doctrine in a given case depends upon an affirmative answer
to these three questions: (1) Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication
identical with the one presented in the action in question? (2) Was there a
final judgment on the merits? (3) Was the party against whom the plea is
asserted a party to or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?
[Citations.]” (Levy v. Cohen (1977) 19 Cal.3d 165, 171; see In re
Marriage of Modnick (1983) 33 Cal.3d 897, 904, fn. 6.)
The term “res judicata” is often
used as an umbrella term encompassing the principles of
claim preclusion and issue preclusion, viewed as two separate
aspects of a single doctrine. (DKN Holdings LLC v. Faerber (2015)
61 Cal.4th 813, 824.) “Claim preclusion, the ‘ “ ‘primary aspect’ ” ’ of
res judicata, acts to bar claims that were, or should have been, advanced in a
previous suit involving the same parties. [Citation.] Issue preclusion,
the ‘ “ ‘secondary aspect’ ” ’ historically called collateral estoppel,
describes the bar on relitigating issues that were argued and decided in
the first suit.” [Citation].) (Id. at p. 824 [quoting Boeken v.
Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 788, 797].)
Unlike issue preclusion,
claim preclusion is directed at “entire causes of action.” (DKN
Holdings, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 824.) Generally,
“[c]laim preclusion arises if a second suit involves: (1) the same
cause of action (2) between the same parties (3) after a final judgment on the
merits in the first suit.” (Ibid.) In contrast,
“issue preclusion applies: (1) after final adjudication (2) of an
identical issue (3) actually litigated and necessarily decided in the first
suit and (4) asserted against one who was a party in the first suit or one in
privity with that party.” (Id. at p. 825.)
This res judicata
rule is
properly raised as a defense on demurrer when all relevant facts “are within
the complaint or subject to judicial notice.” (Carroll
v. Puritan Leasing Co. (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 481,
485; see Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 226-227.) 
First, the
issues raised in the Complaint in this action are the same as those raised in
the Prior Action. 
In the
Prior Action, Plaintiff Davis disputed the December 1, 2021 foreclosure of the
Property, sought preliminary and permanent injunctions, as well as damages due
to the alleged illegal filing of the recorded Assignments of the Deed of Trust.
(Def.’s RJN, Ex. B-C.) On March 18, 2022, Plaintiff amended the Complaint in
the Prior Action, adding a cause of action for Declaratory Relief to Quiet
Title Against all Defendants, including Defendant Prestige. (Def.’s RJN, Ex.
D.) On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint in the Prior
Action, alleging fraud and deceit by intentional misrepresentation, negligent
misrepresentation, suppression of facts, conspiracy, as well as causes of
action for involuntary trust, unjust enrichment, money had and received,
conversion, and quiet title. (Def.’s RJN, Ex. E.)
Based on
the judicially noticeable documents, the first element of res judicata is
satisfied. In both actions, Plaintiff sought to set aside the foreclosure sale
and cancel the deed, and alleged that Defendant Prestige engaged in fraudulent
or unlawful acts in order to obtain title to the Property. Both actions
involved the same loan and deed of trust, the same 2022 foreclosure sale, and
the same real property. Moreover, the primary right at issue was the same: Plaintiff’s
right to reacquire title to the Property. (See Le Parc Community Assn. v.
Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1170 [“California
law defines a ‘cause of action’ for purposes of the res judicata doctrine by
analyzing the primary right at stake”].)
The
judicially noticeable documents also show that Defendant Prestige was a party –
a defendant – to both actions. (Def.’s RJN Exs. C-E.) 
Finally, there
was a final adjudication on the merits in the Prior Action. On February 12,
2023, the Superior Court sustained U.S. Bank’s Demurrer without leave to amend
to the Second Amended Complaint in the Prior Action – specifically noting that
Plaintiff’s fraud claims failed to allege facts with the requisite specificity.
The court dismissed the Prior Action on the additional ground that Plaintiff
had failed to join an indispensable party. (Def.’s RJN, Ex. F.) 
 
Plaintiff
appealed the dismissal of the Prior Action, but the appeal was dismissed on
April 18, 2023 for Plaintiff’s failure to prosecute. (Def’s RJN, Ex. G.) As a
result of this dismissal of the appeal, the ruling in the Prior Action became
final. (Code Civ. Proc., § 913; Harsh v. Broad (1961) 198 Cal.App.2d
128, 130 [“Upon appellant's voluntary abandonment of her appeal from [an
appealable] order, it became final” and binding on issues in appellant's
subsequent motions.].)
            Because
all three criteria for application of res judicata are satisfied, the Prior
Action operates as res judicata to bar the instant Complaint against Defendant Prestige.[2]
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer is sustained in its
entirety. The motion to strike is moot. Plaintiff shall not have leave to
amend. Plaintiff’s complaint is dismissed with prejudice.
