And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a future court hearing. The Judge strikes an unauthorized sur-reply and notes that Defendant Prestige argues that res judicata applies based on a small claims action filed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had filed a small claims action against Michelle Ghidotti, who is the principal of Defendant Prestige, on January 5, 2022. The small claims action resulted in a judgment in favor of Ghidotti, finding that the Plaintiff is not owed any money from Ghidotti. The Judge does not need to address this other action as they have already found that the Complaint is barred by a prior action.
