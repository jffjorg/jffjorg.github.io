And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Haidar Awad's motion to be relieved as counsel for Francine Pearce without prejudice. The reasons for denial include that the attorney declaration supporting the motion was not filed on the mandatory judicial council form, there was no proposed order filed, and proof of service was not filed on the moving papers or other parties. The judge orders counsel to give notice. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court, and if no one submits or appears remotely, the motion may be placed off calendar.
