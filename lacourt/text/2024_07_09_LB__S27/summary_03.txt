And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Brady Gamble, filed a complaint against Ford Motor Company and Villa Ford of Orange, alleging damages under the Song-Beverly Act and negligent repairs. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's claimed fees were unreasonable because he refused a reasonable repurchase offer and that the fees incurred were padded and redundant with other cases.

The Judge found that the rates claimed by the plaintiff's attorney were extremely high and reduced them to a blended rate of $400/hour. The Judge also agreed that the majority of the work done in the case was redundant and should not be billed anew in every case, and reduced the fees by 1/3.

The Judge awarded the plaintiff attorneys' fees in the amount of $22,244, which is 1/3 of the original amount claimed. The Judge also noted that the motion also sought recovery of costs, but any award of costs would be made in connection with the memorandum filed by the plaintiff.

The parties are ordered to give notice and to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email to the court. If the parties do not submit any objections, the motion may be placed off calendar.
