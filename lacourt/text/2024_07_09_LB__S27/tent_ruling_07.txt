 Case Number:  24LBCV00120    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff has discovery motions
scheduled for 7/09/24, 7/18/24, and 7/23/24. 
There is also a status conference re: appointment of a discovery referee
scheduled for 7/09/24.  
 
In the interest of efficiency, the
Court continues the 7/09/24 and 7/18/24 motions to 7/23/24, to be heard
concurrently with the currently scheduled motion to deem RFAs admitted.
 
The Court takes off calendar the
status conference re: appointment of discovery referee.  Upon further review, all pending motions are
related motions to compel responses to initial discovery (and deem RFAs
admitted), based on the contention that Defendant has not served any timely
responses to outstanding discovery.  The
Court finds this is not the type of discovery dispute that warrants appointment
of a referee.  
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
