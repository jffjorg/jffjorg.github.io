And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of process filed by Hess Corp., Sheridan Transportation, and Point Shipping Corp. The defendants argue that they lack minimum contacts with California and therefore should not be subject to jurisdiction in the state. The plaintiff, Kirk Cully, argues that Hess owned a ship that was in California in 2001, and that Hess is currently engaged in a $53 billion merger with Chevron, which is based in California. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing to establish general jurisdiction over Hess, and that the plaintiff's claims do not arise out of or are related to the defendants' forum activities. However, the judge grants permission for jurisdictional discovery to be conducted to determine whether the defendants have minimum contacts with California. The hearing on the motion to quash is continued for three months, and the parties are ordered to engage in good faith jurisdictional discovery.
