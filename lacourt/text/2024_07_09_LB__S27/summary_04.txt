And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a deposition subpoena propounded by the defendant for production of business records from the plaintiff's OBGYN. The plaintiff alleges that the accident caused her to suffer a miscarriage, and the defendant seeks to discover medical records related to the pregnancy. The judge finds that the subpoena is overbroad and grants the motion to quash, but only because it seeks records that pre-date the plaintiff's pregnancy. The judge orders the defendant to serve a new subpoena that is more limited in scope. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions and reminds the parties that there are other discovery motions pending in the case.
