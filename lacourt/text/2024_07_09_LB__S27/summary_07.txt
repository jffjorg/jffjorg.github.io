And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sets new dates for the plaintiff's discovery motions, which were previously scheduled for July 9, 2024 and July 18, 2024. The motions will now be heard on July 23, 2024, concurrently with the motion to deem RFAs admitted. The court has also taken off calendar the status conference regarding the appointment of a discovery referee, as it finds that the discovery disputes do not warrant the appointment of a referee. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the new dates. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court, and if they do not, they must arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
