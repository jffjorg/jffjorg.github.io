And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Allison L. Grandy, Esq. and her firm Cullins & Grandy LLP to be relieved as counsel for defendant Tung Ming. Grandy had previously filed a motion to be relieved as counsel due to a conflict between Tung Ming and Grandy's office, making it impractical for Grandy to continue representing Tung Ming. The judge found that Grandy had complied with all procedural requirements and that the withdrawal would not cause an injustice or undue delay in the case.
