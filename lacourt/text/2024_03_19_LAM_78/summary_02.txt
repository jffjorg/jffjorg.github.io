And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff's use of an easement. The plaintiff, 1525 Colorado, LLC, seeks to use the easement for construction and access purposes to complete its development project at the 1525 parcel. The defendants, Maniben Courp and others, have blocked the easement and refused to allow the plaintiff to use it.

The court found that the plaintiff is likely to prevail on its quiet title cause of action and that it will suffer irreparable harm if the motion is not granted. The plaintiff's project is delayed and operating at a loss, and if the project is not completed, the plaintiff will likely lose the property through foreclosure or bankruptcy.

The court rejected the defendants' arguments that the easement was terminated via adverse possession, nonuse, or abandonment. The court also found that the plaintiff's proposed use of the easement is reasonable and does not place an unreasonable burden on the servient tenements.

The court will require a lesser amount than the defendants' requests for the undertaking. The court will discuss the issue of the undertaking at the hearing.
