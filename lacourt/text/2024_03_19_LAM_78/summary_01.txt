And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories filed by the defendants. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses without objections within 15 days after the date of this order. The defendants are also required to provide notice and file proof of service of such notice within two court days after the date of this order. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' discovery requests, despite being granted extensions, and therefore grants the motion.
