And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant's employee, Mollie O'Rourke, believed that the defendant had 30 days to respond to the complaint, but the deadline was actually 5 days. As a result, the defendant's failure to respond to the complaint was due to O'Rourke's mistake, and the motion is granted. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for a bond in the amount of the default judgment amount requested, as the plaintiff failed to provide evidence that it was prejudiced by the defendant's default or that it incurred damages sufficient to justify the bond. The judge notes that the circumstances do not justify a bond, as the defendant's default was caused by its mistake and not a deliberate attempt to avoid litigation.
