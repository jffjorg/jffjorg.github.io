And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel and a motion to continue trial in a case brought by Janelle Howard against the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and California Department of Transportation. The plaintiff's counsel, Steven Ross, has moved to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, requiring counsel to provide notice and to serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court and any parties who have appeared in the case.

The plaintiff has also moved to continue the trial date, which is currently set for February 16, 2024. The judge has denied this motion without prejudice, concluding that the request for a continuance is not supported by good cause. The judge has noted that the defendant County of Los Angeles has appeared in the case and has been served with the moving papers, contrary to the plaintiff's counsel's assertion that there are no defendants who have appeared in the case.
