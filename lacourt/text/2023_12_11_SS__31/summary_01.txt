And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor. The petition concerns two minors, Josephine Gilbert and Eloise True Gilbert. Josephine is now 18 years old and the guardianship has automatically terminated, making the petition moot. The court will only address the petition concerning Eloise True Gilbert.

The petition seeks to approve a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant, which involves a payment of $47,500, with $3,500 allocated to Eloise True Gilbert. The court finds the settlement agreement fair and reasonable, but denies the petition due to the petitioner's failure to sign the petition and declaration. The court orders the petitioner to file a new petition curing the defects and provides a new hearing date.
