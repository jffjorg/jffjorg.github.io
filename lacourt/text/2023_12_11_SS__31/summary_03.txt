Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Rafael Mendez's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication between Mendez and his attorney, Bart A. Seemen. However, the judge finds that the motion is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Specifically, the motion lacks a proposed order on form MC-053 and the proof of service only indicates that the notice of motion and motion were served, but not the declaration and proposed order. The judge orders Counsel to give notice and provides guidance on how parties can submit their objections to the tentative ruling.
