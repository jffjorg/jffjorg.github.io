The defendant did not personally serve Komiyama with the motion, as required by California Rules of Court 3.1346, and there is no proof of service indicating that Komiyama was served with the instant motion. The judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling and has encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If the parties do not agree, they should submit to the court by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
