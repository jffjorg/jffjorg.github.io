And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on Heights Surgical Institute (Heights Surgical). The defendants are seeking to depose the billing person most knowledgeable (PMK) at Heights Surgical to gather information about the medical treatment received by the plaintiff, Martha Maldonado Luna, following an automobile accident. The judge finds that the defendants have shown that the PMK's testimony is directly relevant to the case and that Heights Surgical's counsel had agreed to the deposition, but failed to produce the PMK. The motion is unopposed, and the judge orders the PMK to appear for deposition at a date and time to be noticed by the defendants. The judge also awards the defendants attorney's fees and costs, as well as sanctions against Heights Surgical in the amount of $600. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, the parties should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
