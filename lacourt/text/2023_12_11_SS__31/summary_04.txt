And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling that the demurrer filed by Bristol Farms (the defendant) is moot and will be taken off-calendar. The demurrer was filed against the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) filed by Danielle Hemple (the plaintiff), but the plaintiff's motion for leave to file the TAC was previously denied. A clerical error in the Court's minute order mistakenly stated that the motion was granted, but a Nunc Pro Tunc Order was issued to correct the error. Since no TAC was actually filed, the demurrer is deemed moot. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and may submit to the tentative ruling via email. If no agreement is reached, the parties should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
