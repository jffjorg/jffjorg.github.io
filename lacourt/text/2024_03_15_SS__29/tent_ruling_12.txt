USA, Inc.
 
Tentative
 
The Court will

BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiff Laurie Scott (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that she was injured on March 23, 2022, when she slipped and/or fell on
a substance on a floor and/or walkway negligently owned, controlled, operated,
and maintained by Defendant Yard House USA, Inc. (sued as The Yard House, L.P.)
(“Defendant”) on Shoreline Village Drive in Long Beach, California. On August
16, 2022, Plaintiff filed her complaint against Defendant and Does 1 through
100. On September 27, 2022, Defendant filed its answer.
 
Trial is currently scheduled for May 14,
2024.
 
On January 25, 2024, Defendant filed a
motion for summary judgment.  Defendant
reserved the earliest available hearing date, which was April 3, 2025.  
 
On February 7,
2024, Defendant filed this motion to continue trial. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on March 1, 2024. Defendant filed a reply on March 7, 2024.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
 
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

 
“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)  
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
contends that good cause for continuance exists as it has timely filed a motion
for summary judgment and reserved the earliest available hearing date, which
was April 3, 2025.  (Epley Decl., ¶ 3.)  That is almost eleven months after the
current trial date.
 
A party has a right to have its timely filed motion for
summary judgment heard before trial.  (Cole
v. Super. Ct. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Super.
Ct. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)
Defendant has established good cause for a continuance of the trial
date.
The Court will hear from counsel to discuss scheduling. 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court will hear from
counsel.
