The court has granted Lyft's motion to continue the trial date due to Plaintiff's illness and the delayed physical examination.

However, the court has not granted Lyft's request for a continuance of more than four months, and instead has continued the trial date for approximately 45 days. The new trial date is set for June 21, 2024.
