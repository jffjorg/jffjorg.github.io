  - "The court may grant a motion for a mental examination of a plaintiff 'only for good cause shown.'"
  - "A showing of good cause generally requires 'that the party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'"
  - "A mental examination is appropriate only if the plaintiff alleges continuing emotional distress."
  - "An order granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination."
  - "The court shall not (except under 'exceptional circumstances') order a mental examination if the plaintiff stipulates (1) 'that no claim is being made for mental and emotional distress over and above that usually associated with the physical injuries claimed' and (2) 'that no expert testimony regarding this usual mental and emotional distress will be presented at trial in support of the claim for damages.'"
  - "Uber has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its motion for an order authorizing a mental examination of Plaintiff. The motion is denied."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Uber's motion to compel a neuropsychological examination of plaintiff Dominique Johnston. The motion was filed in response to plaintiff's claims of emotional distress and alleged difficulties with memory, multitasking, changes of personality, impairment of ability to work, vision issues, and insomnia. However, the judge found that Uber failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its motion, including a lack of specificity regarding the scope and nature of the examination, the diagnostic tests and procedures to be used, and the identity of the examiner. The judge also noted that Uber did not submit a supporting declaration from the proposed examiner, Dr. Dylan G. Harwood, and that the proposed order and supporting declaration from Dr. Ari Kalechstein did not provide adequate detail regarding the examination. As a result, the motion was denied.
