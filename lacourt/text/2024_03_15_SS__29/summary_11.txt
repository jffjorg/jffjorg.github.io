And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The County of Los Angeles's Sheriff's Department (County) filed a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on El Monte Injury Clinic (Clinic) on or about May 24, 2023. The subpoena required Clinic to produce business records by June 19, 2023. Despite Clinic's failure to produce the records and its subsequent refusal to comply with the subpoena, County did not file the motion until February 20, 2024, which is more than seven months after the deadline. The Court finds that County's motion is untimely and denies the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena.
