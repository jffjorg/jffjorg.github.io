And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel deposition and the request for sanctions. The motion to compel deposition is denied as untimely, as it was filed more than three years after the deposition was taken. The request for leave to take a second deposition is granted in part, subject to certain limitations. The second deposition will be limited to one hour and will only cover the plaintiff's treatment, health condition, and injuries for the period between February 15, 2022, and the present. The request for sanctions is denied, as the defendant did not act with substantial justification in bringing the motion. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is granted in part, as the defendant's counsel failed to act with substantial justification in bringing the motion to compel deposition. The judge orders the defendant's counsel to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $900.
