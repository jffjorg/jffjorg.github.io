Counsel Timothy R. Vrastil, Bish & Cutting, APC, The Law Offices of Larry
H. Parker Inc, Bish Law.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On September 24, 2019, Plaintiff Shawn Blaine
Thomas (“Plaintiff”) filed his complaint against George Zacarias, Ramona
Sembrando, Kamo Tsaturyan, and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action
for strict liability, negligence, and premises liability arising out of an
alleged dog bite on February 24, 2019.
On November 12, 2019, Defendant Kamo
Tsaturyan filed an answer to the complaint.
On December 5, 2019, the Court entered the
default of Defendants George Zacarias and Ramona Sembrando.
On October 7, 2021, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name The Kamo Tzaturyan Revocable Living Trust as Doe 1.
On March 3, 2022, the Court granted the
motion for summary judgment of Defendant Kamo Tsaturyan.  Judgment in favor of Kamo
Tsaturyan was entered on March 21, 2022.
On March 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed the First
Amended Complaint against George Zacarias, Ramona Sembrando, Kamo Tsaturyan,
and Does 1 through 100.
There has been little activity
since.
 
On March 22, 2022, the Court
continued the trial date to September 18, 2023. 
On August 28, 2023, the Court vacated the trial date and set an OSC re
failure to obtain entry of default for December 28, 2023.  On December 28, Plaintiff’s counsel appeared
and stated that they had lost contact with Plaintiff and needed additional
time.  The OSC was continued to March 8,
and then to May 9, 2024.  
 
On February 23, 2024, Timothy R. Vrastil of Bish & Cutting, APC, The Law
Offices of Larry H. Parker Inc, Bish Law (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be
relieved as counsel. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel states
there has been a deterioration of the attorney-client relationship. (Decl., No.
2.) All parties have been served with notice of this hearing by mail.
Counsel has confirmed
Plaintiff’s address by phone within the past thirty days. Counsel lists OSC re Dismissal
for Failure to Enter Default scheduled for March 8, 2024; that was accurate as
of the date of filing, but the OSC has since been continued to May 9, 2024.
The Court finds
that Counsel has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for the requested
relief.  The motion is granted, subject to
the submission to the Court of an amended order that identifies the next
hearing date as May 9, 2024.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
The order is NOT
EFFECTIVE UNTIL: (1) Counsel submits to the Court of a revised proposed order
that identifies the next hearing date as May 9, 2024; AND (2) Counsel files a
proof of service with the Court showing service of the signed order that
identifies the next hearing date as May 9, 2024, on the client.  Until these conditions are met, counsel
continues to represent Plaintiff.
