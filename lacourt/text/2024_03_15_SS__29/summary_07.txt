And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the answer/appearance of Damco Distribution and Maersk, Inc. The plaintiff had argued that these companies, which are foreign corporations that have surrendered their right to do business in California, lack the capacity to defend themselves in this action. However, the judge has ruled that surrendered corporations have done nothing wrong and have followed all requirements of the law, and therefore there is no reason to attach negative consequences to them. The judge has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
