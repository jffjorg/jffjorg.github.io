And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to continue the trial date is granted. The defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment and reserved the earliest available hearing date, which was April 3, 2025, almost eleven months after the current trial date. The judge finds that the defendant has established good cause for a continuance of the trial date, as the defendant has a right to have its timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial. The judge will hear from counsel to discuss scheduling.
