 Case Number:  22STCV29833    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Elina Shakhbazyan
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On September 13, 2022, Sheridan Sheree Bood
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Nina Brown, and Does 1 through 50 asserting
causes of action for general negligence and premises liability arising from an
alleged dog bite on September 24, 2020.
There has been no appearance by any defendant,
and no proof of service has been filed.
On February 22, 2024, Elina Shakhbazyan (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be
relieved as counsel.  There is no
opposition in the file.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel states
there has been a breakdown in communication between counsel and the client. (Decl.,
No. 2.) 
Counsel has
provided proof of service for the motion. 
Counsel has not, however, filed a proof of service for the declaration or
the order.
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
