And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment without prejudice due to the failure to serve the motion in a timely manner. The 75-day notice period for a motion for summary judgment must be strictly followed, and the court has no power to shorten this period or cure the defect by continuing the hearing. The motion was not served until December 29, 2023, which is after the deadline of December 28, 2023. The court notes that even if the deadline is considered to be December 31, 2023, the motion was still not served timely. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving party must give notice.
