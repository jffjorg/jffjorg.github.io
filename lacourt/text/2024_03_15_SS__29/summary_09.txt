Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is related to a hearing scheduled for March 15, 2024, regarding six motions to compel and two motions for deemed-admitted orders filed by Defendant Williams. The motions are directed to Plaintiff Henry, who died on March 18, 2022, and her estate. The Court is considering imposing monetary sanctions on Plaintiff's counsel for failing to respond to discovery requests and on the estate for failing to respond to requests for admission. The Court is also considering whether to substitute a new party in place of deceased Plaintiff Brenda Henry and whether to impose monetary sanctions on Plaintiff's counsel for delay in prosecution. The Court will hear from counsel to discuss these matters and determine the next steps in the litigation.
