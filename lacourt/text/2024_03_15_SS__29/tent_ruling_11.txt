 Case Number:  22STCV18914    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel the Compliance with Defendant’s
Subpoena for Production of Business Records 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On June
9 and September 27, 2022, Plaintiffs Rosa Nava and Fabian Tejada Nava (a minor,
by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa Nava) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed
the Complaint and First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in this action against County
of Los Angeles’s Sheriff’s Department (“County”), Anthony Ledesma (“Ledesma”),
and Does 1 through 20.  Plaintiffs assert
causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out
of an automobile accident that occurred on December 3, 2021 at or near the
intersection of Muscatel Avenue and Garvey Avenue in Rosemead.  Plaintiffs allege that Ledesma, during the course
and scope of his employment with County, operated his vehicle in a negligent
manner and collided with a vehicle driven by Rosa Nava and carrying Fabian
Tejada Nava, 
 
On
October 27, 2022, County and Ledesma filed their Answer to the FAC.
 
On or
about May 24, 2023, County issued a Deposition Subpoena for Production of
Business Records to El Monte Injury Clinic (“Clinic”). (Kadomatsu Decl., ¶ 3
& Exh. A.) Counsel states that the subpoena was served on Clinic on June 1,
but no proof of service is attached to the moving papers.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  The Deposition Subpoena set the date of
production as June 19, 2023.  (Id.,
¶ 4 & Exh. A.)
 
Clinic
did not produce documents or otherwise comply with the Deposition Subpoena on
June 19, 2023.  (Id., ¶ 4.)  On July 10, 2023, County “was advised that [Clinic]
refused to comply with the Deposition Subpoena.”  (Id., ¶ 5.)  A further meet and confer letter sent to
Clinic on August 31 did not resolve the dispute.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)
 
On February
20, 2024, County filed this motion to compel compliance with Defendant’s
deposition subpoena for production of business records. County also seeks sanctions.  County personally served Clinic with the
motion.
No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
A party seeking
discovery from a person who is not a party to the action may obtain discovery
by oral deposition, written deposition, or deposition subpoena for production
of business records.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.010.)¿ A deposition subpoena may
command either: (1) only the attendance and testimony of the deponent, (2) only
the production of business records for copying, or (3) the attendance and
testimony of the deponent, as well as the production of business records, other
documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2020.020.)¿¿¿
¿
The deposition
subpoena must be served a sufficient time in advance of the deposition to
provide the deponent a reasonable opportunity to locate and produce any
designated documents and, where personal attendance is commanded, a reasonable
time to travel to the place of deposition.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd.
(a).)¿ Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require a
deponent who is a resident of California to: personally appear and testify, if
the subpoena so specifies; to produce any specified documents; and to appear at
a court session if the subpoena so specifies.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220,
subd. (c).)¿ A deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena may be punished for
contempt without the necessity of a prior order of the court directing
compliance by the witness.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.)¿ 
 
If a deponent “fails
to answer any question or to produce any document … under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer
or production.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (a).)  “This motion shall
be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition
….”  (Id., subd. (b).)
¿
California Code of
Civil Procedure section 1987.1, subdivision (a) states, “[i]f a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, or
other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the
taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person
described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion after giving
counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the
subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those
terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In
addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect
the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy of the person.”¿
¿¿
“[I]n making an order
pursuant to motion made ... under Section 1987.1, the court may in its
discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or
opposing the motion, including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds
the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial
justification.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2,
subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
County
asserts that it served nonparty Clinic with a Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Records, with the date of production set for June 19, 2023.  (Kadomatsu Decl., ¶¶ 3-4 &
Exh. A.)  Clinic did not comply and advised
County by no later than July 10, 2023, that it would not comply.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.)
 
A motion to compel
compliance with a deposition subpoena must be made within 60 days after
completion of the deposition record.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd., (b).)  In
the context of a deposition subpoena for the production of business records
only, the 60-day period runs from the date objections are served or the date
specified for production.  (Board of
Registered Nursing v. Super. Ct. (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1032-1033
(Guerrero, J.); Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th
1164, 1192; Unzipped Apparel v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 132-136.)¿
 
Here, County’s motion
is untimely.  Clinic failed to produce
the documents on June 19, 2023, and advised County that it would not comply on
July 10, 2023.  (Kadomatsu Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
 County did not file this motion until February
20, 2024, more than seven months later.
 
Accordingly,
County’s motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES County’s motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
