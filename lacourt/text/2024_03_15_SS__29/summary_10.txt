And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a mental examination of the plaintiff. The defendants had sought to conduct the examination to assess the plaintiff's mental health injuries arising from the incident, including depression, anxiety, and emotional instability. However, the defendants failed to provide sufficient information about the proposed examination, including the identity of the examiner, the place of the examination, and the tests that would be administered. The plaintiff had cooperated fully with the initial examination, which was noticed by the defendants, but was terminated by the examiner due to a dispute over the terms of the stipulation. The Judge found that the defendants did not demonstrate good cause for the examination and that their motion was deficient in several respects. The Judge also denied the parties' requests for sanctions, finding that there was no misuse of the discovery process or other misconduct by the parties or their counsel.
