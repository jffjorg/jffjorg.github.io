 Case Number:  21STCV22513    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
TENTATIVE
 
The motion
is denied without prejudice for failure to serve timely.
 
Background
 
On June 16, 2021,
Mher Mirzakhanyan (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Rotisserie
Restaurants, Inc dba Tarme Mediterranean Grill and Pat Sungkamee (collectively
“Defendants”) and Does 1 to 25 for motor vehicle negligence stemming from an
automobile accident that occurred on December 23, 2019. ON July 15, 2021,
Defendants filed their answer.
 
On December 29,
2023, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the motion. On March 8, 2024, Defendants filed their reply brief.
 
Discussion
 
As a threshold matter, Plaintiff contends that
the motion for summary judgment was not served in a timely manner.
 
A motion for summary judgment must be served at
least 75 days before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).) When
the motion is served by electronic means, two additional court days must be
added. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
 
Here, the hearing on the motion is on March 15,
2024. The date that was 75 days before the hearing was Sunday, December 31,
2023. Two court days before December 31, 2023, was on Thursday, December 28. The
motion was not served until the following day, December 29, 2023. 
 
Accordingly, service was not timely, and the
motion is denied without prejudice. The Court has no power to shorten time on
the 75-day notice period for a motion for summary judgment, and the Court may
not cure the defect by continuing the hearing to provide the missing days. (Robinson
v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4tha 1258, 1268; McMahon v. Super. Ct. (2003)
106 Cal.App.4tha 112, 116; see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 10:80.5-80.6.)
 
(The Court notes that under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 10, 12, 12a, 12b, and 12c, there is a good argument that the
deadline for 75-day personal service was actually on Friday, December 29, in
which case the electronic service deadline would have been two days earlier, on
December 27. The Court need not reach that argument, however, because even
giving moving party the benefit of the doubt, and treating the 75-day deadline
as falling on Sunday, December 31, the motion was not timely served.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motion for summary
judgment, without prejudice, for failure to serve timely.
 
Moving party to give notice.
