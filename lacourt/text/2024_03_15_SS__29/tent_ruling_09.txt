Background
On September 30,
2021, Plaintiffs the Estate of Bertram Parie (by and through its Personal
Representative, Brenda Henry) and Brenda Henry, individually, filed the
complaint in this action against Defendants City of Lancaster (“City”), County
of Los Angeles (“County”), Demetrius Lamar Williams (“Williams”), Clinae Nicole
Trainor (“Trainor”), and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for (1) Dangerous
Condition of Public Property, and (2) Motor Vehicle Negligence, arising out of
a fatal collision on September 25, 2020, near the intersection of Avenue J and
17th Street East in Lancaster.
 
On June 27,
2022, Williams and Trainor filed their answer to the complaint.
 
On December 15,
2022, City filed its answer and a cross-complaint for indemnity against
Williams, Trainor, and Does 1 through 25.
 
On January 27,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal, without prejudice, of County.
 
On February 8,
2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a Notice of the Death of Plaintiff Brenda Henry.  (The Court has since received information
that Ms. Henry died approximately eleven months earlier, on March 18, 2022.)  Counsel stated that they were “inquiring as
to who the heirs are and whether the heirs want to proceed with this lawsuit.”
 
On September
26, 2022, Defendant Williams (“Defendant”) propounded Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for
Production of Documents, and Request for Admissions on Plaintiff Henry,
in her individual capacity, and the same or similar four sets of discovery requests
on Plaintiff Henry as representative of the Estate of Bertram Parie. (Miskell
Decls., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff Henry, having
died, did not respond.  (The discovery
was propounded after her death but before the Notice of Death was filed with
the Court.)
 
On January
12, 2024, Defendant filed the six motions to compel and the two motions for deemed-admitted
orders that are currently pending.  For
rather obvious reasons, no response was filed.
 
The
motions were set for hearing on February 13 and 15, 2024.  The four motions directed to Plaintiff Henry
as personal representative were continued to March 15, 2024.  The four motions directed to Plaintiff Henry
in her individual capacity were continued to March 19, 2024.
 
At the
hearing on February 13, the Court, on its own motion, also set for hearing on March
15, 2024, two additional matters: (1) an OSC re Substitution of a Party in
Place of Deceased Plaintiff; and (2) an OSC re Why Monetary Sanctions Should
Not Be Imposed On Plaintiff’s Counsel for Delay in Prosecution.  The Court ordered Plaintiff’s counsel to
appear (either in person or by remote means) at the hearing.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and
no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the matters contained in
the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
Discussion
“The general rule is that, after death of a party, it is improper
to render judgment for or against [the party] without first substituting [her]
executor or administrator.  Many
decisions hold than an order entered after the death of a party to an action is
void in the absence of the substitution of the personal representative of such
decedent.”  (Kern v. Kern (1968) 261
Cal.App.2d 325, 328.)
As a result of
Plaintiff’s death, there is no party presently before the Court to oppose the
pending motions or continue this litigation. 
The Court cannot compel a deceased person to respond to discovery.  And the authority of retained counsel
generally does not survive the death of the client.  (Pham v. Wagner Litho Machinery Co.
(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 966, 972-973.)
The Court will
hear from counsel, including whether any person has been identified who is able
to make the decision whether to continue (or dismiss) this litigation, both on behalf
of the Estate of Bertram Parie and now on behalf of the Estate of Brenda Henry.
Conclusion
The Court will hear from counsel.
