And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Kimberly Brooks, has filed a motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, Rogelio Magana Castillo. The motion is based on the plaintiff's repeated failures to comply with discovery orders, including failing to produce ordered documents and failing to pay sanctions. Despite the plaintiff's violations, the court finds that terminating sanctions are not warranted at this time. The court notes that the plaintiff's conduct shows a pattern of misuse of the discovery process, but there is no evidence of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser sanctions. The court also notes that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendant. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, but leaves the door open for the defendant to seek other nonmonetary sanctions or a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings if the plaintiff continues to misbehave.
