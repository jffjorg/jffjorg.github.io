 Case Number:  21STCV20011    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Order Deeming Admitted Matters
Specified in Requests for Admission
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On May 27, 2021, Kyung Sil Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Hyo Rang Lee, M.D. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100 for
Medical Malpractice/Professional Negligence arising from a medical procedure on
February 25, 2020.  On October 3, 2023,
Defendant filed an answer.
 
On October 27, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One). (Rubaum Decl., ¶ 3
& Exh. A.)  No responses were
provided.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-5.) 
 
On January 31, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for an
order deeming admitted the matters specified in the requests for
admission.  No opposition has been filed.

 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission
(Set One) on October 27, 2023. (Rubaum Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.) Plaintiff has
not provided responses.  (Id., ¶¶
3-5.)
 
Defendant need show nothing more.  The motion is GRANTED.
The Court also GRANTS in part Defendant’s request
for sanctions.  The Court sets sanctions
in the amount of $450, calculated based on two hours of attorney time,
multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $195 per hour, plus the
filing fee of $60.  (Id., ¶ 6.) 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for deemed-admitted order.
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff is deemed to
have admitted as true the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for
Admission (Set One).  
The Court GRANTS in part Defendant’s request
for sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary
sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $450 to Defendant
within 30 days of notice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
