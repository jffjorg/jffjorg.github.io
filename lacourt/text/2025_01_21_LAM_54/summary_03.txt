And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Clare Weber, et al. v. Board of Trustees of the California State University, et al. The defendants, Board of Trustees of the California State University, Jake Zhu, and Tomás Morales, have moved for a protective order to prevent the plaintiffs, Clare Weber and Anissa Rogers, from deposing President Morales on certain questions. The defendants argue that President Morales' knowledge is not unique or superior and that the plaintiffs can obtain the same information through other means. The court has denied the motion, finding that President Morales is alleged to have had personal involvement in the matters underlying the plaintiffs' claims and that the defendants have not shown that he lacks personal knowledge. The court also notes that depositions of other, lower-ranking employees have been taken. As a result, the plaintiffs may continue to question President Morales concerning institutional policies and procedures, training, funding, staffing, and other department-level issues.
