And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in two separate motions. The first motion is by David A. Cordier, counsel for Defendant Glendale Centre Theatre, seeking to be relieved as counsel. The Court grants this motion, allowing Cordier to withdraw as counsel upon filing proof of service of order on the defendant. The second motion is by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brenda Dietlein, seeking to amend her cross-complaint and reopen discovery. The Court continues the motion for leave to amend to February 21, 2025, and orders Dietlein to file a declaration meeting certain requirements by January 27, 2025. The motion to reopen discovery is denied, as it is unclear why discovery was not completed earlier and what Dietlein is seeking from the Plaintiffs.
