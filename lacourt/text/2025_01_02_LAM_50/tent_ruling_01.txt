ORDER RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Planet Home Lending, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Rudy Ramiro De Leon Jr. 
 On September 23, 2024, the Court issued an
Order on Plaintiff’s request for default judgment. The Court’s September 23,
2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “the legal description of ‘Parcel
2’ in paragraph 2 of the newly proposed judgment still references a ‘so
foot wide road’ while the legal descriptions contained in the subject Grant
Deed and Deed of Trust reference a ‘60 FOOT WIDE ROAD.’ (O’Connell Decl., ¶¶
5-6, Exs. 1-2.).” (September 23, 2024 Order at p. 2:1-4.) 
The
Court’s September 23, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia, that “[a]t
the hearing, Plaintiff explained that the ‘so foot’ reference appears in the
litigation guaranty. He needs to address this with the title company…Plaintiff
is to file a new proposed judgment on or before December 2, 2024 with a
courtesy copy delivered to Department 50.” 
On
December 6, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a new “Proposed Judgment for Reformation
of Instrument.” The December 6, 2024 Proposed Judgment addresses the discrepancy
identified in the Court’s September 23, 2024 Order. Specifically, the December
6, 2024 Proposed Judgment now references a “60 foot wide road.”
(Proposed Judgment at p. 2:11.) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has
sufficiently supported its request with the submitted declarations and
evidence. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request is granted, and the Court will sign
the December
6, 2024 Proposed Judgment. No
appearance at the hearing is necessary.¿
