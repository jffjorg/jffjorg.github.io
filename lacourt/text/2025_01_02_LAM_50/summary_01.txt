And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Teresa A. Beaudet issued a tentative ruling granting PLANET HOME LENDING, LLC's request for default judgment against RUDY RAMIRO DE LEON JR, et al. The request was made due to a discrepancy in the legal description of a property in the proposed judgment, which referenced a "so foot wide road" instead of the correct "60 foot wide road". The Court had previously identified this issue and ordered the Plaintiff to submit a new proposed judgment addressing the discrepancy. The Plaintiff subsequently submitted a new proposed judgment which corrected the error. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request and will sign the new proposed judgment.
