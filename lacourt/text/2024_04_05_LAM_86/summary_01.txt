And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission's demurrer to John Lee's petition for writ of mandate. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 21 days leave to amend, meaning John Lee has the opportunity to re-file his petition with additional information. The Judge has also ruled that John Lee must plead exhaustion of administrative remedies, or that exhaustion is excused, before seeking judicial review. Additionally, the Judge has noted that John Lee's claims of a pattern and practice of the City Ethics Commission bringing enforcement proceedings when the statute of limitations has expired may be grounds for a separate claim, and has granted leave to amend to allow John Lee to plead these claims. Finally, the Judge has ruled that the City Ethics Commission's demurrer to John Lee's remedy is overruled.
