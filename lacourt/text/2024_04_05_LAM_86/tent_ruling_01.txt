[Tentative]       ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
Respondent, Los
Angeles City Ethics Commission, demurs to the Verified Petition for Writ of
Mandate filed by Petitioner, John Lee. Petitioner opposes the demurrer.
 
Respondent’s request
for judicial notice is granted.
 
The demurrer is
sustained with 21 days leave to amend.
 
APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
“We assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the
truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.” (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The
allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of Petitioner
on demurrer. (See Mobil Oil Corp. v Exxon Corp. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d
942, 947.) “A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
ALLEGATIONS IN THE PETITION
 
The petition alleges
Petitioner “is the City Councilor for CD 12.” (Pet. ¶ 1.)
 
On June 6, 2023, Respondent’s
Director of Enforcement submitted a probable cause report “from alleged incidents
that took place in 2016 and 2017 which they alleged to have found from
unsealing of the indictment against Mitch Englander on March 9, 2020.” (Pet. ¶
6.)
 
A probable cause
report may not used to commence administrative enforcement proceedings more
than four years after the date of the alleged violation. (Pet. ¶ 17 [quoting
Los Angeles Administrative Code (LACC) section 24.26, subd. (a)(2).)
 
The probable cause report
did not establish facts to support a tolling of the statute of limitations on enforcement
proceedings. (Pet. ¶¶ 23-25.)
A probable cause conference
was conducted on August 31, 2023. (Pet. ¶ 28.) On September 22, 2023, the
hearing officer made a probable cause determination. (Pet. ¶ 29.) The hearing
officer found probable cause and that the Director of Enforcement “sufficiently
alleged concealment such that it tolled the Statute of Limitations until March
9, 2020, . . . .” (Pet. ¶ 31.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Respondent asserts
Petitioner’s first cause of action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085
is “improper.” (Memo 2:17.) Respondent also contends Petitioner has failed to
adequately plead exhaustion of administrative remedies. (Memo 2:19-20.)
Finally, Respondent argues injunctive relief is improper. (Memo 2:21.)
 
              Exhaustion of Administrative
Remedies
 
The court agrees
Petitioner has failed to adequately allege he has exhausted his administrative
remedies. 
 
Exhaustion of administrative
remedies is “a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.” (California Water Impact Network v. Newhall County
Water Dist. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1464, 1489.)
“The exhaustion requirement applies whether relief is sought by
traditional (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1085) or administrative (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1094.5) mandamus.” (Eight Unnamed Physicians v. Medical
Executive Com. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 503, 511.) “Before seeking judicial
review a party must show that he has made a full presentation to the
administrative agency upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.”  (Edgren
v. Regents of University of California (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515, 520.)
There are exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, including “when the subject
of the controversy lies outside the administrative agency’s jurisdiction, when
pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm, when the
administrative agency cannot grant an adequate remedy, and when the aggrieved
party can positively state what the administrative agency's decision in his particular case
would be.” (Ibid.)
 
As noted by
Respondent, LACC section 24.27, subdivision (e)(1)(E) appears to provide
Petitioner with a remedy to address his view the hearing officer’s probable
cause determination was incorrect. Pursuant to the provision, Petitioner make
request a hearing on the statute of limitations matter because such a matter is
“not related to the truth or falsity of the factual allegations.” (LACC, §
24.27, subd. (e)(1)(E).)
 
Because Petitioner
does not plead exhaustion or some exception to it,[1] Respondent’s position is
well taken. That is, Petitioner may pursue his statute of limitations defense during
the administrative hearing on the probable cause report.
 
              Traditional vs. Administrative
Mandate
 
While Respondent
asserts Petitioner may not proceed by traditional mandate here (Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085), the court disagrees. As noted by Petitioner, traditional
mandate may be appropriate here. For a traditional writ to issue, the agency
must have a ministerial duty. Here, as argued by Petitioner, the LACC provides
the ministerial duty. A failure to comply with the LACC’s statute of
limitations provisions is a failure to comply with a duty. 
 
That said, it appears
Petitioner’s traditional mandate claim is duplicative of his traditional
mandate claim.
 
In his opposition, however,
it appears Petitioner contends Respondent has a pattern and practice of bringing
enforcement proceedings when the statute of limitations has expired. (Opposition
6:1-3.) To the extent Petitioner intends to allege a pattern and practice, he
has not done so in the petition.
 
If Petitioner wishes
to proceed with a pattern and practice claim, the court will grant leave to amend.
 
              Injunctive Relief
 
An injunction is a remedy;
it is not a cause of action. Petitioner has not labeled the paragraphs in his
petition seeking injunctive relief as a cause of action. It appears Petitioner
seeks an injunction as well as a writ of mandate (traditional or
administrative) as a remedy for the wrong he has allegedly suffered.
 
Respondent’s demurrer
to the remedy is not well taken. Any challenge to the remedy should be by way
of a motion to strike.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing,
the demurrer is sustained with 21 days leave to amend. Petitioner must plead
exhaustion of administrative remedies (or that exhaustion is excused). To the extent
Petitioner is alleging a pattern and practice, he must allege facts to support his
claim for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, otherwise his
challenge appears to be ground in administrative mandate. Finally, Respondent’s
demurrer to Petitioner’s remedy is overruled.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
