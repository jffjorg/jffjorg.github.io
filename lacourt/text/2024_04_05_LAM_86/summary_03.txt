And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment against the defendants, LJT Holdings, LLC and John Anthony Thompson, without prejudice. The plaintiff, Westlake Flooring Company, LLC, sought to attach assets to secure payment of a debt allegedly owed by the defendants. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's moving papers were inadequate to establish the defendants' obligation under the financing agreement and personal guaranty. The plaintiff's claimed deficiency balance was unsupported, and the credits made were unclear and not properly applied. The judge also found that the plaintiff's reply papers further complicated the issues and heightened confusion. As a result, the court cannot determine the appropriate amount of the attachment and cannot issue a writ of attachment.
