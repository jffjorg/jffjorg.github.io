[Tentative]                     ORDER
DENYING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF ATTACHMENT
 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
Plaintiff, Westlake
Flooring Company, LLC, dba Westlake Floor dba Westlake Flooring Services,
applies for a writ of possession against Defendants, LJT Holdings, LLC dba Infiniti
of Mission Viejo (LJT) and John Anthony Thompson, in the amount of $2,683,264.
Defendants oppose the application.
 
This is Plaintiff’s
second attempt at securing an order authorizing an attachment.
 
The application is
denied.
 
RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants for breach of contract and related claims. On
September 6, 2023, Defendants answered the complaint.  The answer states multiple affirmative
defenses, including unclean hands.
 
SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW 
 
“Upon the filing of
the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to
this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an
application for the order and writ with the court in which the action is
brought.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.010.)
 
The court
shall issue a right to attach order if the court finds all
of
the following: 
 
(1)   The claim
upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be
issued. 
(2)   The
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the
attachment is based. 
(3)   The
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based. 
(4)   The amount
to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. (Id.
at
§
484.090.) 
 
“A claim has ‘probable
validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a
judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (§ 481.190.)   

 
“The Attachment Law
statutes are subject to strict construction.” (Epstein v. Abrams (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
There is no dispute Plaintiff
and Defendant LJT entered into a financing agreement to facilitate LJT’s sale
of automobiles. There is also no disagreement Defendant Thompson personally
guaranteed the obligations of LJT under the financing agreement. The parties
also do not dispute the financing agreement was secured by the vehicles offered
for sale to consumers by LJT.
 
Further, Defendants
do not dispute LJT owes money to Plaintiff. (Opposition 3:13-14.) Defendants
believe “ballpark” “around $1.5 million” is due. (Opposition 5:27.) Defendants nonetheless
challenge the amount owed to Plaintiff under the financing agreement.
 
Plaintiff’s moving
papers are inadequate to establish Defendants’ obligation under the financing
agreement and personal guaranty. Plaintiff asserts, through its Senior Vice
President, as of December 1, 2023, LJT owed it “a deficiency balance of not
less than $2,638,689.39.” (Zhan Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff’s moving papers provide
no explanation (foundation) for the deficiency balance claimed. That is, they provide
no accounting and merely assert a $2,638,689.39 obligation—a conclusion—based upon
a letter sent to Defendants that includes no accounting. (Zhan Decl., Exh. 4.) 
 
Plaintiff’s moving
papers thereafter claim $2,628,264 is due from LJT. (Zhan Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff
purports to explain the $10,425.39 difference through the sale of $151,648 of
collateral. (Zhan Decl., ¶ 9.) If, however, LJT’s obligation is credited with
$151,648, the balance due would be $2,487,041.39, not $2,628,264.
 
Moreover, it appears
the value of collateral Plaintiff obtained after LJT defaulted on its
obligations is $1,583,968.70. (See Zhan Decl., Exh. 6.) Plaintiff does not
explain why it has not credited the value of the collateral against LJT’s obligation.
It appears LJT may owe only $888,272.69 to Plaintiff, but the number is unclear
because of Plaintiff’s conflicting information about the extent of the default
and the credits made—$2,638,689.39 vs. $2,628,264 and credits of $151,648 and
$1,583,968.70.
 
Plaintiff’s moving
papers do not provide sufficient information or explanation of the obligation
owed to it by LJT. While there is an admitted obligation, the amount of that
obligation is in dispute, and Plaintiff’s moving papers with their internal
contradictions preclude the court from issuing an attachment. Without regard to
Defendants’ opposition, the court simply cannot determine on the evidence
provided the appropriate amount of the attachment. The claimed beginning
balance number is unsupported and credits have apparently not been properly
applied.
 
Plaintiff’s reply
papers further complicate the issues and heighten confusion. First, Zhan’s
declaration at paragraph 10 attests Plaintiff has recovered 26 vehicles as
collateral. Zhan attaches Exhibit 6 as a list of automobiles “Plaintiff has
recovered.” (Zhan Decl., ¶ 10.)[1] In his supplemental
declaration Zhan indicates 28 automobiles have been repossessed and attaches
Exhibit 8 as those cars that have been repossessed. Exhibit 8, however, lists only
27 automobiles, not 28. Exhibit 8, according to Zhan, provides a listing of
those automobiles repossessed and those not repossessed. (Supp. Zhan Decl., ¶
2, Exh. 8.) Exhibit 8 makes no such notation.
 
Exhibit 6 and Exhibit
8 also provide different MMR valuations. If the repossessed automobiles were “liquidated
in a commercially reasonable manner and the balances applied to Defendants’
balance with Plaintiff” (Supp. Zhan Decl., ¶ 2), it is unclear why Plaintiff is
relying on MMR valuations instead of actual dollars obtained when the automobiles
were liquidated.
 
Zhan’s statement LJT currently
owes it $1,810,706.32 is insufficiently explained. Exhibit 9 is incomprehensible.
Is Plaintiff suggesting the last column in the dealer balance summary should be
totaled, and if totaled would reflect a balance of $1,810,706.32? If so, where
are the credits for those automobiles “liquidated in a commercially reasonable
manner”? (Supp. Zhan Decl., ¶ 2.) Further, it is unclear where, if at all, the
credit of $274,803.75 is accounted for by Plaintiff. The “accounting” leaves blank
any offsets to the obligation.
 
Plaintiff’s evidence
simply does not establish the amount due to it by Defendants pursuant to the
financing agreement and guaranty.
 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s application for a writ of attachment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
