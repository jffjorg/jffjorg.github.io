And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is granted without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Shirley Alvarado-Del Aguila, was terminated from her job at Peace Over Violence and alleges that the termination was due to her cancer diagnosis. The defendant, Peace Over Violence, claims that the termination was for other reasons. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of malice, oppression, or fraud are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court cites several California court cases, including Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. and Cloud v. Casey, to support its ruling. The court also notes that the plaintiff has had three opportunities to plead a viable cause of action and has failed to do so. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive and exemplary damages from her complaint.
