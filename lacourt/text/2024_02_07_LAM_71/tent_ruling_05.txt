 Case
  No.:  22STCV24086
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 7, 2024



 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz
Pourat’s, in pro per,
motion to set aside and vacate the
entry of default is denied without prejudice.
 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat (“Hormoz”) (“Cross-Defendant”),
in pro per, brings a motion to set aside and/or vacate the entry of default in this case.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 3.)
 
Background
Cross-Complainant’s
Cross-Complaint alleges three causes of action against Cross-Defendants Pourandokht, Hormoz, and Non-moving
Cross-Defendant Soleila Pourat (“Soleila”): (1)
negligence; (2) conversion; and (3) breach of contract, related to real
property located at 11815 Dorothy Street #5, Los Angeles, CA 90049.  (See Cross-Complaint.)
Cross-Complainant
filed the operative Cross-Complaint on January 3, 2023.  The Court entered default in this case as to Hormoz and Soleila on March 28, 2023.  The Court entered default in this case as to Pourat Pourandokht, on April 12, 2023.
Hormoz filed the instant motion on October 26,
2023. Cross-Complainant filed his opposition on December 26, 2023.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Motion to Vacate or Set Aside Default
The trial
court has broad discretion to vacate the judgment and/or the clerk’s entry of
default that preceded it.  However, that
discretion can be exercised only if the moving party establishes a proper
ground for relief, by the proper procedure, and within the time limits below.  (See Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)
A Cross-Defendant
may seek discretionary relief from default under C.C.P. §473(b) on grounds of
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (See Lorenz v.
Commercial Acceptance Insurance Co. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 981, 989.)  The motion for discretionary relief must
be filed within 6 months after the clerk’s entry of default.  The motion is ineffective if filed
thereafter, even if it is within 6 months after entry of the default judgment (these are separate procedures).
Another
precondition for obtaining relief is that the application “shall be accompanied
by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein,
otherwise the application shall not be granted.”  (See C.C.P. §473(b).)
The party
moving for relief on the basis of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect” must show specific facts demonstrating that one of these
conditions was met.  (Hopkins &
Carley v. Gens (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1410 [stating defendant’s
burden to demonstrate “that due to some mistake, either of fact or of
law, of himself or of his counsel, or through some inadvertence,
surprise or neglect which may properly be considered excusable, the judgment or
order from which he seeks relief should be reversed”].)
Evidence
that the defendant was seriously ill, or feeble, or unable to
understand that he was being served with process, is sufficient to justify
discretionary relief under §473(b).  Such
evidence shows “excusable neglect” in allowing default to occur.  (See Kesselman v. Kesselman (1963) 212
Cal.App.2d 196, 207-208.).  Similarly,
evidence that the defendant mislaid or misfiled the papers, and
as a result failed to contact a lawyer in time, may show “excusable” neglect.  (Bernards v. Grey (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d
679, 683-686.)  But it is not
enough simply to show that the client was “busy” and “forgot” about the
lawsuit; i.e., such neglect is inexcusable.  (Andrews v. Jacoby (1919) 39 Cal.App.
382, 383-384.)  Likewise, it is not
ground for relief that defendant failed to answer the complaint because he was
indigent and couldn’t afford a lawyer.  Such a defendant could have obtained help from
legal aid offices or appeared in forma pauperis.  (Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d
892, 905-910 [denying relief on basis that evidence was insufficient as a
matter of law where an elderly defendant, who was ill and preoccupied with
caring for her dying husband, turned the complaint over to her son who promised
to “take care of the problem” but never did].) 
A defendant’s mistake in judgment in electing to proceed in propria
persona does not constitute excusable neglect.  (Burnete v. La Casa Dana Apartments
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1262, 1264.)
The court
is empowered to relieve a party “upon any terms as may be just . . . from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)
The law
favors judgments on the merits. Thus, on a motion for relief from default,
“doubts must be resolved in favor of relief, with an order denying
relief scrutinized [on appeal] more carefully than an order granting it.”  (Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th
127, 134.)
Here, Hormoz declares he
appears without an attorney and requests this Court set aside default because he
and his mother, Pourandokht Pourat, “did not receive a copy of the complaint of
the motion to set aside from defendant.” 
(Motion, pg. 2 at ¶2.)  The motion states at ¶4 that Cross-Defendant
“request[s] that this court . . . set aside this motion because I will bring
the court evidence to proof that the purchase of the condominium by . . .
Shahram Moussazadeh, from my father, Mansour Pouray, was fraudulent.”  (Motion, pg. 2 at ¶4.)
The Court denies Hormoz’s motion because he does not provide
supporting, competent evidence of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect” in failing to answer the Cross-Complaint, which led to the
entry of default against him.  (See
Lorenz v. Commercial Acceptance Insurance Co. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 981,
989.)  Further, Hormoz’s motion fails to attach a copy of the proposed pleading as required by C.C.P.
§473(b).  For this reason, the Court
denies Hormoz’s motion to set
aside entry of default.
Accordingly, Hormoz’s motion to set aside entry of default
is denied without prejudice.
Moving Party to give notice.
