SHIRLEY ALVARADO-DEL AGUILA,
  
         vs.
 
PEACE OVER
  VIOLENCE.


 Case No.:  22STCV22675
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  February 7, 2024



 
Defendant
Peace Over Violence’s motion to strike Plaintiff Shirley Alvarado-Del Aguila’s
claims for punitive damages in her second amended complaint is granted without
leave to amend. 
 
Defendant Peace Over Violence (“POV”) (“Defendant”) moves to
strike portions of Plaintiff Shirley Alvarado-Del Aguila’s (“Alvarado
Del-Aguila”) (“Plaintiff”) second amended complaint (“SAC”), specifically the
claims for punitive and exemplary damages pursuant to C.C.P. §435(b)(1).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-7; C.C.P.
§§431.10(b), 436.)  Defendant’s motion is
made on the grounds that the requests for punitive damages are improper because
they constitute demands for relief not supported by the SAC’s allegations.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 5.)
Defendant filed the instant motion on September 27, 2023.  Plaintiff filed her opposition on January 25,
2024.  Defendant filed its reply on
January 31, 2024.
 
Evidentiary Objections
Defendant’s 1/31/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of
Ken Boyd (“Boyd”) are sustained as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
 
Motion to Strike
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court
may, upon a motion made pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” 
(C.C.P. §436(a).)
 
Summary of Motion
Defendant moves to strike the following
sections and prayer for relief from the SAC: (1) ¶62 (“In committing the
foregoing acts, Defendants POV and/or Does 1-25, acted in a despicable,
oppressive, and malicious manner with the express intent of injuring or
damaging Plaintiff or with conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and with the
intent to vex, injure, and annoy Plaintiff, such as to constitute oppression,
fraud, or malice under California Civil Code section 3294, thereby entitling
Plaintiff to punitive and exemplary damages against Defendants in a sum
appropriate to punish and make an example out of Defendants.”); (2) ¶63 (“The
acts of oppression, fraud, or malice against Plaintiff were engaged in by

Punitive
Damages
Punitive
damages may be recovered upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression.
 (Civ. Code §3294(a).)  “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to
cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.  (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California,
Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)  “Oppression” means despicable conduct
subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the
person’s rights.  (Id.)  “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known by defendant, with intent to
deprive a person of property, rights or otherwise cause injury.  (Id.)  Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual
assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)
“Conduct which warrants punitive
damages must be of ‘such severity or shocking character [as] warrants the same
treatment as accorded to willful misconduct – conduct in which defendant
intends to cause harm.’”  (Woolstrum
v. Mailloux (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 10, quoting Nolin v. National
Convenience Stores, Inc. (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 279, 286.)  “[C]onclusory characterization of defendant’s
conduct as intentional, willful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient
statement of ‘oppression, fraud, or malice, express or
implied,’ within the meaning of section
3294.”  (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977)
73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)
          Plaintiff’s
SAC fails to allege specific statements or acts demonstrating the alleged
termination was done out of spite or malice because of Plaintiff’s cancer
diagnosis.  (See SAC ¶¶21, 25; Scott
v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 717 [“[W]rongful
termination, without more, will not sustain a finding of malice or oppression.”];
Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890,
894-895 [“Something more than the mere commission of a tort is always required
for punitive damages. There must be circumstances of aggravation or outrage,
such as spite or ‘malice,’ or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part of the
defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of
others that his conduct may be called willful or wanton.”].)  Further, Plaintiff’s allegation of intentional
misrepresentation merely concludes that Defendant’s Executive Director/CEO
Patti Giggans (“Giggans”) “later and intentionally lied about this April 14,
2022[,] telephone call with Plaintiff. Specifically, Giggans lied that during
this call Plaintiff said that Plaintiff had already moved to North Carolina and
did not have any plans to return when in fact Plaintiff has said no such thing.
Giggans (and POV) used this lie as pretext to justify the termination of
Plaintiff and thereby protect POV against liability and deny Plaintiff her
right to not be discriminated against based on her disability and medical
condition.”  (SAC ¶21.)
          Plaintiff’s
argument analogizing the facts in the instant case to the facts in Cloud v.
Casey (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 895, is unavailing.  In Cloud, executives made specific statements
indicating they did not promote the employee because of her gender. The court
considered “direct statements by Mr. Casey and other executives that the
company had never had a woman in that position, that it was not comfortable to
have a woman in that position, that men do not like smart competent women
working for them, and that perhaps gender was a factor in the decision.”  (Cloud, 76 Cal.App.4th at pg. 911.)  The Cloud Court found sufficient
evidence to support the jury’s punitive damages verdict based on direct evidence
of the executives’ gender discrimination.
          Here,
unlike in Cloud, Plaintiff does not allege any direct, specific
statement or act from Giggans or POV to support the allegation that Plaintiff
was terminated because of her cancer diagnosis and relies merely on pretext and
allegations of discrimination.  (Turman,
191 Cal.App.4th at pg. 65 [“Appellant persists that the
punitive damages allegations are
adequately pled, relying primarily on the underlying facts associated with the
cause of action for gender discrimination. . . . [S]uch facts do not rise to
the level of malice, oppression or fraud necessary under Civil Code section 3294
to state a claim for punitive damages.”].)
          Further,
Plaintiff’s allegation of “intentional lies” based on information and belief
that Giggans approved POV’s Human Resources Manager, Sonia Taizan’s (“Taizan”) “May
20, 2022 email prior to it being sent despite knowing that it contained the
foregoing false statements” does not support an allegation of punitive damages
because the email correspondence between Taizan and Plaintiff that is attached
to the SAC lacks evidence of malice, oppression, or fraud.  Taizan’s email merely states, “Upon
communicating that Peace Over Violence would not be able to approve the reque[s]t
[to work remotely from North Carolina], it wa[s] agreed upon with you to
officially send [sic] your termination after May 5th. You requested this be
done to coordinate with the ending of your [s]tate di[s]ability benefit[s.]
Peace Over Violence agreed to your reque[s]t t[o] wait until May 5th.”  (SAC ¶¶36-37, Exh. E at pg. 47.)  Taizan’s email alleges POV’s reasonable
belief and reliance on Plaintiff’s representations that she already lived in
North Carolina.  A misunderstanding
between an employer and an employee does not support a claim for punitive
damages, nor does a failure to investigate the misunderstanding.
Plaintiff has had three opportunities to
allege a claim for punitive damages and has failed to make a viable allegation.  (Graham v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 618-619 [properly denying leave to amend after
plaintiff given three opportunities to plead a viable cause of action]; Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 994-995
[properly sustaining third demurrer to complaint without leave to amend, having
provided plaintiff “ample opportunity” to cure defect in complaint].)
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to
strike Plaintiff’s request for punitive and exemplary damages from her FAC is
granted without leave to amend.  
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to strike is granted
without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
