```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat's motion to set aside and vacate the entry of default is denied without prejudice. Hormoz claims that he did not receive a copy of the complaint and motion to set aside, and therefore did not answer the Cross-Complaint. However, the judge has determined that Hormoz has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claim of "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect" and has failed to attach a copy of the proposed pleading as required by C.C.P. §473(b). The judge has therefore denied Hormoz's motion.
