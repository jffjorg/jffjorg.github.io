KADEN SANCHEZ,  
 
  
         vs.
 
TURNER’S OPERATIONS INC., et al.
  


 Case No.: 
  21STCV38742
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 7, 2024



 
Plaintiff Kaden Sanchez’s motion for an
order awarding monetary sanctions against Defendant Turner’s Operations, Inc. is granted in the reduced amount of
$8,202.20. 
Sanctions are payable within 10 days.
Plaintiff’s request for non-monetary
sanctions is denied.
 
Plaintiff Kaden Sanchez (“Sanchez”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves for an order for monetary sanctions in the
amount of $8,202.20 plus additional daily sanctions in the amount of $500
accruing from the date of this Court’s anticipated order on this motion until
compliance is achieved, as well as the imposition of terminating sanctions,
evidentiary sanctions, and issue sanctions. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §2023.030.)   Plaintiff brings this motion on the grounds
that Defendants Turner’s
Operations, Inc. and Turner’s Outdoors, Inc. (collectively, “Turners”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) have failed to
comply with the Court’s February 6, 2023, Order to produce documents responsive
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents Nos. 1 and 2 by February
26, 2023.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 1.)  Plaintiff also
moves on the grounds that over a year ago Defendants agreed to mediate this
case, and yet have refused to engage in the process of selecting a mediator or
reserving a mediation date.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Background
On October 20, 2021,
Plaintiff filed its operative complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendants
for civil penalties under PAGA, alleging that Defendants: (1) failed
to provide meal periods; (2) failed to provide rest periods; (3) failed to pay
premium wages for missed meal and or rest periods; (4) failed to pay premium
wages for missed meal and/or rest periods at the regular rate of pay; (5)
failed to pay at least minimum wage for all hours worked; (6) failed to pay overtime
at the correct rate; (7) failed to pay double time at the correct rate; (8)
failed to reimburse for all necessary business expenses; (10) failed to provide
accurate written wage statements; and (11) failed to pay all final wages
following separation of employment.  On
December 21, 2021, Defendants filed their answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
          Plaintiff filed the instant motion on January 9, 2024.  Defendants filed their opposition on January 25,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on
January 31, 2024.
 
Motion for Sanctions
C.C.P.
§2031.320 provides, in part:
(a)   If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.
 
(b)   Except
as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance
with a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
 
(c)   Except
as provided in subdivision (d), if a party then fails to obey an order
compelling inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
(d)   (1)
Notwithstanding subdivisions (b) and (c), absent exceptional circumstances, the
court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for
failure to provide electronically stored information that has been lost,
damaged, altered, or overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith
operation of an electronic information system.
 
(C.C.P. §§2031.320(a)-(d)(1).)
On
February 6, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance,
ordering Defendant to produce the unredacted contact information, timekeeping,
and payroll data for all aggrieved employees during the applicable limitations
period.  Despite this Court’s order being
in effect for nearly a year (and the Court’s compliance date for this order
being February 27, 2023), Defendant has still not produced the payroll data for
all aggrieved employees.
Defendant
has only produced anonymous timekeeping records for aggrieved employees but has
continued to refuse to provide payroll records for aggrieved employees.  (Decl. of Pao ¶¶18, 36, 43, Exhs. C, J, L.)  Plaintiff argues he is unable to prepare his
case for trial without the required payroll data for aggrieved employees.  (Motion, pg. 14.)  Defendants’ opposition concedes that it has
not produced any payroll records to Plaintiff. 
(See Decl. of DeBus ¶5.) 
Defendants have not complied with this Court’s order to produce
timekeeping and payroll records and have failed to demonstrate in their
opposition that the parties entered into an agreement to modify this Court’s
order.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions is appropriate.
 
Monetary
Sanctions
This
Court has power under C.C.P. §§2030.300(d)-(e), 2031.310(h)-(i), 2023.030(a), and
2023.010(d)-(h) to award monetary sanctions on the basis that Defendant and
defense counsel fail to provide any Court ordered supplemental responses.
The
Court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount initially
requested in Plaintiff’s motion, $8,202.20, and declines to award the daily
sanction request, as the amount requested is sufficient to deter future
noncompliance with this Court’s order.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion for sanctions against Plaintiff is granted in the reduced
amount of $8,202.20.

 
Non-Monetary
Sanctions
The
Court declines to award non-monetary sanctions on the basis that there is no
reason to believe monetary sanctions will not be an adequate means of deterring
further non-compliance with this Court’s orders.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against Defendants is granted in the reduced amount of $8,202.20.  Sanctions are payable within ten days.

Plaintiff’s request for
non-monetary sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
