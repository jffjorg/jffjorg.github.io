And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Velocity Commercial Capital LLC to the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff, Bay Area Development Co., alleges that Velocity wrongfully foreclosed on a commercial building and seeks compensation for unjust enrichment. Velocity argues that it did not hold a beneficial interest in the loan for the property and was merely a loan servicer at the time of the foreclosure sale. The Court has granted Velocity's request for judicial notice of an "Assignment of Deed of Trust" and has concluded that the Plaintiff cannot state claims against Velocity based on its purported position as the "holder of the deed of trust". The Court has sustained the demurrer and will decide at the hearing whether to sustain it with prejudice. The Plaintiff will be allowed to amend its complaint to allege claims against Velocity, but must articulate what claims it may still be able to assert against Velocity.
