And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The moving party, Novik Law Group, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs in this personal injury action. The plaintiffs, Edna Fuentes and her minor children, allege that the defendant, Susan Lopaty-Pechman, negligently crashed her vehicle into the rear of their vehicle. The plaintiffs' counsel has been unable to contact the client, Edna Fuentes, since October or November 2023, as she has been unavailable due to being out of the country. Despite efforts to contact her, counsel has not received a response. The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion, noting that counsel has complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362. The trial is not yet set, and the next hearing will concern the instant motion and a Trial Setting Conference on March 20, 204 (note: this date may be incorrect).
