TENTATIVE
RULING: GRANT
 
Counsel contends around October or November 2023, Client Edna Fuentes
indicated that she was going to be unavailable as she would be out of the
country. Since that time, Counsel’s office has tried to contact her several times
but hasn’t heard back. 
 
Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by
filing forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodging with the court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053. Counsel confirmed client’s last known mailing by
emailing and texting Plaintiff Fuentes to the last known e-mail address and
phone number.   
 
Trial is not yet set. The next hearing concerns the instant motion
and a Trial Setting Conference on March 20, 204.
