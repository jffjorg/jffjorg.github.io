  Case Number:  23STCV03882    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  61 Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. (“CCP”) section 284
states that “[t]he attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed
at any time before or after judgment or final determination” upon either
consent of both client and attorney, or upon the order of the court under
application of either the client of the attorney, after notice from one to the
other. Cal. Rule of Court 3.1362 states the requirements for a motion to be
relieved as counsel under CCP section 284. No memorandum is required, but the
motion must be accompanied by (1) a declaration stating why a motion has been
brought instead of filing a consent (without compromising attorney-client
confidentiality), (2) proof of service of the motion, and (3) all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if know.
Additionally, “[t]he proposed order relieving counsel must be prepared on the
Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-053)
and must be lodged with the court with the moving papers.”
 
The present motions pertain to attorney
Justin H. Sanders of the firm Sanders Roberts LLP, counsel for Defendants
Celestine Washington-Palmer and .Celestine Washington-Palmer, Trustee of the
Celestine Washington Palmer Living Trust dated April 19, 2000. The declaration
submitted by Sanders states that the motions are brought because there has been
a breakdown of the working relationship with the clients. The motions, however,
do not come with proposed order forms or proofs of service.
 
Justin H. Sanders’ Motions to be Relieved as
Counsel for Defendants Celestine Washington-Palmer and .Celestine
