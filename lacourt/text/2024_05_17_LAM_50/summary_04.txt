And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, alleging causes of action for negligence, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit. The defendant has also cited to two California Supreme Court cases, Tenzer v. Superscope and Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., but has not provided further analysis on how these cases apply to the case at hand. The defendant has also asserted that the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith attempts to add duties that either replicate the alleged contract or expand it to add new terms, but has not provided any further explanation on how this claim attempts to "add duties." The court has reviewed the defendant's demurrer and has determined that the defendant has not provided sufficient analysis to support its claims. The court will reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke its prior order under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a).
