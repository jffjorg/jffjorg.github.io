And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment in the amount of $104,146.95. The court has identified several defects in the plaintiff's default judgment package, including the lack of exhibits and unclear statements regarding attorney's fees. The court has also noted that the plaintiff's claim for damages is based on a February 2, 2018 agreement, but the court is unable to determine whether the agreement contains a statement that the prevailing party in any action between the parties is entitled to attorney's fees. As a result, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package with the plaintiff.
