[1]On February 6,
2024, Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff alleging causes of
action for (1) negligence, (2) unjust enrichment, and (3) quantum meruit. 


[2]Defendant also cites to Tenzer v. Superscope (1985) 39 Cal.3d 18,
30, but Defendant
does not discuss or apply this case here. The Court does not see how Tenzer
is applicable. In addition, Defendant cites to Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317,
349-350, where the
California Supreme Court noted that “[t]he covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in
every contract, exists merely to prevent one contracting party from unfairly
frustrating the other party’s right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made. The covenant thus cannot be
endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings. It cannot impose substantive duties or limits on the
contracting parties beyond those incorporated in
the specific terms of their agreement.” (Internal quotations, citations,
and emphasis omitted.) Defendant asserts that “[t]he
claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith attempts to add duties
that either replicate the alleged contract or to expand it to add new terms,
both of which are prohibited.” (Demurrer at p. 6:11-13.) However, Defendant
does not provide any further analysis in the demurrer as to how the fourth
cause of action purportedly attempts to “add duties.” 
 


[3]Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a)
provides in part that “[w]hen an application for
an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in
part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by
the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of
entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.”
