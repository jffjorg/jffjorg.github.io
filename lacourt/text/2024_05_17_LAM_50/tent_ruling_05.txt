[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Irth Communications, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Biotricity, Inc. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount
of $104,146.95, comprising $97,431.23 in damages, $4,030.72 in interest, $2,100.00
in attorney’s fees, and $585.00 in costs. 
The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
First, the Declaration of
Andrew William Haag in support of the request references Exhibits “A” through
“D”. (Haag Decl., ¶¶ 6-8, 12.) However, no exhibits are attached to the
declaration.  
Second,
Mr. Haag’s declaration states that “[t]he interest rate calculation is based on
the legal rate of 10%.” (Haag Decl., ¶ 34.) However, the Complaint in this
action alleges, inter alia, that “IRTH also requests from Biotricity
interest at the rate of 1.5% per month for all sums of money due from
Biotricity to IRTH from the date of the material breach as set forth in the
parties Agreement, according to proof at trial.” (Compl., ¶ 25, emphasis
added.)[1] The Court notes that “[a] complaint…shall contain…the
following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims
to be entitled.¿If the recovery of money or damages is demanded, the amount
demanded shall be stated.” ((Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10,
subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure section 580,
subdivision (a) “limits a trial court’s jurisdiction to grant relief on a
default judgment to the amount stated in the complaint.” ((Dhawan v. Biring (2015)
241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968.) “[I]n all default judgments the demand sets a
ceiling on recovery.” ((Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534.)¿ 
Third, the Complaint
names Biotricity, Inc. and Does 1 through 20 as Defendants. However, on April
22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal as to Does 1 through 10 only.
The Court notes that a party seeking a default judgment
must file “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment…”¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).)¿
Fourth, in his supporting
declaration, Mr. Haag asserts that “IRTH has incurred attorney’s fees in
connection with this matter, which fees IRTH is entitled to recover from
Biotricity pursuant to the Civil Code, Section 1717.5.”
(Haag Decl., ¶ 27.) Mr. Haag also states that “[t]he contract between IRTH and
Biotricity states that IRTH is entitled to attorney’s fees and collection costs
in regards to trying to collect payment under the Agreement.” (Haag Decl., ¶
35.) Thus, it is unclear if Plaintiff asserts that it is entitled to attorney’s
fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1717.5, or a
specific provision of the parties’ agreement. 
Moreover, the Court notes
that Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (a)
provides in part that “[i]f there is a written agreement between the parties
signed by the person to be charged, the fees provided by this section may not
be imposed unless that agreement contains a statement that the prevailing party
in any action between the parties is entitled to the fees provided by this
section.”¿In the Complaint in this action, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia,
that “IRTH has regularly invoiced Biotricity for the unpaid fixed
monthly fees of $7,500, which now equals $97,431.23, pursuant to IRTH and
Biotricity’s written agreement dated February 2, 2018, and all amendments
thereto.” (Compl., ¶ 13, emphasis added.) In addition, Mr. Haag’s declaration
references “IRTH and Biotricity’s written agreement dated February 2, 2018…”
(Haag Decl., ¶ 11.) Mr. Haag’s declaration states that “[a] true and correct
copy of the Agreement between IRTH and Biotricity is attached hereto as Exhibit
‘A.’” (Haag Decl., ¶ 6.) However, as set forth above, no exhibits are attached
to the declaration. Thus, the Court is unable to determine whether the subject written
agreement “contains a statement that the prevailing party in
any action between the parties is entitled to the fees provided by this
section.” (Civ. Code § 1717.5, subd. (a).)
Accordingly, it is unclear whether the requested attorney’s fees are warranted
here under Civil Code section 1717.5 (to the extent
Plaintiff seeks fees pursuant to this provision).  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
