And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Adam Isai Palma, has sued the defendant, Providence Health System – Southern California, and its affiliate, Providence Holy Cross Medical Center, for personal injury, property damage, and wrongful death, alleging that the defendant caused or proximately caused his assisted fall and injuries at the defendant's facility on July 11, 2023.

The judge found that the complaint is too vague, ambiguous, and uncertain and does not plead the required elements for each cause of action. The plaintiff has not included sufficient facts to put the defendant on notice of the nature of the alleged fall and injuries. The judge also found that the causes of action are duplicative, as they are based on the same set of facts.

The judge gave the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint and overruled the defendant's demurrer to the premises liability cause of action, but sustained it with leave to amend on the basis that it is vague, ambiguous, and uncertain.
