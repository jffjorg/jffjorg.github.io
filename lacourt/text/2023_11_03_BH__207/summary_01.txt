And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the defendants is overruled. The cross-complaint alleges that the plaintiff and cross-defendant fraudulently acquired an interest in the property and the defendants seek damages for the fraudulent acts. The judge found that the cross-complaint alleges the elements of a fraud cause of action with sufficient particularity and that the disputed deed does not demonstrate an unreasonable delay as a matter of law. The judge also found that the doctrine of laches is not applicable in this case. The plaintiff and cross-defendant are ordered to file and serve an answer to the cross-complaint on or before November 17, 2023.
