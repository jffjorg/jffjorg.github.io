MOTION
 
Defendant Shawn King (“Defendant”) moves to quash service of the
summons and complaint.  The motion is
unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)  
 
“A general appearance by a party is equivalent to personal service of
summons on such party.”  (Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks Construction, Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135,
1145.)  “A general appearance operates as
a consent to jurisdiction of the person, dispensing with the requirement of
service of process, and curing defects in service.”  (Ibid.)  “An appearance is general if the party
contests the merits of the case or raises other than jurisdictional
objections.”  (Ibid.)  In other words, “[i]f the defendant raises an
issue for resolution or seeks relief available only if the court has
jurisdiction over the defendant, then the appearance is a general one.”  (Factor Health Management v. Superior
Court (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 246, 250.) 

 
“In the absence of a voluntary
submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the statutes
governing service of process is essential to establish that court's personal
jurisdiction over a defendant. When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction by
bringing a motion to quash,  the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440; accord Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160 [“It was incumbent
upon plaintiff, after the filing of defendant's motion to quash, to present
evidence discharging her burden to establish the requisites of valid service on
defendant”]; Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413 [“when
a defendant challenges the court's personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service’ ”].)   A declaration
of service by a registered process server establishes a presumption that the
facts stated in the declaration are true. (Evid. Code, § 647; Rodriguez v.
Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.)
 
            “In
order to obtain in personam jurisdiction through any form of constructive
service there must be strict compliance with the requisite statutory
procedures.  (Zirbes v. Stratton
(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1417, quoting Stamps v. Superior Court (1971)
14 Cal.App.3d 108, 110.)  
 
For service on persons within California, generally, service of
summons and complaint must be done by personal service.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.)  However, “[i]f a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served,” a plaintiff may
serve an individual defendant “by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business,
or usual mailing address . . . , in the presence of a competent member of the
household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of
business, or usual mailing address . . . , at least 18 years of age, who shall
be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the
summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person
to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd.
(b).)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Here, Defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint on
the basis that the proof of service filed on August 30, 2023 indicates he was
personally served at an address he has never lived at and has no association
with.  (King Decl. ¶¶ 1-3.)
 
However, on September 21, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the
complaint.  The Court notes that Defendant’s
answer was filed before the motion to quash was filed on
September 28, 2023.  Thus, Defendant made
a general appearance in advance of challenging the service of the summons and
complaint, and in so doing, Defendant voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction
of this Court.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            The Court denies Defendant’s Motion
to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint. 

 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling.
