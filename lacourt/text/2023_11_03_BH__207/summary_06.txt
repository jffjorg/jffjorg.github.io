Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Shawn King, has moved to quash the service of the summons and complaint on the grounds that the proof of service filed on August 30, 2023 indicates he was personally served at an address he has never lived at and has no association with. However, the court notes that the defendant filed an answer to the complaint on September 21, 2023, which is before the motion to quash was filed on September 28, 2023. This means that the defendant made a general appearance in advance of challenging the service of the summons and complaint, and in so doing, he voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of this court. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.
