The judge has reviewed the case of Plaintiff Glenn Vallecillos M.D., Inc. against Defendants Pacific Source Insurance Agency, Inc. and Antoinette Turner. The case involves a dispute over the remodel of the surgical center. The judge has considered the motions filed by the parties, including a demurrer, motion to strike, and request for leave to amend.
