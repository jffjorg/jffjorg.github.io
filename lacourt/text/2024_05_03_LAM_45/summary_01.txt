The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant had requested that the plaintiff provide further responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and to produce responsive documents. The court found that the plaintiff's responses to the defendant's requests were incomplete and that the defendant had shown good cause for the discovery sought. The court also found that the plaintiff's objections to the defendant's requests were boilerplate and lacked specific details. As a result, the court ordered the plaintiff to provide further responses to the defendant's requests and to produce responsive documents within 30 days. The court also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,822.50.
