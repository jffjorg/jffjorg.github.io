Background 
            On September 12,
2019, Frank Bachinsky and Avalor Capital LLC filed their Complaint against
Forever Oceans Corporation, Forever Oceans Corporation, BV Advisory Partners,
LLC, V3M Ventures, LLC, Jason Heckathorn, David Voyticky, and Keith Barksdale,
asserting nine causes of action for (1) Failure to Pay Wages Owed; (2)
Violation of Labor Code section 226; (3) Breach of Employment Contract; (4)
Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (5) Breach of Fee Sharing
Contract; (6) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (7)
Intentional Interference with contractual Relations; (8) Waiting Time
Penalties; and (9) Accounting. 
            On December 27, 2023,
Defendant Forever Oceans Corporation (“Defendant”) filed this motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and to
produce responsive documents.  Plaintiff
Frank Bachinsky (“Plaintiff”) filed an opposition on April 22, 2024.  Defendant replied on April 26, 2024. 
Legal Standard 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents 
On receipt of a response to a Request
for Production of Documents, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that
(1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete, (2) a
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or
(3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(a).)    
Motions to compel further responses to
RPDs must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the request.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310(b).)  To establish good cause,
a discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in
the action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or
disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact.  (Digital Music
News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224, disapproved on
other grounds by Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531; see
also Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98
[characterizing good cause as “a fact-specific showing of relevance”].)  If good cause is shown by the moving party,
the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to
disclosure of the documents.  (Kirkland,
supra, 95 Cal.App.4th at 98.)   
Meet and Confer 
A motion to compel further responses
to requests for production of documents must be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)   
Here, on March 9, July 18, and October
2, 2023, Defendant’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s
counsel regarding Plaintiff’s deficient discovery responses.  (Menges Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8-9; Ex. “5,” “7,” and
“9.”)  The parties were not able to
resolve the discovery disputes informally. (Id. ¶ 11.)  Therefore, Defendant has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. 
Discussion 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents 
            Defendant requests that
the Court compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to Defendant’s Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 13, 15-18, and 21-22.  The requests at issue are as follows: 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 13: All DOCUMENTS RELATING TO all sources of income YOU received
from August 2015 to September 2017.
 
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION
NO. 15: All DOCUMENTS RELATING TO all W-2 forms issued for YOU from August 2015
to September 2017.
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 16: All DOCUMENTS RELATING TO all 1099 forms issued for YOU from
August 2015 to September 2017.
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 17: All DOCUMENTS RELATING TO YOUR tax returns from August 2015
to September 2017.
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 18: All DOCUMENTS showing money YOU received from August 2015 to
September 2017.
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 21: All YOUR bank statements from August 2015 to September 2017.
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 22: All Avalor Capital LLC’s bank statements from August 2015 to
September 2017.
 
In
response to these requests, Plaintiff made boilerplate objections, including on
the 
following
grounds: vague and ambiguous, overly broad and burdensome, the requests seeks
privileged information, the requests invades the right to financial privacy. 
            Here, the requested documents are
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims and alleged damages, as well as Defendant’s
defenses because Plaintiff claims that he was Defendant’s employee Defendant
from 2015 to 2017, but Defendant argues that Plaintiff was a consultant for
other entities during that time and was receiving commissions or other forms of
compensation from them. Thus, the Court finds good cause exists for the
discovery sought. 
            Further, the Court does not find the
need to otherwise discuss Plaintiff’s boilerplate objections in excessive
detail.  Regarding Plaintiff’s vague and
overbroad objections, Plaintiff fails to identify how the requests are such.  The requests are clear, concise, and limited
to the time period from August 2015 to September 2017.  Regarding Plaintiff’s privilege and privacy
objections, Plaintiff fails provide a privilege log to evaluate his claims, and
Plaintiff fails to show a protective order cannot protect against any privacy
concerns—a protective order is already in place.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd.
(c)(1).)  Also, Plaintiff failed to
timely respond to Defendant’s discovery requests thus waiving all objection,
including claims of privilege and work product protection.  (Menges Decl. ¶¶ 2-4;
Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
            Lastly, where Plaintiff responded to
the requests, the Court finds they are mostly nonresponsive or evasive.  For example, as to Requests Nos. 15 and 16,
Plaintiff stated that he did not have any documents “relating to” W-2
forms and 1099 forms issued for him from the time period requested.  It is unclear why Plaintiff emphasized “relating
to” in his responses.  Further, as to
Requests Nos. 18, 21, and 22, Plaintiff stated that he previously produced “all
relevant documents concerning all monies received from any defendant in this
action,” however, the requests are not limited to money received from
defendants. 
            Therefore, Defendant’s motion is
GRANTED. 
            Plaintiff is ordered to provide
further responses to Defendant’s First Set of Requests for Production of
Documents, Requests Nos. 13, 15-18, and 21-22, and to produce responsive
documents thereto within 30 days. 
            Sanctions
            Defendant requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,822.50 representing 3.5 hours preparing this
motion, 5 hours reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition, drafting a reply, and
appearing at the hearing of this matter, all at the hourly rate of $325.00,
plus $60.00 filing fee. (Menges Decl. ¶ 12.) 
            The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record in
the amount of $2,822.50. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(h).)
Plaintiff and his counsel of record are
ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,822.50 to Defendant’s
counsel within 30 days. 
It is so ordered.
