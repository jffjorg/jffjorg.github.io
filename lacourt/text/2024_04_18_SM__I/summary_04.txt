And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling suggests that the application will be granted, and the arbitration award will be confirmed. The defendant has filed a case-dispositive motion, and the plaintiff claims that due to counsel's schedule, additional time is needed to oppose the motion. The court is inclined to agree with the plaintiff, absent any showing of prejudice. The court will give the defendant additional time to file a reply if requested, which would push the hearing date further out. The court acknowledges that the details of the need for time are sketchy and recalls the opposition to continuing the trial. However, the court believes that it is better to get the decision right rather than to rush it.
