 Case Number:  SC129215    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the application.  Defendant has filed a case-dispositive motion
(if granted) to confirm the arbitration award. 
Plaintiff claims that due to counsel’s schedule, more time is needed to
oppose the motion and therefore counsel seeks a 30 day continuance.  The court is inclined to agree absent some
showing of prejudice.  That said, the
court will give defendant additional time to file a reply if defendant so
requests, although that would push the hearing date further out.  The court is aware that the details of the
need for time are sketchy and the court recalls the opposition to continuing
the trial.  But the trial and a hearing
are different.  The court’s trial
calendar is much harder to move and openings are far fewer.  The hearing calendar is more flexible.  The court sees no prejudice here, and better
to get it right than do it fast.
