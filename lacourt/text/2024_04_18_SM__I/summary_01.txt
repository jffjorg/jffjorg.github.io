English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to withdraw from arbitration in a wage and hour/PAGA case. The Defendant successfully compelled arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claim, and the arbitration was to be held before JAMS. However, the Defendant failed to make timely payment of a $29,832 invoice, leading to the plaintiff's withdrawal from the arbitration. The Judge holds that the FAA does not preempt the statute, and the court must decide whether the failure to make timely payment constitutes a material breach. The Judge agrees with the plaintiff that the failure to make timely payment is a material breach, and the statute requires the non-drafting party to withdraw from the arbitration. The Judge grants the motion to withdraw from the arbitration and sets a case management conference.

Note: The Judge's ruling is tentative, meaning it is subject to change before the final ruling is issued.
