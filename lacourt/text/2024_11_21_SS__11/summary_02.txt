```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike punitive damages filed by the defendants. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to allege malice, oppression, or fraud with particularity, but the judge disagrees. The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint state a sufficient factual basis for punitive damages, particularly with regard to the defendants' interference with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's (LADWP) response to an emergency.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to specifically allege malice, oppression, or fraud is not fatal to the claim, as the Rowland factors can be considered at the discovery stage. The judge also disagrees with the defendants' waiver argument, finding that the plaintiff's new complaint (the second amended complaint) is a new pleading and does not preclude the defendants from challenging punitive damages.

The judge ultimately denies the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the allegations in the complaint state a sufficient factual basis for punitive damages and that the efficient approach is to move to the discovery stage to flesh out the facts.
