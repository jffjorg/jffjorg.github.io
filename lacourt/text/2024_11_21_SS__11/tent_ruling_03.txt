TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff and Defendants’ joint motion to seal is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class action
regarding collision insurance.
 
Recently, the parties reached a
settlement.  In part, the settlement
requires Plaintiff’s individual claims to be dismissed with prejudice and the
class claims to be dismissed without prejudice.
 
At issue is Plaintiff and
Defendants’ joint motion to seal. 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration and the settlement agreement disclose
the settlement amount.  Plaintiff and
Defendants move to seal the settlement amount.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records,
protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group
June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made.  Such an arrangement ‘is entirely inconsistent
with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551 and the constitutional
values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
Case
law recognizes that confidential settlement agreements “may include information
that may warrant sealing[.]”  (Id. at ¶¶
9:418.5, 9:418.8; see also, e.g., Universal City Studio, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273.)  
 
But
“[a] settlement agreement . . . does not qualify for sealing after all
references to financial and other confidential data have been redacted.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 9:418.20.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
In light of these rules, the
Court finds that the joint motion to seal should be granted because:
 
* the
motion is unopposed;
 
* an
overriding interest exists in keeping the settlement amount confidential;
 
* the
overriding interest supports the sealing request;
 
*
there is a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the motion is denied;
 
* the
sealing request is narrowly tailored given that Plaintiff and Defendants only
seek to redact the references to the settlement amount; and
 
*
sealing is the least restrictive means to protect the overriding interest.
