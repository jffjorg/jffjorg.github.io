And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the joint motion to seal the settlement amount filed by the plaintiff and defendants in a putative class action case regarding collision insurance. The settlement agreement requires the dismissal of individual claims with prejudice and class claims without prejudice. The parties seek to seal the settlement amount, which is disclosed in the plaintiff's counsel's declaration and the settlement agreement. The judge finds that an overriding interest exists in keeping the settlement amount confidential, and that sealing the record is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to protect this interest. The motion is unopposed, and the judge believes that there is a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the motion is denied.
