TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ motion to strike is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class action. 
The second amended complaint (“SAC”) alleges:
 
1. Plaintiff brings
this action as a class action, on behalf of herself and all other California
residents residing on Arch Drive, in Studio City, California, similarly
situated, relating to Defendants’ public and private nuisances, and negligence,
and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
Defendants and each of them, are alleged herein, to have installed but
failed to adequately maintain or secure at least one overly-mature Pine tree on
the SUBJECT PROPERTY on and before February 24, 2023, causing said tree to
collapse and remain on Arch Drive on and after February 24, 2023 and creating
and thereafter maintaining a dangerous condition that Defendants, and each of
them, refused to remedy timely at any time. 
This constituted a danger to the public due to the risk of immediate
physical harm from the collapsed tree and its branches that blocked the public
road and alley way, the lack of access due to the road blockage caused by the
fallen tree, and the unsafe conditions and resulting damage to utility services
that hindered, prevented and interfered with repair crews and repair equipment
from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“LADWP”) or any other
government agencies, from making repairs needed to restore services to
Plaintiff and those similarly situated, within a reasonable time.  [Citations.] Defendants also refused
reasonable requests to access or to allow access onto their property so that
emergency repairs needed to restore power could be made in a reasonable and
safe manner  Such access was needed for
reasons including to initiate repairs to power lines and power poles on and
near the TREE FALL area including portions of the tree that fell into and out
of the SUBJECT PROPERTY.  Also, access to
the SUBJECT PROPERTY was needed for anyone to remove the Defendants’ fallen
tree or any parts thereof which extended from the SUBJECT PROPERTY to and
through Arch Drive and the abutting public alley which was left inaccessible
and a continuing dangerous condition as alleged herein. Simply removing the
portions of the tree not on the SBJECT PROPERTY would not allow the harm
addressed herein to be remedied.  As
These acts left an estimated number of over 500, individuals, denizens,
residents, tenants or occupants living in or on Arch Drive, to suffer the
special and unique personal harm, 
emotional distress, inconvenience, and/or deprivation of use of their
residences/ouster, actually or constructively, without light, power, heat
and/or hot water of any kind, as well as lack of security and dark and unsafe
conditions, for an unreasonable amount of time (more than 3 nights and four
days as more detailed below in ¶¶ 8-17) (“BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS”).  The BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS also resulted in
Plaintiff and those similarly situated incurring general and special damages
and entitling them to a permanent injunction against Defendants and each of
them, restraining or prohibiting Defendants from installing and failing to
adequately maintain, or otherwise refusing to timely remove fallen trees or any
portion thereof, they own or manage, or which obstruct or prevent ordinary use
of public streets or sidewalks or threatening to or actually downing powerlines
in and around Arch Drive.
 
* * *
 
8. At all times
relevant Plaintiff and those similarly situated were residents (including as
tenants and owners and with property rights) of Arch Drive, in Studio City,
California.  The rear of the SUBJECT
PROPERTY is located on Arch Drive with an iron fence lining the street as well
as various trees including several mature pine trees of 30-50 feet or taller
planted and installed several years before February 24, 2023 on the SUBJECT
PROPERTY. 
 
9. On February 24,
2023, one of those trees had overgrown to such size, weighing several tons and
more than 40 feet in height, that it had uprooted and fell through the SUBJECT
PROPERTY’s iron fencing and onto the public road and alley.  This created a dangerous condition, including
without limit, several limbs protruded like dangerous spikes (including into
areas where people walked), debris from the tree was scattered, the length of
the enormous tree (while still having the base on Defendants’ property) blocked
the public road and alley way and prevented access for equipment and crews
needed to make repairs to power lines and poles; and the fallen tree and debris
therefrom made it unsafe and too dangerous for repair crews to commence repairs
without first removing the fallen tree and accessing the SUBJECT PROPERTY (as
noted above) for those the needed emergency repairs.  Further, as addressed above, during February
24 to 27, 2023, Defendants did not permit, prevented, refused, or otherwise
would not readily permit equipment or repair crews from LADWP onto the SUBJECT
PROPERTY which was needed to make those emergency repairs to restore power and
services to Plaintiff and those similarly situated.  Moreover, the alleyway entrance and egress
was blocked, including one-end of Arch Drive was entirely blocked and
completely obstructed.  Upon information
and belief, the over-grown tree collapsed and fell due to the lack of lateral
support and subjacent support at the point where the tree was abutting the
public road, and due to its overgrowth without the needed additional support or
securing of that tree and improper maintenance, causing its insufficient
rooting to destabilize the surrounding dirt and land during the rainstorm on or
about February 24, 2023, and causing Defendants’ tree to fall onto nearby
electricity poles and break several powerlines and bend others along Arch Drive
and the alleyway, and which, Defendants knew or should have known, would and
did cause all or substantially all of the tenants, residents and apartment
buildings on Arch Drive to be left entirely without any power for longer than
reasonable, and such that the easternly entrance to Arch Drive was completely
blocked and untraversable, dangerous and hazardous, during that time.  (the allegations in this paragraph are
referred to as the “TREE FALL”).   
 
10. On and between
February 24, 2023 to February 27, 2023, the SUBJECT PROPERTY, operated in the
ordinary course of business as a fully functioning apartment rental property
fully serviced with onsite staff consisting of a property manager and staff and
offsite property or asset managers, engineering and landscaping managers and
staff.   
 
11. By the late
night of February 24, 2023, Plaintiff and those similarly situated (including
other tenants, residents, neighbors, and/or persons suffering from the BAD
NEIGHBOR ACTS) and others began to make complaints to Defendants, and each of
them, and/or their managers in charge and on the property, to remove the fallen
tree and obstructions on the public road, and about their persistence to
refusal to stop the BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS or remedy the TREE FALL.  This includes as early as late night on
February 24, 2023 through the early morning February 25, 2023, and continually
until and through February 27, 2023.   
 
12. In fact, during
that time, Defendants, and each of them, were informed and advised of the
unsafe and dangerous conditions created by the TREE FALL and there was a
growing number of tenants, residents, occupants and/or persons working for
LADWP, who physically appeared outside the SUBJECT PROPERTY’s front entrance in
person to complain and/or request that Defendants and each of them, remedy the
dangerous conditions created by the TREE FALL as well as to grant access to
LADWP repair crews and equipment to areas on the SUBJECT PROPERTY needed to
restore power and services damaged by the TREE FALL .  Defendants’ managers and employees, refused,
and instead argued with these individuals, threatened to call the police and
did call police or the sheriff during that time, and would not allow LADWP access
to the SUBJECT PROPERTY to remedy to 
make emergency repairs to restore power or to to remedy the dangerous
condition created by the TREE FALL (or do so itself), and continued to engage
in the BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS.  Defendants’
managers and employees also ignored Plaintiff, those other tenants, residents,
and occupants and interested persons. 
Defendants continued to reject and refuse to comply with multiple
requests from LADWP for reasonable and safe access to the SUBJECT PROPERTY so
as to allow LADWP to safely make repairs to the downed power lines and broken
or bent power poles during the relevant time period.  
 
13. Further, upon
information and belief, on or about February 25 or 26, 2023, in response to
request to remove the tree as requested by LADWP so power could be restored,
one of Defendants’ on-site managers publicly stated in the neighborhood, “F@@@
the tenants” and that Plaintiff or tenants could take care of it themselves, or
words to that effect.  The BAD NEIGHBOR
acts continued throughout the time, and by the morning of February 26, 2023, at
or about 8 am, when LAWDP attempted to make repairs to restore power, they were
refused entry onto the SUBJECT PROPERTY by Defendants’ on-site managers and/or
staff. 
 
14. At all times
relevant, Defendants, and each of them, knew or should have known of the TREE
FALL, that it caused the power outages, and that the BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS would
and did harm Plaintiff and those similarly situated, but Defendants ignored the
problem and refused or failed to repair, correct, or remedy the problem or
remove the fallen tree or obstructions, despite knowing and being requested to
do so urgently, including by putative class members and LADWP, and despite
Defendants, and each of them being aware of the ongoing and increasing harm and
danger to Plaintiffs, and those similar situated, by the persistence of the
TREE FALL and BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS. Yet, they would not attempt to remedy the
obstructions, TREE FALL, or discontinue the BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS, nor would
Defendants agree to pay to have their fallen tree removed, or actually ensure
it was removed at any time or otherwise engage in any act to remedy it or the
damages caused by their actions 
 
15. By the morning
of February 26, 2023, after Plaintiff and those similarly situated had been
three nights without any power/electricity/light and were living in squaller,
without convenient showers, hot water, electrical stoves, televisions,
chargers, and were living in darkness or otherwise ousted, constructively or
actually, out of their own homes or apartments, and/or were increasingly
suffering intolerable inconveniences, humiliation, emotional distress, and
rapid deterioration in habitable living conditions.  Defendants acts continually deprived
Plaintiff and those similar situated, of the value of the rents/mortgages and
homes or apartments for that time, as Defendants OWNER and PROPERTY MANAGERS
were indifferent to Plaintiff and those similarly situation, and they allowed
their nuisance to persist including, without limit, continuing to engage in the
BAD NEIGHBOR ACTS, continuing to ignore the TREE FALL, and refusing to allow
removal and instead permitting the fallen tree to obstruct the public road and
damage the power supply in the area.  Nor
did Defendants otherwise abate the nuisance or nuisance activities so as to
allow for the LADWP to lawfully remove Defendants’ fallen tree and, in fact,
continued to prevent LADWP from lawfully making the repairs needed to restore
power.  
 
16. By the night of
February 26, 2023, LADWP was still unable to access or affect repairs, and did
not have authority from Defendants to remove Defendants’ fallen tree, and
Defendants, and each of them, still refused to pay for or otherwise remove the
fallen tree on their own and they prevented LADWP from taking such action.  After LADWP was turned away and prevented
from making repairs, for yet another night, several tenants gathered near the
TREE FALL, including Plaintiff and others similarly situated, to protest
Defendants’ nuisance and refusal to remedy the nuisances as alleged herein,
including calling a tree removal company to remedy the TREE FALL and BAD
NEIGHBOR ACTS, and this was observed by at least one Sherriff’s Deputy
on-scene.  After approaching Defendants’
on-site managers or staff to pay for the removal that night and being rejected,
the tenants (including Plaintiff) engaged in peaceful self-help, by collecting
community funds and through a Good Samaritan, to pay the approx. $3,000 to
remove and dispose of Defendants’ fallen tree so LADWP could start working on
repairs to restore power to Arch Drive so they could return to normal use of
their residences, and to permit Plaintiff and those similarly situated to use
of the road and sidewalk on Arch Drive without Defendants’ obstructions and
debris. 
 
17. On February 27,
2023, after four days without power and ordinary and reasonable use of their
homes and apartments and without habitable living conditions, the LADWP was
able to restore the electrical service and power to Arch Drive at or about 1:30
pm that day as a result of the class members and Good Samarita having the tree
removed after Defendants continued to refuse to do so and prevented the
removal.   
 
18. However, large
pieces of the fallen tree from the TREE FALL were a continuing and persistent
nuisance to Plaintiff and those similarly situated, because Defendants, and
each of them, refused to remove their debris and continued to ignore the TREE
FALL, which persisted to be a nuisance and blocked parts of the sidewalk of and
adjacently to Arch Drive for several days or weeks after February 27, 2023. . .
. 
 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 8-18.)
 
At issue here is Defendants’
motion to strike punitive damages.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants contend the motion to
strike should be granted because Plaintiff fails to allege malice, oppression,
or fraud with particularity.  (See
Motion, pp. 11-15; see also Reply, pp. 4-7.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees.  She claims Defendants waived the right to
strike punitive damages. (See Opposition, p. 13.)  She also claims the allegations state
sufficient facts.  (See id. at pp. 5-10.)
 
The waiver argument is
unavailing.  The SAC is a new
complaint.  Plaintiff fails to cite
authority that prohibits a defendant from challenging punitive-damages
allegations in a new pleading.
 
Regardless, the motion to strike
is denied.  The Court incorporates the
demurrer tentative ruling.  As explained
there, the SAC alleges that Defendants interfered with LADWP’s response to an
emergency.  (See 11/21/24 Tentative
Ruling Re: Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint, p. 9.)  The Court finds that the interference
allegations suffice to allege malice or oppression and that, ultimately, the
efficient approach is to move to the discovery stage to flesh out the facts.
 
To the extent Defendants claim
punitive damages are unavailable, the Court disagrees.  The SAC alleges negligent conduct and
intentional conduct.  Multiple decisions
“recognize[] the availability of punitive damages” in negligence actions.  (Bommareddy v. Superior Court (1990)
222 Cal.App.3d 1017, 1020 [collecting cases]; see also, e.g., Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc. (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 1270 [affirming punitive-damages award in
an asbestos case where the plaintiff alleged negligence and strict liability concerning
the defendant’s failure to warn].)  The
same is true in nuisance actions when the alleged conduct is intentional.  (See, e.g., Stoiber v. Honeychuck
(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920.)  Again,
the Court finds that the SAC alleges a factual basis for punitive damages.
