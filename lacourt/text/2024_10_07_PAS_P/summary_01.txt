  - "A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 'must conform to the same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.'"
  - "The 'request must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.'"

And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and enter judgment. The case involves a collections action filed by American Express National Bank against Xiaojia Ma and Caesar Hardware International Limited. The parties entered into a settlement agreement, where the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiff a stipulated sum of $32,139.08 in monthly installments. The defendants defaulted on their payment obligations, and the plaintiff issued a cure letter. The plaintiff now seeks to recover the unpaid balance of the stipulated judgment.

The judge found that the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The judge also found that the plaintiff has complied with the procedural requirements of the agreement and that the defendants' failure to cure the default triggers the plaintiff's right to seek entry of judgment. The judge granted the motion and entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $29,702.08, which includes the unpaid balance of $29,139.08 and $563 in court costs.
