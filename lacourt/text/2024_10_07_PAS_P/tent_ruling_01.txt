  Case Number:  23AHCV02803    Hearing Date:   October 7, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO
VACATE CONDITIONAL DISMISSAL and ENTRY OF JUDGMENTI.         INTRODUCTION
On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff American Express National Bank
(“Plaintiff”) filed a collections action against Defendants Xiaojia Ma and
Caesar Hardware International Limited (“Defendants”)
On April 18, 2024, the parties entered into a settlement agreement
whereby the Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff a stipulated sum of $32,139.08
in monthly installments of $3,000.
On May 8, 2024, pursuant to the agreement, the Court conditionally
dismissed the action, retaining jurisdiction.
On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent a cure letter to Defendants after they
failed to make payments required under the settlement. Defendants did not
respond or cure the default.
On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP § 664.6, seeking judgment for the
unpaid balance of the settlement.
No opposition has been filed. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (CCP § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis
added].) For purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is
signed by any of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2)
¶ An attorney who represents the party.” (CCP § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].)
            “On a
motion to enforce, the court must determine whether the settlement agreement is
valid and binding. [Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of
the settlement were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the
parties expressly acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by
those terms. [In re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896,
911.]” (Estate of Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5 948, 952.)
            The
court may interpret the terms and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v.
Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create
material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties
themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4 793, 810). 
III.      ANALYSIS
A.    Retention
of Jurisdiction
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an
action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the
matter.’ (Conservatorship of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.)
‘If requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF
Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.)
“‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of
section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a
settlement agreement.’” (Id., quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)
            “A
request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must
conform to the same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts
have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself:
the request must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the
case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3)
either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’” (Id.,
quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440.) “The ‘request
must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Id., quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440.)
Here, the parties signed a
stipulation containing their agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction
under CCP § 664.6 to enforce the terms of the settlement and enter judgment in
the event of default. (05-09-24 Order) Prior to dismissing the action, the
parties submitted the signed stipulation to the Court. On May 5, 2024, the
Court signed the order granting the dismissal. Therefore, the Court finds that
the stipulation complies with the requirements under CCP § 664.6, and it
retains jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ stipulation in
this action.
 
B.    Entry
of Judgment
The settlement agreement, filed on
April 18, 2024, provides that the parties agreed to settle the matter for a
stipulated sum of $32,139.08 owed by Defendants on their account ending in
3001. (Dyle Decl., ¶5; Exh. A) The Agreement, signed by both the Plaintiff and
Defendants, provides for payment to be made in consecutive monthly installments
of $3,000 starting from January 2024, with a final payment of $2,139.08 due in
November 2024. (Exh. A) Defendants to date have made payments totaling $3,000
but have defaulted on their payment obligations since January 26, 2024. (Dyle
Decl., ¶7) Plaintiff issued a cure letter on June 26, 2024, notifying
Defendants of the default, but Defendants failed to cure within the stipulated
time period. (Dyle Decl., ¶7; Exh. B)
Plaintiff now moves to vacate the
conditional dismissal and seeks the entry of judgment under the terms of the
Settlement Agreement pursuant to CCP § 664.6. The motion requests judgment in
the total amount of $29,702.08, which reflects the unpaid balance of the
stipulated judgment, after deducting the $3,000.00 paid by Defendants, plus
$563.00 in court costs.
The Court finds the Settlement
Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here, the Plaintiff has
provided evidence of Defendants’ default in making the agreed-upon payments.
Under the terms of the Agreement, Defendants expressly agreed that, in the
event of a default, the Plaintiff may request entry of judgment for the full
stipulated amount of $32,139.08, minus any payments made. (Exh. A)
Plaintiff has complied with the
procedural requirements of the Agreement, including issuing a cure letter to
Defendants and allowing the stipulated period to cure. Defendant's failure to
cure the default triggers Plaintiff’s right to seek entry of judgment for the
unpaid balance of $29,139.08.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED, and judgment is entered for
Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount of $29,702.08 which includes the
unpaid balance of $29,139.08 and $563 in court costs.
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
