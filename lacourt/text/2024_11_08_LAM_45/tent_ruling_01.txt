Background 
            This case stems from accusations of
insurance fraud. On February 1, 2021, Frank J. Cannata (Relator) filed a
Complaint against Lucky’s Two-Way Radios, Inc., Buddy Corporation, and James A.
Kay Jr. The Complaint alleges that defendants violated the California Insurance
Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA or INS §1871.7). On July 15, 2024, the Court
sustained the Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed on March 22, 2023. On
August 12, 2024, Relator filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC)
against Lucky’s Two-Way Radios, Inc., Buddy Corporation, Communications Relay,
LLC, and James A. Kay Jr. 
The SAC
alleges the following: In 1993, the California legislature enacted the
Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), codified at Insurance Code §§ 1871, et
seq. The IFPA permits civil enforcement of relevant provisions of the Penal
Code either by the State or by any “interested person” on behalf of the State,
i.e., a relator in a qui tam action. (SAC, ¶¶ 13-14.) Relator is a former
employee of defendants Lucky’s Two-Way Radios, Inc. and Buddy Corporation. (Id.
at ¶ 23.) In 2018, defendants made a claim to Harford Fire Insurance Company
(Harford) for commercial property loss, claiming that they were damaged by the
supposed theft, loss, or disappearance of certain defunct electronic equipment.
(Id. at ¶¶ 24-26.) The equipment was of negligible value, but defendants
entered into a scheme to misrepresent the property’s value to Harford. (Id.
at ¶¶ 28-29.) Relator then filed suit. 
There
are now four motions before the Court filed by defendants Lucky’s Two-Way
Radios, Inc., Communications Relay, LLC, and James A. Kay Jr. (collectively
Defendants): (1) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions;
(2) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories; (3) Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents; and (4)
Motion to Compel Responses to Deposition Questions. Defendants request monetary
sanctions against Relator and his counsel in connection with each motion. 
On
May 31, 2024, the Court continued the motions to November 1, 2024. The Court
also granted Defendants’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories. 
On
October 28, 2024, the Court again continued the motions to November 8, 2024. 
As
of November 5, 2024, Relator has not opposed any of the motions.[1]
Trial
Setting Conference is scheduled for January 17, 2025.   
Legal Standard for Motion to Compel Further 
Where responses to interrogatories, requests for production, or requests
for admissions have been served but requesting party believes that they are
deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete or because an objection
is without merit, that party may move for an order compelling a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a); 2031.310, subd. (a);
2033.290, subd. (a).) A respondent has the burden to justify objections in
response to a motion filed to compel further responses. (Fairmont Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)       
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §§2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h);
2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Before bringing a motion to compel
further responses to any discovery request, the moving party is required to
make efforts to meet and confer in good faith and must submit a declaration
attesting to those efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1); 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿However, a discovery motion need not be denied
automatically based upon the reason that the moving parties failed to meet and
confer in good faith.¿(See Obregon v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
424, 434.) 
Discussion for
Motion to Compel Further 
The parties met and conferred before
Defendants filed their motions to compel further. (McGonigle Decl., ¶¶ 4-5;
Exs. E-G .) Upon review of the meet and confer letters, the Court finds that
the parties sufficiently met and conferred in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2016.040.  
Defendants move to
compel further responses to requests for admissions, special interrogatories,
and requests for production of documents. 
1.     
Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Admissions
Defendants move to
compel further responses from Relator to Requests for Admissions numbers 6-8, 11,
20-23, 25, 34, and 35. Defendants also request an order deeming numbers 1-5, 9-10,
12-19, 22, 24, and 26-33 admitted as no responses to these requests were
provided.[2] Defendants
request sanctions against Relator and his counsel in the amount of $2,500. 
Because no responses to requests numbers
1-5, 9-10, 12-19, 22, 24, and 26-33 were provided and without a timely
objection, an order deeming them admitted is warranted. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280, subd. (b); McGonigle Decl., ¶¶ 2-5.)
Further, as to requests numbers  6-8, 11, 20-23, 25, 34, and 35, the Court
agrees with Defendants that Relator states improper boilerplate objections. For
example, Relator objected to requests on the ground that they were contention
requests, however contention requests are standard as “requests for admission
may ask a party to admit the truth of specified fact, opinion relating to fact,
or application of law to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter
that is in controversy between the parties.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2033.010.)
Further, Relator’s other responses that constitute objections including “contention
of law,” undefined phrases, harassment, and attorney client privilege are unpersuasive,
and Relator fails to substantiate them as no opposition has been filed. 
Accordingly, the motion is granted and
sanctions are warranted. Defense counsel requests
$2,500 in attorney’s fees and costs for bringing the Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Admissions, however, Defense counsel provides no
calculations for how they arrived at this figure. (McGonigle Decl., ¶ 6.) Defense counsel merely states, “[b]etween
the time spent by attorneys and paralegals in my office in researching,
preparing and finalizing these moving papers and any Reply papers, and time
spent preparing for and appearing at oral argument, I anticipate that
Defendants will have incurred greatly in excess of $4,500 in attorneys’ fees
and costs in bringing this motion.” (Ibid.) Defense counsel should
provide calculations for the requested sanctions prior to the Court imposing
sanction on Relator and his counsel. 
2.      Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
Defendants move to compel further
responses from Relator to Special Interrogatories numbers 7-11 and 15-16 as
these responses contained no objections but instead a promise that supplemental
responses will be provided. Defendants also request further responses from
Relator to Special Interrogatories numbers 1-6, 12-14, and 17-42 as Relator
stated improper boilerplate objections. Defendants request sanctions against
Relator and his counsel in the amount of $4,500. 
Defendants contend that after
propounding Special Interrogatories to Relator, the responses received back
were evasive and when supplemental responses were promised by Relator they were
never received. The Court agrees and grants the motion. Defendants propounded
their Special Interrogatories on December 19, 2023. (McGonigle Decl., ¶ 2.)
Responses were received on January 29, 2024 which contained objections and
promises that substantive responses would follow. (Ibid.) As of the
filing of the motion, no substantive responses were received. Attempts to meet
and confer by Defendants proved futile. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-5.) 
Responses to Interrogatories
numbers 7-11
and 15-16 contained no objections but stated that “supplemental responses will
be furnished shortly.” However, no responses were furnished. Additionally,
responses to Interrogatories numbers 1-6, 12-14, and 17-42 contained meritless
objections. For example, Relator objected on the basis that he intends to
designate under section 2030.230, however he failed to satisfy the other
requirements of this section such as “specify the writing from whichever the
answer may be derived or ascertained.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.230.) Further,
Relator objected on the basis that the interrogatories were “unduly burdensome and
overbroad,” however this objection is conclusory as Relator failed to explain
how the interrogatories are burdensome and overbroad. Similarly, Relator failed
to explain how the interrogatories requested information protected by the
attorney-client privilege, nor did Relator provide a privilege log. Finally,
the objections that claim the interrogatories call for a legal conclusion and
interfere with privacy rights are unpersuasive. Relator fails to substantiate any
of the objections as no opposition has been filed to this motion.
Accordingly, the motion is granted and
sanctions are warranted. Defense counsel requests
$4,500 in attorney’s fees and costs for bringing the Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories, however, Defense counsel provides no
calculations for how they arrived at this figure. (McGonigle Decl., ¶ 6.) Defense counsel should provide
calculations for the requested sanctions prior to the Court imposing sanction
on Relator and his counsel. 
3.      Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production 
Defendants move to compel further
responses from Relator to Requests for Production of Documents numbers 1-15 as
Relator stated improper boilerplate objections. Defendants request sanctions
against Relator and his counsel in the amount of $2,500.  
Defendants contend that after
propounding Requests for Production to Relator, Relator served Defendants with
boilerplate objections and a promise to provide supplemental responses although
responses were never received. The Court agrees and grants the Motion.
There are 15 Requests for
Production in dispute. Relator failed to provide any documents requested by
Defendants despite promising to do so. (McGonigle Decl., ¶
4.)
Further, Relator’s response that constitutes an objection is meritless. For
each of the 15 Requests for Production, Relator objects on the basis the
requests are burdensome and overbroad, call for attorney-client privileged
information and work product information, call for a legal conclusion, and
violate privacy rights. However, the objections are unpersuasive for the same
reasons as noted above regarding the requests for admissions and special
interrogatories. Moreover, Relator fails to substantiate any of the objections
as no opposition has been filed to this motion. 
Accordingly, the motion is granted and
sanctions are warranted. Defense counsel requests $2,500
in attorney’s fees and costs for bringing the Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Request for Production, however, Defense counsel provides no
calculations for how they arrived at this figure. (McGonigle Decl., ¶ 6.) Defense counsel should provide
calculations for the requested sanctions prior to the Court imposing sanction
on Relator and his counsel. 
Legal
Standard for Motion To Compel Proper Deposition Responses 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 2025.480, subdivision (a) provides: “If
a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(a).) “This motion shall be made no later than 60 days after the
completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Id., § 2025.480,
subd. (b).)  The 60-day deadline is mandatory. (Weinstein v.
Blumberg (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 316, 321.) 
If the court determines that the
answer or production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the
answer be given or the production be made on the resumption of the deposition.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (i).) 
If the proposed deponent made some
response, then a separate statement must accompany any motion to compel
deposition attendance or production. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
subd. (b).) 
Discussion
for Motion To Compel Proper Deposition Responses 
Defendants move pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (a) for an order compelling Relator to
properly respond to questions propounded to him in his deposition arguing that
Relator evaded answering the questions or was instructed by counsel without
good cause not to answer. In connection with the motion, Defendants request
sanctions against Relator and his counsel in the amount of $4,500. 
Defendants noticed Relator’s deposition
for December 12, 2023, and on January 17, 2024, the deposition was continued.
(Motion, pp. 4-6; McGonigle Decl., ¶ 6;
Ex. B.) During the deposition, Defendants sought Relator to provide the factual
basis of the various claims and to disclose the facts that were provided to the
Department of Insurance to determine whether he was an “original source.”
(Motion, p. 7.) Insurance Code §1871.7, subd. (h)(2), provides:
(A)
No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon
the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or
administrative hearing in a legislative or administrative report, hearing,
audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought
by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source
of the information. 
(B)
For purposes of this paragraph, ‘original source’ means an individual who had
direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations
are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the district attorney
or [insurance] commissioner before filing an action under this section which is
based on the information.
Defendants state that they were required
to file this motion compelling Relator to disclose the facts he provided to the
Department of Insurance and the basis of his claims because Relator refused to
answer, incorrectly claimed he already answered, or was instructed not to
answer questions at the deposition. (Motion, pp. 7-8.) 
There is a mandatory 60-day deadline to file a motion to compel under section
2025.480, subdivision (a). (Weinstein, supra, 25 Cal.App.5th at 320.) Based
upon the date of January 17, 2024—the date the deposition was continued—it
appears that Defendants had until 60 days or March 17, 2024 to file their
motion. However, Defense counsel declares that opposing counsel agreed to extend
the deadline for Defendants’ motion until April 1, 2024. (McGonigle Decl., ¶ 5.) Defendants served and filed their
motion on April 2, 2024. Therefore, notwithstanding the agreement for an
extension, Defendants’ motion appears untimely, and Defendants do not state
that opposing counsel agreed to the late motion. 
Accordingly, the motion is denied as well
as the request for sanctions.  
Conclusion 
            Defendants’ Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission, Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories, and Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production are GRANTED. The Court requests that Defense
Counsel provide calculations for the requested sanctions prior to the Court
imposing sanctions on Relator and his counsel. 
            Defendants’ Motion to
Compel Proper Deposition Responses is DENIED.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
