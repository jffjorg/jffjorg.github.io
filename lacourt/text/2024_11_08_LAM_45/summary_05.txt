  - "The Covid Notice was served on May 13, 2024, which is over one year after the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibition ended and over one year after the accumulation of the rental debt."
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff's Covid Notice is invalid because it was served more than 12 months after the rent became due. The Covid Notice was served on May 13, 2024, and seeks $42,750 in COVID-19 rental arrears for the periods between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021, and October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2023. The court concludes that the Covid Notice was not timely served, as it was served over one year after the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibition ended and over one year after the accumulation of the rental debt. The plaintiff's complaint is therefore dismissed, and the defendant's motion is granted.
