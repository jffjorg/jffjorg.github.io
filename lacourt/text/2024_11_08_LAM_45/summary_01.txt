And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by the defendants, Lucky's Two-Way Radios, Inc., Buddy Corporation, and James A. Kay, Jr., and has granted their motions to compel further responses to requests for admissions, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The Court has also denied their motion to compel proper deposition responses.

The Court finds that the defendants' motions are justified because the plaintiff, Relator (Frank J. Cannata), failed to provide adequate responses to the discovery requests, and that the objections raised by Relator are meritless. The Court orders that Relator provide further responses to the discovery requests and imposes sanctions on Relator and his counsel.

The Court also denies the defendants' motion to compel proper deposition responses because the motion was filed late, and the defendants failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff evaded answering questions or was instructed by counsel not to answer.

The Court requests that Defense Counsel provide calculations for the requested sanctions prior to imposing sanctions on Relator and his counsel.

The Court's ruling is based on the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290, and 2025.480, and Insurance Code section 1871.7.
