And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The County of Los Angeles has filed a motion to determine the good faith of a settlement between it and Richard R. Salazar, the plaintiff in this personal injury action. The settlement amount is $50,000.00. The County argues that the settlement was reached in good faith and that there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling parties.

The judge has reviewed the motion and finds that it provides sufficient grounds for a good faith determination. The judge notes that the County's motion describes the background of the case and provides sufficient reasoning as to why the settlement was reached in good faith. Additionally, the judge notes that there is no opposition to the motion.

Therefore, the judge grants the County's motion for a determination of good faith settlement. This means that the settlement between the County and Salazar is deemed to be in good faith, and any other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors are barred from claiming equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
