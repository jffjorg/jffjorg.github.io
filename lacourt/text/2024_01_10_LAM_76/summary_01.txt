And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order granting summary judgment to the defendants. The plaintiff, Michael Goland, alleged that the defendants failed to deliver a Permanent Dental Appliance and refused to refund payments made. The judge found that the plaintiff's argument that he was required to be personally served with the motion for summary judgment was meritless, and that the motion was properly served by overnight delivery. The judge also noted that the plaintiff was aware of the motion for summary judgment when he filed his ex parte application to stay proceedings. The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was based on the same arguments that were presented in the original opposition to the motion for summary judgment, and the judge found that the plaintiff failed to present new or different facts, circumstances, or law that could not have been presented earlier. The judge concluded that the motion for reconsideration was an abuse of the process and was denied.
