ANALYSIS
Motion To Compel Further Responses To Requests For Production
Plaintiff
Angela Arnone moves to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents from Defendant and requests sanctions.
 
(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
 
 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the following:
 
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(3) In lieu of a separate statement
required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.
 
(c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.
 
.  . .
 
(i) Except as provided in subdivision
(j), if a party fails to obey an order compelling further response, the court
may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in addition to, that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).
 
.  .  .

     (Civ.
Proc. Code § 2031.310.)
 
Defendant
served supplemental responses on January 27, 2023 electronically. (K.L. Decl,
¶¶ 11 – 12; Exh. D.) Based on the service of these responses, the deadline to
bring a motion to compel was March 15, 2023 (45 days plus 2 additional days for
electronic service). Plaintiff obtained a “two-week extension” from Defendant’s
counsel on March 13, 2023 at 2:04 PM (K.L. Decl., Exh. E.) This would extend
the deadline to Wednesday March 29, 2023. (Plaintiff was operating under the assumption
that the deadline was extended to March 27, 2023—March 13, 2023, 3:29 and 3:32
PM emails; K.L. Decl., Exh. E.) On March 21, 223 at 1:30 PM, Defendant’s counsel
granted an extension to April 4, 2023. (K.L. Decl., Exh. E.) This motion was
thus timely filed and served on April 4, 2023.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel engaged in sufficient meet and confer efforts prior to filing this
motion. (K.L. Decl., Exhs. D, E.)
 
The Court
will address the requests set forth in the separate statement:
 
¿        Demand for
Inspection No. 17: GRANTED.
            In the separate
statement, Plaintiff makes a fact-specific showing of good cause for the
requested documents. As such, Defendant’s objections as to relevance and discoverability
are OVERRULED.
Moreover,
Defendant has not made a sufficient showing under the Hill analysis
regarding Tshoaedi’s right of privacy.
            The
California Supreme Court has held that a compelling
interest or compelling need is not always required in order to discover
private information—the Court must consider the factors articulated in Hill
v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994)  7 Cal.4th 1 to determine the
seriousness of the privacy invasion and the strength of the countervailing
interest required to overcome that invasion. (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531.)
In ruling upon a privacy
objection in the contact of discovery, the party asserting a privacy right must
establish a legally protected privacy interest. (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at 552.) The party asserting a privacy
right must also establish an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in
the given circumstances. (Id.)
Further, the party asserting a privacy right must establish a threatened
intrusion that is serious. (Id.)  The Court need not proceed to the fourth step
of balancing competing interests if all three of the above are not satisfied. (Id. at 555.) If the Court reaches the
fourth step, the Court must balance these competing considerations: The party
seeking information may raise whatever legitimate and important countervailing
interests disclosure serves.  (Id. at 552.) The party seeking
protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or
protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy.  (Id.)
Courts may not require the party seeking discovery to demonstrate a “compelling
state interest” or “compelling need[1]”
simply because discovery of any facially private information is sought.  (Id.
at 556-57.)
            As such,
Defendant’s privacy objection is OVERRULED.
            Further responses
are due within 20 days.
¿        Demand for
Inspection No. 18: DENIED.
 
            Defendant’s response
that it will produce all responsive documents in its possession, custody and control
is code-compliant. (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2031.220.) Defendant is not withholding
any documents based on the objections. 
 
¿        Demand for
Inspection Nos. 19, 20: DENIED.
            In the separate
statement, Plaintiff makes a fact-specific showing of good cause for the
requested documents. As such, Defendant’s objections as to relevance and discoverability
are OVERRULED. Defendant’s objections which were not initially asserted are
OVERRULED as waived.
            Objections
which the responding party did not raise in initial responses are deemed to
have been waived. (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 263, 272-76 [holding
that the attorney-client privilege was waived by failing to present the
objection in the initial response to requests for production of documents].)  Defendants’ sole recourse is to seek a relief
from waiver pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a)(1) & (2). (Id.  at 274-75 [noting that the “sole remedy
for relief from waiver in the context of discovery is contained within the
provisions of the Act and [a party] cannot rely upon the provisions of [Code of
Civil Procedure] section 473.”])

            However,
Defendant’s supplemental response that it will produce or already has produced documents responsive to this Request
within its possession, custody, and control, and identified as documents Bates
stamped VSM 00533-535, 00541, 00572-573, 00697 is code-compliant. (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2031.220; § 2031.230.)
 
¿        Demand for
Inspection No. 32, DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff has not
made a fact-specific showing of good cause for the broad category of document sought.
 
“Although the scope of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless.”
(Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223
[61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 567].) Discovery devices must “be used as tools to facilitate
litigation rather than as weapons to wage litigation.” (Id. at p. 221.) A party
seeking to compel discovery must therefore “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought.” (§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); see
Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at p.
223.)  To establish good cause, a discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in
reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will
tend to prove or disprove the fact.
 
(Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224 (bold emphasis and underlining added),
overruled on other grounds in Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557, n. 8.)
            Defendant’s
objection on the ground of attorney-client privilege and attorney work product
privilege is SUSTAINED. Defendant must provide a privilege log describing the
documents being withheld and the applicable privilege.
¿        Demand for
Inspection Nos. 36, 37, 38: DENIED. 
            Plaintiff has not
made a fact-specific showing of good cause for the broad category of document sought.
¿        Demand for
Inspection No. 62: DENIED.
In the
separate statement, Plaintiff makes a fact-specific showing of good cause for
the requested documents.
As such,
Defendant’s objections as to relevance and discoverability are OVERRULED.
Defendant’s objections which were not initially asserted are OVERRULED as
waived. 
However, in
the supplemental response, Defendant has indicated that it is unable to comply because
the documents never existed. This complies with Civ. Proc. Code, § 2031.230.
Because
Plaintiff’s motion was largely unsuccessful, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is DENIED.
