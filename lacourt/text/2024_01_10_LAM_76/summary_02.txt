And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories to March 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The hearing will be heard concurrently with the defendant's motion for relief from waiver—interrogatories. The plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to respond to the form interrogatories by the deadline, but the plaintiff's counsel did not file a declaration in support of this claim, stating under penalty of perjury that this is true. The judge relies on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 and the case of Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06, which states that a party who fails to respond to interrogatories waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product.
