And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, but only in part. The plaintiff had requested documents related to wage and hour violations, demotion and termination, and FMLA qualifying medical leave. The judge found that some of the requested documents were relevant and discoverable, and ordered the defendant to produce them within 20 days.

However, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for documents related to certain broad categories, finding that the plaintiff had not made a sufficient showing of good cause for the discovery. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's motion was largely unsuccessful.

The judge noted that the defendant had served supplemental responses on January 27, 2023, and that the plaintiff's counsel had engaged in sufficient meet and confer efforts prior to filing the motion. The judge also considered the factors set forth in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, in ruling on the defendant's privacy objection.
