Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Frank O. Fox, demurred to the Complaint, arguing that the cause of action for financial elder abuse is time-barred by the four-year statute of limitations and that the plaintiff failed to file a compulsory cross-complaint in a related case. The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the case with prejudice.

The judge found that the Complaint failed to allege how the plaintiff was harmed and when the events occurred. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to file a compulsory cross-complaint in a related case, which barred the plaintiff from bringing the current action.

The judge granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain court records and orders, but denied the defendant's request for judicial notice of other documents that were extrinsic to the Complaint.

The judge noted that the demurrer did not lie to only part of a cause of action or a particular type of damage or remedy, and that the proper procedure is to bring a motion to strike the substantively defective allegation.
