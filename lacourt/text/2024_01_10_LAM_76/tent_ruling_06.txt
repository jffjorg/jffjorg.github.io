Discussion
Defendant
Frank O. Fox demurs to the Complaint as follows:
1.         Entire
Complaint (First and Only Cause of Action—Financial Elder Abuse, Welf. &
Inst. Code, § 15610.30).
            A.        Re: Statute of Limitations.
            Defendant
argues that the cause of action for financial elder abuse is time-barred by the
four-year statute of limitations set forth in Welf. & Inst. Code § 15657.7.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff alleges that the deed of trust attached as Exh.
C to the Complaint was signed on October 29, 2018—more than four years prior to
the filing of the Complaint on July 21, 2023.
Defendant
argues that Fox and Fox stopped representing Plaintiff in the Wyla Jones matter
as of July 10, 2019, in the Jones v. Shavers matter as of April 15, 2019, and
in the Conservatorship of Wylma Jones as of April 23, 2018—all more than four
years before the Complaint was filed in this case.
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant was attorney of record for James Jones up to
and including January 23, 2019. (Complaint, ¶ 9.)
Welfare
and Institutions Code, § 15657.7 provides: 
An action for damages pursuant
to Sections 15657.5 and 15657.6 for financial abuse of an elder or dependent
adult, as defined in Section 15610.30, shall be commenced within four years
after the plaintiff discovers or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence,
should have discovered, the facts constituting the financial abuse.
Here, the
alleged financial abuse is Defendant having Plaintiff sign a fraudulent lien
securing Defendant’s legal fees. (Complaint, ¶ 19.) ¶ 9 alleges that Defendant
filed a lawsuit to collect his legal fees. That lawsuit—20STCV08922 (RJN Exh.
1) was filed on March 4, 2020. ¶ 8 of that Complaint alleges the existence of a
lien via a security instrument, executed. A jury could find that this was the
first time Plaintiff Bushnell discovered that Defendant had procured such a
lien from Jones and was asserting it. Given the four-year statute of
limitations, this action was timely filed on July 21, 2023.
            B.        Re: Another Action Pending.
            Defendant
argues that there is another action pending between the same parties on the
same matter. Defendant argues that Fox and Fox filed a civil action against
Plaintiff for breach of contract and common counts to collect the balance due
of $254,225.05 as of February 27, 2020. Defendant argues that no compulsory
cross-complaint was filed.
            Defendant’s
argument that this action is barred because Plaintiff was required to file a
cross-complaint in 20STCV08922 is persuasive. 
            Civ.
Proc. Code, § 426.30 provides:= 
(a) Except as
otherwise provided by statute, if a party against whom a complaint has been
filed and served fails to allege in a cross-complaint any related cause of
action which (at the time of serving his answer to the complaint) he has
against the plaintiff, such party may not thereafter in any other action assert
against the plaintiff the related cause of action not pleaded.
 
(b) This
section does not apply if either of the following are established:
 
(1) The court
in which the action is pending does not have jurisdiction to render a personal
judgment against the person who failed to plead the related cause of action.
 
(2) The
person who failed to plead the related cause of action did not file an answer
to the complaint against him.
 
     (Civ. Proc. Code § 426.30.)
            After
Jones’ default and the default judgment was set aside, Jones filed an answer on
May 31, 2022. 
Because of the liberal construction
given to the statute to accomplish its purpose of avoiding a multiplicity of
actions, “transaction” is construed broadly; it is “not confined to a single,
isolated act or occurrence … but may embrace a series of acts or occurrences
logically interrelated [citations].” (Saunders, supra, 231 Cal.App.2d at p.
336; see also Currie Medical, supra, 136 Cal.App.3d at p. 777.)

In addition, section 426.30 includes a timing element. The related cause of
action must be one that was in existence at the time of service of the answer
(§ 426.30, subd. (a)); otherwise, the failure to assert it in prior litigation
is not a bar under the statute. (Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221
Cal.App.3d 852, 864 [270 Cal. Rptr. 699].)


(Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 960.)
            Here,
Jones was required to file a compulsory cross-complaint as the alleged
financial elder abuse was effectuated through procuring the lien, which was
asserted in the Complaint filed in 20STCV08922.
            As
such, because Jones failed to file a compulsory cross-complaint in 20STCV08922,
he is barred from doing so here. 
            The
demurrer to the entire complaint (sole cause of action for financial elder
abuse) is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
            C.        Re:
Failure To Factually Allege The Underlying Events.
 
            Defendant argues that the Complaint
fails to allege how Plaintiff was harmed and when the events occurred. 
 
            Defendant argues that the deed of
trust was never recorded. However, this is a fact extrinsic to the Complaint. 
 
            This argument is moot, given the
above ruling.
 
            D.        Re:
Punitive Damages Not Supported.
 
            A demurrer
does not lie to only part of a cause of action or a particular type of damage
or remedy. (See Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046; PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (Ibershof)
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.) 
The proper procedure is to bring a motion to strike the substantively
defective allegation.  (Id. at 1682-83.)
 
Motion To Strike
 
            Given the ruling on the demurrer,
the motion to strike is MOOT.
 
The case
is hereby ordered dismissed with prejudice.
