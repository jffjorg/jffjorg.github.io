 Case Number:  21STCV38016    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  76 The hearing on Plaintiffs Fatima
Garcia, Jean Carlos Garcia and Carlos Garcia’s motion is CONTINUED to March 13,
2024 at 8:30 a.m., to be heard concurrently with Defendant’s motion for relief
from waiver—interrogatories. 
 
Motion To Compel Responses To Form Interrogatories
 
When a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to respond, under CCP § 2030.290(b) a party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling a response. A
party who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection, including
one based on privilege or work product. (CCP § 2030.290(a).) For a motion to
compel initial responses, no meet and confer is required. All that needs to be
shown is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. (Leach v. Sup. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff indicates in the
motion that Defendant did not provide any response or objections to form
interrogatories by the deadline. However, Plaintiff’s counsel did not file a
declaration in support of this motion stating under penalty of perjury that this
is true. 
 
As such, the hearing on the motion
is CONTINUED to March 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m., to be heard concurrently with
Defendant’s motion for relief from waiver—interrogatories.
