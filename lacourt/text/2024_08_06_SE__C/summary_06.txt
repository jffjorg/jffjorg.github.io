And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District's motion for summary judgment has been continued to August 27, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. Due to a cyberattack on the court's computer systems, the court's electronic filing systems were inoperable, causing a delay in the filing of the plaintiff's opposition. The court has not had sufficient time to review the opposition and reply briefs and therefore requires additional time to do so.
