And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge on a case, Case No. BC707783, between Arturo Beltran and Clarissa Beltran (Plaintiffs) and Downeys Billiard LLC, HAYK GEVORKYAN, and Diversified Protective Services (DPS) (Defendants). The Plaintiffs filed a complaint on May 25, 2018, alleging that they were attacked by security personnel at Club DB Lounge on May 28, 2016. The case is related to premises liability, general negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. On November 9, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant DPS's demurrer, which means that the Plaintiffs' claims against DPS are barred by the statute of limitations. The Court gave the Plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint, but as of July 30, 2024, no amended complaint has been filed. Since the Plaintiffs have not amended their complaint, the Court has granted Defendant DPS's Motion to Dismiss.
