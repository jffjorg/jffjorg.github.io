And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to deem matters admitted in this unlawful detainer lawsuit. The defendant had served requests for admissions on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to respond in a timely manner. As a result, the court has deemed the matters admitted and has granted sanctions of $400, payable within 60 days by the plaintiff and their counsel, jointly and severally. The court has also noted that the plaintiff's responses to the requests for admissions were served late, despite the shorter deadline for unlawful detainer actions.
