And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, which are subject to arbitration. The judge has denied the motion as to the fifth cause of action, which seeks injunctive relief under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law, as this claim is not arbitrable. The judge has held that claims seeking injunctive relief designed to protect the public by stopping unlawful practices under the CLRA and UCL are not arbitrable, citing previous case law. The judge has also noted that the parties have not committed the arbitrability decision to an arbitrator, and therefore the court must decide whether the dispute is within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
