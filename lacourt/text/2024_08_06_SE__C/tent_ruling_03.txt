Tentative Ruling 
Counsel Darlene Hernandez, Esq. and L&F
Brown P.C.’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED. 
Counsel to give notice. 
 
 
This motion is brought by Darlene Hernandez, Esq. and
L&F Brown P.C., presently counsel of record for Defendant Kenneth Redding,
for a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
This is a collections action.
As of July 29, 2024 this motion is unopposed. 
Good cause
exists to grant the motion based on any of the grounds under Rules of
Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C). Rule 3-700(c) provides that an attorney may
withdraw based on any of the following: (1) The client (a) insists upon
presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law and
cannot be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or
reversal of existing law, or (b) seeks to pursue an illegal course of conduct,
or (c) insists that the member pursue a course of conduct that is illegal or
that is prohibited under these rules or the State Bar Act, or (d) by other
conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out the
employment effectively, or (e) insists, in a matter not pending before a tribunal,
that the member engage in conduct that is contrary to the judgment and advice
of the member but not prohibited under these rules or the State Bar Act, or (f)
breaches an agreement or obligation to the member as to expenses or fees. (2)
The continued employment is likely to result in a violation of these rules or
of the State Bar Act; or (3) the inability to work with co-counsel indicates
that the best interests of the client likely will be served by withdrawal; or
(4) The member's mental or physical condition renders it difficult for the
member to carry out the employment effectively; or (5) The client knowingly and
freely assents to termination of the employment; or (6) The member believes in
good faith, in a proceeding pending before a tribunal, that the tribunal will
find the existence of other good cause for withdrawal. 
The
attorney declaration demonstrates good cause for withdrawal based on the death
of the Defendant and the estate’s apparent unwillingness to participate in the
current litigation.  On July 29,
2024, Counsel for Defendant filed Notice of Defendant Redding’s Death
Certificate.  
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
