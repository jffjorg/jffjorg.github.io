And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Darlene Hernandez, Esq. and L&F Brown P.C. on behalf of Defendant Kenneth Redding. The motion was unopposed as of July 29, 2024. The judge has found good cause to grant the motion based on Rule 3-700(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which allows an attorney to withdraw if the client's continued employment would result in a violation of the rules or the State Bar Act. In this case, the death of the Defendant and the estate's apparent unwillingness to participate in the current litigation have created good cause for the attorney to withdraw.
