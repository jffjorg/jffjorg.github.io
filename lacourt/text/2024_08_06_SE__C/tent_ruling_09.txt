Tentative Ruling 
Defendant SSM Dealer, Inc.’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration and to Stay Action is GRANTED as to the First, Second, Third, and
Fourth Causes of Action and DENIED as to the Fifth Cause of Action.
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background 
This is a breach of contract lawsuit regarding the sale of
a used 2010 Dodge Challenger VIN # 2B3CJ5DT6AH220012. On July 19, 2023,
Plaintiff Fabian Allen Lacey (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant
SSM Dealer, Inc. and Merchants Bonding Company Mutual alleging: (1) Intentional
Misrepresentation; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; (3) Violation of Business
and Profession Code § 17200; (4) Bond Claim; (5) Violation of the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act. 
Defendant SSM Dealer, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel
arbitration and stay proceedings.  
Legal Standard 
Defendant
moves to compel arbitration pursuant to an Arbitration Agreement entered into
between Defendant and Plaintiff when Plaintiff purchased the vehicle.  
 
California
law reflects a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a relatively
quick and inexpensive method for resolving disputes. To further that policy,
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 requires a trial court to
enforce a written arbitration agreement unless one of three limited exceptions
applies. Those statutory exceptions arise where (1) a party waives the right to
arbitration; (2) grounds exist for revoking the arbitration agreement; and (3)
pending litigation with a third party creates the possibility of conflicting
rulings on common factual or legal issues.” (Acquire II, Ltd. v. Colton Real
Estate Group (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 959, 967 [citations omitted]; Code Civ.
Proc. § 1281.2.) 
 
In
deciding a petition to compel arbitration, trial courts must decide first
whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and
then determine the second gateway issue whether the claims are covered within
the scope of the agreement. (Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 955, 961.) The party seeking arbitration has the “burden of proving
the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the
evidence, while a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” (Ruiz v.
Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842.)¿The trial
court “sits as the trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations,
and other documentary evidence, and any oral testimony the court may receive at
its discretion, to reach a final determination.” (Id.) General
principles of contract law govern whether parties have entered a binding
agreement to arbitrate. (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market
Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236; see also Winter v.
Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)¿ 
 
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff does not dispute that
the First, Second, Third, and Fourth causes of action are subject to
arbitration. It follows that Plaintiff submits that there is a valid and
enforceable arbitration agreement as to these causes of action.  Accordingly, the Motion Compel Arbitration as
to the First, Second, Third, and Fourth causes of action is GRANTED.  
The Court now turns its attention to the CLRA claim. 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends that the CLRA claim is
inarbitirable and therefore should not be subject to arbitration. 
In reply, Defendant contends that there is no claim for
injunctive relief. Defendant points to the fact that the word “injunction”
appears only in paragraph 84 which states “Plaintiff seeks to obtain an
injunction against Dealer which enjoins Dealer from continuing to make false
and misleading statements to consumers regarding the sale of motor vehicles.”
(Complaint, ¶ 84.) Defendant further argues that Plaintiff has not filed a
motion for a preliminary injunction.   
CLRA
and UCL
claims for injunctive
relief are not subject to arbitration as they are inarbitrable. (See Cruz v.
PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 303, 316; Broughton v.
Cigna Healthplans (1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066, 1082-84.) This was recently
confirmed in Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899,
917. The court in Sanchez raised, but declined
to address, whether the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in AT&T Mobility LLC
v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333 (finding federal preemption of a
California case holding unconscionability of class
arbitration waivers in consumer contracts) would also result in preemption of
the California rule against arbitration of UCL
and CLRA injunctive claims.
As such, Broughton and Cruz remain good law and Plaintiff’s UCL
and CLRA claims
for injunctive relief are not arbitrable. 
 
Absent
the parties' commitment of the arbitrability decision to an arbitrator,
disagreements over whether a particular dispute is within the scope of an
arbitration provision are ordinarily the responsibility of a court. (Mendoza
v. Trans Valley Transport (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 748, 765.) 
 
As
the Court held in Cruz, claims seeking injunctive relief designed to
protect the public by stopping unlawful practices under the CLRA and UCL are
not arbitrable. Here, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief under both the CLRA and
UCL.  
 
Accordingly,
the Motion to Compel Arbitration as to the Fifth Cause of Action is DENIED.
