The judge is continuing Plaintiff Maria Ramirez's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests and her motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The judge finds that the meet and confer efforts between counsel have been insufficient and orders counsel to make further efforts to resolve the issues. If the issues are not resolved, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. The judge also orders counsel to submit a revised joint separate statement outlining the remaining disputed issues by September 23, 2024.
