Here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies in part and grants in part the defendant's motion to strike the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The demurrer to the first cause of action for open book account is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the FAC does not adequately plead the elements of an open book account. The demurrer to the second cause of action for account stated is also sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the FAC does not adequately plead the elements of an account stated. The demurrer to the third cause of action for reasonable value (quantum meruit) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the FAC does not adequately plead the elements of a quantum meruit claim. The Court also denies the defendant's request to strike the FAC based on the grounds that it is a sham pleading, as the plaintiff has sufficiently explained the discrepancies between the original complaint and the FAC.
