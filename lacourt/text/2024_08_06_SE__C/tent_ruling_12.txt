Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Diversified Protective Services’
Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
This action for premises liability was filed by Plaintiffs
ARTURO BELTRAN and CLARISSA BELTRAN (“Plaintiffs”) on May 25, 2018. Plaintiffs
allege that “[o]n or about May 28, 2016 at around 12:00 AM, Plaintiff ARTURO
BELTRAN, along with his daughter CLARISSA BELTRAN were paying patrons at the
SUBJECT PREMISES at Club DB Lounge which was owned, operated, managed and or
controlled by Defendant DOWNEY’S BILLIARD, LLC… and/or HAYK GEVORKYAN. The
SUBJECT PREMISES is marketed as ‘LA’s and OC’s hottest  21 + Nightclub for 5 years running.”
(Complaint ¶12.) “Not too long after being inside the SUBJECT PREMISES, and as
Plaintiff ARTURO BELTRAN, knelt down to fix his leg-fast brace, he was
viciously kicked in the head and savagely beaten without any warning or provocation
by ‘security personnel’ or DOE BOUNCERS acting within the course and scope of their
employment…. Plaintiff was dragged about 50 feet to the exit.” (Complaint ¶15.)
“Plaintiff CLARISSA BELTRAN sustained significant emotional injuries after
witnessing her father being attacked by DOE BOUNCERS.” (Complaint ¶17.) Plaintiffs’
Complaint asserts the following causes of action: (1) General Negligence; (2)
Premises Liability; (3) Assault/Battery; (4) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; (5) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6)
Negligent Hiring, Training, Supervision, and Retention of Employees.
On November 9, 2023, this Court sustained Defendant DPS’s
Demurrer on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ claims against it are barred by the
statute of limitations.  The Court
sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.  As of July 30, 2024, no amended complaint or
opposition to the motion has been filed.
The Court retains the inherent power to dismiss a case when
the Plaintiff does not amend its complaint pursuant to a demurrer sustained
with leave to amend by the Court. (Sousa v. Capital Co. (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d
744, 755.)
 
The motion is unopposed. 
Accordingly, Defendant DPS’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.
