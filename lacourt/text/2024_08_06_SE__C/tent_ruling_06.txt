Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Norwalk-La Mirada
Unified School District’s Motion for Summary Judgment is CONTINUED
to August 27, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Defendant Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District’s
Motion for Summary Judgment was filed on May 9, 2024, and scheduled to be heard
on today’s date.  Due to a cyberattack on
the Court’s computer systems on July 19, 2024, the Court’s civil electronic
filing systems were inoperable until at least July 24, 2024.  Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion for
summary judgment was due on July 23, 2024, when the Court’s civil electronic
filing systems were still inoperable. 
Plaintiff was able to file its opposition by facsimile on July 24,
2024.  Defendant filed a timely reply on
August 1, 2024.
Due to an apparent error in the Court’s computer systems,
the Court was unaware that Plaintiff had filed an opposition on July 24,
2024.  The Court did not realize this
fact until after the reply was filed on August 1, 2024.  As a result, the Court requires additional
time to review the opposition and reply briefs. 
The hearing is therefore continued as set forth above.
