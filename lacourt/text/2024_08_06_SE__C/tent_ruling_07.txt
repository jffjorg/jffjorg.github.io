Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff The Ted Herz, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for Breach of Contract against Defendant Javier
Quezada Sanchez (“Defendant”).  
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, by email. (Burton Decl., ¶ 2.) 
On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motions. 
On June 20, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte
application to advance the hearing from January 14, 2025 to today’s date.  
To date, verified responses have not been severed upon
Plaintiff. (Burton Decl., ¶ 3.)
As of August 2, 2024, the motions are unopposed.
As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff has filed three motions
to compel responses to discovery in a single document.  Counsel is advised that each motion should be
filed separately and filing fees should be paid for each motion.  In the interests of judicial efficiency, the
Court will consider each motion on the merits. 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
served all discovery requests on March 19, 2024. (Burton ¶ 2.)
 
Plaintiff’s
attorney of record declares that as of June 3, 2024, Defendants have not responded
to any of the discovery requests or conferred with Plaintiff about the status
of the responses. (Id., ¶ 6.)  
 
Because
Defendant has failed to respond to the discovery requests, Defendant is
compelled to respond to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, without objection, including objections based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300 subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  For
interrogatories, the failure to respond also waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230. 
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s Motions are GRANTED.
 
A.   Sanctions 
 
Failure to respond to discovery requests is misuse of the
discovery process subject to sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) The
court is required to award monetary sanctions against Defendant unless
Defendant can show they “acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The monetary
sanction shall be in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.) Counsel for Defendant requests two separate awards of sanctions. 
 
Given the simplicity of the motions and the lack of opposition,
the Court imposes sanctions in the reasonable amount of $910.00, inclusive of
costs, upon Defendant and Counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 60
days.
