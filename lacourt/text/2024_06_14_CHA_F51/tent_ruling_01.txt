MOTION FOR
ATTORNEY’S FEES

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 20CHCV00290

 
Motion filed: 01/09/2024
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Eric Steinmann
RESPONDING PARTY: None
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order awarding Plaintiff
attorney fees in the total amount of $54,880. 

 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is GRANTED.
 
 
On September 1, 2023, the Court entered judgment
in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Jamila Alhwity only. Plaintiff
awarded fees and costs to Plaintiff.
 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
memorandum of costs.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021, which allows parties to a contract to agree on who will
bear the attorneys’ fees for claims arising out of their agreement. When a
contract authorizes attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party is generally entitled
to recover these fees as costs, as stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(10)(A)
and (c)(5). Here, Plaintiff states the agreement between Alhwity and TSG
contained an attorney fees provision, entitling the prevailing party to an
award of fees against the losing party.
 
Plaintiff argues he is the prevailing party because a
judgment was rendered in his favor. Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees in the
amount of $54,880, which he argues are reasonable. 
 
“[T]he fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. California courts
have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the
reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’
fee award.” (PLCM Grp. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal 4th 1084, 1095.) The
reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing rate for similar work in the
community. (Ibid.) “The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)  
 
After the lodestar is determined, the
court in its discretion may, but is not required to, apply a fee
enhancement or multiplier.
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel, Shannon Gallagher, provides a
declaration that states he obtained a J.D. from Loyola Law School and an LL.M.
in taxation from New York University. (Gallagher Decl. ¶ 3.) He declares that
he has been an attorney since 1982, has over 40 years of experience, and has
handled a large number of trial and arbitrations. (Id. ¶¶ 3-5.) He
claims a rate of $500 per hour and Aaron Burden, the other attorney who worked
on the case from 2020-2022, claims a rate of $300 per hour. (Id. ¶ 6.) The
declaration also provides a description of tasks, the hours spent, and fees
incurred. (Id. ¶ 7.) Upon review of the information, the Court finds the
rate and hours spent to be reasonable. Defendants failed to oppose this motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is awarded
attorney’s fees in the amount of $54,880.
