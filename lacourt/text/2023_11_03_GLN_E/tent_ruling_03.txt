16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP 1005(b)): Ok
Proper Address (CCP §1013, §1013a, §1013b): No – At the hearing, Plaintiff is to demonstrate proper proof
of service. Plaintiff’s proof of service alleges service by electronic mail on
August 21, 2023. On the proof of service, Plaintiff indicates it served
clh@hester-lawgroup.com and glgmail@hester-lawgroup.com; however, on eCourt,
Defendant’s counsel’s email address is listed as aab@hester-lawgroup.com. 

LEGAL STANDARD –
COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP §2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
TENTATIVE RULING
MOTION 1 
Since no Opposition
was submitted, Plaintiff needs to demonstrate proper proof of service for the
Court to grant this motion. Plaintiff’s proof of service alleges service by
electronic mail. On the proof of service, Plaintiff indicates it served
clh@hester-lawgroup.com and glgmail@hester-lawgroup.com; however, on eCourt,
Defendant’s counsel’s email address is listed as aab@hester-lawgroup.com. 
Plaintiff’s counsel
states that Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant on
June 21, 2023. (Elechyan Decl. ¶5.) Plaintiff granted Defendant several
extensions for Defendant to respond. (Elechyan Decl. ¶¶6-7.) As of the date of
filing the motion on 08/21/2023, Plaintiff’s counsel had still not received
responses. (Elechyan Decl. ¶8.)
Since Defendant did not respond within 30 days, and since Defendant
did not respond by the extension deadlines, the Court is inclined to grant this
motion and compel responses, without objection, to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, if Plaintiff can demonstrate proof of service of the instant motion.
 
Sanctions
CCP
§2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2030.290(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Here, Plaintiff requests sanctions be awarded to
Plaintiff and against Defendant and/or its attorney of record, Hester Law
Group, APC in the amount of $1,811.65. Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions
based on: (1) An hourly rate of $350.00; (2) Filing fee of $61.65; (3) 2.5
hours to prepare this motion; (4) 0.30 for anticipated review of Defendant’s
Opposition; (5) 1.0 for preparation of Plaintiff’s Reply; and (6) 1.0 for Court
Appearance.
The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the
hearing.
Motion 2
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff, Cheryl
Ollison, will move this Court to compel Defendant, Pasadena Huntington Hospital
Association, Ltd dba Huntington Hospital, to serve responses, without
objections, to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, under C.C.P. §
2031.300 and Request for Costs, Sanctions, and Attorney’s Fees under C.C.P. §
2031.300 against Defendant and/or the Attorney of Record, HESTER LAW GROUP,
APC.
 
Plaintiff will also seek sanctions,
reimbursement of costs and attorney's fees against Defendant in the amount of
$1,811.65 under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§2023.010 et seq. and § 2031.300 et seq.

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP §2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP
§2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
