And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to strike paragraphs 28 and 36 of the amended complaint filed by the defendants, Glendale I Mall Associates, LP, Glendale II Mall Associates, LLC, and Brookfield Properties Retail, Inc. The defendants alleged that the amended complaint includes irrelevant, false, or improper matters that should be stricken, specifically the request for punitive damages without alleging sufficient facts or law to support such relief. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, citing California Civil Code § 3294, which allows for punitive damages when a defendant has acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The court also notes that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged ratification by the defendants, which is required under California Civil Code § 3294(b).
