Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by Plaintiff Milagro J. Reynoso to strike Defendant FCA US LLC's objections and compel further responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Numbers 16-21. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to provide adequate responses to their requests, which seek documents directly relevant to their claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Judge finds that the motion is timely and that the Plaintiff's counsel sufficiently met and conferred with the Defendant's counsel. However, the Judge denies the motion as moot since the Defendant provided supplemental responses after the filing of the motion. The Judge also notes that the issue of sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.
