BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
filed its Complaint on 02/03/2023. The caption of the Complaint states,
“Complaint for Violation of Statutory Obligations (Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act CA Civil Code §§1790-1795.8.)
Although
the caption does not list the causes of action, the body of the Complaint lists
the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code
Section 1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2;
(3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of

including, but not limited to the following: defective engine system; defective
safety system; defective steering system; defective fuel system; defective
electrical system; defective brake system; and any additional complaints made
by Plaintiff, whether or not they are contained in the records or on any repair
orders.

ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP §2031.310(c).) 
Here, the parties don’t dispute the timeliness of this
motion. Therefore, the Court finds this motion timely. 
Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP §2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Movant’s counsel sufficiently met and conferred.
(Decl. Cao ¶19-20.) 
LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that
discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having
knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description,
nature, custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”

 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document inspection
may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if the
demanding party deems that:
 
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  
 
“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant’s counsel indicates that
it provided supplemental responses and verifications to the supplemental
responses on October 25, 2023. The instant motion was filed on 08/08/2023;
therefore, the supplemental responses were provided after the filing of this
motion.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, Numbers 16-21 is DENIED as moot; however, the issue of sanctions would not
be moot.
 
To
the extent Plaintiff has issues with the supplemental responses that were
provided after the filing of this motion, those issues are not before this
Court.
 
SANCTIONS
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §2031.310(h).)
“The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).) 
The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the
hearing.
