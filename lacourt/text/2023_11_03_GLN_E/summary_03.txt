And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. Since no opposition was submitted, Plaintiff needs to demonstrate proper proof of service for the Court to grant this motion. Plaintiff's proof of service alleges service by electronic mail, but the email address listed on the proof of service does not match the email address listed on eCourt. The Court is inclined to grant the motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, if Plaintiff can demonstrate proof of service of the instant motion.

The Court will also take up the issue of sanctions at the hearing. Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant and/or its attorney in the amount of $1,811.65. The Court has not yet made a determination on this issue.

The hearing date is November 3, 2023.
