I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On February 7, 2023, Plaintiffs, Cecilia Tapia De
Ulloa and Edwin J. Ulloa, as individuals and as successors in interest to
Natalia C. Ulloa filed a Complaint against Defendants, Michael K. Newman, M.D.,
South Bay Plastic Surgeons, Inc., Jason K. Ho, M.D., Michael Mercado, M.D.,
Providence Medical Institute Manhattan Beach Urgent Care, and DOES 1 through
100. The Complaint alleges a cause of action for Medical Malpractice/Wrongful
Death and Survival Action. 
On September 19, 2023, Defendant, Providence Medical
Institute Manhattan Beach Urgent Care (“Providence”) propounded written
discovery on Plaintiff, Edwin J. Ulloa.
This discovery included Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant Providence notes that
Plaintiff’s responses were due on or before October 23, 2023. On October 30,
2023, counsel for Defendant sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’
counsel, requesting verified responses, without objection, be received no later
than November 6, 2023.
 
On November 6, 2023, counsel for Defendant Providence,
sent a second meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel, requesting
verified responses, without objection, be received no later than November 17,
2023. Nonetheless, Defendant Providence asserts that no responses were
received, and no extensions were requested. To date, Defendant Providence
contends that no responses have been received. Thus, Defendant Providence now
files these motions to compel Plaintiff’s discovery responses. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On December 1, 2023, Defendant Providence
filed these Motions to Compel. To date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Motions to
Compel Responses 
 
Legal Standard 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411
Further, where there has been no timely response to a Code
of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the demanding party must seek an order
compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely respond waives all
objections, including privilege and work product. Thus, unless the party to
whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise
objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to
compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not
attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. Where the
motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no showing of "good
cause" is required. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Here, Defendant
Providence has asserted that Plaintiff, Edwin J. Ulloa has
not submitted any responses. Moreover, Plaintiff has not filed any opposition
brief to this motion. As such, the Court issues an order compelling Plaintiff, Edwin J. Ulloa, to submit verified responses to each of
Defendant Providence’s propounded discovery, without objections by March 19,
2024. 
 
III. CONCLUSION¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
For the
foregoing reasons, Defendant
Providence’s Motions to Compel Plaintiff, Edwin J. Ulloa’s
responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One are all GRANTED. The
Court orders Edwin to serve Code-compliant, verified answers to the
interrogatories, plus a verified written response to the document demands, plus
to produce the responsive documents, all without objection, to Providence by
March 19, 2024. 
Defendant Providence is ordered to give
notice.
