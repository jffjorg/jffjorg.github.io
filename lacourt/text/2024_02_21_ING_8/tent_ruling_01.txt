CASE NAME:                        T.K.&S
Development, L.P.;Hawthorne 14, LLC,  v.
Charles Thacker; Diana Thacker.
¿¿ 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendants, Charles and Diana Thacker 
¿¿ 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiffs, T.K.&S Development, L.P and Hawthorne 14,
LLC 
¿¿ 
MOTION:¿                              (1) Motion for Attorneys’ Fees 
¿ 
Tentative Rulings:                  (1)  Defendants’ Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in a modestly reduced amount from what was sought,
and oral argument is needed on several points. 
There is no challenge to Mr. Ishimatsu’s reduced hourly rate in this matter
which was considerably less than awarded to Mr. Goldberg in the related
arbitration case.  Does Plaintiff concede
the costs in the cost bill and only challenge specific line entries in the attorneys’
fees?  
¿
I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿ 
On December 22, 2022, Plaintiff, T.K.&S. Development, L.P., and
Hawthorne 14, LLC filed a Complaint for unlawful detainer against Defendant,
Charles Thacker, Diana Thacker, and DOES 1 through 10.  The Court conducted a bench trial over the
course of several different days, ultimately issuing a “tentative decision
after bench trial and proposed statement of decision” finding in favor of
defendants on all counts of Plaintiff’s commercial unlawful detainer complaint.
Neither party filed objections to the Court’s PSOD, making it now the final Statement
of Decision.  But costs and fees are
still at issue.  On December 12, 2023,
Defendants filed their amended memorandum of costs as the prevailing party and
in accordance with the Court’s instructions in the tentative decision.
Defendants note that to date, plaintiffs have not filed a motion to tax costs.   Defendants Charles and Diana Thacker now file
a Motion for an award of contractual Attorneys’ Fees. 
 
            There was a separate proceeding
between the parties, a contractual arbitration in which it appears TK&S
prevailed and were awarded attorneys fees and costs.  Counsel in the UD matter have taken pains to
separate billing invoices relating to the arbitration matter versus the UD
matter between the same parties.  Retired
Judge Bruguera issued a thorough and detailed decision awarding much of the Plaintiff’s
attorneys fees and costs, excising a few claimed entries where the moving party
did not carry its burden of providing a proper basis for mixed time entries
where some of the time was claimed to be attributable to the arbitration case
and some incurred for the UD case. 
Similar issues are raised here.  
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
¿ 
On December 20, 2023, Defendants
filed a Motion for Attorney Fees, Costs, and Expenses. On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition. On February 13, 2024, Defendants filed a reply brief. 
 
 
II. ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
Attorney’s fees are recoverable when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(10), attorney fees when authorized by contract, statute or law
are allowable as costs and may be awarded upon a noticed motion pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(5).  
 
Where a contract specifically provides for attorney’s fees
and costs incurred to enforce the contract, attorney’s fees and costs must be
awarded to the party who is determined to be the prevailing party on the
contract. (Civ. Code., § 1717, subd. (a).) “Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be
fixed by the court and shall be an element of the costs of suit.” (Ibid.) 
 
A prevailing party is defined as follows: 
 
(4) “Prevailing
party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose
favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than
monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing
party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the
court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion
costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules
adopted under Section 1034. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) 
 
In determining what fees are reasonable, California courts
apply the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
From there, the “[t]he lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
factors include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.) 
 
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the
appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986)
182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were
necessarily incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)
 
B.    
Discussion
 
Here,
Defendants moving papers indicate that they are seeking attorneys’ fees for
prevailing in this action in the amount of $50,452.50, upped to $51,122.50 in
Mr. Ishimatsu’s 2nd Supplemental Declaration. However, after the
filing of Plaintiffs’ opposition, Defendants note that they have agreed with
some of Plaintiff’s arguments on items that should not have been included in
Defendants’ request for attorneys’ fees. A recalculation of the amount sought
needs to be accomplished.  The issues conceded
or discussed by the parties include: 
 
June 2022 invoice – Plaintiffs argued that these invoices for the total amount
of $1,522.50 related only to the arbitration issues and not the current action.
Defendants conceded this, and have now agreed to remove it from the amount
sought. 
 
July 2022 invoice – Plaintiffs’ opposition argues that all 6 of the time
entries in the July 222 invoice, totaling $3,010 should be disallowed because
they purportedly relate to issues in the arbitration and not this unlawful
detainer action. Defendants, in their opposition, note that they agree in part.
Although Defendants agree that the first three time entries totaling $1,190
relate to issues in the arbitration and should therefore be disallowed, Defendants
disagree that the last 3 time entries should be disallowed because they relate
to the repair issues and permits that later were central to the unlawful
detainer action and the threatened eviction as a result thereof. 
 
            Plaintiffs’
opposition regarding the invoices does not discuss the July 22, 2022 charge,
however, with the other two remaining charges on the July 2022 invoice (July 25
and July 27, 2022) (assuming these entries were mistakenly identified as being
dated in 2023), Plaintiffs argue these entries are improper.  Plaintiff asserts that they had not raised
issues of repairs and permits regarding the property as of that date. In their
reply brief, Defendants argue that the repair issues were central to the
unlawful detainer action and the threatened eviction as a result thereof.
However, this Court notes that this case was not even filed until December
2022. The Court does not believe moving party has carried its burden in showing
how the July 2022 invoices relate the present unlawful detainer action and not
the arbitration issue generally. The Court will allow oral argument as to these
issues, but the Court’s tentative ruling is to DENY the $3,010 amount in attorneys’
fees in the July 2022 invoice. 
 
August Billing (Invoice Dated
November 25, 2022) – Plaintiffs’
opposition argues that all seven time entries for August 2022 ($4,025) should
be disallowed because they purportedly relate only to the arbitration and not
this unlawful detainer action. Defendants agree that the first 4 entries
related to the arbitration and should be disallowed in the amount of $2,205.
However, Defendants argue that the remaining 3 entries do relate to the repair
issues central to the unlawful detainer action and should be allowed. Defendants
note that they had discussions with attorney Stephen Goldberg about the repair
issues in August 2022 which manifested themselves in the September 1, 2022
letter from Mr. Goldberg. As such, Defendants still seek a total of $2,275 as
to this line item. 
 
            The
Court seeks oral argument from the parties as to the August 25, 28, and 30,
2022 charges and how they relate to the current action, and to attorneys’ fees incurred
prior to the filing of this action. Also, it is unclear based on the invoice
entries whether these charges were tied to the arbitration issue or whether
they have to do with a potential filing of this case. The Court notes that the
September 5, 2022 time entry references a letter from Mr. Goldberg just days
before re “alleged repairs and lease violations,” but this reference is
somewhat vague.  
 
February
7, 2023 – Defendants seek $175 for a 0.5
time entry to review Mr. Goldberg’s demand for an unlawful detainer trial.
Defendants submit that this is a reasonable time to spend in analyzing the
demand and its impact on the parties’ business relationship. The Court agrees
with the defense that this is a reasonable amount of time to spend given the relationship
of the parties and the impact that a contested trial might have on the
relationship. As such, those fees will be granted. 
 
February
17, 2023 –  Plaintiffs challenge Defendant’s 2.5 hour time entry of
“Drafted Requests for Admission and Requests for Documents,” drafts which were
begun on that date. Plaintiffs argue that these discovery requests were not in
the unlawful detainer action but in the arbitration as they were sent to the
arbitrator for approval by Defendants’ counsel on February 17, 2023 (Goldberg
Decl., ¶ 15, Exhibit K.) Moreover, Plaintiffs note that on February 18, 2023,
counsel billed for the Requests for Admission which are specifically identified
for the unlawful detainer. Plaintiffs argue that the February 18, 2023 charge
is acceptable, but the $875 charge on February 17, 2023 was not because the
February 17th requests were for arbitration, not for the unlawful
detainer action. 
 
In
Defendants’ reply brief, they argue that the RFAs were in fact drafted for the
unlawful detainer action as seen in Defendants’ attached Exhibit B to the reply
brief. Defendants clarify that on February 18, 2023, he completed the draft of
the RFAs and spent 1.5 hours and that there is no duplication of effort. This
Court will allow oral argument as to this issue, however, it appears that the
February 17, 2023 and February 18, 2023 charges are, as Defendants represent,
connected. As such, the Court is inclined to GRANT these fees. 
 
March
21, 2023 – Plaintiffs challenge the time
entry on March 21, 2023 for 1.8 hours ($680) (“Reviewed TKS Discovery Responses)
but admit that one of the responses was indeed related to the discovery in the
unlawful detainer action. Plaintiffs argue that two of the three discovery
responses were already served in the arbitration and thus the time Defendants’
counsel stated was used to review these responses should be reduced. The Court
agrees and reduces the amount to 0.6 hours ($223.67). 
 
Finally,
the Court notes that there is some confusion as to the requested amount as it
as changed in the reply brief to an originally requested amount of $56,957.50
but noting that $4,917.50 is disallowable, and instead requests $52,040. Defendants
also clarify in their reply brief that they seek costs in the amount of
$23,868.05. However, the Court notes that the originally requested amount, in
Defendants’ moving papers was $50,452.50 prior to the concession of lowering
amounts, and the Court’s own lowering of amounts. Further, Defendants’
memorandum of costs filed on December 12, 2023 identifies a request for costs
in the amount of $13,300.83. Defendants will need to clarify these
discrepancies before the Court.
