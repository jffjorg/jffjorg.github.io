This tentative ruling grants the motion of Plaintiffs Jiang Xu and Hui Cao to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The complaint was dismissed due to the failure of Plaintiffs' previous counsel, Ronald Norman, to appear at an Order to Show Cause hearing. Plaintiffs claim that this failure was caused by Ronald Norman's mistake and excusable neglect. The court finds that the dismissal was entered against Plaintiffs based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and grants the motion. However, Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $500 within 30 days.
