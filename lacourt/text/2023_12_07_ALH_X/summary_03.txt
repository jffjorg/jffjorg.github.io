The Defendant's motion is based on the fact that Plaintiff's allegations do not meet the legal standards for pleading punitive damages. The Plaintiff's allegations are general and conclusory, and do not specifically state that the Defendant acted with malice or oppression. The Court cites California Code of Civil Procedure and California Civil Code sections to support its ruling. The Plaintiff has 15 days to amend their complaint to meet the legal standards for pleading punitive damages.
