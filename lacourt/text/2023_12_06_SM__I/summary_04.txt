And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the motion for leave to amend is granted in part and denied in part. The judge allows Ramirez to bring back individual defendants who were previously defaulted, but only by amending the cross-complaint rather than filing a new one. The judge denies Ramirez's request to add new parties to the case, citing the potential for further delay and prejudice to the remaining parties. The judge also denies Ramirez's request for injunctive relief. Additionally, the judge strikes Mayendia's amended complaint for failing to comply with previous orders. The judge sets a case management conference (CMC) approximately 90 days from now and intends to set a trial date at that time.
