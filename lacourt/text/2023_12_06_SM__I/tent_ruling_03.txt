 Case Number:  21SMCV01145    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  I This is an ex parte application to allow the defense
more than 7 hours to depose plaintiff. 
Defendants are concerned that 7 hours won’t be enough and plaintiff will
end the deposition.  They claim to need
more time.
The court will allow 12 hours without prejudice to more if
the transcript reveals it is necessary. 
This is a very detailed complaint with a lot of allegations.  The court agrees that more than 7 hours is
appropriate.  The court will not go to
the requested 14 because, absent some showing that defendants have been
efficient with their questioning or improper behavior (such as obnoxious objections)
by plaintiff’s counsel, the court is not sure that 14 hours or even more is
appropriate.
The court STRONGLY urges the parties not to file motions on
this sort of thing but rather to work it out.
The court will not hear argument on this matter today.
