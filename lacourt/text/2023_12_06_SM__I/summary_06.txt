And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of process filed by the defendant, which challenges the validity of the service of process on Donald Sterling and Rochelle Sterling. The defendant claims that the proofs of service are perjurious and that the plaintiff's motivation for suing the individuals is illegitimate. The judge finds that the defendant has made a strong showing that the proofs of service are perjurious, but notes that the defendant waited until the reply to present this evidence. The judge orders the plaintiff to file a sur-reply to address the reply evidence and warns that the price of poker has gone up. The judge prefers the parties to work out the service issue among themselves, but notes that if the defendant wins the motion, service will not be quashed "with prejudice." The judge suggests that the parties can work out the service issue or demur, and notes that marching through the Code of Civil Procedure is an expensive and unnecessary alternative. The judge also suggests that if the defendant insists on playing hide and seek, the court may force the plaintiff to engage in that game or allow service by publication.
