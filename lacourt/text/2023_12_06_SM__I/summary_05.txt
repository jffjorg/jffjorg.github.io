And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is concerned about the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which is the second attempt to argue that the defendant's conduct did not fall below the applicable standard of care and did not cause the injury. The court views this motion as a serial motion, which is barred by the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP). The court also finds that the defendant's conduct in serving the papers personally, without also serving them electronically as requested by the plaintiff's counsel, was a sharp practice. Additionally, the court notes that the defendant's counsel did not attempt to communicate with the plaintiff's counsel to inform them of the motion, despite knowing that the time for opposition had passed. The court therefore declines to hear the motion and denies the summary judgment.
