**Significant Statements:** 
  - "Plaintiff knew that he was supposed to be on the Board (and therefore could have had a hand in setting the number), but for years did nothing about it."
  - "He knew he was a shareholder and he knew that there were never any shareholder meetings where directors were elected (which would have helped ensure a properly functioning corporate structure), but he never complained."
  - "The court believes now, as it believed then, that the number was not meant to be an actual going concern valuation of the company, but rather a number to be set based on the Board's discretion that it believed would be appropriate."
  - "Plaintiff's theory devolves into the realm of speculation."
  - "The chain of reasoning and causation is too attenuated to support a recovery."
  - "The motion to conform the pleadings to proof is DENIED."
  - "To allow plaintiff to articulate that now would be unfair. In the court's mind, it would require essentially a whole new trial, and worse, in front of a whole new jury."
  - "The court will set an OSC re: Entry of Judgment for January 24, 2024, at 8:30 am."
