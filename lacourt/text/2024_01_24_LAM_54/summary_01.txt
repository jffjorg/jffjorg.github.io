And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue trial filed by Defendant Xiangjie Zhou. The motion is granted in part, with trial continued to March 18, 2024, at 9:30 am. The final status conference is also continued to March 8, 2024, at 9:30 am. The court has allowed a short continuance to accommodate Defendant's counsel, who has an unrelated trial at the same time. The court has declined to grant a 90-day continuance, as requested by the Defendant, due to the indefinite nature of the Defendant's inability to travel to the US. The five-year cut-off for the action remains May 20, 2024, and pretrial deadlines are not extended.
