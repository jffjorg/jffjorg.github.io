BACKGROUND
                
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiffs William
Marshall and Clarence Tate filed the operative first amended complaint against
Defendant Farhad Yaghoubi, asserting causes of action for breach of contract,
fraud, negligence, civil battery, IIED, and premises liability. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant demurs to the entire
complaint on the grounds that it is uncertain and fails to state sufficient
facts. The Court agrees. Plaintiffs’ complaint contains vague and confusing
allegations of a property transfer from Defendant to Plaintiffs. It is unclear
from the FAC whether the transfer was a sale or lease and Plaintiffs do not
provide a copy of the lease and/or sales agreement. 
 
The allegations of misrepresentation,
negligence and battery are similarly incomprehensible. For example, Plaintiffs
allege, “Defendant made representations to Plaintiffs
about subject property described in this complaint that were wholly false.
Defendant conveyed property that had been closed due to a raid conducted by
LAPD, conceal that roof needed to be replaced; that mold had the high vo tage
[sic] wire removed because it was an illegal grow site. Defendant conveyed the
building to the former tenants knowing that the building would be used for an
illegal purpose.” This is insufficient to state a claim for fraud or negligence.
Plaintiffs do not oppose the demurrer to clarify the allegations.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. The motion to
strike is MOOT.
