  Case Number:  18STCV05750    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  54    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles       Weichou Huang,         Plaintiff,     Case No.:       18STCV05750       vs.         Tentative Ruling         Xiangjie Zhou, et al.,         Defendants.                                Hearing Date: January 24, 2024 Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter Motion to Continue Trial Moving Party: Defendant Xiangjie Zhou Responding Party: Plaintiff Weichou Huang   T/R:     DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS  GRANTED IN PART.    TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO MARCH 18, 2024,  AT 9:30 AM. THE FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE IS CONTINUED TO MARCH 8, 2024, AT 9:30  AM.   DEFENDANT TO  NOTICE.   If the parties wish to submit on the  tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with  notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the  day of the hearing. The Court considers the moving papers,  opposition, and reply.   While trial continuances are generally  disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good  cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain  essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent  efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,  “[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous  continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and  “[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)  Defendant Xiangjie Zhou moves to  continue trial for 90 days on the grounds that Defendant is awaiting criminal  trial in China and Defendant’s counsel has an unrelated trial at the same time.  Defendant does not indicate that Zhou will be able to travel to the United States  within the next 90 days. Plaintiff opposes a 90-day continuance.  Plaintiff emphasizes that  Defendant’s inability to travel to the US is indefinite. Plaintiff does not  oppose a 3-to-4-week continuance to accommodate Defendant’s counsel.  The Court declines to continue trial  for 90 days. The parties have agreed that the five-year cut-off for this action  is May 20, 2024; the parties have not stipulated to extend that deadline. The  Court will allow a short continuance to accommodate Defendant’s counsel.  Trial is CONTINUED to March 18, 2024, at  9:30 am. The final status conference is continued to March 8, 2024, at 9:30 am.  Pretrial deadlines are not extended.
