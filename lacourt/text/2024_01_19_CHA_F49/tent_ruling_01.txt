SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On August 8, 2023, this Court issued a ruling denying
Defendants Charles and Sheila Johnson’s (Defendants) motion for reconsideration
of the order granting summary adjudication on possession of the premises at
issue in this case. The Court denied their motion for reconsideration on the
basis that it did not present any new facts or law and instead tried to present
new arguments without any explanation for why they did not present those
arguments previously.
 
Plaintiff
Dunn Investment Properties, Inc. (Plaintiff) now seeks sanctions from Defendants’
counsel, Dominic J. Trutanich and Anthony M. Horiates, in the amount of
$9,840.00 for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $60.00. Plaintiff filed
this motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 128.7 and 1008 based on
Defendants’ failure to introduce any new facts or law in their motion for
reconsideration. The amount that Plaintiff seeks in sanctions is based on its
time opposing the motion for reconsideration and pursuing this motion for
sanctions.
 
No
opposition has been filed by Defendants.
 
RULING: Granted
 
Plaintiff
moves for sanctions in the amount of $9,840.00 for attorney fees and $60.00 for
costs.
 
Code
of Civil Procedure  § 1008(a) states: “When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge
or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or
revoke the prior order.” (Emphasis added.) Further, “A violation of this
section may be punished as a contempt and with sanctions as allowed by Section
128.7.” (Code of Civil Procedure § 1008(d).)
 
Code
of Civil Procedure § 128.7(b) provides that “by presenting to the court,
whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating, a pleading,
petition, written notice of motion, or other similar paper, an attorney or
unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person’s knowledge...
(1) It is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to
harass or to cause unnecessary delay… (2) [the] legal contentions therein are warranted
by existing law… (3) The allegations and other factual contentions have
evidentiary support… (4) The denials of factual contentions are warranted on
the evidence…”
 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants’ counsel have abused Code of Civil Procedure § 1008 by filing
a motion for reconsideration without a showing of “new or different facts, circumstances,
or law” as required by that section. Plaintiff further argues that Defendants’ motion
for reconsideration was filed for the improper purpose of causing delays in the
litigation in violation of Code of Civil Procedure § 128.7(b)(1); was not
supported by existing law in violation of Code of Civil Procedure § 128.7(b)(2);
and lacked evidentiary support for their allegations in violation of Section
128.7(b)(3).
 
The
Court agrees with Plaintiff’s reasoning. Sanctions should be assessed against
Defendants’ counsel pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1008 and 128.7.
 
Plaintiff
has requested $9,840.00 in sanctions for attorney fees. Plaintiff’s counsel has
a billing rate of $400.00 an hour. (Apollo Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel
represents that he spent 4.3 hours defending the Motion for Reconsideration; spent
3.8 hours drafting the instant motion; anticipated spending 2.5 hours amending
the opposition to the motion for reconsideration; anticipated spending 1.5
hours researching further law in opposition to the motion for reconsideration; anticipated
spending 4 hours traveling to and arguing at the hearing on the motion for
reconsideration; anticipates spending 4 hours traveling to and arguing at the
hearing on the instant motion; anticipates spending 4 hours to draft a reply to
the instant motion; and anticipates spending 0.5 hours discussing these
proceedings with his client. (Apollo Decl., ¶¶ 5-12.) This is 24.6 hours in
total. (Apollo Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Because
no opposition was filed to the motion for sanctions, Plaintiff has not filed a
reply. That means that Plaintiff’s counsel’s anticipated 4 hours for drafting a
reply to the instant motion can be subtracted from the amount for sanctions. That
would be 20.6 hours at $400 an hour for a total of $8,240.00 in sanctions for
attorney fees, plus $60.00 in costs.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for sanctions is granted in the total amount of $8,300.00 for attorney
fees and costs. Defendants’ counsel are ordered to pay the sum of $8,300.00 to
Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
