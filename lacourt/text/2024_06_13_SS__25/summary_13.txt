And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the demurrer filed by Defendant Prennella Johnson is overruled. The judge finds that Defendant failed to meet and confer with Plaintiff Los Angeles Federal Credit Union as required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.41. Even if the judge considered the demurrer on its merits, it would still overrule it because the Complaint has alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge orders Defendant to file an answer or responsive pleading to the Complaint within 30 days.
