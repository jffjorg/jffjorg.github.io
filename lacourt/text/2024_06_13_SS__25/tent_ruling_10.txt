 

BACKGROUND 
 
This action arises from the breach of a
promissory note.  On August 31, 2023,
Plaintiff Gitibin & Associates dba Go Rentals (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Defendant Jasmine Arora (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 to 10,
inclusive, alleging a single cause of action for common counts.  
 
On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Stipulation, Settlement, Agreement and Release (the “Agreement”), which was
entered into between Plaintiff and Defendant. 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff and
Plaintiff “agreed to accept the principal sum of $8,931.95, plus
filing fees in the sum of $450.00, plus service fees in the sum $115.50, plus
mandatory E-filing fees in the sum of $36.62, for the total sum of $9,534.07 to
be paid as follows: Defendant will make payments in the sum of $264.83
installments, beginning November 15, 2023, and continuing on the 15th day of
each and every month thereafter until paid in full.  (Agreement, ¶ 3.)  Defendant agreed to no grace period and no
notice of default and that, if payment was not received on or before the due
date as set forth in paragraph 3 of the Agreement, judgment may be entered
without notice in the sum of $8,931.95, plus court costs
including all first appearance fees and interest, less payments received.  (Id.
at ¶ 6.)  The parties agreed for the
Court to retain jurisdiction until performance in full of the Agreement
pursuant to CCP § 664.6.  (Id. at  ¶ 7.)  
 
On November 6, 2023, the Court entered an
order indicating that, pursuant to the settlement terms set forth in the
Agreement, the parties specifically request that the Court retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms
of the settlement.  (11/06/23 Order.)  The Court dismissed the case per CCP § 664.6.  (Id.)  
 
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed and
served the instant unopposed Motion to Enforce Settlement.  As of June 11, 2024, the motion is unopposed.  Any opposition to the motion was required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing.  (CCP § 1005(b).)

ANALYSIS 
 
I.                  
Enforcing the Settlement Agreement    
 
A.               
Legal Standard  
 
“Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by
entering judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1174, 1182.)  “[I]f the parties to
pending litigation enter into a settlement either in writing signed by the
parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Id.)  “The court retains jurisdiction to enforce a
settlement under the statute even after a dismissal, but only if the parties
requested such a retention of jurisdiction before the dismissal.”  (Id.)  “Such a request must  be made either in writing signed by the
parties or orally before the court.”  (Id.)  
 
“A court ruling on a motion
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement.” 
(Id.)  “A settlement is
enforceable under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material
settlement terms.” (Id.) “The court ruling on the motion may consider
the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties
agreed to.”  (Id.)  “If the court determines that the parties
entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a
formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Id.) 
Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly provides for the court to enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Id. at p. 1183.)
 
 
B.    
Discussion   
 
In support of the motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel, Jay W. Smith (“Smith”), declares that on or about October
3, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to settle this case by signing the
Agreement.  (Smith Decl., ¶ 5.)  Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff principal
sum of $8,931.95, plus filing fees in the sum of $450.00, plus service fees in
the sum $115.50, plus mandatory E-filing fees in the sum of $36.62, for the
total sum of $9,534.07 in monthly payments.  (Id. at  ¶ 5; Ex. “1.”)  Defendant made the initial payment, but she
only made three payments of $264.83 for a total amount of
$1,080.50 with the last payment having been made on February 20, 2023 and has
made no further payments since then.  (Id. at  ¶ 6.)  Counsel’s
office has not received emails from Defendant.  (Id.)  Regular and consistent efforts have been made
to encourage Defendant to complete all of the obligations under the settlement.
 (Id.)  Defendant has only paid
$1,080.50 towards the principal amount, there is now due and owing the sum of
$9,719.09.  (Id. at ¶ 7.) Counsel requests that the
Court enforce the Agreement and enter judgment against Defendant in the
principal amount of $9,534.07, plus costs in the amount of
$644.34, plus interest of 10% from August 31, 2023 through April 25, 2024 in
the sum of $621.18, less payment received in the sum of $1,080.50, for a total
judgment amount of $9,719.09.  (Id. at  ¶ 8.)  
 
 The Court finds that it
has authority to enforce the Agreement pursuant to Hines v. Lukes, supra,
167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.  Plaintiff
and Defendant signed the Agreement.  The
Court also has jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement as the parties explicitly
requested that the Court would retain jurisdiction to enforce such agreement.  The Court furthermore determines that the
parties entered into a valid and binding agreement.  The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel sets
forth the terms of the settlement and indicates that Defendant has breached the
Agreement.  
 
However, the Court notes the
Agreement provides that in the event of default, judgment may be entered against
Defendant “without notice in the sum of $8,931.95, plus court costs including
all first appearance fees and interest, less payments received.”  (Smith Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. “1” at ¶ 6.)  Counsel’s declaration does not indicate any
first appearance fees that were incurred. 
Defendant has made payments totaling $1,080.50.  (Smith Decl., ¶ 8.)  Further, counsel’s declaration provides costs
in the amount of $644.34, plus interest of 10% from August 31, 2023 through
April 25, 2024 in the sum of $621.18.  (Id.)  As such, the Court will enter judgment in the amount of $9,116.97,which
represents the among of judgment the Court can enter pursuant to the Agreement,
which is $8,931.95, plus costs in the amount of $644.34, plus
interest of 10% from August 31, 2023 through April 25, 2024 in the sum of
$621.18, less payment received in the sum of $1,080.50.  (Smith Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. “1” at ¶ 6.)  
 
The Motion to Enforce
Settlement Agreement is therefore GRANTED IN PART. The Court will enforce the
Agreement and enter judgment thereto but only in the amount of $9,116.97 pursuant
to the Court’s discussion above.  
 
II.        Conclusion  
 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED IN PART. The Court will enforce the Agreement and
enter judgment thereto but only in the amount of $9,116.97 pursuant to the
Court’s discussion above.  
 
The Dismissal entered on 11/06/2023 is set aside and
vacated.
 
 
The Moving party is
ordered to give notice and to attach a copy of the Court's Tentative Ruling, as
an exhibit “A” to said notice, as the final order of the Court.
