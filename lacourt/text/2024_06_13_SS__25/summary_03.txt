Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The plaintiff, Scot L. Bennett, is seeking to set aside the dismissal of his lawsuit against the defendants, Luis Hernandez, Damien Hernandez, John Koutsoukos, and Jane Doe Koutsoukos. The plaintiff alleges that he was not given sufficient notice of the dismissal and that his failure to appear at trial was due to his illness. The court denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal, citing his failure to comply with the court's order and his failure to provide evidence to support his claims.
