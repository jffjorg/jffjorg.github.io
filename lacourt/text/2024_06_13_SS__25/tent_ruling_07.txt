BACKGROUND
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Antonio
Hernandez Perez aka Antonio Hernandez Perez (“Defendant” or “Perez”) and Yulsa
Gonzales aka Yulis Asucely Escobar Gonzalez (collectively “Defendants”) for
subrogation to recover $8,655.16 in damages.  On December 11, 2023, Defendants filed their
Answer. 
 
            Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (the “Motion”) as to Defendant Perez on
April 23, 2024.  No opposition has been
filed as of June 11, 2024.
            
ANALYSIS
 
I.                   
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
A. Requests for
Admission 
 
A party must respond to requests for admissions within 30
days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)  “If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives
any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Id.
at subd. (b).)  A motion dealing with the
failure to respond, rather than with inadequate responses, does not require the
requesting party to meet and confer with the responding party. (Deymer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4 [disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973]. There is no time limit within which a motion to have matters deemed
admitted must be made. (Brigante v. Huang
(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1585.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel served Defendant Perez with
Requests for Admission, Set One, on January 5, 2024 via electronic service.  (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 1., Ex. “A.”)  Defendant’s responses became due 32 days
later on February 8, 2024.  (Id. at ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff granted an extension to respond by
April 16, 2024, but Defendant has not served responses upon Plaintiff as of the
date of this Motion.  (Id.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the
Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
 
B. Request for
Sanctions  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  Furthermore, it is “mandatory that the Court
impose a monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
            The Court finds Defendant’s failure
to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery request a misuse of the discovery process.  In addition, the Court is required to impose a
monetary sanction on Defendant for his failure to respond to the Requests for
Admission under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).
 
            Plaintiff seeks sanctions of $460.00
based on two hours of attorney time billed at $200.00 per hour and one filing
fee of $60.00.  (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 6.)  However, the amount sought is excessive given
the simplicity of this Motion and the lack of opposition and reply.  The Court finds $360.00 based on 1.5 hours of
attorney time and one filing fee, to be reasonable.  Sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff’s
counsel within thirty (30) days of notice of this order. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admissions Admitted is GRANTED.  
 
Plaintiff’s request for Sanctions is
also GRANTED in the amount of $360.00 to be paid by Defendant Antonio Hernandez
Perez within thirty (30) days of notice of this Court’s order.
 
The Moving party is ordered to give notice
and to attach a copy of the Court's Tentative Ruling, as an exhibit “A” to said
notice, as the final order of the Court.
