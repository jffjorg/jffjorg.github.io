  Case Number:  23VECV02505    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  T LEVI V KEYES 23VECV02505
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendants Hyundai Motor America and Keyes Hyundai of Van Nuys’s Motion
to Strike the First Amended Complaint is DENIED.  
Defendants Hyundai Motor America and Keyes Hyundai of Van
Nuys are provided 20 days to file a response to only the second cause of action
for negligent misrepresentation alleged in the First Amended Complaint.  
Introduction 
Defendants Hyundai Motor America (HMA) and Keyes Hyundai of
Van Nuys (Keyes) (collectively, Defendants) moved to strike Plaintiff Liel
Levi’s (Plaintiff) First Amended Complaint (FAC).  Plaintiff’s opposition was due May 10, 2024
and it was filed late on May 13, 2024.
Discussion 
On February 7, 2024, the Court issued its ruling on the
demurrer to the Complaint.  The Court
mailed its ruling on the same day.  In
relevant part, the Court sustained and granted 20 days leave to amend as to the
second cause of action (COA) for negligent misrepresentation.  Plaintiff’s leave to amend expired on March
4, 2024.  The deadline was calculated as
20 days from February 7, 2024 plus five days for mailing.  Twenty-five days from February 7, 2024 lands
on Sunday, March 3, 2024.  The deadline
being a Sunday requires the deadline to be moved to the following Court day,
which was Monday, March 4, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed their First Amended Complaint (FAC) on March 14, 2024 –
ten days untimely.  There exists grounds
to strike the FAC.  
The Court’s authority to strike the untimely pleading is
discretionary.  (Brown v. Brown (1959)
169 Cal.App.2d 54, 57;  Gitmed v. General
Motors Corp. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 824, 828.) 
Plaintiff submitted the declaration of Counsel asserting his neglect and
mea culpa in the untimely filing.  (Jacob
Partiyeli Decl. par. 7.)  Because it was
Counsel’s mistake in untimely filing the FAC and there is no prejudice to
Defendants, the Court exercises it’s discretion to allow the untimely filing of
the FAC (as well as the opposition to the instant motion WHICH WAS ALSO LATE).
The motion to strike the FAC is DENIED.  
With the viability of the FAC and review of the
demurrer to the Answer concurrently being heard this date, the Court notes that
Defendants have not yet responded/tested the pleading of the newly alleged
second cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.  Defendants are granted leave to file a
response to the second cause of action in the FAC.
