"In this case, Bagdasaryan v GM, the court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel documents in deposition notice of PMQ. The court grants the motion to produce documents, but with some limitations. The court requires the production of specific documents within 10 days, with verification that all responsive documents are being produced. The court also strikes any general objections and finds that the term 'ALL documents' is overbroad and only means the actual documents listed. The court denies the request to produce attorney-client and attorney work product. The court grants the motion in part, requiring the production of specific documents, and denies it in part, excluding attorney-client and attorney work product."
