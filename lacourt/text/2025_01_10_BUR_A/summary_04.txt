And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a cause of action for Premises Liability and to bolster allegations in support of her Negligence cause of action. The motion is granted because the plaintiff has shown that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper, and that it does not cause prejudice to the defendants. The judge notes that the defendants have not opposed the motion, and that the proposed amendment is related to the original complaint. The plaintiff is ordered to file her Third Amended Complaint within 10 court days.
