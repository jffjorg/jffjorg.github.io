California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) whereby notice of intent to appear
is requested.  Unless the Court directs argument in the Tentative Ruling,
no argument is required and any party seeking argument should notify all other
parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the
party’s intention to appear and argue.  The tentative ruling will become
the ruling of the court if no argument is received.

DISCUSSION:
 
Complete Merchant Services, Inc.
(Plaintiff) brings this action against Signature
Payments, LLC (Defendant). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant,
an Independent Sales Organization (ISO), improperly transferred a merchant account, attributable to merchant
Digica, Inc. (Digica). Plaintiff argues that this transfer has resulted in
Defendant’s refusal to pay Plaintiff residuals owned under their agency
contract. 
 
Before the Court is Plaintiff’s “Motion to Compel Further Discovery
Responses”. The Court finds this one motion is actually three motions
improperly presented as one. Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to
their Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production,
yet they have made only one reservation and paid only one filing fee. The Court
finds this improper for the various reasons stated below. 
 
First, moving party is obligated to pay an additional $120 in filing
fees.  combining motions to compel
further responses in this way deprives the Court of $120 in filing fees which
it would otherwise be entitled to. Second, combining multiple motions to compel
unfairly cuts in line in front of litigants who follow the Court's guidelines
and reserve separate hearings for each motion to compel further responses.
Third, combining multiple motions into a single filing does not provide
adequate notice to the Court for allocation of time and its resources when a
reservation which appears to be for a single motion to compel further responses
is in fact three such motions. 
 
Given the circumstances, the Court is inclined to continue this combined
motion to January 24, 2025. 
 
Plaintiff is to pay an
additional $120 in filing fees and file proof
of such payment within 7 days of the date of this order. Failure to pay the additional filing fees will result in all but
one motion being taken off calendar.
 
No further briefs will be permitted.
 
The Court cautions that future violations of this policy may result in
motions being taken off calendar, the imposition of sanctions, or both.
