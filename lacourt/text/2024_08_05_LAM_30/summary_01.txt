And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in regards to the demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendants, Rochelle Sterling, Donald T. Sterling, and Beverly Hills Properties, LLC. The court has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendants to answer within 10 days. The court has found that the plaintiff, Hong, has sufficiently pleaded the causes of action and that the defendants have been properly joined. The court has also found that the allegations of financial elder abuse are sufficient to state a claim. The court has rejected the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff's employer is mis-joined and that the elder abuse statute was never intended to protect against wage and employment claims.
