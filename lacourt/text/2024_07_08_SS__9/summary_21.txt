And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and outlines the next steps for the Petitioner. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
