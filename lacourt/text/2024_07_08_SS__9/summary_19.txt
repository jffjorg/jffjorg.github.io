This tentative ruling grants the petition and outlines the procedure for the hearing on July 8, 2024. The Petitioner must review the new name on the proposed decree to ensure it is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not accurate, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Additionally, the Judge notes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
