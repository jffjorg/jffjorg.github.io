And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a petition for a name change. The judge grants the petition, but with certain conditions. The petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is correct and legible, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
