 Case Number:  24STCP01400    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  9 



Petitioner has failed to provide any form of
  identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for
  Probation/the Court to run a criminal history assessment.  Petitioner must provide the Name Change Clerk
  with some form of identification verified by a fingerprint to enable the Name
  Change Clerk to run a criminal history assessment.  Petitioner may do this by any of the
  following options:
(1) providing a California driver license
  number or California id number (Petitioner may apply for and obtain a new
  California id or California driver license and provide such information to
  The Court Clerk);
(2) providing The Court Clerk with a driver
  license number or DMV-issued id number from another state and identifying the
  state that issued the driver license or id; or
(3) contacting the Name Change Clerk in the
  Clerk’s Office, who can provide instructions on how Petitioner may have
  fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan and results sent
  to the Court Clerk.
The petition is continued to October 7, 2024
  at 9:30 am to enable Petitioner to pursue one of these three options.  If Petitioner fails to follow these
  instructions and provide sufficient information to run a criminal history
  assessment prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and
  dismissed without prejudice.
The Name Change Clerk is ordered to run and
  complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.
Court Clerk to give notice.
