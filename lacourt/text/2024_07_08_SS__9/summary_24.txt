If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing with a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
