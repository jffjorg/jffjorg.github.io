And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition and outlined the process for naming a new name on the proposed decree. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
