And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a name change petition. The petitioner has failed to provide any form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for the court to run a criminal history assessment. The judge has ordered the petitioner to provide some form of identification verified by a fingerprint, which can be done through one of three options: providing a California driver's license number or ID number, providing a driver's license number or ID number from another state, or having fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan and results sent to the court clerk. The petition is continued to October 7, 2024, at 9:30 am to enable the petitioner to pursue one of these options. If the petitioner fails to comply, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The judge has also ordered the Name Change Clerk to run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.
