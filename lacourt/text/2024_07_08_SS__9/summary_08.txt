And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition for name change, but has some conditions attached. The petitioner must review the proposed decree with the new name to ensure that it is legible and correctly spelled. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. If the new name is legible and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
