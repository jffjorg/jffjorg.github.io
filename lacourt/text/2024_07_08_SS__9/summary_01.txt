And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling outlining the next steps in the case. The parties have agreed to produce certain documents, including different versions of arbitration agreements, exemplars of each version with personal identifying information redacted, and information about the number of putative class members who signed and opted out of the agreements. The plaintiff will examine these documents to determine whether to dismiss the class allegations without prejudice. The parties will then meet and confer regarding the plaintiff's potential willingness to dismiss the class allegations and the defendant's responses to requests for admissions. A joint status report will be filed by August 8, 2024, regarding the parties' meet and confer efforts. The informal discovery conference is continued until August 15, 2024, at 2 pm, and discovery will be stayed until then. The parties have a dispute regarding the deadline for the plaintiff to move to compel further responses to requests for admissions and whether any such motion would be untimely.
