 Case Number:  24STCP01430    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  9 The Petition for Change of Name is GRANTED as all requirements have been satisfied.
 
However, as the March 25, 2024 order (the Honorable Michelle Williams Court presiding) notes, Petitioner is a vexatious litigant, and the instant name change will not alter Petitioner’s status as a vexatious litigant.
 
Pursuant to the  March 25, 2024 order, the Court Clerk shall give notice to all of the following: (1) Petitioner, (2) Department 1, and (3) the Judicial Council (including at  VexatiousLitigantGroup@jud.ca.gov) so that the Judicial Council may update the prefiling order and entry on the vexatious litigant list.
