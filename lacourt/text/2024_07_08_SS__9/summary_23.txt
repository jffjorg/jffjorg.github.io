The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition for a name change. The Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
