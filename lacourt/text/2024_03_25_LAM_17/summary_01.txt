Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action for elder abuse and wrongful death. The judge has given the plaintiff 15 days to amend their complaint. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice and found that the plaintiff's complaint is a "sham pleading" because it omits important facts about the decedent's care and treatment. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's opposition does not provide a substantive argument to explain the omission of these facts. The motion to strike is moot because the demurrer is sustained.
