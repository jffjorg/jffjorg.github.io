  Case Number:  20STCV40085    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior  Court of CaliforniaCounty of  Los Angeles DEPARTMENT 17 TENTATIVE  RULING     MARION    NEWMAN, et al.,             vs.   KND DEVELOPMENT 52, LLC, et al.      Case No.:     20STCV40085        Hearing Date:  March 25, 2024               Defendant’s  demurrer is SUSTAINED with 15 days leave to amend.             Accordingly,  Defendant’s motion to strike is MOOT.              On  October 19, 2020, Plaintiffs Marion Newman, by and through her  Successor-in-Interest, Tiffany Newman, and Tiffany Newman (collectively  “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendant KND Development 52, LLC dba  Kindred Hospital Baldwin Park (“KND”) for (1) elder abuse (pursuant to Welfare  and Institutions Code § 15600, et seq.) and (2) wrongful death.  The complaint also named Debbie Newman, Donna  Shelvin, Wesley Newman, Marion Newman, Christine Newman, and Jill Newman as  nominal defendants.  On May 12, 2022, Plaintiffs  filed an amendment to complaint, substituting in Pomona Valley Hospital Medical  Center (“Defendant”) for Doe 2. The operative Third Amended  Complaint (“TAC”) filed on January 19, 2024 alleges the same causes of action. Defendant Pomona Valley  Hospital Medical Center now demurs to both causes of action in the TAC and  moves to portions of the TAC.  Legal Standard A  demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the  allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles  Dept. of Water and Power¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In  a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading  or via proper judicial notice.¿ (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)  116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿ “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and  not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ Therefore, it lies only  where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially  noticed.”¿ (SKF  Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)¿  “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it  stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿ (Hahn,  supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) Discussion  I.                    Judicial Notice Defendant’s request for  judicial notice is GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) II.                Sham Pleading The Court previously  sustained the demurrer based in part on it being a sham pleading. The Court  stated:  First, Plaintiff has not  alleged facts which could show that Defendant’s conduct caused Plaintiff’s  injury five month later. Rather, inexplicably, Plaintiff’s SAC entirely omits  the allegation that Decedent was discharged from Defendant’s care, and was  admitted to Pomona Valley Rehabilitation Center, not a party to this action,  for skilled nursing care. The Court agrees with Defendant that this omission  gives the appearance that Decedent was under the care of Defendant the entire  time until she was admitted to Co-Defendant Baldwin Park on 3/25/2020. As such,  “[t]his omission is not trivial or minor; it is a major inconsistency that  Plaintiffs fail to explain. The omission of these allegations without any  explanation as to why Plaintiffs did not make these allegations in earlier  pleadings, or any explanation of the inconsistencies, renders the SAC a sham  pleading. (Motion, 13: 7-10.)  Plaintiff must set forth  facts to explain the omission of the allegation that Decedent was actually  discharged from Defendant's facility and was admitted to an entirely different  facility - not a party to this action -before she was ever admitted to Baldwin  Park. . . . In sum, Plaintiff must set  forth: (1) facts to explain the omission of the allegation that Decedent was  discharged from Defendant’s care and admitted to Pomona Valley Rehabilitation  Center prior to her admission to Baldwin Park; (2) facts which could show a causal  connection between the alleged skin breakdown in Defendant’s care and her  eventual death while in the care of another facility; and (3) facts which could  show that the requisite custodial relationship existed.” (1/3/24 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs now allege that “NEWMAN  entered Pomona Valley Rehabilitation Center for wound-care and rehabilitation  on February 22, 2020,” and that “[o]n March 13, 2020, Pomona Valley Rehab  transferred NEWMAN to San Gabriel Valley Medical Center for ongoing wound care  for her infected pressure injuries.” (TAC, ¶¶ 55, 57.) “On or about March 25,  2020 NEWMAN was admitted to KINDRED from San Gabriel Valley Medical Center for  continuation of her care.” (TAC, ¶ 58.) However, the TAC also alleges that “[f]rom  February 22, 2020 through March 25, 2020, POMONA’s staff on many occasions  failed to inspect NEWMAN’s skin for breakdown as required by her care plan.”  (TAC, ¶ 51.) Plaintiffs further allege that “[f]rom February 4, 2020, through  March 25, 2020, POMONA’s repositioning records show POMONA’s nursing staff  repositioned NEWMAN sporadically or not at all.” (TAC, ¶ 52.) Based on these  allegations, it is still unclear how Defendant’s conduct caused Plaintiff’s  injury five month later. Plaintiffs’ allegations still give the appearance that  Decedent was under the care of Defendant the entire time until she was admitted  to Co-Defendant Baldwin Park on 3/25/2020. The allegations do not explain why Defendant’s  staff was required to inspect or reposition Decedent until 3/25/2020 even  though she was under the care of other facilities. Plaintiffs’ opposition  provides no substantive argument on this issue. Accordingly, the same  deficiencies still remain without further explanation.The Court notes that  Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts now to show the requisite custodial  relationship for an elder abuse claim. (FAC, ¶34.) Accordingly,  the demurrer to the TAC is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. The motion to strike is moot.   Dated: March 25, 2024                                                                                                                                                Hon.
