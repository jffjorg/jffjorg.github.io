Summary:

The judge denied Defendant Abshah's motion for a protective order to confirm the automatic stay of all proceedings, including discovery, pending the appeal of the denial of an anti-SLAPP motion. The court found that there is no authority to support staying discovery pending the appeal of a denial of an anti-SLAPP motion, and that the parties' reliance on Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino was misplaced.
