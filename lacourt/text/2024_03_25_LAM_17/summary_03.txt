Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling denies Yassine Amallal's motion for reconsideration of the court's November 22, 2023 order denying his motion for summary judgment. The court finds that Amallal's motion for reconsideration is based on a misinterpretation of the law and fails to present new or different facts or circumstances. The court also finds that Amallal's evidence does not support his claim that he was not an employee of 26 Center and that he did not exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions of Plaintiff. The court finds that Amallal was involved in the determination of Plaintiff's work schedule and pay rate and that he was a corporate employee of 26 Center, creating a triable issue of material fact as to whether Amallal was a managing agent.
