Legal Standard
 
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may
make an order compelling responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that
fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including
ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to
compel further responses, a motion to
compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding
party has no meet and confer obligations. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 404.)
 
Where
the court grants a motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel,
unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).) The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery even though no
opposition to the motion was filed or where the requested discovery was
provided after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Discussion 
 
On June 30, 2023, Defendant
propounded the subject discovery on Plaintiff. (Nathanson Decls., ¶3, Exh. 1.)
On August 10, 2023, defense counsel’s office sent a letter to Plaintiff’s
counsel requesting answers within 5 days. (Id. at ¶4, Exh. 2.) As of the
date of filing the motions, no responses have been received. (Id. at
¶4.) Plaintiff has not opposed any of the motions. 
 
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED. Sanctions are granted in the amount of $255 for each
motion. (Nathanson Decls., ¶5.)
