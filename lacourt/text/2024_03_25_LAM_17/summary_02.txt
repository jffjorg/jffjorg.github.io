And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants defendant's motions to compel plaintiff's responses to discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, despite being given an opportunity to do so. As a result, the court imposes sanctions in the amount of $255 for each motion. The plaintiff has 20 days to respond to the discovery requests, and the sanctions are payable within 60 days. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not opposed any of the motions, and therefore, the motions are granted as requested.
