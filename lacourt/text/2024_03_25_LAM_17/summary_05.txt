Significant Statements:
  - "The focus of the minimum contacts analysis is the defendant's contacts with the forum."
  - "In the absence of a voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that court's personal jurisdiction over a defendant."
  - "When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service."
  - "The evidence submitted by Defendant does not support a finding of personal jurisdiction over it in this case."
