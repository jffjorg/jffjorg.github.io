And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Medina Law Firm has filed two motions to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs GLORIA ESCOBAR and JOSE VALDEZ. The firm has been unable to communicate with the clients and the attorney-client relationship has broken down. According to the firm, the clients do not respond to communications, and despite repeated efforts, the firm has been unable to verify the clients' last known address. The court finds that the firm has presented cognizable grounds for withdrawal, including a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the clients' noncooperation. Since no opposing papers have been filed showing any prejudice to the clients, the motions are granted, and the court will sign the proposed orders submitted by counsel.
