 Case Number:  22STCV23653    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
 Motion of the Medina Law Firm to be
Relieved as Counsel of Record- Civil.  Motion
of the Medina Law Firm to be Relieved as Counsel of Record- Civil.  
Plaintiffs LEO GONZALEZ et al. are tenants at 625 S.
Burlington Ave., Los Angeles, and filed this case for damages for allegedly uninhabitable
conditions at the property. Now, in two motions, the Medina Law Firm requests
to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs GLORIA ESCOBAR and JOSE
VALDEZ. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” 
Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112 Cal. App. 4th 1161, 1173. The form notices,
declarations, proposed orders, and proof of service comply with the
requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel. See CRC Rule 3.1362. Moving counsel’s declarations state that the
clients do not respond to communications so counsel cannot advocate for them in
the case and there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship,
and that counsel has been unable, despite repeated efforts, to verify the clients’
last known address is current. Moving counsel’s declaration shows cognizable
grounds for withdrawal:

Breakdown
     in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash).  Estate of Falco v. Decker (1987)
     188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.
Client
     by conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out
     the employment effectively (e.g., noncooperation or
     noncommunication).  Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(4).  

No opposing papers have been filed showing any
prejudice to the clients.  See 
Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(d). 

Therefore, the motions are granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed orders submitted by counsel.
