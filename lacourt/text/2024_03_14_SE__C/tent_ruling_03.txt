CASE NO.: 21NWCV00477
HEARING:  03/14/24
 
#6
 
Defendants JORGE CHAVEZ; LUZ CHAVEZ; and JASMIN CHAVEZ’s Motion to
Dismiss is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Defendants JORGE CHAVEZ; LUZ CHAVEZ and JASMIN CHAVEZ (“Defendants”) move to dismiss the Second
Amended Complaint based on the statute of limitations for fraud under CCP
§338(d).
 
No Opposition has
been filed as of March 11, 2024. 
 
The Motion to
Dismiss is DENIED on procedural grounds. 
CCP §581 sets forth grounds
for dismissal, none of which relate to the statute of limitations.  
 
The Court’s denial
is without prejudice to Defendants from re-asserting these same arguments via a
different procedural vehicle—e.g. Demurrer, Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings, or Motion for Summary Judgment.
