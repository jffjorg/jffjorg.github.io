Defendant/Cross-Complainant OLIVIA SAAVEDRA’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This action concerning real property was filed on June 29,
2022. 
 
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff CARLOS S. VARGAS, JR.
(“Plaintiff”) and Defendant OLIVIA SAAVEDRA (“Defendant”) are siblings.
(Complaint ¶7.) “In or around
August 11, 1992, Elvira Vargas [mother of Plaintiff and Defendant] and
Plaintiff CARLOS S. VARGAS, JR. obtained title to the Subject Property as joint-tenants.”
(Complaint ¶8.) “However, in or around September 24, 2019, Elvira Vargas
affirmatively severed the joint tenancy between herself and Plaintiff CARLOS S.
VARGAS JR. and conveyed her 50% interest in the Subject Property to herself, in
her capacity as the Trustee of the Elvira S. Vargas Living Trust, dated
September 24, 2019….” (Complaint ¶11.) “Thereafter, in or around January 25,
2020, Plaintiff CARLOS S. VARGAS, JR. conveyed his 50% interest in the Subject
Property to himself, in his capacity as the Trustee of The Carlos Santillan
Vargas and ORTENCIA Vargas Living Trust….” (Complaint ¶16.) Elvira Vargas is
deceased. (Complaint ¶19.)
 
The Complaint asserts the following causes of action: 
(1) Partition
and Sale of Real Property; 
(2) Accounting;

(3) Quiet
Title; 
(4) Cancellation
of Instruments; 
(5) Declaratory
Relief; 
(6) Financial
Elder Abuse; and 
(7) Unjust
Enrichment 
 
Defendant OLIVIA SAAVEDRA moves for judgment on the
pleadings as to the entire Complaint on the basis that Plaintiff lacks standing
to assert these causes of action. 
 
Standing
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert any
claims because they have an adequate remedy in Probate Court. 
Every action must, except as otherwise expressly authorized
by law, be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. (CCP §367; Killian
v. Millard (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1601, 1605.) 
 
          Sixth
Cause of Action – Financial Elder Abuse 
 
“After the death of the elder or dependent adult, the right
to commence or maintain an [elder abuse] action shall pass to the personal
representative of the decedent. If there is no personal representative, the
right to commence or maintain an action shall pass to any of the following, if
the requirements of Section 377.32 of the Code of Civil Procedure are met:
(A) An intestate heir whose interest is affected by the action. (B) The
decedent’s successor in interest… (C) An interested person, as defined in Section
48 of the Probate Code….” (emphasis added) (Cal. Wel. & Inst. Code
§15657.3(d).)  CCP §377.32 requires a person seeking to proceed as
successor in interest to file a declaration setting forth certain facts.  The Court has reviewed the case file. To
date, no declaration in compliance with CCP §377.32 has been filed. As such, Plaintiff
fails to adequately plead standing to assert a claim for financial elder abuse
at this time. 
 
The
motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the sixth cause of action is GRANTED
without leave to amend. 
 
First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh
Causes of Action 
 
“(a) The [Probate] court having jurisdiction over the trust
pursuant to this part has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings concerning the
internal affairs of the trusts. (b) The superior court having jurisdiction over
the trust pursuant to this part has concurrent jurisdiction of the following:
(1) Actions and proceedings to determine the existence of trusts; (2) Actions
and proceedings by or against creditors or debtors of trusts. (3) Other actions
and proceedings involving trustees and third persons.” (Cal. Prob. Code §17000.)
The Probate Court has complete and exclusive jurisdiction over property of the
estate, all persons claiming interests in the decedent’s estate, and all
matters involved in a complete and effective administration of the estate,
which include the probate of wills. (See Cal. Prob. Code §7050; Morrison v.
Kaufman (1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 280, 281.) “It is the general rule in
California that the superior court sitting in probate has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine the persons and share that each has in the estate of
a decedent. (Howard v. Bennett (1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 546, 548.) 
 
“Proceedings concerning the internal affairs of a trust
include, but are not limited to, proceedings for any of the following purposes:
(1) Determining questions of construction of a trust instrument. (2)
Determining the existence of nonexistence of any immunity, power, privilege,
duty, or right. (3) Determining the validity of a trust provision. (4) Ascertaining
beneficiaries and determining to whom property shall pass or be delivered upon
final or partial termination of the trust, to the extent the determination is
not made by the trust instrument. (5) Settling the accounts and passing upon
the acts of the trustee, including the exercise of discretionary powers. (6)
Instructing the trust. (7) Compelling the trustee to [do certain acts.]”
(emphasis added.) (Cal. Prob. Code §17200(b.) “Internal trust affairs, for
example, include modification of the terms of the trust, changes in a
designated successor, trustee, other deviations from trust provisions,
authority over the trustee’s acts, or the administration of the trust’s
financial arrangements.” (Harnedy v. Whitty (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1333,
1345 [quoting Estate of Mullins (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 924, 931.].) 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to obtain title to the Subject
Property, which is purportedly held in the Carlos Trust and the Elvira Trusts.
Consequently, Plaintiff’s claims involve the internal affairs of the trusts,
and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court. 
 
Moreover, as indicated above, Plaintiff has not filed a
declaration under CCP §377.32 stating that Plaintiff is the Decedent’s
successor in interest. (CCP §377.32(5)(A).) “[A] trustee or beneficiary of a
trust may petition the court… concerning the internal affairs of the trust or
to determine the existence of the trust.” (Cal. Prob. Code §17200(a).) 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff does not substantively address
Defendant’s arguments pertaining to standing. Standing is a threshold issue
that must be resolved before reaching the merits of an action. (See Blumhorst
v. Jewish Family Services of Los Angeles (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 993,
1000.)  
 
The motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED as to
all claims.
 
The Motion is GRANTED without leave to amend, without
prejudice to Plaintiff from re-filing this Cross-Complaint in the Probate
Department.
