And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's ex parte application for a preliminary injunction and order to show cause re: preliminary injunction. The Plaintiff alleged that the Subject Property is the subject of an ongoing probate case involving the property of Decedent Katharine Dodd. The Judge ruled that the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction over the property of the estate, all persons claiming interests in the decedent's estate, and all matters involved in a complete and effective administration of the estate, including the probate of wills. The Judge cited various California laws and court cases to support this ruling, including Howard v. Bennett, Spencer v. Crocker First Nat. Bank of San Francisco, and Colden v. Costello. The Judge ordered the Moving Party to give notice of the denial.
