```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for entry of judgment in favor of All-Ways Far East, LLC and All-Ways Forwarding International, Inc. The plaintiff argued that these entities should be required to submit a proposed judgment, as they had successfully moved for summary judgment and had not submitted a proposed judgment in their favor. The opposing party argued that entry of judgment at this time is premature and would violate the one final judgment rule.

The judge found that all issues between All-Ways Far East, LLC and All-Ways Forwarding International, Inc. have been resolved, and therefore, the court has discretion to render judgment in their favor. However, the judge declined to exercise this discretion, citing the possibility of multiple, successive appeals on identical legal issues if judgment were entered in favor of these entities at this time. Instead, the judge will allow a single appeal of the September 2023 summary judgment order to proceed.
