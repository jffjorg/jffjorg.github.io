Matthew
B. Dart and Dart Law’s unopposed motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Defendant
SNAIL GAMES USA INC. is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as March 11, 2024.       
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that Dart Law’s continued representation would serve the interests of
justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED. 

 
The
Court notes that a Notice of Stay of Proceedings as to Defendant INDIEV, Inc.
was entered on October 3, 2023. This action is stayed as to Defendant Indiev,
Inc.
