 Case Number:  24NWCV00620    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  C Ferrill v. Newsom
24NWCV00620
Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for a
Preliminary Injunction and Order to Show Cause Re: Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.
Plaintiff alleges that the Subject Property is the the subject of an ongoing
probate case involving property of Decedent Katharine Dodd.  (Complaint
Par. 17-18.) “It is the general rule in
California that the superior court sitting in probate has exclusive
jurisdiction to determine the persons and share that each has in the estate of
a decedent.”  (Howard v. Bennett (1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 546,
548.)  “‘The Probate Code provides one comprehensive, exclusive
method for administration upon the estate of decedents.’”  (Spencer v.
Crocker First Nat. Bank of San Francisco (1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 397, 401
(quoting Colden v. Costello (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 363, 370).) 
“‘The proceeding is in rem and the jurisdiction of the court is
complete over the property of the estate and over all persons claiming
interests therein under the decedent, as to all matters involved in a complete
and effective administration.’”  (Id. (quoting Colden,
supra, 50 Cal.App.2d at 370).) The Probate Court has complete and
exclusive jurisdiction over property of the estate, all persons claiming
interests in the decedent’s estate, and all matters involved in a complete and
effective administration of the estate, which include the probate of
wills. (See Prob. Code, § 7050; Morrison v. Kaufman (1945) 68
Cal.App.2d 280, 281; Colden v. Costello (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 363,
370.) Moving Party to give notice.
