And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies defendant City of Downey's motion to compel various medical providers to produce billing records. The defendant issued subpoenas to the medical providers seeking documents and records reflecting amounts billed to patients referred by the Wilshire Law Firm. The Judge finds that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the billing records are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this case. The Judge relies on the case of Qaadir v. Figueroa, which held that referral evidence is relevant to the question of the reasonable value of the lien-physicians' medical care. The Judge notes that the defendant fails to cite authority requiring production of billing records and that the value in billing records for non-party patients is speculative. The motions to compel are denied, and the plaintiff is required to give notice.
