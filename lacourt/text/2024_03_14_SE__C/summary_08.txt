And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the default judgment entered against Lone Oak is not void, as it was properly served electronically. Lone Oak had argued that the default was void because the Cross-Complaint was never served on their attorneys, but the judge found that the Cross-Complaint was served on John Narcise, a paralegal at Lone Oak's counsel's firm, and that Lone Oak admits receipt of the Cross-Complaint.

The judge also ruled that Lone Oak's failure to defend the Cross-Complaint was caused by excusable neglect, and that Lone Oak timely sought relief. However, the judge denied relief under CCP §473.5(b) because Lone Oak did not attach a copy of its Answer or other responsive pleading to the motion.

The judge ordered the matter continued to April 18, 2024, and instructed Lone Oak to file and serve an amended motion with a responsive pleading by April 11, 2024. The judge also denied, without prejudice, Lone Oak's request to dissolve the temporary restraining order.
