Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant OLIVIA SAAVEDRA's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The judge finds that Plaintiff CARLOS S. VARGAS, JR. lacks standing to assert the causes of action alleged in the Complaint. The judge determines that the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction over the internal affairs of the trusts and that the Plaintiff's claims involve the internal affairs of the trusts. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to file a declaration under CCP §377.32 stating that Plaintiff is the Decedent's successor in interest. Therefore, the judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to all claims. The judge notes that the Plaintiff may re-file the Cross-Complaint in the Probate Department without prejudice.
