  Case Number:  21CHCV00269    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    5/14/24     Case    Name: Kelly Condon, Caroline Condon, v. Ryan Culver Ealing, Adriana    Velasquesz Vacca, and Does 1-10     Case    # 21CHCV00269      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MAY 14, 2024    MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED  COMPLAINT  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 21CHCV00269    Motion  filed: 3/13/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Kelly  Condon and Caroline Condon (“Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants” or “Condons”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Complainants Ryan  Culver Ealing and Adriana Velasquesz Vacca (“Defendants/Cross-Complainants” or  “Ealing/Vacca”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order granting Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants leave to file their Third Amended  Complaint.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED.   BACKGROUND   This  action arises out of a dispute between neighboring landowners regarding the  existence, use, maintenance, and control of an easement (as defined below, the  “West Disputed Easement”). Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants are the owners of 35646  Dormer Road, Agua Dulce 91390 (the “Condon Property”). The legal description of  the Condon Property provides that it is comprised of “Parcel 3 of Map No.  8384." (Condons Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. “A”). Parcel Map 8384  shows a 30-foot-wide strip of the westerly boundary of the Condon Property  delineated as “Dormer (Private and Future Street) Road” for use by the owners  of real property in Parcel Map 8384 (the “East Easement” which is not in  dispute). (Id., Ex. “C.”) Defendants/Cross-Complainants Ealing/Vacca are  the owners of 9505 Hierba Road, Agua Dulce 91390 (the “Ealing/Vacca Property”).  (Condons Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. “B”). The top northeasterly boundary  of the Ealing/Vacca Property adjoins almost the entirety of the westerly  boundary of the Condon Property. (Id., Ex. “C.”) Per the legal  description of the Ealing/Vacca Property on their 2019 deed, it is “Parcel 1 of  Parcel Map No. 10382.” Parcel Map No. 10382 shows a 30-foot-wide strip of the  easterly boundary of the Ealing/Vacca Property delineated as “Dormer (Private  and Future Street) Road” for the owners of real property in Parcel Map 10382 (“West  Disputed Easement”). (Condons Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. “D”).   On April 6, 2021, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants initiated  this action against Defendants/Cross-Complainants and Does 1 through 10. The  original Complaint alleged causes of action for (1) Preliminary and Permanent  Injunction, (2) Nuisance, (3) Abatement of Interference and Obstruction of  Private/Public Easement, and (4) Abatement of Private/Public Nuisance - Change  in Grading of Adjoining Property Causing Water, Soil and Debris Deposits on  Plaintiffs’ Property.   On  July 1, 2021, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed a First Amended Complaint,  containing the following causes of action: (1) Interference with Easement, (2)  Nuisance, (3) Abatement of Nuisance, and (4) Declaratory Relief. Subsequently,  on March 20, 2022, the Department F47 Court overruled Ealing/Vacca’s demurrer  to the First Amended Complaint and granted their motion to strike with 20 days  leave to amend. (See 3/20/22 Minute Order).    On  May 20, 2022, Defendants/Cross-Complainants Ealing/Vacca filed their Answer to  the First Amended Complaint and a Cross-Complaint against the Condons,  alleging: (1) Quiet Title, (2) Declaratory Relief, (3) Trespass, and (4)  Damages to Trees.   On  July 12, 2022, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, the Condons filed  their operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), alleging: (1) Interference  with Easement, (2) Nuisance, (3) Abatement of Nuisance, (4) Declaratory Relief  and (5) Negligence. Subsequently, on August 17, 2022, Ealing/Vacca filed their  Answer to the Second Amended Complaint.               On May 11,  2023, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed an ex parte application to  continue the July 17, 2023, trial date and all related pre-trial dates, which  was subsequently granted by the Department F47 Court on May 12, 2023. (See 5/12/23  Minute Order).               On September 11, 2023, the Department F47 Court granted  Ealing/Vacca’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, enjoining the Condons from:  (1) Traversing in any manner onto, over or through the 30 foot wide strip of  the easterly boundary of RYAN CULVER EALING and ADRIANA VELASQUEZ VACCA’s real  property located at 9505 Hierba Road, Agua Dulce 91390 (“EALING/VACCA  PROPERTY”), except for (a) the portion of the EALING/VACCA PROPERTY upon which  there currently exists Hierba Road as designated on the survey referred to in  the prior stipulation proposed by RYAN CULVER EALING and ADRIANA VELASQUEZ  VACCA and attached hereto as Exh. 1, and (b) the portion of the EALING/VACCA  PROPERTY designated on the same survey as “Garbage Truck Turn Around Area.” (2)  Performing any maintenance to, making any improvements to, or removing any  items or improvements from any portion of the EALING/VACCA PROPERTY. (3)  Removing, cutting or trimming in any manner the plants or trees on the  EALING/VACCA PROPERTY or that belong to RYAN CULVER EALING and ADRIANA  VELASQUEZ VACCA.” (See 9/11/23 Minute Order.) A Court Order Re Preliminary  Injunction was entered on September 12, 2023 (the 9/12/23 Preliminary  Injunction Order).               On March 13, 2024, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed the  instant Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (the “Motion”).  Subsequently, on May 1, 2023, Defendants/Cross-Complainants filed their  Opposition. Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants replied on May 7, 2024.   ANALYSIS   Code of Civil Procedure section  473, subdivision (a)(1), provides in pertinent part, “The court may likewise,  in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as  may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars;  and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by  this code.” Trial  courts have discretion to permit amendments, which should be exercised  liberally in favor of amendments to promote the judicial policy to resolve all  disputed matters in one lawsuit. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior  Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047. “But this policy applies only [w]here no prejudice is shown to  the adverse party.” (Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007)  151 Cal.App.4th 168, 175 (Melican), quotation marks omitted.)   “Moreover,  even if a good amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in  presenting it may—of itself—be a valid reason for denial.” (Melican, supra,  151 Cal.App.4th at p. 175, quotation marks omitted.)   A.     Request for  Judicial Notice   Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants  request the Court take Judicial Notice of the following records based on the  authorities under Evidence Code sections 452 and 453, and California Rules of  Court, rules 3.1113(1) and 3.1306(c):   1.       Grant  Deed from Daniel James Bruce Walliser and Kari Molbach Walliser to Kelly Condon  and Caroline Condon recorded in Los Angeles County on April 19, 2002. (Condons’  Ex. List, Ex. “A.”)   2.       Grant  Deed to Ryan Culver Ealing and Adriana Velasquez Vacca recorded on June 26,  2019. (Id., Ex. “B.”)   3.  Parcel Map 8384 filed on January 17, 1979. (Id., Ex. “C.”)   4.  Parcel Map 10382 filed on March 23, 1979. (Id., Ex. “D.”)   5.  Assessor’s Map 3213, Page 30, filed on May 8, 1994. (Id., Ex. “E.”)   6.  Second Amended Complaint filed in Kelly Condon, et al. vs. Ryan Culver Ealing,  et al. Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. 21CHCV00269 on July 12, 2022.  (Id., Ex. “F.”)   7.  Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed in Kelly Condon, et al. vs. Ryan Culver  Ealing, et al. Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. 21CHCV00269 on August  17, 2023. (Id., Ex. “G.”)               The Court GRANTS the Request for  Judicial Notice of the above-listed documents.   B.      Motion For  Leave to Amend Complaint   The Condons seek the Court’s  leave to file the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”), adding a Sixth Cause of Action  for “Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief” for the uses and maintenance of  the easement described as “for road, public or private utilities, drainage or  other incidental purposes over the southerly thirty (30) feet of the Ealing/Vacca  Property, part of Hierba Road (the “Hierba Road Easement”), among other related  changes.  (See Condons’ Request  for Judicial Notice, Ex. “A”)   The Condons explain the difference between the SAC and  the TAC, asserting that the issue in the SAC is Defendants/Cross-Complainants’  interference with the West Disputed Easement, whereas the TAC’s added Sixth  Cause of Action concerns disputes over rights to the Hierba Road Easement.  (Mot., at p. 3.)   1)      Unwarranted  Delay    The Condons argue that there is no unwarranted delay in  their filing of the Motion as they brought the instant Motion as soon as  reasonably practicable. (Mot., at p. 6.) However, the Court finds this assertion  to be unsupported by uncontradicted facts.   The Condons assert that the basis of the new claim,  the Sixth Cause of Action in the proposed TAC, is based on a set of facts including  that Defendants/Cross-Complainants allegedly encroached on the Hierba Road  Easement by placing rocks, planting cacti, and allowing trees and other plants  to grow over the Hierba Road Easement. (Mot., at p. 6, Caroline Condon Decl., ¶  6.) However, the Condons note that this alleged encroachment occurred “in or  about 2020” (Reply, at p. 5), predating the filing of the initial Complaint on April 6, 2021, and the SAC on July 12, 2022.   Consequently, the Condons delayed asserting the claim  for more than three years, or should have included it in their SAC, constituting  a delay for almost two years. The Court does not find the delay to be  excusable.   The Condons make an incomplete argument that the delay  was due to the mediation efforts between the parties, resulting in their hope  to avoid bringing the Motion as the parties seemed to move towards mediation.  (Mot., at p. 7, Caroline Condon Decl., ¶ 7.) However, this argument is based on  a conclusory statement and does not support a finding that either the mediation  concerns to any extent the Hierba Road Easement as opposed to the West Disputed  Easement, or that the Condons justifiably relied on Ealing/Vacca’s  promise to resolve the alleged dispute over the Hierba Road Easement through  mediation. Contrarily, Ealing/Vacca maintain, in their Opposition, that “[a]t  no time have EALING/VACCA denied the CONDONS’ (or the public’s) right to use  the easement nor are EALING/VACCA encroaching on the Hierba Road Easement.”  (Opp’n., at p. 2.) The Condons do not contest that Ealing/Vacca’s position has  ever changed over the period of the proceeding.    Consequently, the Court  finds that the Condons’s argument that their delay was due to reliance on the  mediation process is not supported by factual showing substantiating their  claim, thus not persuasive in justifying the delay.   Furthermore, the Condons  contend, in their Reply, that the Motion was brought as reasonably practicable  as the use and maintenance of Hierba Road Easement did not become an issue  until the Court issue its preliminary injunction in September 2023. (Reply, at  p. 3.)   The 9/12/23 Preliminary  Injunction Order, issued by the Department F47 Court, specifies that  Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants are enjoined from, among other things: “¶  (1) Traversing in any manner onto, over or through the 30 foot wide strip of  the easterly boundary of RYAN CULVER EALING and ADRIANA VELASQUEZ VACCA’s real  property located at 9505 Hierba Road, Agua Dulce 91390 (“EALING/VACCA  PROPERTY”), except for (a) the portion of the EALING/VACCA PROPERTY upon  which there currently exists Hierba Road as designated on the survey referred  to in the prior stipulation proposed by RYAN CULVER EALING and ADRIANA  VELASQUEZ VACCA and attached hereto as Exh. 1, and (b) the portion of the  EALING/VACCA PROPERTY designated on the same survey as ‘Garbage Truck Turn  Around Area.’” (9/12/23 Preliminary Injunction Order.) (Underlines added.)  It is evident to the Court that the 9/12/23 Preliminary Injunction Order considers  the existence of the Hierba Road Easement, and does not by itself disregard the  Condons’ right therein.   Additionally, the 9/11/23  Minute Order explicitly highlights that “[a]s noted in the Court’s 8/19/21  ruling on the Condons’ request for a preliminary injunction, the purpose of a  preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial on the  merits. [citing Continental Baking Co. (1968) 68 Cal.2d 512, 528 and SB  Liberty, LLC v. Isla Verde Assn., Inc. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 272,  280.]” (9/11/23 Minute Order.) Accordingly, the parties’ adherence to the  Preliminary Injunction Order cannot be construed as a denial of any party’s  rights that needs to be adjudicated by a separate cause of action.   Therefore, the Court finds  that the Condons have failed to present an excusable explanation of their  unwarranted delay in adding the Sixth Cause of Action.    2)       Prejudice to  the Opposing Party   The Condons argue that  should the Motion be granted, Defendants/Cross-Complainants will not be  prejudiced. (Mot., at p. 7.) In response, Ealing/Vacca contend that the  amendment would require a continuance of the July 8, 2024 Trial, increased  costs of preparation and burden of discovery. (Opp’n., at p. 6.)               In  their Reply, the Condons state, “Prejudice exists where amendment would require  delaying trial, along with the loss of critical evidence, added costs of  preparation, and increased burden of discovery. [citing Magpali v. Farmers  Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 (Magpali).]”  (Reply, at p. 8.) Nevertheless, the Condons maintain that no prejudice exists  as they do not seek to continue the trial and that they do not object to a  brief continuance of the trial. (Ibid.)               The  Court agrees with the Condons’ citation of legal standards outlined in Magpali;  however, it rejects their application in finding none or insignificant  prejudice based on their subjective intention. Given that  Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants seek to add a new cause of action that is unrelated  to the operative SAC – as opposed to “finishing telling the story begun in the  original complaint” – the Court determines that prejudice exists when a near trial  date is objectively reasonable to be continued and new discovery and additional  costs in defending the suit will be incurred by Defendants/Cross-Complainants.  (Cf. Honig v. Financial Corp. of America, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th  960, 966, [“The proposed amendments finished telling the story begun in the  original complaint. The added assertions described the continuation of the  events asserted in the initial pleading . . . . Appellant was fully deposed on  these issues. Thus, no prejudice would have resulted had the amendments been  permitted.”])                Based  on the above, the Court exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure  section 473, and DENIES the Motion for Leave to Amend.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants’  Motion for Leave to Amend is DENIED.   Moving  party is ordered to provide notice of this order.
