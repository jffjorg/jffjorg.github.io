Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The motion by defendant Townhomes at Lost Canyon to quash the service of summons is granted. The court finds that the service of summons was defective because it was served on a non-existent entity, and the California Secretary of State website does not list a registered agent for service of process for "Townhomes at Lost Canyon". Additionally, the service was not made in accordance with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure. As a result, the court has no jurisdiction over the defendant. The motion is granted, and the service of summons is quashed."
