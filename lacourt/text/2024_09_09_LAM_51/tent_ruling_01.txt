STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff Dave Ventrella (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Let’s Jett, Inc. and Connor Jadwin
(Defendants) with ten causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract, (2)
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (4) Constructive Fraud, (5) Conversion, (6) Intentional
Misrepresentation, (7) Unfair Competition, Business and Professions Code §
17200 et seq., (8) Accounting, (9) Unjust Enrichment, and (10) Declaratory
Relief.
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint centers around an oral partnership
agreement in which he alleges that he is entitled to forty-nine percent of
shares in Let’s Jet stock based on his contribution to the company.
 
On March 14, 2024, Defendant Let’s Jett, Inc. (LJI) filed a
motion to compel arbitration, joined by Defendant Jadwin, which the court
DENIED.
 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related Case
with Case No. 24STCV07396.
 
On May 28, 2024, Defendant LJI filed an Appeal to the
court’s denial of the motion to compel arbitration.
 
On May 31, 2024, Defendant Jadwin filed a Demurrer to the
Complaint.
 
On June 3, 2024, Defendant LJI filed an Answer.
 
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(FAC) with the same causes of action.
 
On August 12, 2024, Defendant Jadwin filed the instant
motion to stay proceedings. On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. Replies
were due on or before August 30, 2024. As of September 4, 2024, the court has
not received a reply brief. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
CCP § 1294(a) provides for an appeal from “an order
dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration” without an automatic
stay pending appeal.[1]
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1293(a).) There is no authority indicating that why the court did not compel arbitration
is a factor in the right to appeal. So long as the court did not compel
arbitration, the party moving to compel arbitration may appeal. 
 
“[A] court ordinarily has inherent power, in its discretion,
to stay proceedings when such a stay will accommodate the ends of justice.” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8 Cal.5th 111,
141 [citing People v. Bell (1984) 159
Cal.App.3d 323, 329.]) “[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the
power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its
docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for
litigants.” (Landis v. North American Co.
(1936) 299 U.S. 248, 254; OTO, L.L.C.,
supra, at p. 141.) 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Defendant’s request
for judicial notice as to A, B, and C. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h);
See Kalnoki v. First American
Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the
court only takes judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the
existence, content and authenticity of public records and other specified
documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual
matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez
v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Aeolus Air Charter,
Inc. Arbitration Agreement - Is there a choice-of-law provision at all?
 
As a threshold matter, the court asks whether there is even
an applicable choice-of-law provision since there is no agreement to arbitrate
Plaintiff’s claims.[2]
The subject Arbitration Agreement (Agreement) advanced by Defendant Jadwin
concerns an employment relationship, not a partnership relationship. Neither
party addressed this issue in their briefs.
 
“There is no public policy . . . that favors the arbitration
of disputes the parties did not agree to arbitrate.” (Howard v. Goldbloom (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 659, 663 [internal citations omitted.]) “Thus,
no dispute may be ordered to arbitration unless it is within the
scope of the arbitration agreement.” (Ibid.) While parties may have disputes that an arbitration
agreement broadly covers, the dispute “must arise out of the contract.” (Ibid.) Such broad clauses apply to “extracontractual disputes”
provided that “they have their roots in the relationship between the parties
which was created by the contract.” (Ibid.)
To decipher these roots, courts examine the “nature of the agreement and of the
claims and their relationship to one another.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the parties have two separate relationships: one as
partners (subject of this dispute) and one as employer-employee (subject of the
related dispute now in arbitration). The partner relationship occurred in or
about February 2020. (FAC ¶ 17.) The employment relationship with the Agreement
subsequently occurred in June 2020. (Jadwin Decl., Exhibit A.) These
relationships are independent even though they arise from the same underlying
facts – the private charter business. Plaintiff here seeks relief pertaining to
the partnership agreement only. (See generally FAC.) The Agreement covers the
employment relationship. (Jadwin Decl., Exhibit A, p. 1.) Therefore, the “roots”
of the instant dispute are not in the Agreement.
 
Accordingly, the parties’ adoption of the FAA for the
Agreement does not apply here.[3]
 
Stay Pending Appeal
 
Defendant contends that there is good cause for the court to
issue a stay pending appeal.[4]
Plaintiff argues that Plaintiff has not explained how a stay will accommodate
the ends of justice or otherwise established good cause for a stay.
 
As indicated above, the court has “the power to stay
proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the
disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for
itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” (Landis
v. North American Co. (1936) 299 U.S. 248, 254; OTO, L.L.C., supra, at p. 141.) Additionally, while the court is
still not convinced that Coinbase, Inc. applies
here, in the context of judicial economy and docket management, the reasoning
behind implementing a stay pending appeal of an order denying a motion to
compel arbitration is persuasive. (Coinbase,
supra, at p. 742-744.) Here, the very matter subject to appeal is whether
the partnership dispute is subject to the Agreement. It is appropriate to preserve
the court’s and the parties’ resources litigating this matter pending a
decision from the Court of Appeals.[5]
 
Accordingly, the court exercises its discretion to GRANT
Defendant’s motion for stay pending appeal.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Stay pending appeal is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
