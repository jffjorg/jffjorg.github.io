And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to stay proceedings pending appeal of the court's denial of the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that there is good cause for the stay, as it will allow the parties to conserve resources and avoid the need for duplicate litigation. The court also notes that the dispute is still in its early stages and that the appeal will provide an opportunity for the Court of Appeals to review the issues and provide guidance. The court exercises its discretion to grant the stay pending appeal.

The judge's decision is based on the fact that the parties have two separate relationships: one as partners and one as employer-employee, and that the dispute at hand is related to the partnership agreement, which is not subject to the arbitration agreement. The court finds that the "roots" of the instant dispute are not in the arbitration agreement and that the parties' adoption of the FAA for the agreement does not apply here.

The judge notes that the court has the power to stay proceedings when such a stay will accommodate the ends of justice, and that the power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants. The court also cites several cases to support its decision, including OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, People v. Bell, and Landis v. North American Co.
