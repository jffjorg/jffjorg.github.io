And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide further responses to document requests. The defendant failed to comply with its statutory obligations to replace the vehicle or pay restitution. The defendant also failed to meet and confer in good faith and unilaterally limited production of documents. The court finds that the defendant's responses were inadequate and that the defendant failed to show substantial justification for opposing the motion. The court orders the defendant to provide further responses to the document requests and to pay sanctions to the plaintiff.
