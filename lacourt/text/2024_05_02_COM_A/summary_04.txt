And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleading. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's employment-related claims were previously litigated in the unlawful detainer action and are therefore barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. The plaintiff, however, argued that the claims were never litigated and that the previous litigation only concerned the landlord's right to possession of the premises. The court found that the plaintiff's claims were not litigated and are not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel. The court granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of records in the unlawful detainer action and found that the issues raised in the previous action were distinct from the issues in the present case. Therefore, the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleading is denied.
