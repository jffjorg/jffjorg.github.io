And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amendment Complaint (FAC) filed by Sirena Hovagimyan against CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, Nelson Owyoung, Joseph Nussbaum, and Khaldoun Sroujieh. The FAC alleges that the defendants denied Mary Babayan adequate medical care and treatment, leading to her death on October 26, 2021. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first and fifth causes of action insofar as they are brought by Sirena Hovagimyan as successor in interest, finding that she lacks standing to bring a wrongful death claim in that capacity. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second and fourth causes of action with leave to amend, finding that the allegations are insufficient to state a claim. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action with leave to amend, finding that the allegations fail to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements for fraud claims. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the eighth cause of action without leave to amend as to Sirena Hovagimyan's individual capacity, finding that the allegations are insufficient to support the proposition that the defendants are licensees of a skilled nursing facility. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action with leave to amend, finding that the allegations are insufficient to establish a predicate act by the defendants that would support a claim under Business and Professions Code Section 17200. The court has denied the defendants' motion to strike targeting the FAC as moot.
