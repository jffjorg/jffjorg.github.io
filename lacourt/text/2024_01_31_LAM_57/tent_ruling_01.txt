  Case Number:  19STCV10150    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  57 The City of Industry's motion to the lift stay of this action is granted to the extent that the motion seeks an order enabling the City to (1) pursue its attorney's fees and costs related to Defendant Cordoba Corporation's unsuccessful appeals from this Court's rulings granting the City's special motion to strike Cordoba's cross-complaint and awarding the City attorney's fees incurred in connection with that motion, and (2) enforce and collect from Cordoba the attorney's fees the Court awarded.  The City's motion to lift the stay of this action is denied all other respects.  The Court has considered the arguments advanced in the City's motion to lift the stay in its entirety, or, at minimum to lift the stay to enable the City to pursue third-party discovery , and the arguments advanced by the parties opposing the relief the City seeks.  Having considered those arguments, the Court has determined that the stay should remain in place, except to the extent of the relief from the stay the Court is granting related to the City's special motion to strike Cordoba's cross-complaint.  The City's motion to lift the stay is not sanctionable.  The arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  The Court will set a hearing for late October 2024 on the status of the criminal proceeding that led to the entry of the stay of this action.
