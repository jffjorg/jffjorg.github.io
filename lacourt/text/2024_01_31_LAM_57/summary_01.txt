And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The City of Industry's motion to lift the stay of this action is granted in part and denied in part. The city is allowed to pursue its attorney's fees and costs related to Cordoba Corporation's unsuccessful appeals from the court's previous rulings, as well as to enforce and collect the attorney's fees awarded. However, the stay of the action remains in place except for this limited relief. The city's request to lift the stay to allow for third-party discovery is denied. A hearing will be set for late October 2024 to review the status of the criminal proceeding that led to the stay.
