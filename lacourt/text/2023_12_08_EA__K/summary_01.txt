Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants. The court sustained the demurrer filed by Kwok and Winsome to the ninth cause of action (Inducing Breach of Contract) in the Second Amended Complaint, finding that the pleading fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court also sustained the demurrer filed by Brubacher and Firm to the seventh and eighth causes of action (Fraud in the Inducement and Negligent Misrepresentation, respectively) in the Second Amended Complaint, finding that the pleading fails to allege the necessary facts to constitute these causes of action.

The court denied the motion to strike filed by Kwok and Winsome as moot, as the demurrer was sustained. The court also denied the motion to strike filed by Brubacher and Firm as moot, as the demurrer was sustained.

The court set a Case Management Conference for December 4, 2023, to discuss the status of the case and any further pleading or discovery issues.
