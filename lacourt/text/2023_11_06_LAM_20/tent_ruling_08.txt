This is a medical malpractice action.  Plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ negligent surgery and post-surgery evaluation led to paraplegia for Plaintiff Ana Cordova and loss of consortium for Luis Cordova.  On July 17, 2023, Plaintiffs amended their Complaint to identify Doe 1 as Shuo Steven Wang, M.D.Defendant Wang now seeks to quash the aforementioned doe amendment because he contends that Plaintiffs were aware of his identity and involvement since the filing of this lawsuit due to medical records in their possession.  Defendant contends that he has been severely prejudiced by the amendment because all other Defendants have settled or been dismissed.  Specifically, Defendant asserts that “Ms. CORDOVA's same medical records from ADVENTIST HEALTH WHITE MEMORIAL show that Dr. WANG examined Ms. CORDOVA on July 27, 2021, at 10:32 a.m., and that an ‘ASAP’ telephone order for neurology consult due to ‘weakness’ on July 27, 2021, at 6:50 p.m., was attributed to Dr. WANG by Estela Quintero. [ ] Therefore, the care provided by Dr. WANG involved the same period of time during which Plaintiffs allege that there was a failure to order proper testing to evaluate Ms. CORDOVA's condition, and all the facts which would give rise to the cause of action were contained in those same medical records.”Plaintiffs argue that “on January 12, 2023, Plaintiff Ana Cordova served Defendants with Requests for Admission, Set One wherein Plaintiff asked Defendants to admit that no person other than Defendants did anything to cause Ms. Cordova’s injuries. (Hemesath Decl., Exh. 3.) Plaintiff also served Special Interrogatories on Defendants to determine whether they were contending any other person was negligent and whether there was any support for their affirmative defenses on this issue. (Hemesath Decl., Exh. 4.) All defendants indicated that they lacked sufficient information to determine whether any other person was negligent. (Hemesath Decl., Exhs. 5-8.) . . . On June 19, 2023, Plaintiffs received the expert designation of Defendant Longacre wherein a hospitalist was designated to testify as to the standard of care of a hospitalist. (Hemesath Decl., Exh. 15.) On July 3, 2023, Defendant Longacre responded to discovery which explicitly stated that Defendant Wang was negligent and outlined the manner of the alleged negligence. (Hemesath Decl., Exh. 19.) Rather than wait for Defendant Longacre’s expert to be deposed, Plaintiffs retained their own expert to review the care and treatment rendered by Defendant Wang. Plaintiffs’ expert completed his review and spoke with Plaintiffs’ counsel on July 6, 2023, regarding his review. (Hemesath Decl., ¿33.) . . . Plaintiffs did not unreasonably delay in filing the Doe amendment. The Doe amendment was filed two weeks after receiving discovery responses from Defendant Longacre which stated that Defendant Wang was negligent.”A plaintiff may file an action against a doe defendant when she is “ignorant of the name of a defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 474.)  The phrase, “ignorant of the name of a defendant” means either (1) plaintiff was unaware of defendant's identity, (2) plaintiff was unaware of defendant's culpability (facts giving rise to a cause of action against the defendant), or (3) the law did not give plaintiff a right of action until after commencement of the action.  (See Marasco v. Wadsworth (1978) 21 Cal.3d 82, 88.)  “[Code Civ. Proc.] [s]ection 474 allows a plaintiff in good faith to delay suing particular persons as named defendants until he has knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a reasonable person to believe liability is probable. The distinction between a suspicion that some cause could exist and a factual basis to believe a cause exists is critical in the operation of section 474. The former is one reason attorneys include general charging allegations against fictitiously named defendants; the latter requires substitution of the defendant's true name.”  (Dieckmann v. Superior Court (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 345, 363.)In Balon v. Drost (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 483, 487–88, it was said,“Section 474, however, ... is restricted to the knowledge of the plaintiff at the time of the filing of the complaint.” (Munoz v. Purdy, supra, 91 Cal.App.3d at p. 947, 154 Cal.Rptr. 472; see also Westfour Corp. v. California First Bank, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1559–1560, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 394; Sobeck & Assoc., Inc. v. B & R Investments No. 24 (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 861, 867, 264 Cal.Rptr. 156; Streicher v. Tommy's Electric Co. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 876, 882, 211 Cal.Rptr. 22.) “The lack of knowledge of the true name of the defendant ... must be ‘real and not feigned.’ [Citation.] ... ‘Ignorance of the facts is the critical issue, and whether it be due to misinformation or negligence is not relevant.’ [Citations.]” (Munoz v. Purdy, supra, 91 Cal.App.3d at p. 947, 154 Cal.Rptr. 472; see also Irving v. Carpentier (1886) 70 Cal. 23, 11 P. 391; Westfour Corp. v. California First Bank, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1559–1560, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 394.) Under section 474, therefore, a plaintiff has no duty “to exercise reasonable diligence prior to filing the complaint to discover the defendant's identity.” (Snoke v. Bolen (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1427, 1432, 1 Cal.Rptr.2d 492.)Code Civ. Proc. § 474 “includes an implicit requirement that a plaintiff may not ‘unreasonably delay’ his or her filing of a Doe amendment after learning a defendant's identity. Second, a defendant named in an action by a Doe amendment under section 474 may challenge the amendment by way of an evidence-based motion, which argues that the plaintiff ‘unreasonable delayed’ his or her filing of the challenged amendment. Third, ‘unreasonable delay’ . . . includes a prejudice element, which requires a showing by the defendant that he or she would suffer prejudice from plaintiff's delay in filing the Doe amendment.”  (A.N. v. Cty. of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1066–67.)“Absent compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 474, service of a summons on a purported Doe defendant is ineffective.”  (Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks Constr. Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145.)“When a defendant is properly named under section 474, the amendment relates back to the filing date of the original complaint.”  (McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 368, 371.)The Court finds that while Plaintiffs/counsel likely knew of Wang’s identity at the time they filed the Complaint, there is little to indicate that they knew or had a factual basis to know that Wang was negligent in providing care.  Rather, it seems Wang was added as a defendant shortly after other Defendants contended he was negligent.  As Plaintiffs point out, if this were not the standard, then a plaintiff would have to name every treating doctor as a defendant in every case to avoid a statute of limitations bar.  The Motion is denied.  The Request for Judicial Notice is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
