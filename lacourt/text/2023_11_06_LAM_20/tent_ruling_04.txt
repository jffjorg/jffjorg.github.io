This is a habitability matter.  Defendant Hwy 111 Hotel Group, LP seeks to consolidate this matter with Evans, et al. v. Rosecrans Avenue Property LLC, et al., Case No. 22STCV11702 and Barboza, et al. v. Rosecrans Avenue Property LLC, et al., Case No. 23STCV06376.Defendant contends that “all actions arise from similar allegations of substandard conditions at the same apartment complex located at 1518 – 1774 E. Kay St., Compton, CA 90221 ("Subject Property"). There are common questions of law and fact, and consolidation of the actions will avoid unnecessary costs, delays, inconsistent rulings/findings/verdicts, or other prejudice to any of the parties. The Evans case involves entirely the same Plaintiffs already named in the Amaro matter with the exception of one, and the same Defendant employee witnesses are alleged to be involved in all three cases.”Code Civ. Proc. § 1048(a) provides, “[w]hen actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions;¿it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  Given the factual similarity of the subject cases and the fact that no oppositions were filed, the Motion to Consolidate is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
