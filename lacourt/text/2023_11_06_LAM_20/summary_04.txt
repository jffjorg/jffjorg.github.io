And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by the Judge to grant the Motion to Consolidate filed by the Defendant, Hwy 111 Hotel Group, LP. The Defendant seeks to consolidate this case with two other similar cases, Evans, et al. v. Rosecrans Avenue Property LLC, et al. (Case No. 22STCV11702) and Barboza, et al. v. Rosecrans Avenue Property LLC, et al. (Case No. 23STCV06376). The Defendant argues that all three cases involve similar allegations of substandard conditions at the same apartment complex and that consolidation will avoid unnecessary costs, delays, and inconsistent rulings. The Judge agrees with the Defendant's argument, citing Code Civ. Proc. § 1048(a), which allows for consolidation of cases with common questions of law or fact. The Judge grants the Motion to Consolidate and orders the moving party to give notice. Additionally, the Judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
