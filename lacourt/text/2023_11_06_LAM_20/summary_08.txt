And here is the English text summary:

This is a medical malpractice action brought by Ana Cordova and her husband Luis against several defendants, including Dr. Shuo Steven Wang. The plaintiffs allege that Dr. Wang's negligent surgery and post-surgery evaluation led to Ana's paraplegia and loss of consortium for Luis. The defendants, including Dr. Wang, contend that the plaintiffs knew Dr. Wang's identity and involvement in the case since the filing of the lawsuit and that the plaintiffs unreasonably delayed in filing an amended complaint identifying Dr. Wang as a defendant. The court finds that while the plaintiffs' counsel likely knew of Dr. Wang's identity, there is no indication that they knew or had a factual basis to know that Dr. Wang was negligent. Therefore, the court denies the motion to quash the amended complaint and grants the request for judicial notice.
