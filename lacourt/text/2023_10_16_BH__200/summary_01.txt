And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions in limine. The first motion, filed by the beneficiary, seeks to exclude evidence related to the 2013 Settlement Agreement. The beneficiary argues that the objections to the Settlement Agreement were reasonably foreseeable, while the former trustees contend that the Settlement Agreement was a "good deal".

The second motion, also filed by the beneficiary, seeks to exclude testimony from the former trustees' designated expert, Grant Steifel, on the reasonableness of the fees incurred. The beneficiary argues that Steifel's opinion lacks foundation, while the former trustees argue that Steifel is qualified to give opinions on the reasonableness of the fees.

The third motion, filed by the former trustees, seeks to exclude the claim for attorney's fees incurred by Greenberg Traurig on behalf of the beneficiary. The former trustees argue that the fees were not recoverable as damages or costs, citing the American Rule, and that the beneficiary cannot avoid the American Rule by using a third person to recover the fees.

In his ruling, the judge concludes that the beneficiary's claim for fees as damages will have to be decided at trial. The judge also finds that the beneficiary's motion in limine to exclude evidence related to the Settlement Agreement is denied, and that the former trustees' motion in limine to exclude claims for attorney's fees is granted in part and denied in part. The judge also grants the beneficiary's motion in limine to exclude testimony from Steifel, subject to certain conditions.

The judge's ruling is based on the following laws and case citations: CCP sec. 1021, CCP sec. 2034.280(a), CCP sec. 2034.300, Probate Code sec. 15645, Probate Code sec. 17211, McMillin Cos. v.
