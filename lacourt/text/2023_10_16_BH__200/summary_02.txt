And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of fees incurred by Greenberg Traurig in bringing a claim for surcharge as part of the Beneficiary's objections to the Former Trustees' accounting. The Judge finds that whether such fees are recoverable is not part of this trial and is reserved for later proceedings, as stipulated to by prior trial management order. The Judge also notes that even if the Beneficiary's claim were one for recovery as a prevailing party, the applicability of Probate Code sec. 15645 is unclear, as it was enacted after the Trust was formed and its retroactive application is uncertain. Additionally, the Judge questions why the fees were not sought from Judge Beckloff during the removal trial, and whether the Beneficiary could have sought a corporate trustee or designated individuals as successor trustees.
