And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has continued the Order to Show Cause re: Sale of Dwelling to June 3, 2024, due to uncertainty regarding a potential bankruptcy filing by the defendant. Additionally, the court has denied, without prejudice, a motion by the plaintiff to permit the sale of the dwelling to a bidder who offers less than 90% of the property's value, as the motion is premature and not yet ripe for consideration.
