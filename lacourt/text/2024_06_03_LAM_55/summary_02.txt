And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the complaint. The plaintiff, TAI-LI CHU, filed a complaint against the defendant, Y. JESSIE SHAW dba LAW OFFICE OF Y. JESSIE SHAW, alleging breach of contract, fraud, accounting, elder abuse, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and declaratory relief. The defendant seeks to strike the portion of the prayer for relief that states "for all causes of action" because not all causes of action in the complaint can support punitive damages. The court denies the motion to strike as to this issue. The defendant also contends that the plaintiff has alleged insufficient ultimate facts to seek punitive damages, but the court finds that the plaintiff's claims for fraud, elder abuse, breach of fiduciary duty, and intentional infliction of emotional distress theoretically could support punitive damages. The court grants the motion to strike the request for $10,000,000 in punitive damages because stating an amount of punitive damages in a complaint is prohibited by Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (e).
