And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for the Gonzalez Defendants to obtain a writ of possession to enforce the judgment. The judgment requires the plaintiff to vacate the property after receiving the payment of $160,000. However, the plaintiff has not vacated the property and has not filed an opposition to the motion. The Gonzalez Defendants have requested rental damages for the period from May 1, 2024, until the plaintiff vacates the property. The court finds that the judgment supports a writ of possession and an award of rental damages.
