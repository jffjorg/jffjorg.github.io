And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for determination of good faith settlement and entry of bar order. The court found that the settlement is made in good faith and that the defendants have made a reasonable effort to remediate the contamination. The court denied the plaintiff's opposition to the settlement, finding that the settlement is within the ballpark of good faith settlements. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a continuance, finding that the plaintiff has not shown that a continuance is necessary. The court's ruling is based on the principles of good faith settlement and the Tech-Bilt factors, which consider factors such as the plaintiff's rough estimate of total recovery, the settlor's share of liability, and the size of the settlement.
