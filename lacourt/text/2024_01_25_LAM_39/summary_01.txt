And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the default judgment against Pretty Fashion, Inc. is void. The default judgment was obtained in an employment discrimination and wage-and-hour case filed by Bertha Velasquez on October 15, 2020. The judgment was for damages in the amount of $103,436, but the default judgment imposed joint and several liability in the amount of $281,663.75, which is an excessive amount. The judgment also included a PAGA penalty of $22,500, but did not include the State of California's share of the penalty.

The Judge has granted the ex parte application of Francisca Gonzalez, the defendant, to set aside the default judgment and recall and quash the writ of execution. However, the defendant will remain in default, as the ex parte application did not seek to set aside default, and there is no good cause to do so at this time.

The parties are ordered to meet-and-confer to discuss the case proceedings and may submit a joint statement on or before February 26, 2024. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, Plaintiff shall submit a new default judgment packet on or before February 26, 2024. The Court will not enter any default judgment before March 8, 2024, which should afford the defendants sufficient time to file any noticed motion to set aside default.
