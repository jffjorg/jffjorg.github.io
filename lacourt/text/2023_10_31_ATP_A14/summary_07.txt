    + Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (doing business as Mr. Cooper) made representations that:
        - At the end of the forbearance, plaintiff would simply need to resume making regular monthly mortgage payments
        - Any and all payments made after December 2021 would be accepted so long as plaintiff makes regular monthly mortgage payments
        - If plaintiff is unable to make monthly payments after the expiration of the forbearance, then Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (doing business as Mr. Cooper) would automatically place plaintiff into loan modification review or other non-foreclosure alternatives
    + These representations were false and Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (doing business as Mr. Cooper) knew they were false
