**Significant Statements**

* "The decision to dismiss an action under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2) rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and a reviewing court does not disturb the ruling unless the trial court abuses its discretion."
* "A dismissal under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2) is necessarily with prejudice."
* "Since Plaintiff has failed to file her second amended complaint, it should be considered strong evidence that her claims against Defendants remain insufficient, and that she is no longer eager to litigate her case against them."
* "Plaintiff has not opposed this motion."
* "As it stands, it is now over two months since the Court's deadline for the amended pleading has passed. With the exception of the appearance of Cothran at the September 19, 2023 hearing, no action has been taken on Plaintiff's behalf."
* "Defendants Charles E. Mosman; Sandra Mosman; Mosman's Country Steakhouse & Bar, Zubie Enterprises, Inc.; and Charles E. Mosman DBA Mosman's Town & Country Carpet & Construction's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED."
