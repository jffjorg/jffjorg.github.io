Plaintiffs have filed a Complaint stating that the cause of actions are Motor
Vehicle and General Negligence, but attaching Premises Liability and General
Negligence Cause of Action attachments. As form is respected less than
substance, the Court addresses the causes of actions by their attachments,
which include relevant allegations. (See Cal. Civ. Code § 3528 [“The law
respects form less than substance.”].)
