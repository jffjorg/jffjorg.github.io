Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is focused on determining the good faith of a settlement agreement between the cross-defendant, Alexander de Leon Giron, and the plaintiffs, Nisha Norberg and Gaige Woolfield. The settlement amount is $30,000, which Giron claims is reasonable given his financial situation. The Court considers various factors, including the rough approximation of the plaintiffs' total recovery, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, a recognition that a settlor should pay less than if found liable at trial, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. Based on these factors, the Court finds that the settlement is not grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person would estimate Giron's exposure to be, and therefore, the motion contesting the good faith of the settlement is denied.
