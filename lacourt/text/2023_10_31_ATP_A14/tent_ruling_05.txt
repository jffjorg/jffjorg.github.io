 Case Number:  23AVCV00066    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is an action stemming from
the lease of real property located at 46645 60th St. West, Lancaster, CA 93536
(“the Property”). Plaintiff Leilani L. Antoine (“Plaintiff”) alleges that
Defendants Charles E. Mosman (“Charles”[1]);
Sandra Mosman (“Sandra”); Mosman’s Country Steakhouse & Bar, Zubie
Enterprises, Inc. (“Zubie Enterprises”); and Charles E. Mosman DBA Mosman’s
Town & Country Carpet & Construction (“Mosman’s Town & Country
Carpet & Construction” and collectively “Defendants”) are former commercial
tenants of hers. Plaintiff further alleges damages stemming from their time as
her tenants. 
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint alleging once cause of action for General Negligence and
four causes of action labelled “Intentional Tort.”
 
On February 24, 2023, Defendants
filed their Demurrer with Motion to Strike to the Complaint, subsequently
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff
filed her First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action for General
Negligence and Intentional Tort (four cases of action with this label).
Plaintiff also wrote in, but not did not provide an attachment, for a cause of
action under Cal. Pen. Code § 496(c). 
 
On May 30, 2023, Defendants filed
their Demurrer with Motion to Strike to the FAC, subsequently sustained with
leave to amend. 
 
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff
filed an Ex Parte Application for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”). The Ex Parte Application for Leave to File a SAC requested leave to
include a sixth cause of action for battery against Charles and a seventh cause
of action against all defendants for intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage. The matter was continued to August 14, 2023 as Department
A-14 was dark on August 11, 2023. On August 14, 2023, the Court denied the Ex
Parte Application for Leave to File a SAC as no exigent circumstances existed
to hear it on an ex parte basis. The matter was scheduled for regular hearing
on September 19, 2023. 
 
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a substitution of attorney, substituting William Garrett Cothran as
counsel. 
 
On September 19, 2023, the
following were held by the Court: (1) an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”),
(2) the hearing on the Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint, (3) a Case
Management Conference (“CMC”), and (4) an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) RE:
Dismissal. The Court denied Defendant’s oral motion to dismiss without
prejudice and advised that a noticed motion may be filed. The OSC RE: Dismissal
and hearing on the Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint were taken off
calendar. The CMC was continued to January 12, 2024.
 
On October 04, 2023, Defendants
filed their Motion to Dismiss. 
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which
a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing is set for October 31, 2023. Accordingly, an Opposition was due October
18, 2023. Should an Opposition be filed, it is now untimely.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Dismissal – Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 581
provides in relevant part that “[t]he court¿may dismiss the complaint as to
that defendant when…[e]xcept where Section 597 applies, after a demurrer to the
complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it
within the time allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2).)¿The decision to dismiss an action under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2) rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and
a reviewing court does not disturb the ruling unless the trial court abuses its
discretion. (Gitmed v. General Motors Corp. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 824,
827.)¿ 
¿ 
Courts have held that a dismissal under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2) is necessarily with prejudice. (Cano v. Glover¿(2006)
143¿Cal.App.4th 326, 329.) Courts have also held that a dismissal under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2) is discretionary due to the phrasing of the statute.
(Id., See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §581(f)(2) [“may dismiss”].)¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – Defendants
reiterate the procedural background regarding the previous demurrers in this
case. Defendant presents that the Court’s July 11 Order granted Plaintiff leave
to amend and instructed her to file the second amended complaint within 30
days, or by August 10, 2023, Plaintiff failed to do so, and there is currently
no operative complaint within this case. Defendant argues that since Plaintiff
has failed to file her second amended complaint, it should be considered strong
evidence that her claims against Defendants remain insufficient, and that she
is no longer eager to litigate her case against them. Further Defendant’s present
that the Court reserved a hearing date for September 19, 2023 for a regularly
scheduled motion regarding leave to amend and the Court had to take the hearing
off calendar as no motion was filed. Defendants conclude that Plaintiff’s right
to file the second amended complaint has expired; there is no operative
complaint on file with the Court; or even a slight indication that one is
forthcoming; and, as such, dismissal with prejudice of the entire action
pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 581(f)(2)is appropriate.
 
The order regarding the July 11,
2023 hearing on the Demurrer to the FAC with Motion to Strike reads:
 
Defendants Charles E.
Mosman; Sandra Mosman; Mosman’s Country Steakhouse & Bar, Zubie
Enterprises, Inc.; and Charles E. Mosman DBA Mosman’s Town & Country Carpet
& Construction’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Plaintiff is to
file an amended Complaint within 30 days of this Court Order. 
 
Defendants Charles E.
Mosman; Sandra Mosman; Mosman’s Country Steakhouse & Bar, Zubie
Enterprises, Inc.; and Charles E. Mosman DBA Mosman’s Town & Country Carpet
& Construction’s Motion to Strike is MOOT.  
 
(07/11/2023 Order After Hearing.)

 
30 days from July 11, 2023 is August 10, 2023. Plaintiff, instead of
filing a SAC, filed the Ex Parte Application for Leave to File a SAC to
be heard on August 11, 2023. Plaintiff appeared to each subsequent hearing,
including those after the substitution of attorney was filed. At the September
19, 2023 hearing, which included (1) an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”),
(2) the hearing on the Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint, (3) a Case
Management Conference (“CMC”), and (4) an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) RE:
Dismissal, William Garrett Cothran (“Cothran”) for Richard Alvarez Loa appeared
on behalf of Plaintiff. Following this, no action has been taken on behalf of
Plaintiff. 
 
As it stands, it is now over two
months since the Cout’s deadline for the amended pleading has passed. With the
exception of the appearance of Cothran at the September 19, 2023 hearing, no
action has been taken on Plaintiff’s behalf. Plaintiff has not opposed this
motion. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to
Dismiss is GRANTED.
 
-----
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Charles E. Mosman; Sandra Mosman; Mosman’s
Country Steakhouse & Bar, Zubie Enterprises, Inc.; and Charles E. Mosman
DBA Mosman’s Town & Country Carpet & Construction’s Motion to Dismiss
is GRANTED.
