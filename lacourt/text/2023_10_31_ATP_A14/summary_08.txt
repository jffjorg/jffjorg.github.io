English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion to Stay the Action filed by the Defendants, KB Home, KB Home Greater Los Angeles, Inc., KB Home Sales - Southern California Inc., and KB Home Holdings, Inc. The case involves a breach of contract action brought by Plaintiffs, Eugene Jones and Jamie Jones, against the Defendants, alleging that they failed to disclose defects in the construction of the property they purchased in 2019. The Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs failed to comply with the prelitigation procedures required by the Right to Repair Act, which requires that a homeowner must first notify the builder of the alleged defects and provide an opportunity for the builder to make repairs before filing a lawsuit. The Court finds that the prelitigation procedures were not followed and grants the Motion to Stay the Action, pending further compliance with the requirements of the Right to Repair Act.
