And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the plaintiff's responses to the deemed admitted order. Firstly, the judge notes that the responses were not signed under oath, as required by law. Secondly, the judge states that any objections raised by the plaintiff were waived due to the untimely filing of the responses. Thirdly, the judge reviews the docket and notes that the plaintiff was mailed notice of the deemed admitted order on November 20, 2023, but did not file a motion to "terminate sanctions" until February 6, 2024, over two months later. The judge cites relevant case law, including Nwosu v. Uba, to support the proposition that pro per litigants (those acting as their own attorneys) must follow the same rules of procedure as attorneys. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's actions may have contributed to the delay in the case and that further action may be necessary to resolve the issues raised.
