**Significant Statements**
```
The law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits.
Any doubts in applying section 2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.
The court's discretion to deny a motion under the statute is limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the withdrawal or amendment would substantially prejudice the party who obtained the admission in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.
```

**Summary**

The Judge denies Plaintiff's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions. The Plaintiff failed to verify her responses to Defendant's Request for Admissions, Set One, and the Defendant filed a motion to deem admitted the Request for Admissions, Set One, which was granted by the Court. The Plaintiff's declaration does not provide a sufficient basis for the Court to find mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and the Defendant has relied on the order to deem admitted in its subsequent filings.
