22STCV36647

Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel

Plaintiff Steve Medrano’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Steve Medrano’s (Plaintiff) counsel of
record, Hesam Yazdanpanah; Law Offices of Hess Panah & Ass. (Counsel),
moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel contends relief is
necessary because there has been a breakdown in attorney-client communication.
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has
filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053 as required. 
(Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) 
Counsel states the instant motion is filed for the following reason: “There
has been no communication with the client. He has failed to respond to our
phone calls and communications. We have been unable to make any contact with
him.” (MC-052.) The Court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. (See Rules
Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4).)   
 
However, Counsel has not included the dates, times,
locations, and subject matter of all future proceedings in this case. The Court
orders Counsel to file within 5 calendar days of the hearing an amended form
MC-053 which should include information about all future hearings and
proceedings noticed by any party. 
 
Further, Counsel must serve the signed order (MC-053)
within 10 days of the date of the order, and file a proof of service of
such.  Counsel will remain the attorney of record for Plaintiff until
Counsel files and serves the updated proposed order.  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(e).)  
 
Accordingly, the Court conditionally grants the motion
pending Counsel’s filing and service of the updated form.  Counsel shall
provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
