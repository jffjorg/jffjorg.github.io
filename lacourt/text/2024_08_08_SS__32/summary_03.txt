Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court grants the Cross-Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court finds that Brand Buzz Limited Liability Company and E.S. Sutton, Inc. did not owe a duty of care to the Plaintiff and that the Plaintiff has not presented any triable issues of fact to support their claims. The Court also finds that the Cross-Defendants have met their initial burden to establish that they did not owe a duty of care and that the Plaintiff has not responded to their motion. Therefore, the Court grants the Cross-Defendants' motion and dismisses the Plaintiff's claims against them.
