after reviewing the docket in this case, the Court notes that Plaintiff was
mailed notice of the deemed admitted order on November 20, 2023. She did not

the law, a party may choose to act as his or her own attorney. [Citations.]
‘[S]uch a party is to be treated like any other party and is entitled to the
same, but no greater consideration than other litigants and attorneys.

must follow correct rules of procedure. [Citation.]” (Nwosu v. Uba
