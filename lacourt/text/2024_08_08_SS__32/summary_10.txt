```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

After reviewing the motion to quash the subpoenas served by the City of Los Angeles, the Court finds that the subpoenas are overbroad and violate Plaintiff Angela Cendy Betancourt's right of privacy. The Court notes that medical records are privileged under the patient-physician privilege, but where a party has waived that privilege by filing a lawsuit, discovery must be limited to matters directly relevant to the party's claims. In this case, the Plaintiff has not specified the limitations of the discovery, but based on the discovery responses, it appears that the Plaintiff's injuries are limited to her lumbar spine and a tailbone fracture. Therefore, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas and orders the Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
