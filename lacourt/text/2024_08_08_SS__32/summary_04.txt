And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Henry Utama on behalf of Claimant Ian Law, a 15-year-old boy who suffered a laceration from a park bench, resulting in permanent injuries. The judge denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons. First, Petitioner failed to label the attachments according to the numbers referenced in the petition. Second, Petitioner did not provide sufficient information regarding Claimant's anxiety, including medical records. Third, Petitioner must complete a section of the settlement agreement and provide proof of payment for medical expenses. Finally, Petitioner's request for attorney fees is unclear and may be excessive. The judge orders Petitioner to file a proof of service of the denial and to make these corrections before re-filing the petition.
