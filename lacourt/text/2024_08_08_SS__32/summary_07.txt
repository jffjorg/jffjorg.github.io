And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Hesam Yazdanpanah, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Steve Medrano. The motion is based on a breakdown in attorney-client communication, with Counsel stating that they have been unable to make contact with the client. Since no opposition has been filed, the Court finds this to be a valid reason for withdrawal.

However, the Court orders Counsel to file an amended form MC-053 within 5 calendar days of the hearing, which must include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party. Counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service.

The Court conditionally grants the motion pending Counsel's filing and service of the updated form. Counsel shall provide notice of the Court's ruling.
