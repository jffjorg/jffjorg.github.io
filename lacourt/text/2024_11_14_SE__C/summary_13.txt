And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Subway Real Estate, LLC, has moved for an order permitting service by publication on the defendants, Aman Beri and Vandana Beri, due to their failure to respond to service attempts. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated reasonable diligence to locate the defendants. The court notes that the plaintiff's process server attempted to serve the defendants at their last known address, but was unsuccessful. The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to investigate further through other means, such as mailing the summons or inquiring with friends or relatives.

The court also finds that the proposed order submitted by the plaintiff does not comply with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP). Specifically, the order must specify that publication will be made once a week for four consecutive weeks, and that if the defendants' addresses are ascertained before the expiration of the time prescribed for publication, copies of the summons, complaint, and order for publication will be mailed to the defendant.

As a result, the motion for service by publication is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff is required to give notice of the denial and may re-file the motion if it can demonstrate reasonable diligence to locate the defendants.
