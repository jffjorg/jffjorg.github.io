Plaintiff’s motion to vacate this Court’s December 27, 2022
Order granting Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration and stay of this action
is DENIED. 
 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
This lemon law action was filed by Plaintiff TIFFANY V.
ANGELES (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA (“Defendant” or
“Hyundai”) on August 16, 2022. 
 
On December 27, 2022, this Court granted Defendant’s Motion
to Compel Arbitration and Stay this Action. This action is currently STAYED
until conclusion of the arbitration. 
 
JURISDICTION 
 
“Once a court grants the petition to
compel arbitration and stays the action at law, the action at law sits in the
twilight zone of abatement with the trial court retaining merely a vestigial
jurisdiction over matters submitted to arbitration. This vestigial jurisdiction
over the action at law consists solely of making the determination, upon
conclusion of the arbitration proceedings, of whether there was an award on the
merits….” (Brock v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1790, 1796.)
“The court also retains a separate, limited jurisdiction over the contractual
arbitration which was the subject of the section 1281.2 petition: “After a
petition has been filed under this title  [i.e., “Title 9” (§§
1280–1294.2) ], the court in which such petition was filed retains jurisdiction
to determine any subsequent petition involving the same agreement to
arbitrate and the same controversy, and any such subsequent petition shall be filed in the same proceeding. [Citations Omitted.]” (Ibid.)

 
On August 30, 2023, the Arbitrator issued an Order stating,
which states: “The Arbitrator defers to the lower court to re-determine, in
light of the subsequent cases that have come down since the court’s Order
granting [Defendant’s] motion to compel arbitration, whether [Defendant] can
compel this proceeding to binding arbitration or not; and (2) While the lower
court re-decides this issue, this Arbitration will be in abeyance.” (Moses
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 3.) 
 
As such, the arbitration is not currently pending and this
Court has limited jurisdiction over the arbitration under CCP §1292.6.
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff moves this Court to vacate it’s December 27, 2022
Order under CCP §1008(c), arguing that new case law warrants the Court to
reconsider it’s prior order. 
 
Defendant argues the following in Opposition: (1)
Plaintiffs’ Motion is untimely; (2) Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration would result in extreme prejudice to Defendant because this
matter has been in arbitration since January 3, 2023; and (3) The grant of
review of the Ochoa/Ford Motor Warranty decision appears consistent with
the California Supreme Court’s previous order denying the request from
Plaintiff’s counsel to depublish the Felisilda decision as well as the
denial of the petition for review in Felisilda. 
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion is not untimely. Under CCP §1008(c), “[i]f a court at any time determines that there has
been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered,
it may do so on its own motion and enter a different order.” 
Thus, the Court may exercise its authority to
reconsider a prior order based on a change in the law. The Court does have
jurisdiction to reconsider its prior order. 
 
On December 27, 2022, this Court granted Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay this Action.  The Court relied upon an opinion issued by
the Third Appellate District in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 486.  Felisilda held that
a nonsignatory manufacturer can compel arbitration under equitable estoppel
“when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are ‘intimately founded in
and intertwined’ with the underlying contract obligations.” (Id. at
495.) In its December 27, 2022 ruling, this Court found that the arbitration
provision at issue in this case was identical to the one in Felisilda, the
only controlling authority at the time. (12/27/22 Minute Order.)
 
On April 4, 2023, little more than three months after
this Court’s order compelling arbitration, the Second Appellate District
decided Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ford) (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th
1324 (review granted). Disagreeing with Felisilda, the court in Ford found
that plaintiffs’ claims were not “intimately founded in and intertwined” with
the sale contracts because the sale contracts did not intend to cover the
manufacturer’s warranties. (Ford, supra, 89 Cal.App.5th 1324.) Equitable
estoppel did not apply to compel plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims because
plaintiffs were not making use of the terms of the sale contracts. (Ibid.)  There is now a split of authority on this
issue.  
 
In deciding whether to exercise its discretion to
reconsider its December 27, 2022 order, the Court considers the fact that Felisilda
remains good law.  The Court also
considers the fact that this lawsuit was filed on August 16, 2022, nearly 27
months ago, and was compelled to arbitration nearly 23 months ago.  Moreover, arbitration was stayed more than 14
months ago to provide plaintiff an opportunity to move this court for
reconsideration, which Plaintiff did not do until just over two months
ago.  Under the circumstances here, the
Court declines the invitation to reconsider its December 27, 2022 ruling.
 
The motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
