Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' joint statement and opposition to the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents (RPD). The court finds that the motion is moot in part, granted in part, and denied in part.

The motion is moot as to RPD Nos. 24, 35-41, and 46, as the defendant has amended its responses to these requests. The motion is granted as to RPD No. 45, which seeks documents evidencing complaints by owners of the 2018 BMW X1 vehicle regarding repairs during the warranty period. The defendant is ordered to produce a further response to RPD No. 45 within 30 days.

The court denies the motion to compel further response to RPD No. 18, which seeks the operative franchise agreement on the date of sale of the subject vehicle. The defendant's response indicates that it has conducted a reasonable search and diligent inquiry and does not have any responsive documents.

The court also denies sanctions, as the parties have acted reasonably in this matter.
