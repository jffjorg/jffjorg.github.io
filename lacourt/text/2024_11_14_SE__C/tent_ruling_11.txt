Defendant ARTUR SHAKHNAZAROV’s Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement against Defendant OVERSEAS FOOD DISTRIBUTION, LLC is DENIED.  
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This breach of lease action was filed on January 22, 2024. 
 
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff/Landlord ABIMAEL G. GARCIA and Defendant/Tenant
BEST FOR YOU MOVING (by Artur Shakhnazarov) and Defendant ARTUR SHAKHNAZAROV
(“Defendant”) executed a Settlement Agreement. 
 
A Notice of Settlement was FILED on August 22, 2024, and the
Court’s August 22, 2024 Minute Order states: “The Court will retain
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.” (08/22/24 M.O.)

 
Defendant now moves for an order to enforce the terms of the
parties’ July 17, 2024 mediation, wherein the parties apparently agreed that
escrow proceeds being held would be apportioned by the parties. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s Motion should
be denied because the July 24, 2024 Settlement Agreement fully executed by the
parties required that the settlement amount of $89,345.68 be paid to Plaintiff
by no later than July 31, 2024. Plaintiff expressly conditioned the release of
Defendants on the payment of the settlement amount by July 31, 2024. 
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (emphasis
added.) (CCP. §664.6.) Although a judge hearing a section 664.6 motion may
receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment, nothing in section 664.6 authorizes a judge to create
the material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the
parties themselves have previously agreed upon. (Weddington Productions,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793,810.) A settlement agreement is
interpreted according to the same principles as any other written agreement (Leeman
v. Adams Extract & Spice, LLC (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1374.) It
must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it
existed at the time, insofar as that intent can be ascertained and is lawful. (Id.)

 
Under Section 664.6, the Court must be primarily guided by
the terms of the operative settlement agreement. Here, the parties agreed to
the following terms: “In consideration of the execution of this Agreement, the
Tenant Parties shall pay Landlord the amount of $89,345.68… in immediately
available funds by wire transfer, payable on or before July 31, 2024 (the
‘Payment Date’). In the event the Settlement Amount is not paid on or before
the Payment Date, the release of the Tenant Parties shall be null and void.”
(Shakhnazarov Decl., ¶ 8, Ex.
A.)
 
Here, Defendant is asking the Court to enforce the terms
agreed to during a July 17, 2024 mediation. However, the apparent terms of the
July 17, 2024 mediation are not properly before this Court. Pursuant to CCP
§664.6, the Court has authority to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement
only when the agreement is sufficiently definitive to enable the trial court to
give it an exact meaning. (Weddington v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 812.) The July 24, 2024 Settlement Agreement fully executed by the parties
and attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Artur Shakhnazarov requires
Defendant to have paid $89,345.68 on or before July 31, 2024. It is undisputed
that Defendant failed to comply with this express term of the Settlement
Agreement. 
 
Defendant’s request falls outside the scope of the parties’
Settlement Agreement. 
 
The Motion is DENIED.
