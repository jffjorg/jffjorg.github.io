#12
 
Defendant ABIMAEL COLLADO SANTOS’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
Court Clerk to give notice. 
 
 
This action for unlawful detainer concerning real property
located at 7107 Pacific Boulevard, Huntington Park, CA 90255 (“Subject
Property”) was filed by Plaintiff PACIFIC FLORENCE, LLC (“Plaintiff”)  against Defendant ABIMAEL COLLADO SANTOS (in
pro per) (“Defendant’) on July 19, 2024. 
 
Defendant Gloria Martinez generally demurs to the Complaint
on the basis that “plaintiff filed the complaint prematurely as no notice to
Terminate tenancy was served on defendant prior to the summons and complaint.”
(Notice 2:5-10). 
 
“[T]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of
rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.”  (Kruger
v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.) 
 
The Declarations of Service of Notice to Tenant attached to
Plaintiff’s Complaint reflect that the 3 Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was
served by substitute service on June 14, 2024, and then again by mail on June
17, 2024. 
 
The demurrer is OVERRULED.
