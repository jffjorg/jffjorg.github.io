  - "The grant of review of the Ochoa/Ford Motor Warranty decision appears consistent with the California Supreme Court's previous order denying the request from Plaintiff's counsel to depublish the Felisilda decision as well as the denial of the petition for review in Felisilda."
```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the Court's December 27, 2022 Order granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The Plaintiff argued that new case law warrants the Court to reconsider its prior order, citing the California Supreme Court's decision in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ford) (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which disagreed with the Court's prior ruling in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. However, the Judge declined the invitation to reconsider its December 27, 2022 ruling, citing the fact that Felisilda remains good law and the Plaintiff did not move for reconsideration until nearly two months after the arbitrator's order was issued.
