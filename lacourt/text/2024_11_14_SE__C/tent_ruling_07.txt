AMERICA, LLC 
CASE
NO.:  23NWCV01250
HEARING:  11/14/24
 
#10
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Request for Production of Documents (set one) is MOOT in
part; GRANTED in part; and DENIED in part. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This lemon law action
was filed on April 25, 2023. Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”) (set one) Nos. 18, 24,
35-41, 45, and 46. 
In Opposition,
Defendant indicates that it has amended its responses to RPDs Nos. 24, 35, 36,
and 37 and that the Motion is now moot as to these RPDs. Defendant otherwise
stands by its objections.  
On September 12,
2024, this matter was continued and the parties were ordered to meet and confer
and submit a Joint Statement prior to this continued hearing date. 
The Joint Statement
filed on November 6, 2024 indicates that Plaintiff withdraws all RFPs except
for RPD Nos. 18 and 45. (JS 2:5.) 
Therefore, the Motion
is MOOT as to RPD Nos. 24, 35-41, and 46.
The Court will
address the Merits of the Motion as to RPDs 18 and 45. 
RPD No. 18 seeks
the operative Franchise Agreement on the date of sale of the Subject Vehicle
between Defendant and the dealership that sold the Subject Vehicle to
Plaintiff. On November 6, 2024, Defendant served the following Supplemental
Response to RFP No. 18: “Subject to the objections previously stated and
without waiving any objections, BMW NA has conducted a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry and does not have any responsive documents within its
possession, custody or control responsive to this request.” (JS, Ex. A.,
3:5-7.) This response complies with CCP § 2031.230 (Statement of inability to
comply).  It appears no franchise
agreement has ever existed. (JS, 6:9-12.)
 
The motion
to compel further response to RPD No. 18 is DENIED.  
 
RPD No 45 seeks
“ALL DOCUMETNS evidencing complaints by owners of the 2018 BMW X1 vehicle
regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented to YOUR
or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during the warranty period.”
This information is relevant to this action. Moreover, Defendant’s November 6,
2024 Supplemental Response indicates that Defendant “will conduct a diligent
search and make a reasonable inquiry to provide a list of other 2018 BMW X1
vehicles regarding any of the complaints that the subject vehicle was presented
to an authorized repair facility for repair during the warranty period by using
search terms derived from the relevant WVI, and repair orders, or agreed upon
search terms between the parties. Said list will be limited to California
vehicles only. Should such information exist, Responding Party will produce
such.” (JS, Ex, A, 3:23-28.) Defendant is ORDERED to comply with its agreement
to produce a further response to RPD No. 45 within 30 days of the date of the Court’s
issuance of this Order. If no responsive documents exist, Defendant is ORDERED
to indicate such in accordance with the requirements of the Code. 
 
The motion
to compel further response to RPD No. 45 is GRANTED.  
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories or demand for production of documents unless the party subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310,
subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Given the mixed
ruling, sanctions are DENIED.
