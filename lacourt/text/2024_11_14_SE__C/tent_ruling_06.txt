Sydney
M. Desman, Esq.; and Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack’s unopposed motion to
withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff RETHA DIAMOND is GRANTED.  
 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of November 12, 2024.  
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
there is an apparent breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Where the
issue (or conflict) is between the lawyer and client(s), without implicating
other parties, the court can rely on counsel’s sworn declaration absent any
reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that the Attorney Desman’s continued representation would serve the
interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.
