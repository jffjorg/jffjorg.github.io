And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Ryean Brewer, filed a complaint alleging defamation, false light, abuse of process, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the defendant, Julia Weems, based on false statements made in a restraining order filing. The defendant demurred to each cause of action, arguing that the plaintiff's action was filed in retaliation for her own filing of a restraining order and that her litigation activities are privileged under the First Amendment. The judge notes that the defendant failed to comply with the meet and confer requirements of CCP §430.41 and that the demurrer is improperly addressing factual and evidentiary considerations. The judge has ordered that the demurrer be overruled and that the proper vehicle for resolution of this issue is a special motion to strike.
