The tentative ruling states that the demurrer filed by Defendant Abimael Collado Santos to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Pacific Florence, LLC for unlawful detainer is overruled. The plaintiff claims that it served a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit to the defendant, and the court finds that this notice was properly served. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant is in possession of the subject property, which is located at 7107 Pacific Boulevard, Huntington Park, CA 90255, without permission and in default for nonpayment of rent. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure §1161(2) and a 2014 case, Kruger v. Reyes, in support of its ruling. The hearing on this matter is scheduled for November 14, 2024.
