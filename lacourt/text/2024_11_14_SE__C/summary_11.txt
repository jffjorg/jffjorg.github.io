And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Artur Shakhnazarov's motion to enforce the terms of a July 17, 2024 mediation. The mediation agreement is not properly before the court, and the judge must be guided by the terms of the operative settlement agreement, which was executed on July 24, 2024. The settlement agreement requires Defendant to pay $89,345.68 on or before July 31, 2024, and Defendant failed to comply with this term. The judge has denied the motion because it falls outside the scope of the parties' settlement agreement.
