And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Southern California Edison Company's motion to strike portions of the City of Norwalk's Cross-Complaint. The motion seeks to strike the City's first and third causes of action for breach of contract and declaratory relief, as well as the second and fourth causes of action as moot. The judge has denied the motion. The judge finds that the issues raised by the motion are factual and evidentiary, and cannot be determined on the face of the Cross-Complaint. The motion was based on California Civil Code Section 2782(b), which provides that certain provisions in construction contracts with public agencies are void and unenforceable. The judge notes that the City argues that this section does not apply, and/or that exceptions to the section are applicable. The judge has ordered the opposing party to give notice of the ruling.
