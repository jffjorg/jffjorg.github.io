```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings in this case. The defendant argued that the two pending writs in the California Appellate Courts, which challenge the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218), should be stayed to avoid conflicting decisions. However, the judge agrees with the plaintiff that granting the stay would prejudice the plaintiff, and that there is no guarantee that the decisions made by the Court of Appeals would create a definitive ruling on the issue. The judge also notes that the majority of trial courts have held against the District on this argument, and that this trial court has consistently held against the District on this issue.
