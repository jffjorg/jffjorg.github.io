 Case Number:  23LBCV00172    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  S27 Defendants propounded RFAs, set one
and FROGs, set two on Plaintiff on 4/04/24. 
Defendants propounded FROGs, set three, SROGs, set two, and RFAs, set
three on Plaintiff on 4/10/24.
 
On 5/15/24 and 5/16/24, Defendants
filed motions to compel responses to the above interrogatories and to deem the
above RFAs admitted, setting them for hearing on various dates.  On 6/03/24, the Court rescheduled the hearing
on all of the motions to 7/18/24. 
Defendants gave notice of the ruling the same day.
 
To date, Plaintiff has not served
responses to any of the propounded discovery. 
Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiff to respond,
without objections, to the outstanding discovery, deeming the RFAs admitted,
and requiring Plaintiff to pay sanctions.
Defendants’ motions to compel are
granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve
verified responses to the above-detailed interrogatories, without objections,
within five days.  The Court notes that
time is of the essence, as the case is scheduled for trial on 8/06/24.  CCP §§2030.290(a),(b).  
 
Defendants’ motions to deem RFAs,
sets two and three, admitted are also granted. 
CCP §2033.280(a), (b). 
 
Sanctions are mandatory.  §§2030.290(c), 2033.280(c).  Defendants seek sanctions in the varying
amounts in connection with each motion. 
Counsel bills at the rate of $210/hour. 
The Court awards one hour of time to prepare each of these form
discovery motions.  No opposition was
filed and therefore no reply was necessary. 
The Court awards one hour to appear at the hearing on the motions, as
the Court strongly encourages remote appearance.  The Court therefore awards a total of six
hours of attorney time at the requested rate $210/hour, or $1320 in attorneys’
fees.  The Court also awards five filing
fees of $60 each, or $300 in costs.  
 
Sanctions are sought against and
imposed against Plaintiff, in pro per; he is ordered to pay sanctions to Defendants,
by and through their attorney of record, in the amount of $1620, within twenty
days.
 
Defendants are ordered to give
notice.
