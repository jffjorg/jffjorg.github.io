English-text summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of a summons and complaint filed by Daveon Clark against Kiari Kendrell Cephus, Demetrius Deandre Carter, Buzzfeed, Inc., and Contemporary Services Corporation. The plaintiff alleges that he was assaulted and battered while working as a security guard for an event owned and/or operated by the defendants. The defendant moved to quash service, arguing that the address used for service is his mother's house, not his usual mailing address, and that there was no attempt to serve him at a proper address by personal service before effectuating service by substitute service. The judge ruled that the plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show that the Kilpatrick address is the defendant's usual mailing address and granted the motion to quash service.
