English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents (RPD) filed by the Plaintiff, Elsy Henriquez, against the Defendants, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Caliber Motors, Inc. dba Mercedes-Benz of Anaheim. The Plaintiff is seeking to compel the production of a franchise agreement between the Defendants and their dealerships, which the Plaintiff believes will show the standards for dealing with customers and the agency relationship between the Defendants and their dealerships. The Defendant has objected to the request, arguing that the franchise agreement is not relevant to the action and that the Plaintiff has not shown good cause for its production. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to show good cause for the production of the franchise agreement. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff purchased the vehicle from Mercedes-Benz of Long Beach, but had it repaired at Mercedes-Benz of Anaheim, which makes it less clear how the franchise agreement with Long Beach would be relevant to the repairs performed at Anaheim.
