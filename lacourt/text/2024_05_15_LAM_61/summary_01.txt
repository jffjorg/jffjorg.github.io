And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Milgard Manufacturing, LLC (Defendant) to add affirmative defenses to its answer to Guild GC, Inc.'s (Plaintiff) complaint. The Defendant seeks to add three affirmative defenses: "bulk supplier doctrine," "warranty not part of basis of bargain," and "sophisticated user doctrine." The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the proposed defenses fail as a matter of law. The Defendant argues that the basis for the affirmative defenses was discovered during depositions of the affected homeowners. The judge grants the motion as to the 57th affirmative defense for "warranty not part of basis of bargain" and denies the motion as to the other two affirmative defenses. The judge notes that the Plaintiff has not shown any prejudice as a result of the delay in seeking leave to amend, and that the Plaintiff could have alleviated some of its own prejudice by stipulating to amend prior to filing the present motion.
