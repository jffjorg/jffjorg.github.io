 Case Number:  24TRCV00488    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  P Application for Default JudgmentThe court considered the application for default judgment.RULINGThe application for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.DISCUSSIONPlaintiff Guy Edwards seeks to enter default judgment against defendants JAF Investments Inc. and John Fowler in the total amount of $545,195.14 consisting of: (1) $336,878 in principal; (2) $25,500 in loan fees; (3) $33,687.80 in late fees; (4) $141,174.29 in prejudgment interest; (5) $7,262.40 in attorney fees; and (6) $692.65 in costs.Upon review of the application as submitted, it is noted that it contains several deficiencies. First, the judgment amount identified in the CIV-100 compared with what is listed in the proposed judgment are not identical. Second, the CIV-100 fails to include the total demand of the complaint, and instead, it refers to the combined loan principal of $336,878 and “int, costs, fees.” Third, the proposed judgment only lists defendant John Fowler as whom judgment would be entered against. Fourth, the application fails to substantiate that the total amount of money loaned to defendants. Based on the checks and cashier checks issued to the defendants, plaintiff has only substantiated $208,500 of the $336,878 of the total loan principal. Thus, additional evidence is needed.Accordingly, plaintiff’s application for default judgment filed on April 3, 2024 is DENIED without prejudice.
