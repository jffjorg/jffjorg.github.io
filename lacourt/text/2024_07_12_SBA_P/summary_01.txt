The court has issued a tentative ruling on the application for default judgment filed by Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club against Cheree Simmons. The court has denied the application without prejudice. The plaintiff is seeking a total of $63,560, consisting of damages, prejudgment interest, and costs. However, the court has noted that the damages and costs are uncertain, as the plaintiff's declaration does not include exhibits reflecting the damages, and the declaration also states that the plaintiff is seeking only $20,000. Due to this uncertainty, the court has denied the request for default judgment.
