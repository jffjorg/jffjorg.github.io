SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Geraldine Parker’s
(Plaintiff) claim that she was retaliated against and wrongfully terminated
from her employment as a Library Aide with Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District (the District) due to her sincerely held religious beliefs which she
claims exempted her from the requirement to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.  (See First Amended Complaint (FAC)
p.2:5-14, ¶¶1, 16-52).  Plaintiff also
alleges that during her employment she “suffered racial discrimination from
some of the teachers” and was retaliated against for reporting the
discrimination.  (FAC ¶¶15, 100).  
 
On 5/17/23, Plaintiff, representing herself, filed this
action against the District and several of its employees.  On 6/7/23, Plaintiff filed her operative
First Amended Complaint against the District and several of its employees for:
(1) Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 
(2) Wrongful Termination of Employment in Violation of
Public Policy; (3) Violation of Labor Code 1102.5; (4) Retaliation in Violation
of FEHA;  (5) Violation of Labor Code
232.5; 
(6) Government Code Section 911.2; (7) Government Code
Section 945.6; (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (9) Negligent
Hiring, Supervision and Retention; (10) Failure to Take All Reasonable Steps
Necessary to Prevent Discrimination, Retaliation, and Harassment in Violation
of FEHA and (11) Negligence/Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 8/9/23, the District and its certain of its employees,
Alberto Carvalho, Adam Grable and Kristen Kaiser Murphy (Individual Defendants
and collectively with the District, Defendants) filed and served a demurrer to
the entire First Amended Complaint and a motion to strike seeking an order
striking Plaintiff’s representation that she is an attorney made on page 1 line
3 of the First Amended Complaint.  On
10/17/23, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, in part, and
without leave to amend, in part, and granted the motion to strike without leave
to amend.  (See 10/17/23 Minute
Order).  
 
On 9/20/23, Defendants Randy Chung, Julie Hall Panameno,
Leanne Hannah, David Palmer, Jer-Lynn Reid and Shiwonda Wynn (Defendants) filed
the instant demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint.  On 10/23/23, Plaintiff filed and served an
opposition to the demurrer.  Also, on
10/23/23, Plaintiff filed and served a Request for Dismissal of the First
Amended Complaint as to Defendants David Palmer, Jer-Lynn Reid, Julie
Hall-Panameno, Leanne Hannah, Randy Chung, Shiwonda Wynn, Megan K. Reilly and
Jeanie Raphelt.  On 10/25/23, the
Defendants filed a reply to the opposition with a notation that it was filed
“in an abundance of caution” because the Request for Dismissal had not yet been
entered.  (See Reply, p.2 fn.1). 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The dismissal of the demurring Defendants from the First
Amended Complaint on 10/23/23 renders the instant demurrer moot.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is placed off calendar as moot.
