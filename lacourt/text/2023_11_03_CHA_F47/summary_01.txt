And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by defendants Randy Chung, Julie Hall Panameno, Leanne Hannah, David Palmer, Jeri-Lynn Reid, and Shiwonda Wynn is placed off calendar as moot. The demurrer was filed in response to the First Amended Complaint, which alleges various claims against the defendants, including retaliation and wrongful termination. However, the defendants who were the subject of the demurrer have since been dismissed from the case, rendering the demurrer moot. The Judge notes that the dismissal of the defendants was filed on October 23, 2023, and the reply to the opposition was filed on October 25, 2023, in an abundance of caution.
