19STCV40636
Motion to Vacate
Conditional Dismissal and Enter Judgment
 
            The Court posts
this tentative order on Monday, March 25, 2024, and provides the following
notice: Plaintiff’s counsel filed this motion on November 16, 2023, and Defendant
did not file an opposition.  Therefore,
unless Defendant appears on the morning of the hearing, either remotely or
in-person, to oppose the motion or request a continuance, the Court shall take
the hearing off-calendar and shall adopt the following tentative order without
a hearing.
            
            Plaintiff
moves to vacate the conditional dismiss and enter judgment.  Plaintiff filed this collections action on or
about November 12, 2019.  (See
Declaration of Scott D. Dyle, ¶ 2.)  The
parties entered into a settlement agreement on or about October 13, 2020.  (See Declaration of Scott D. Dyle, ¶ 3.)  Per the agreement, Defendants agreed to pay
Plaintiff the sum of $63,198.72 plus costs. 
(See Declaration of Scott D. Dyle, Exh. A, ¶¶ 4.)  Per the agreement, Defendants agreed that if
they fail to do so, “the Court can enter a judgment against Defendants in the
amount of $63,198.72 plus costs.”  (See
Declaration of Scott D. Dyle, Exh. A, ¶ 5.) 
The parties stipulated that the Court may retain jurisdiction to enforce
the agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  (See Declaration of Scott D. Dyle, Exh. A, ¶¶
13, 18.)  Defendants have not made any
payments pursuant this settlement agreement. 
(See Declaration of Scott D. Dyle, ¶ 10.)
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion is granted.
 
            2.         The Court sets aside the conditional
dismissal and enters judgment in the amount of $63,198.72 in damages plus $563
in costs for a total of $63,761.72.  
 
            3.         The Court shall sign the proposed
judgment, which was lodged with the motion.
 
            4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
