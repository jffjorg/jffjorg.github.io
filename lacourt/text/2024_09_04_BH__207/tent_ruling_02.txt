[1] The Court has discretion whether to consider
late-filed papers.  (California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300(d).)  Because Defendant
filed the opposition on Plaintiff’s deadline to file a reply, considering the
Opposition would unfairly deprive Plaintiff of his due process rights.  Further, because trial is less than two
months away, the Court cannot continue the hearing to allow Plaintiff time to
file a reply.  As such, the Court
declines to consider the Opposition papers.
