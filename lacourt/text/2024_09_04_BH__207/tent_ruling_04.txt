OPPOSING PARTY


None



 
The Court has reviewed the petitions
submitted by Petitioner Alexander Bowen Martin (“Petitioner”) on behalf of Claimants Whitcomb Aldo Martin
and Bowen Thomas Martin (collectively, “Claimants”), and continues the hearing to
September 30, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207 to address or resolve the
following issues:
 
·      
Petitioner
has not been appointed as the Guardian Ad Litem for Claimants.  Further the Court notes that Applications and
Orders for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem have not been filed with the Court.  
 
·      
Section 3:  The claims of the minors (Claimants) are the
subject of the complaint filed in this action on June 20, 2024.  But Petitioner marked Section 4a [minor “is
not the subject of a pending action or proceeding”].    
 
·      
Section
11:  Petitioner is not a party to the
action, but Petitioner’s response to Section 11.b.(3) indicates that Petitioner
is a party (a plaintiff).  Further, Petitioner
does not adequately explain why he will be receiving $50,000 in settlement
proceeds when he is not a party to the action and has not asserted any claim
(see Complaint), including a  claim for emotional
distress.   
 
·      
Sections
6,7 & 8 (Claimant Bowen).  The Court
finds Petitioner’s responses to Sections 6, 7 and 8 to be inherently
inconsistent and unverified.  Foremost,
Petitioner claims that the Claimant experienced Anxiety as a result of the
incident.  Then, Petitioner claims that
the Claimant did not receive any treatment for the alleged Anxiety; yet
Petitioner claims that the Claimant has completely recovered from the effects
of the Anxiety.  The Court is uncertain
as to how Petitioner can pronounce that the Claimant has fully recovered from
the Anxiety when the Claimant has not been examined or treated by a health care
provider.  In turn, if the Claimant needs
health care treatment to address the Anxiety in the future, the Court is
concerned that the $20,000 in settlement proceeds allotted to the Claimant may
be woefully insufficient.  
 
            Petitioner
shall file amended petitions on or before September 23, 2024 with the requisite  MC-351s, addressing or resolving the issues
set forth above.
 
            Petitioner
shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of
service forthwith.
