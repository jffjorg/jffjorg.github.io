And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petitions submitted by Petitioner Alexander Bowen Martin on behalf of Claimants Whitcomb Aldo Martin and Bowen Thomas Martin. The court finds that Petitioner has not been appointed as the Guardian Ad Litem for Claimants and that Applications and Orders for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem have not been filed. The court also notes that Petitioner's responses to certain sections of the petition are inconsistent and unverified.

The court expresses concern about the sufficiency of the $20,000 in settlement proceeds allotted to Claimant Bowen, given that Petitioner claims the Claimant has fully recovered from Anxiety without providing evidence of treatment or examination by a healthcare provider. The court orders Petitioner to file amended petitions with the requisite MC-351 forms and to provide notice of the court's orders with a proof of service forthwith. The hearing is continued to September 30, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207 to address or resolve the issues set forth above.
