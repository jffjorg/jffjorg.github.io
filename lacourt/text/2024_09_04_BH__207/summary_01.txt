And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a business records subpoena served on Factor's Famous Deli by Defendant Antonio Gomez Pineda, Jr. The subpoena seeks employment records of Plaintiff Adam Thomas Wolf, including records from May 6, 2014 to the present. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena invades his constitutional right to privacy and is not narrowly tailored, while the defendant argues that the records are necessary for their claim or defense.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has not established a serious invasion of his privacy rights and that the disclosure of the employment records would not be a serious violation of his privacy. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's diminished reasonable expectation of privacy in his employment records, as he has already put these records at issue by seeking damages for lost wages and loss of earnings capacity.

The judge limits the time period of the requested discovery to December 16, 2017 to the present, and denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The judge grants the motion to quash in part, but denies it in all other respects, including the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the court's order and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
