And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the complaint without prejudice due to procedural issues. The motion was denied because the declaration filed by Plaintiffs did not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b), which requires a declaration that states facts under penalty of perjury about why the amendment is necessary and proper, and when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered. The Court notes that the declaration provided by Plaintiffs was unclear and difficult to follow, and that much of the information presented had no evidentiary value. The Court orders Plaintiffs to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
