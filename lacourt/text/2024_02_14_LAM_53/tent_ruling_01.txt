  Case Number:  22STCV38301    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  53 Forex Express Corp. v. Inter
& Co. Payments, Inc.  22STCV38301 
Ex
Parte Application  February 14, 2024
After
considering the papers and evidence filed in support of, and in opposition to, plaintiff’s
ex parte application, the court finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the
requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an
applicant for an ex parte order must make an affirmative factual showing in a
declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of
irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for granting plaintiff’s
ex parte requests for a temporary restraining order and expedited discovery.  The court therefore denies plaintiff’s ex
parte request to issue that relief. 
The
court grants plaintiff’s request to issue an order to show cause re preliminary
injunction pursuant to the separate “Order re Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application”
signed and filed by the court today.
   The
court orders the parties’ counsel to meet and confer no later than February 21,
2024, (1) to determine whether defendant Eliran Grushkowsky has possession,
custody, or control of the MacBook Pro laptop computer with serial number
C02X433WJG5K that is the subject of the court’s order to show cause re
preliminary injunction issued today, and (2) if so, to try to enter into a
stipulation for a protocol for  preserving
that laptop and its data, and for defendant Eliran Grushkowsky to produce that
laptop for plaintiff’s inspection and copying. 

The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order and the “Order re Plaintiff’s Ex
Parte Application” signed and filed by the court today.
