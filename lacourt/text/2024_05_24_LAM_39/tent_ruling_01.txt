MOTION


Motion
  to Set Aside Default Judgment




MOVING PARTIES


Defendant BDB Properties, Inc.




OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff
  SoCal Lien Solutions



 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff SoCal
Lien Solutions (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant BDB Properties, Inc. (“Defendant”) to
collect sums due for construction work. 
In its order of September 2, 2022, the Court entered judgment by default
against Defendant.  Defendant moves to
set aside the default judgment Plaintiff took against Defendant.  Plaintiff opposes the motion.  The Court previously considered this motion
and, in its order of January 17, 2024, continued the matter for further
briefing.
 
DISCUSSION
“There are four
grounds which a court, utilizing its equity capacity may rely upon to provide
relief from a default. Those areas are (1) void judgment, (2) extrinsic fraud,
(3) constructive service, and (4) extrinsic mistake.”  (Stiles v. Wallis (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 1143, 1147.)  The Court may
set aside the default judgment as void if Defendant did not have “actual or
constructive notice” of the proceedings. 
(Lovato v. Santa Fe Internat. Corp. (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 549,
553.)
Plaintiff served
Defendant via the Secretary of State.  A plaintiff may serve summons on a corporation via the
Secretary of State if the plaintiff obtains a court order based on a factual
showing that the corporate defendant has failed to file with the Secretary of
State the annual statement of names and addresses of corporate officers and
agents for service of process required by Corporations Code section 1502, or
that the designated officers or agents cannot be found after diligent
search.  (Corps. Code, § 1702, subd. (a).) 

In its order of June 8, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
application to serve Defendant via the Secretary of State.  Plaintiff served the Secretary of State on
June 20, 2022.  (See Notice of Lodging
Record of Service of Process, filed December 28, 2023.)  Defendant thereafter had until August 1, 2022
to respond.  However, the return from the
Secretary of State shows that the Secretary of State inexplicably did not serve
Defendant until October 24, 2022, after Plaintiff took judgment by default
against Defendant.  See Notice of Lodging
Record of Service of Process, filed December 28, 2023.)  It therefore appears that Defendant did not
receive actual or constructive notice of this action in time to respond.  The Court, therefore, sets aside the default
and default judgment as void.  
Defendant also seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5.  A defendant must
seek relief under section 473.5 within two years after entry of default
judgment or 180 days after service of written notice that default or default
judgment has been entered, whichever comes first.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff served Defendant with written
notice of the entry of judgment on September 6, 2022.  Plaintiff had until March 10, 2023 to seek
relief under section 473.5.  Plaintiff’s
motion for relief under section 473.5 is, therefore, untimely.
Plaintiff argues
that Defendant cannot seek relief based on Koski v. U-Haul Co. (1963)
212 Cal.App.2d 640.  In that case, the
Court held, “service upon the Secretary of State is permissible . . . , and
when such service is properly made, it is personal service and relief is not
available to the corporation by motion under section 473a of the Code of Civil
Procedure.”  (Id. at p. 645.)  Here, however, Defendant shows that the
Secretary of State did not complete service. 
Pursuant to Corporations Code section 1702, “the Secretary of State shall
give notice of the service of the process to the corporation at its principal
office, by forwarding to such office, by registered mail with request for
return receipt, the copy of the process . . . .”  (Corp. Code, § 1702, subd. (b), emphasis
added.)  Further, “[t]he certificate of
the Secretary of State, under the Secretary of State's official seal,
certifying to . . . the giving of notice thereof to the corporation and the forwarding
of such process pursuant to this section, shall be competent and prima facie
evidence of the matters stated therein.” 
(Id. at subd. (c).)  While
Plaintiff contends the statutory scheme for service of process via the
Secretary of State does not require the Secretary of State to serve Defendant
to complete service of process, these provisions make it clear the Secretary of
State must give Defendant notice of the proceedings by certified mail for
service to be effective.  Defendant has
shown the Secretary of State did not timely do so.  As such, Defendant has shown it did not
receive proper notice of this action.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The motion is
granted.  The Court vacates the default
and default judgment taken against Defendant.
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
