And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Florian Hamm, was served by publication, but contends that the service was improper. The plaintiff, Pricaspian Development Corporation, failed to prove damages exceed the record before the court and did not select the most likely newspaper to provide actual notice to the defendant. The declaration in support of service was also defective, as it lacked personal knowledge of the underlying facts. The court finds that the default judgment is void and grants the motion to set aside the judgment.
