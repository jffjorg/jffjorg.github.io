MOTION


Motion
  to Set Aside Default Judgment




MOVING PARTIES


Defendant Florian Hamm




OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff
  Pricaspian Development Corporation



 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Pricaspian
Development Corporation (“Plaintiff”) obtained a default judgment against
Defendant Florian Hamm (“Defendant”). 
The court entered the default judgment on January 6, 2012.  Defendant moves to set aside the default
judgment Plaintiff took against Defendant. 
Plaintiff opposes the motion.  
 
DISCUSSION
“There are four
grounds which a court, utilizing its equity capacity may rely upon to provide
relief from a default. Those areas are (1) void judgment, (2) extrinsic fraud,
(3) constructive service, and (4) extrinsic mistake.”  (Stiles v. Wallis (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 1143, 1147.)  The Court may
set aside the default judgment as void if Defendant did not have “actual or
constructive notice” of the proceedings. 
(Lovato v. Santa Fe Internat. Corp. (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 549,
553.)
Here, Plaintiff
served Defendant by publication.  Defendant
contends service was improper.  The
default judgment is void if Plaintiff did not properly serve Defendant.  (Gibble v. Car-Lene Research, Inc.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 295, 313.)  Unlike
other service methods, a plaintiff must obtain a court order prior to serving a
defendant via publication. Strict compliance with the statutory requirements is
required.  (County of Riverside v.
Sup. Ct. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 443, 450.)  To obtain an order for publication, the
plaintiff must show reasonable diligence in serving the defendant by some other
manner.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.50,
subd. (a).)  The plaintiff must establish
reasonable diligence via the testimony of an individual with personal knowledge
of the efforts to serve the defendant.  (Olvera
v. Olvera (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 32, 42.)  Likewise, the plaintiff must establish that a
cause of action exists against the defendant via the testimony of an individual
with personal knowledge of the underlying facts.  (Harris v. Cavasso (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d
723, 726.)
In determining
whether a judgment is void for lack of proper service, the Court considers only
“the summons, with the affidavit or proof of service . . . .”  (Kremerman v. White (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th
358, 370-371.)  Here, Defendant’s
arguments that Plaintiff should have located Defendant to serve him, that
Plaintiff did not select the newspaper most likely to provide actual notice to
Defendant, and that Plaintiff failed to prove damages exceed the record before
the court and rely on extrinsic evidence. 
As such, Defendant was required to raise this argument within two
years.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5,
sub. (a); Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1123.)  Defendant failed to do so, and, therefore,
those are not valid grounds to grant defendant’s motion.  
However, Defendant
also argues the declaration in support of Plaintiff’s application to serve
Defendant by publication was defective, because it does not state a cause of
action against Defendant.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.50, subd. (a).)  The
declaration must state the facts of the cause of action against Defendant based
on personal knowledge.  (Harris v.
Cavasso (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 723, 726.) 
In support of Plaintiff’s application to serve Defendant by publication,
Plaintiff advanced only the declaration of his counsel, R. Jeffrey Neer
(“Counsel”).  (See Exhibit A to Motion to
Set Aside and Vacate Default and Default Judgment.)  Counsel failed to address the underlying
facts of Plaintiff’s claim.  Further,
Counsel lacked personal knowledge of the underlying facts.  As such, Plaintiff’s application to serve
Defendant by publication was defective. 
The court grants the motion to set aside the default and default
judgment as void.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The motion is
granted.  The court vacates the default
and default judgment taken against Defendant.
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
