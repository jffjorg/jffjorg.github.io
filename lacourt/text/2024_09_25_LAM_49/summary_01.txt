And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint and the motion to strike. The case involves a breach of habitability claim filed by tenants against their landlord, Abbey Apartments, L.P., and its property management company, SRHT Property Management Company.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint in its entirety, finding that the allegations of continuous accrual of claims and patterns of similar conduct by the defendants are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations of punitive damages are supported by sufficient facts.

The judge has expressed frustration with the constant over-pleading of lawsuits by plaintiffs' lawyers, suggesting that plaintiff's counsel modify its standard cut-and-paste habitability complaints accordingly.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint within 21 days and has ordered the plaintiffs to give notice, unless waived. The case is set for hearing on September 25, 2024.
