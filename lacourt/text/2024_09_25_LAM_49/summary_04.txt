And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Jeffery William Merriman against Defendant Progressive Direct Insurance Company. The court sustains the demurrer to each cause of action in the First Amended Complaint, including breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, harassment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that the Plaintiff's claims do not state a cause of action and that the allegations are insufficient to support the claims.

The court gives the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to attach the governing contract to the complaint or to adequately plead the relevant terms of the insurance policy by their legal effect. The court also orders the Defendant to give notice, unless waived.

The court finds that the Plaintiff's claims are subject to demurrer and that the allegations do not amount to outrageous conduct as a matter of law. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's claims for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress are subject to demurrer and that the allegations do not state a cause of action.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to modification or revision at the hearing, which is scheduled for September 25, 2024.
