And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by both the plaintiff and defendant. The ruling grants some motions, denies others, and sets limits on the evidence that can be presented during the trial.

The plaintiff's motions were partially granted and partially denied. The motion to exclude exhibits during opening statements was granted, but counsel are encouraged to exchange evidence and objections outside the presence of the jury. The motion to exclude witnesses was granted, and the motion to exclude insurance and settlement discussions was granted in part, except for medical insurance, which can be referenced for the reasonable value of services rendered.

The defendant's motions were also partially granted and partially denied. The motion to exclude common carrier evidence was granted, and the motion to exclude new claims was granted in part, subject to the defendant conducting discovery to establish the full scope of claims. The motion to exclude prior medical conditions was denied without prejudice.

The judge also set limits on the evidence that can be presented during the trial. For example, counsel are not allowed to use evidence not disclosed in discovery, and the court will engage in questioning of the jury to ensure they can render a substantial verdict.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to ensure a fair and equitable trial by limiting the evidence that can be presented and encouraging counsel to exchange information and objections outside the presence of the jury.
