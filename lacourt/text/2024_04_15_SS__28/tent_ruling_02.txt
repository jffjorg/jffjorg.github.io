PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Emma Silva (“Claimant”). 
DISCUSSION      
In
the Court’s March 5, 2024 order, the Court asked Petition to explain the
discrepancy between the different figures given for the Medi-Cal payments
($10,708.96 versus $13,977.62).
The
declaration of Sebastian Russell states: “As of the date of settlement,
DHCS/Medi-Cal had only received billing and had paid $10,708.96 in medical
bills on behalf of its beneficiary, Emma Silva. The additional $3,268.66 in
payments made by DHCS/MediCal were made between the time they asserted its lien
in December 2023 and February 2024 when the billing records were requested.”  (Russell Dec. ¶ 5.) 
The statement
in the Russell declaration addresses the issue raised in the Court’s March 5,
2024 order.  The Court grants the
petition.
