And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses the State's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff alleges that the State is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property. The State argues that the condition was not dangerous as a matter of law and that the Plaintiff was not owed a duty to warn of the decreasing height clearance.

The Court concludes that the State has not carried its initial burden of showing that the condition did not create a hazard to those who foreseeably would use the property or adjacent property with due care. The State also fails to show that it had actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition.

The Court also addresses the State's design immunity defense, concluding that the State has established the first element of design immunity (causal relationship between the plan or design and the accident) and the second element (discretionary approval of the plan or design prior to construction). The Court finds that the State has satisfied the discretionary approval element by showing that the design plans were approved in advance
