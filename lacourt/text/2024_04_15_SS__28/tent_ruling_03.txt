BACKGROUND 
On
May 6, 2022, Plaintiffs Juan Carlos Meza, Rosa Sandoval Villasenor, Maria Contreras,
and Carlie Sandoval, a minor, by and through her guardian
ad litem Juan Carlos Meza, filed this action against Defendants Carlos Delgado
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for negligence and negligence per se. 
On
July 6, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
September 8, 2022, the Court found that this case (case number 22STCV15123) and
case number 22STCV09631 are related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 22STCV09631
became the lead case. The cases were assigned to Department 28 at Spring Street
Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
January 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
March 19, 2024, Petitioner Juan Carlos Meza (“Petitioner”)
filed a petition to approve minor’s compromise to be heard on April 15, 2024.
On April 8, 2024, Petitioner filed an amended petition. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Carlie
Sandoval (“Plaintiff”). 
DISCUSSION      
The
gross settlement amount for Plaintiff is $7,250.00.  Plaintiff incurred $2,625.00 in medical
expenses, which will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  Attorney’s fees are $1,812.00.  The net balance is $2,813.00. 
Section
18b of the petition asks that the net balance of $2,813.00 be paid or delivered
to a parent of the minor, without bond, on the terms and under the conditions
specified in Probate Code sections 3401 and 3402, and that the money or other
property be delivered to the parent whose name and address are specified in
Attachment 18b(5).  However, the petition
does not include an Attachment 18b(5). 
Section
8b(2) of the proposed order states that the net balance will be
disbursed to Plaintiff “by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Juan Carlos
Delgado.”  The guardian ad litem is Juan
Carlos Meza.  The Court denies the petition without prejudice.
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for
approval of the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Carlie Sandoval filed
by Petitioner Juan Carlos Meza on March 19, 2024. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
