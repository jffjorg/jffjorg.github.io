And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the motion to compel the deposition of General Motors LLC's person most qualified. The motion was filed by Angel Martinez Ramirez and German Zea, who are seeking to compel the deposition after General Motors LLC refused to provide a witness for the deposition. The judge found that General Motors LLC failed to appear for the deposition and therefore granted the motion. However, the judge declined to rule on whether the deponent must answer questions related to specific categories. The judge also denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The deposition shall be conducted within 30 days of this order or a date stipulated by the parties.
