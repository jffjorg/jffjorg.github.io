Background
Pleadings
Plaintiffs filed this “lemon law”
suit against Defendants (1) BMW of North America, LLC (“Defendant”) and (2)
Does 1-10 on August 18, 2023. The Complaint alleges three causes of action
under the Song-Beverly Act (the “Act”): (1) breach of express warranty, (2)
breach of implied warranty, and (3) violation of Section 1793.2(b) of the Act.
The claims arise from Plaintiffs’
purchase of a used car (the “Vehicle”) from Defendant. Plaintiffs allege that
the Vehicle was delivered to Plaintiffs with, and later on continued to develop
more serious defects and noncomformities with warranty. Plaintiffs seek relief
in the form of restitution, actual damages, consequential and incidental
damages, a two-time civil penalty, and attorney’s fees and costs. 
Motion Before the Court
On May 2, 2023, Plaintiffs’ second
and third causes of action were dismissed via Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication. 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiffs served
on Defendant Requests for Production of Documents (“RPDs”) (Set Two). 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiffs
moved to compel Code-compliant responses without objections to RPDs, Set Two. Plaintiffs
claim they were stonewalled by Defendant, receiving no response whatsoever.
They further contend that they received no response to their August 15, 2023
attempt to meet and confer, in which letter they referenced a prior agreement
to extend the deadline to August 14, 2023, and further extending the time for
response to August 22, 2023, but without objections. (Daghighian Decl., ¶ 12
and Exh. D.) The motion did not seek sanctions.
Defendant opposed the motion on November
30, 2023 and argued that it provided timely and properly served responses on
August 25, 2023, pursuant to agreed extensions. (Edel Decl., ¶ 4.) However, no
documentation of those extensions was provided, and the correspondence attached
by Plaintiffs suggest that the agreed upon deadline for production of documents
in connection with RPDs, Set Two was August 14, 2023. (Daghighian Decl., Exh.
D.) In its Opposition, Defendant further contends that it had previously served
responses to RPDs, Set One, which were served on Defendant on an unspecified
date. The substance of the Opposition is in the nature of a motion to compel further
responses, rather than a motion to compel responses in the first instance.
Although Plaintiffs’ motion, as a motion to compel initial responses, did not
require a Separate Statement, Plaintiffs filed one (on August 28, 2023). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
Plaintiffs filed a Reply on
December 6, 2023, reiterating that the only extension granted was to August 14,
2023, and reattaching the meet and confer letter that requested further responses
without objections and documents by August 22, 2023. (Reply Daghighian Decl.,
at ¶¶ 4-6, Exh. A.)
Motion to Compel Initial Production

a.    
Legal
Standard for Motions to Compel an Initial Response
A
motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did
not serve a timely response to a demand to produce. Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300 provides, in
pertinent part, 
            If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). . . . 
(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. 
 (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a), (b), (c).)  A
responding party must serve responses to a propounding party’s request for
production within thirty (30) days of service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) 
To succeed on a motion to compel an
initial response, a movant must show: (1) proper service (see Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.040); (2) expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days
after service or on date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b)); and (3) no timely response (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300).
b.    
Motions to
Compel Responses are Different Than Motions to Compel Further Responses 
            In addition to filing a
motion to compel responses when no timely responses are served, parties engaged
in discovery may file motions to compel further responses if responses are
received, but the responses are inadequate. Code of
Civil Procedure Section 2031.310 provides, in pertinent part, 
“On receipt
of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1)  
A statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2)  
A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§
2031.310, subd. (a).) 
Unlike motions to compel, motions to compel further require
meet and confer declarations showing good faith attempts to informally resolve
each issue. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1), 2031.310, subd. (b)(2), 2033.290, subd. (b).) Moreover, unlike
motions to compel, motions to compel further inherently assume that some
response, albeit an inadequate one, has already been made. 
Analysis
            The success of the motion hinges on whether Defendant
provided timely responses to Plaintiffs’ RPDs. While Defendant contends that there
was an agreement to extend the response date to August 25, 2023, there is no
documentation of that extension and to the contrary, the correspondence that is
in the file demonstrates that the agreed upon extension date was August 14,
2023. 
            Defendant denies Plaintiffs’ basic premise
that no responses were provided to two sets of RPDs. Defendant alleges in the
introduction to their Opposition Papers that timely responses were provided to
both sets of Plaintiffs’ RPDs. (Opposition, p. 1.) A motion to compel is
appropriate only when no formal response has been served. If Defendant’s
statements are true, the instant motion would be moot. Yet, Defendant failed to
attach any documentation (e.g., its alleged responses to the RPDs, proof
of service of the alleged responses, etc.) to support its statement.
            Moreover, Plaintiffs’
motion would be moot only if Defendant’s alleged responses were timely
served. Here, Defendant alleges that it timely served responses to RPDs, Set
Two on August 25, 2023, pursuant to agreed extensions. (Edel Decl., ¶ 4.) According
to Plaintiffs’ attorney, however, the agreed deadline to respond to RPDs, Set
Two, was August 14, 2023. (Daghighian Decl., Exh. D; Reply,
2:15-3:14, Reply Daghdighian Decl.) This date was documented in the
correspondence. Because Defendant has failed to overcome Plaintiff’s evidence
of the extension date of August 14, 2023, there is no evidence in the record
that Defendant’s responses were in fact timely served.
            Due to the
above deficiencies, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is GRANTED.
Here, Plaintiffs did not seek sanctions,
and thus the Court does not need to reach that issue.
Conclusion
Plaintiffs Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents is GRANTED. Defendant is to
provide Code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days.
