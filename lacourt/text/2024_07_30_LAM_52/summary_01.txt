And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted Security National Insurance Company's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The court has discretion to permit an amendment to any pleading in furtherance of justice, and this discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments. The judge cites two previous court cases, Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court and Howard v. County of San Diego, which support this approach. The judge finds that permitting the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint serves the interest of justice. The judge orders the plaintiff to file the first amended complaint, which is attached to the motion, forthwith.
