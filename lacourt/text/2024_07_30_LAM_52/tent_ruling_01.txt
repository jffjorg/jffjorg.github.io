  Case Number:  23STCV00632    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Security National Insurance Company’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended
Complaint 
Plaintiff
Security National Insurance Company moves for leave to file a first amended complaint.  Courts
have discretion to permit an amendment to any pleading “in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper.” (CCP § 473(a)(1).)  “This discretion should be exercised
liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  Courts exercise their discretion “liberally
to permit amendment,” and “[t]he policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)  Permitting plaintiff to file a first amended
complaint serves the interest of justice.
Plaintiff Security National Insurance Company’s motion for leave to file
a first amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff shall
file the first amended complaint, which is attached to the motion, forthwith.
