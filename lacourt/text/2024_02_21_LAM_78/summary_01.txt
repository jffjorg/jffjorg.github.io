And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant, the State Bar of California, is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike is denied as moot. The Court finds that the rule in question, State Bar Rule 2.30(B)(C), is reasonable and justified. The Court also finds that the plaintiff's equal protection claim fails as a matter of law.

The Court's reasoning is that the rule is designed to allow the State Bar to cover regulatory costs incurred by the conduct of attorneys working in alternative dispute resolution. Inactive licensees, though not authorized to practice law in California, are still subject to discipline by the State Bar for misconduct. By serving in positions where they would be providing legal services, inactive attorneys may be subject to discipline if they commit misconduct while working as arbitrators and mediators. The State Bar would bear the cost of the disciplinary proceedings arising from this misconduct. It is reasonable to conclude that funding the State Bar's regulatory functions is a legitimate government purpose.

The Court also finds that the plaintiff's argument that the rule is unfair because inactive licensees are required to be active licensees when non-attorneys do not have these restrictions is not relevant to the rational basis analysis. The Court concludes that the rule is constitutional and enforceable, and that the plaintiff's claims are without merit.
