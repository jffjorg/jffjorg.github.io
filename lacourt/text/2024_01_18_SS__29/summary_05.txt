And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to requests for admission and to form interrogatories for approximately 90 days so that the parties can complete an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The court denies the defendant's motions to compel initial responses to requests for production and special interrogatories.

The court notes that the plaintiff's motions were filed without first engaging in an IDC, which is a requirement under the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts. The court also finds that the defendant did not properly effect service of the discovery requests, as it only served one of the two electronic service addresses provided by the plaintiff's counsel.

The court cites various California Code of Civil Procedure sections and California Rules of Court rules to support its decision. The ruling also notes that the court may impose monetary sanctions on a party who fails to respond to discovery requests or who engages in other misconduct during the discovery process.
