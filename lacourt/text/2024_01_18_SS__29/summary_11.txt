And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not available for argument on January 18, 2024, and is continuing the hearing to the next available date. The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to reduce the amount of the appeal bond filed by non-party Infinity Insurance Company is denied. The judge has questions for counsel regarding the amount of the appeal bond, the status of the second appeal, and the phrase "sufficient to litigate the merits of this motion." The judge notes that Infinity's motion is not untimely and that Infinity has standing to bring the motion as the party who is providing the bond. The judge also notes that Infinity did not obtain a clear benefit in choosing to post a bond at the outset of the appeal and that there is no authority that would permit an entity to post a bond at the outset of an appeal and then withdraw it while the appeal remains pending.
