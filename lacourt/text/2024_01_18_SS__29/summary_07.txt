Here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to reopen discovery in the case of Jose Munoz v. Pasy Wang, Rolan Hernandez, et al. The motion was made after the discovery deadlines had expired, but the defendants claimed that they had only recently learned of the missed deadlines due to their lead counsel's illness. The defendants sought to designate their experts and conduct a neuropsychological examination of the plaintiff, but were unable to do so due to the missed deadlines. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants were not diligent in filing the motion and that granting it would give them a strategic advantage without good cause. The judge considered the four factors required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 and found that the defendants had established a need to reopen discovery. The judge granted the motion, resetting the discovery deadlines based on the current trial date.
