And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling takes the plaintiff's motions to compel defendant Target Corporation to provide further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production off calendar. The plaintiff had filed these motions on October 26, 2022, and January 31, 2023, respectively. However, the defendant failed to comply with the requirement set forth in the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The IDCs were eventually scheduled for December 11 and 13, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to appear, and the IDCs were placed off calendar. As a result, the Judge takes the motions off calendar, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
