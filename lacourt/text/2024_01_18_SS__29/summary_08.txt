And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge on a motion to continue trial filed by the defendants, CJ Logistics America, LLC and Won Keun Park. The plaintiff, James Shaff, filed a complaint against the defendants on September 2, 2022, alleging two causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. The defendants filed the motion to continue trial on December 15, 2023, and no opposition has been filed.

The Judge has granted the motion to continue trial in part, finding that the defendants have shown good cause for a continuance due to their difficulty in obtaining material evidence despite diligent efforts. The defendants have served written discovery on the plaintiff, but no responses have been received. The Judge has ordered the trial date to be advanced and continued for approximately four months, and has reset the final status conference and deadlines.

The Judge has considered the legal standard set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 128(a)(8) and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c) and (d), which provide that a court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance. The Judge has also considered the factors set forth in Rule 3.1332(d), including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, and whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance.
