And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a compromise of a disputed claim by a minor, Annie Tapia, who is 16 years old. The judge excuses the personal appearance of Annie and her guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by phone or video conference. The court had previously ordered the petitioner to submit a new petition and proposed order, but this has not been done. As a result, the petition is denied without prejudice, and the petitioner may file a new petition and proposed order. The court also continues the Order to Show Cause (OSC) re dismissal for approximately 60 days. If the petitioner fails to complete the necessary steps, the action may be dismissed at the next OSC hearing, which is scheduled for March 25, 2024.
