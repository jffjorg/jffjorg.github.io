Discussion On October 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant  Target Corporation (“Defendant”) to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests  for Production (Set One) and a motion to compel Defendant to provide further  responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories (Set One).  The hearing on both motions was set for March  27, 2023. On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel  Defendant to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production  (Set Two).  The hearing was set for March  3, 2023. On March 3 and 27, 2023, the Court held that Plaintiff had not  engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”), as required by the Eighth  Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts (“Standing  Order”), directed the parties to participate in an IDC, and continued the  hearings to September 8 and 11, 2023. IDCs were eventually scheduled for December 11 and 13, 2023,  and the hearings were continued to January 18 and 19, 2024. At the IDCs on December 11 and 13, there was no appearance by Plaintiff,  the moving party, and the IDCs were placed off calendar. Given the failure of Plaintiff to participate in an IDC, as required  by the Standing Order, the Court takes the motions off calendar.

Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to provide further  responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production (Set Two), filed January 31,  2023, is taken off calendar.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
