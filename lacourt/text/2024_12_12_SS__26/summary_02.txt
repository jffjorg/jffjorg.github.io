And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Petitioner Brian L. Fitterer's Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned against Respondents Juan Magana and Irma Magana. The petitioner sought a court order deeming the mobilehome abandoned and awarding rent due on the Mobilehome site from October 1, 2021 to July 31, 2024. However, the court found that the petitioner did not meet the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome under Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1). The court also noted that the petitioner's evidence did not demonstrate how it came to determine the amount Respondents are claimed to owe. Additionally, the court took judicial notice that judgment has been entered in LASC Case No. 23PDUD00017 against Griselda Magana in the amount of $25,000.00, which may affect the outcome of the case.
