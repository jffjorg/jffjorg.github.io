And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. The default was entered on August 30, 2024, and the default judgment was entered on November 24, 2024. The defendant, Leslie Wall, had failed to file a responsive pleading and was served with the complaint on August 9, 2024. The defendant claimed that they had submitted the summons and complaint to their attorney, The Law Offices of Gary Saunders, and expected their attorney to respond to the action. The judge found that the defendant's default was the result of their surprise that their attorney did not respond to the action, and that the defendant's motion was timely filed and supported by a sufficient declaration of fault.

The judge also denied the defendant's request for relief under other statutory grounds, including Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, section 473, subdivision (d), and 418.10. The judge did not find that the entry of default was void or that the defendant had a lack of actual notice of the action.

The defendant is ordered to file and serve their answer to the complaint within 20 days of the order.
