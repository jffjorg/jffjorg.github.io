And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Hagop J. Markarian Corporation, has moved to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement and mutual release, and to enter judgment against the defendant, Chris Ramos. The settlement agreement was signed by both parties and their attorneys, and it provides that the defendant would pay the plaintiff a total of $10,126.00 in three installments. The defendant defaulted on the payments, and the plaintiff seeks to enforce the settlement agreement and be awarded prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.

The court finds that the settlement agreement complies with the statutory requirements and that the parties' request for retention of jurisdiction was properly made. The court also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment against the defendant in the amount of $4,563.00 principal, plus ten percent interest from the due date of each payment, attorney's fees of $4,180.00, and costs of $427.30.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion and orders that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $4,563.00 principal, plus ten percent interest from the due date of each payment, attorney's fees of $4,180.00, and costs of $427.30. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
