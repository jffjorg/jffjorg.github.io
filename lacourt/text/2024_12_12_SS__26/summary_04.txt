And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to vacate the entry of default filed by Leslie Wall, an individual. The default was entered on September 25, 2024, after Leslie Wall failed to file a responsive pleading to the complaint filed by Christine Lee. Leslie Wall's motion was filed on October 28, 2024, and was supported by a declaration explaining that Leslie Wall had submitted the complaint to their attorney, The Law Offices of Gary Saunders, on August 9, 2024, and expected them to respond to the action. The declaration demonstrated that Leslie Wall's default was the result of their surprise that their attorney did not respond to the action. The judge found that the default was the result of excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and that Leslie Wall's motion was timely and supported by a copy of their proposed answer to the complaint. The judge therefore vacated the default entered on September 25, 2024, and ordered Leslie Wall to file and serve their answer to the complaint within 20 days of the order.
