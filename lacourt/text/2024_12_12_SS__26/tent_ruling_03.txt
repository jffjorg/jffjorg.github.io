ANALYSIS:
On July 1, 2024,
Plaintiff Hagop J. Markarian Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
breach of contract and common counts against Defendant New Directions for
Youth, Inc. (“Defendant”). On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of
settlement. Two days later, Plaintiff
filed a copy of the parties’ settlement agreement with a request for dismissal
and retention of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The
Court dismissed the action pursuant to the stipulation on September 17, 2024. 
On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Enforce Terms of Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release; to
Enter Judgment Against Defendant; for Prejudgment Interest; and For Attorney’s
Fees and Costs. To date, no opposition has been filed.
Discussion
Plaintiff brings the instant motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure,
section 664.6, which states in relevant part: 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement complies
with the statutory requirements set forth above because it was signed by both
parties and their attorneys. (Motion, Markarian Decl., Exh. 8, p. 6.)
Furthermore, the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Markarian Decl., Exh. 8, ¶15.)
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $10,126.00 through three installments on August
6, 2024, September 1, 2024, and September 30, 2024. (Id. at Exh. 8, ¶2.)
The settlement agreement also provides that in the event of Defendant’s default,
Plaintiff may move to enforce the settlement agreement, and be awarded ten
percent interest, attorney’s fees and costs. (Id. at ¶¶4, 9.) Payments
of $5,563.00 were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted.
(Id. at ¶10; Grossburg Decl., Exh. 11.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
is entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the amount of $4,563.00 principal
($10,126.00 - $5,563.00), ten (10) percent interest from the due date of each
payment, attorney’s fees of $4,180.00 and costs of $427.30. (Id. at ¶¶11-16.)

Plaintiff Hagop J. Markarian Corporation’s
Motion to Enforce Terms of Settlement
Agreement and Mutual Release; to Enter Judgment Against Defendant; for
Prejudgment Interest; and For Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED.
