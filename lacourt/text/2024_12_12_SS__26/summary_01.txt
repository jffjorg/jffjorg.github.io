And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Plaintiff, California Automobile Insurance Company, granting their Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against the Defendant, David Allen Benson dba Benson Crane. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint for automobile subrogation, alleging that the Defendant's negligence caused an electrical surge on the property of the Plaintiff's insured, resulting in damage to the property. The Defendant filed an answer, but the Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings was granted due to the Defendant's admissions in response to the Plaintiff's Requests for Admission. These admissions contradict the Defendant's general denial and affirmative defenses, and establish the facts upon which the Plaintiff's Complaint is based. As a result, the Judge has determined that the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Defendant is ordered to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this order.
