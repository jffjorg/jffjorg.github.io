ANALYSIS: 
On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff Christine Lee (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of lease agreement against Defendant Leslie
Wall, individually (“Defendant Wall”), and Leslie Wall doing business as W2K
Properties, LLC (“Defendant W2K”). Following Defendants’ failure to file a
responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on August 30, 2024 and
October 16, 2024.
The instant Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment
was filed on October 28, 2024 by “Leslie Wall, an individual dba W2K
Properties, Inc.” Plaintiff filed a late opposition on December 4, 2024.
Discussion
As an initial matter, it is
unclear which Defendant filed the instant Motion. There is no defendant named
“Leslie Wall, an individual dba W2K Properties, Inc.” Also, the Motion was
filed in propria persona. However, a corporate entity cannot represent itself
in court. (Clean Air Transport Systems v. San Mateo County Transit Dist.
(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 (citing Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v.
Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).) This rule applies to all
entities regarded as separate from their owners, including partnerships and
unincorporated associations. (See Clean Air Transport Systems, supra, 19
Cal.App.3d at 578.) Therefore, the Court will consider the Motion as being
brought by Defendant Wall.
Defendant Wall moves to vacate the entry of default and
default judgment, and quashing service of the Summons and Complaint. (Notice of
Motion, p. 2:1-5.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)
Defendant Wall moves to vacate the entry of default on
multiple grounds, include Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
Regarding relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b), an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry
of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an
affidavit of party fault attesting to their excusable mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be
accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a
proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)
The Motion was timely filed and served two months after
entry of default against Defendant Wall and is supported by a declaration of
fault that explains Defendant Wall submitted the Summons and Complaint to their
attorney, The Law Offices of Gary Saunders, on August 9, 2024. (Motion, Wall
Decl., ¶1.) Defendant Wall excepted that their attorney would follow up and
respond to the action. (Ibid.) This declaration sufficiently
demonstrates that Defendant Wall’s default was the result of their surprise
that The Law Offices of Gary Saunders did not respond to the action. The Motion
is also accompanied by a copy of Defendant Wall’s proposed answer to the
Complaint. (Id. at Exh. A.)
Plaintiff untimely opposition does not offer any evidence to
overcome Defendant Wall’s showing of excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise
or neglect. It merely argues without support that Defendant Wall was not
represented. Therefore, the Court finds grounds to vacate the entry of default
and default judgment against Defendant Wall under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b).
Other statutory grounds for relief
The Motion also refers to other statutory grounds for
relief, including Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, section 473,
subdivision (d), and 418.10. However, the Motion does not explain how any of
these statutes applies to the facts set forth in Defendant Wall’s supporting
declaration. Section 473.5 pertains to lack of actual notice of the action,
which Defendant Wall admits to having. Section 473, subdivision (d) pertains to
void judgments or orders, but the Motion does not explain why the entry of default
in this action was void. In fact, the Motion does not provide any authority
regarding the request to quash service of the Summons and Complaint under
418.10. Therefore, the request to for relief under these statutes, including to
quash service, is denied.
Finally, the Motion refers to res judicata and collateral
estoppel without providing any legal authority regarding those doctrines and
their applicability to the facts of this action.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Leslie Wall, an
individual’s Motion to Vacate Entry of Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED.
THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON AUGUST 30, 2024 AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTERED ON NOVEMBER
24, 2024, ARE HEREBY VACATED. DEFENDANT LESLIE WALL, AN INDIVIDUAL, IS TO FILE
AND SERVE THEIR ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
