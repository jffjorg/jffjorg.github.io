```

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment and motion for summary adjudication, finding that there are triable issues of material fact as to Plaintiff's claims. The judge concludes that Defendant's termination of Plaintiff was pretextual and that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to prevent, failure to accommodate, and failure to engage in the interactive process.
