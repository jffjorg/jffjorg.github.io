DAVID CURTIS GRIFFITH, et al. 
  
        
  vs.
 
JAGUAR LAND
  ROVER NORTH AMERICA
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV01149
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 23, 2024



 
Plaintiff is awarded
$22,050.00 in reasonable attorney fees.           
 
Given that
Plaintiffs’ motion did not include a verified memorandum of cost, the Court
does not consider the cost award at this time. 

 
On 1/11/2022,
Plaintiffs David Curtis and Stephanie Griffith (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed
suit against Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (Defendant), alleging
violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
 
Now,
Plaintiffs move for $87,821.25 in attorney fees and costs totaling $1,535.53.
 
Legal Standard 
 
The party claiming
attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the reasonableness
of the fees claimed.  (Civic Western Corporation v. Zila
Industries, Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) “Except as attorney’s fees
are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation
of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or
implied, of the parties[.]” (CCP § 1021.)
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”  (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) 
In exercising its discretion, the court should
consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the
attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (Ibid.) 
 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their learning,
their age, and their experience in the particular type of work demanded the
intricacies and importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for
skilled legal training and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed.
(Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 647, 657.) 
 
In
determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar
method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing parties
are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues.  A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the
award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
635 (Serrano IV); see also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable
attorney fees should be based on an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e.,
the market value of services rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise.  (Id. at 1096.)  The trial
court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to,
or without the necessity for, expert testimony. 
(Ibid.)  The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Ibid.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiffs
seek $87,821.25 in attorney fees. This is based on a lodestar of $58,547.50,
and a requested lodestar enhancement of 0.5 in the amount of $29,273.75.
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel claims the following hourly rates for the attorneys who worked on this
case: 
 
-        
Sepehr Daghighian: pre-1/1/2023: $575/hr;
post 1/1/2023: $625/hr 
 
-        
Michael H. Rosenstein: $650-$700/hr[1]
 
-        
Brian T. Shippen-Murray: rate until
3/20/2022: $450/hr; for remainder of 2022: $500/hr; after 1/1/2023: $550/hr 
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s rates are excessive,
given that lemon law cases generally are not complex. The Court agrees. In Morris
v. Hyundai Motor Am. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41, the trial court reduced
the rates of Bryan Altman of the Altman Law Group, who has 30-plus years of
litigation experience with over 100 jury trials, of which 20-plus were as lead
trial counsel in lemon law cases, from $650 to $500 per hour, reduced Steve
Mikhov of the Knight Law Group from $500 to $400, and reduced all the
associates’ rates that ranged from $450 to $350 to $300 per hour. (Id. at 8-9.)
In support of the lower court decision, the court of appeal held that:
 
[E]ven if
Morris established that her attorneys’ rates were generally commensurate with
other consumer law attorneys with the same level of experience and skill,
Morris ignores that there are a number of factors that the trial court may have
taken into consideration in determining that reductions in the attorneys’
hourly rates were warranted. The court reasonably could have reduced the rates
based on its finding that the matter was not complex; that it did not go to
trial; that the name partners were doing work that could have been done by
lower-billing attorneys; and that all the attorneys were doing work that could
have been done by paralegals.
 
            (Id.
at pp. 23-24.)
 
            Similarly,
Judge Randolph Hammock of the Los Angeles County Superior Court recently found
rates of $350 per hour appropriate for an “experienced” lawyer to take a lemon
law case all the way through trial. (See Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 245-46 [“The court found the requested fee amount
“was just not reasonable.”… The court decided that $350 “is a reasonable hourly
rate for the services that were done.”].)
 
            Here,
the Court finds the hourly rates to be unreasonable, and reduces the hourly
rates for each of plaintiffs’ attorneys to a reasonable blended $350 per hour
for all attorneys who litigated this case, consistent with Mikhaeilpoor.
This is based the fact that this case did not address novel or difficult
questions, and was straightforward and simple. No depositions took place and no
trial documents were prepared. 
 
Hours
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel claims a total of 102.6 hours. A review of the billing records
indicates padding and duplicative and unnecessary billings. For example, a
substantial portion of the billing records are for “reviewing,” “analyzing,”
and “conferring.” Given the simplicity of the case, and the limited discovery,
the quantity of such billings indicate padding. Moreover, there are multiple
billings for the same meet and confer. For example, on 7/11/2023, there are
three separate billings for the same meet and confer. After review, the Court
agrees that Plaintiff’s fee award should be reduced consistent with the
proposed reductions in Defendant’s Exhibit A. Accordingly, the Court reduces
the reasonable hours to 63, and thus awards $22,050.00 in reasonable attorney
fees. 
 
            Plaintiff
did not submit a verified memorandum of costs and thus the Court does not
consider the cost request at this time. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
