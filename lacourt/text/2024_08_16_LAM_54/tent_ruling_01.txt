BACKGROUND
 
On August 31, 2021, Plaintiffs Derrick R. Upchurch and Sari M. Upchurch sued
BC Design and Development, Inc., and other defendants for breach of contract,
breach of express and implied warranties, misrepresentation, negligence, and
money due on contractor’s license bond. 
 
Defendants Dario
Acosta Bernal and Sergio Acosta now move for an order determining whether the
proposed $5,000.00 settlement between them and Plaintiffs is in good faith. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 877.6, subdivision
(a)(1),“[a]ny¿party to an action wherein it is alleged that two or more parties
are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a contract debt shall be entitled to a
hearing on the issue of the good faith of a settlement entered into by the
plaintiff or. . . and one or more alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors . . . .”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).) “A determination by the court that
the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or
co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or
co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (c).)¿Although a determination that a settlement was in
good faith does not discharge any other party from liability, “it shall reduce
the claims against the others in the amount stipulated” by the
settlement.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 877, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿¿¿  
 
In¿Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, the California Supreme Court identified the
following nonexclusive factors courts are to consider in determining if a
settlement is in good faith:¿“a rough approximation of plaintiffs' total
recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in
settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a
recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he
were found liable after a trial.¿Other relevant considerations include the
financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as
well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure
the interests of¿nonsettling¿defendants.”¿(Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde
& Associates¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.) 
 
Acosta Defendants argue that the parties entered into the proposed
settlement agreement after an arms-length negotiation at a mandatory settlement
conference. The parties were represented by counsel. Acosta Defendants do not
admit liability. They argue the proposed settlement is a fair apportionment of
their alleged liability because the estimated total cost for the repair of the
purportedly damaged swimming pool was $66,399.80 and Plaintiffs settled with FC
Steel for $64,000.00. There is no opposition to the motion. 
 
            The
motion
is GRANTED.
