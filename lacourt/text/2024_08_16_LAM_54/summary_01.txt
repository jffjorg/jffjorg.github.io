And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of defendants Dario Acosta Bernal and Sergio Acosta to determine whether a proposed $5,000.00 settlement between them and the plaintiffs is in good faith. The motion was unopposed, and the judge considered the moving papers. The settlement was reached after an arms-length negotiation at a mandatory settlement conference, where the parties were represented by counsel. The defendants do not admit liability and argue that the proposed settlement is a fair apportionment of their alleged liability based on the estimated cost of repairing the damaged swimming pool. The judge has considered the relevant factors, including the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. Based on this review, the judge has granted the motion and determined that the proposed settlement is in good faith.
