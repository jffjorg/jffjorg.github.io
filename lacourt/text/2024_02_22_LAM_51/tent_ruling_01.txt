TENTATIVE RULING:    1.      Motion  for Leave to File Proposed Third Amended Complaint is GRANTED without  prejudice. STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:    On October 31, 2022, Plaintiffs Sagi Jacob Cohen and Shlomit  Cohen (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants First Coast Home  Improvement, LLC; First Coast Home Improvement, business entity of form  unknown; Sparkling Stones, LLC; Mariam Kevliyan; Avetis Avetikian aka Avik  Avetikian aka Avik Avetikyan; Narine Avetikyan; Michelle Maghalyan; California  Quest Realty, aka Cal Quest Realty; Pacific Point SW, LLC; Pacific Point Realty  Fund, LLC; and Better Escrow Services (“Defendants.”) The complaint alleges  that Plaintiffs wanted to buy a house and used Defendants to facilitate the  purchase. Plaintiffs signed a Residential Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow  Instructions for a house in Woodland Hills, California. Plaintiffs offer was  allegedly accepted and was told by Defendant Avik to deliver a cashier’s check  for $60,00 to Avik’s company, First Coast Home Improvement. However, Plaintiffs  learned the house was sold and later Defendant Avik told Plaintiffs to wire  $247,722.52 to Better Escrow Services. Plaintiffs discovered that the wired  money was not used to buy the Woodland Hills house, but to purchase an  unrelated property in Altadena. Defendant failed to repay the funds.    On December 6, 2022, Defendant Better Escrow Services filed  an Answer.    On December 29, 2022, Defendant Narine Avetikyan filed a  Demurrer, which was SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.    On April 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended  Complaint.    On May 26, 2023, Defendant Better Escrow Services filed an  Answer.    On May 30, 2023, Defendant Narine Avetikyan filed a Demurrer,  which was SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.   On August 2, 2023, Defendants Mariam Kevliyan and Sparkling  Stones, LLC, filed an Answer.    On October 19, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended  Complaint.   On November 2, 2023, Defendant Better Escrow Services filed  an Answer.   On November 22, 2023, Defendant Narine Avetikyan filed a  demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint.   On January 9, 2024, Defendants Pacific Point Realty Fund,  LLC and Pacific Point SW, LLC filed a demurrer with motion to strike to the  Second Amended Complaint.   On January 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion for  Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint.   On January 31, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Pacific Point SW,  LLC and Pacific Point Realty Fund, LLC.   On February 1, 2024, the court advanced the hearing on  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint to February 21,  2024.   On February 2, 2024, Defendants Sparkling Stones, LLC and  Marian Kevliyan filed a demurrer with motion to strike portions of the Second  Amended Complaint.   Oppositions were due as of February 6, 2024. As of February  15, 2024, no oppositions have been filed.   LEGAL STANDARD    Leave to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure §  473(a) and § 576.  The policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters  in the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of  leave to amend can be justified.  [Citation.]”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422.)   Notwithstanding the “policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the  complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial  [citations], this policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to  the adverse party . . . .’ [citation].  A different result is indicated  ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party’ is  shown. [Citation].”  (Magpali v.  Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)    A motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply  with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324,  which requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what  allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence  was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made  earlier. The motion must also include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered  amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and lines the allegations that  would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect,  necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for  delay.  (See Cal. Rules of  Court, Rule 3.1324(a), (b).)    ANALYSIS:    Plaintiffs contend leave to amend is warranted because they  received documents from, now dismissed, defendants Pacific Point SW, LLC and  Pacific Point Realty Fund LLC providing probable cause that Defendant Narine  Avetikyan was an active participant in the business. Plaintiffs also contend  that Defendants will not suffer prejudice by an amendment.   First, the motion includes the proposed amended pleading.  (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) Second, the motion includes a redlined copy of the  proposed amended pleading indicating the new allegations and any deleted  allegations. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The Points and Authorities  as well as the exhibits substantially comply  with CRC, Rule 3.1324(b), explaining why the amendment is necessary and proper,  when the facts giving rise to the allegations were discovered, and the reasons  why the request for amendment was not made earlier as required by,. The  Declaration of John Deer also attaches and authenticates the Proposed Third  Amended Complaint and various documents produced in discovery. (Deer Decl. ¶¶  2-4.)  Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for  leave to file a third amended complaint .   CONCLUSION:    For the foregoing reasons, the  Court decides the pending motion as follows:   1.        Motion for Leave to File Proposed Third Amended  Complaint is GRANTED.   Moving party is to give notice.    IT IS SO ORDERED.    Dated:             February  22, 2024                   __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder  S.
