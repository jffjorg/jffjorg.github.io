On February 7, 2024, the court advanced the hearing on Defendant’s demurrer
from May 1, 2024 to February 22, 2024.

The court rejects Defendant’s argument that Los Angeles Municipal Code 151.01
et seq. doesn’t apply to the Property. Los Angeles Municipal Code 151.01
defines “Rental Units” as “All dwelling units, efficiency dwelling units, guest
rooms, and suites, as defined in Section 12.03 of this Code, and all housing
accommodations as defined in Government Code Section 12927, and duplexes and
condominiums in the City of Los Angeles, rented or offered for rent for
living or dwelling purposes, the land and buildings appurtenant thereto, and
all housing services, privileges, furnishings and facilities supplied in
connection with the use or occupancy thereof, including garage and parking
facilities.” (emphasis added.) The Property is located in Los Angeles. (FAC. ¶ 2.)
Civil Code § 1947.12 pertains to rent increases and Defendant’s reliance on
carving the Property out is therefore misplaced. Likewise, Civil Code § 1946.2 requires
just cause to terminate a continuous tenancy and lawful occupation of
residential real property for 12 months and does not apply to residential
property “subject to a local ordinance requiring just cause for termination of
a residential tenancy adopted on or before September 1, 2019 . . . .” (Civ.
Code § 1946.2(g)(1)(A).)
