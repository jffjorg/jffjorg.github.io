And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the proposed settlement between Justen L. Jones, a minor, and the defendants Carlos E. Orozco and Avanath Northpointe, L.P. The settlement was reached in response to a dog bite incident that left the plaintiff with multiple lacerations, scarring, back pain, and emotional trauma. The settlement amount is $150,000, which will be used to cover medical expenses, attorneys' fees, and costs of suit. The judge finds the settlement fair and reasonable, but is concerned about the amount of attorneys' fees sought by Counsel (45% of the settlement). The judge typically limits fees in cases involving minors to 25% and wishes to hear from Counsel and the plaintiff's guardian ad litem at the upcoming hearing to determine an appropriate fee. The hearing is scheduled for September 12, 2024, and the parties are reminded that remote appearances are requested.
