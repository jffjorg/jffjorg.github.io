 Case Number:  23LBCV001090    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  S27  
1.     Background Facts
Plaintiff, Cheryl Garlow Garcia filed this action against Defendant,
John F. Kellogg for damages and injunctive relief arising out of the parties’
joint ownership of Nominal Defendant, Island Donuts, LLC.  Plaintiff’s operative complaint is her First
Amended Complaint, which she filed on 2/16/24. 
The FAC includes causes of action for judicial expulsion, conversion,
improper distributions, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and injunctive
and declaratory relief.    
 
2.     Motion
for Preliminary Injunction
On 7/07/23, Plaintiff filed an ex
parte application to preclude Defendant from withdrawing funds or otherwise
taking property the nominal defendant and other related relief.  The Court issued an order that Defendant could
only make withdrawals for the purpose of payment to investors.  The Court denied all other requests for
relief.  The Court set a hearing on
imposition of a preliminary injunction for 9/08/23.
 
Since 9/28/23, the parties have
been repeatedly filing stipulations to continue the hearing on the request for
a preliminary injunction, each time indicating they are attempting to resolve
all outstanding issues between them. 
They filed the most recent such stipulation on 7/09/24.  
 
The Court is hopeful the parties
have concluded their settlement negotiations and the request for injunctive
relief is now moot.  If that is not the
case, the TRO will remain in place and the Court will hear from the parties
concerning the status of their dispute at the time of the hearing.  The Court will reschedule the hearing on the
preliminary injunction and require both parties to file briefs and evidence
concerning the status of the dispute prior to the continued hearing date.
 
The Court asks the parties to
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
