 Case Number:  22LBUD00619    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiff filed this unlawful detainer action on 5/05/22.  After much litigation, Defendant vacated the
premises on 9/24/23.  Because Defendant
vacated the premises, the Court took the trial re: possession off calendar on
9/25/23.  
 
On 12/11/23, the
Court heard and granted Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to amend the complaint to
state a claim sounding purely in breach of contract for unpaid rent.  The Court found CCP §§1952.3, 472, 473, and
464 collectively permitted the relief sought. 
Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint on 12/21/23.    
 
On 4/23/24, the
Court heard and overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the TAC.  On 6/24/24, the Court called the matter for
trial.  Plaintiff appeared and Defendant
did not.  The Court entered judgment in
Plaintiff’s favor in the amount of $35,542.66 (unpaid rent), $7531.21 (plumbing
and repairs), and $1970.37 (utility bills). 
The Court entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice of Defendant’s
cross-complaint.  
 
2.    
Motion
for New Trial
On 7/19/24, Defendant filed a
motion for new trial.  She contends a new
trial is necessary per CCP §657(1), which provides for a new trial when there
has been irregularity in the proceedings of the court.  She contends there was such irregularity
because the Court denied her request for a continuance of the trial due to
illness.  She contends that, at the
6/21/24 FSC, she made an oral request for a continuance and provided copies of
doctor’s notes establishing she could not proceed to trial due to health problems.
 
The motion is denied.  First, Defendant provides no evidence of her
prior health problems with her motion. 
The burden is on Defendant to show she is entitled to a new trial, and
she has provided no evidence in this regard. 
She provided only the Court’s 6/21/24 minute order, which does not
contain any doctor’s notes of evidence of illness; it merely indicates the oral
request for a continuance is denied.
 
Additionally, in opposition to the
motion, Plaintiff correctly notes that Defendant, on 6/24/24, the same day of
the court trial, filed a petition for writ of mandamus.  The Court made a finding, on 6/21/24, that
Defendant was not too ill to appear for trial on 6/24/24.  Her ability to file a petition for writ of
mandamus that same day affirms the Court’s prior finding.  Absent any contrary evidence, the motion for
a new trial is denied.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
