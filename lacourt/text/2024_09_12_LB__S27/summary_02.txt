And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's motion for a new trial. The motion was based on a claimed irregularity in the court proceedings, specifically the denial of a request for a continuance of the trial due to illness. The judge found that Defendant provided no evidence of her prior health problems to support the motion, and that her ability to file a petition for writ of mandamus on the same day as the trial suggests that she was not too ill to appear. The judge also noted that Defendant did not provide doctor's notes or other evidence to support her claim of illness. As a result, the motion for a new trial is denied. The judge orders Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
