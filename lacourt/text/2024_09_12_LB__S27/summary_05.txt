Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on a motion for attorneys' fees filed by Plaintiff Dora Maria Hurtado in a lemon law case against Defendants FCA US LLC and Glenn E. Thomas Dodge Chrysler Jeep. The Plaintiff seeks to recover attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $32,559, while the Defendant argues that the fees are unreasonable and excessive. The Judge has reduced the rates charged by the Plaintiff's attorneys from $455/hour to $400/hour and has also reduced the total fee awarded by 1/3 due to the "canned" work done in the case. The total fee awarded is $18,384.80. The Judge has also noted that the motion also seeks recovery of costs, which will be made in connection with a memorandum of costs filed by the Plaintiff. The parties are ordered to give notice and indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
