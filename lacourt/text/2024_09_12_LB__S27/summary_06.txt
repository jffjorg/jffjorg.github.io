Significant Statements:
  - "The instant case is not one where the defendant has shown that the plaintiff suffers from a chronic pain disorder, where she had a prior injury that may have caused or contributed to her claimed pain in her subject body parts, or where her injuries are so numerous that limiting production by body part would be virtually impossible."
  - "Defendant has, therefore, not shown 'good cause' for production of medical records unrelated to Plaintiff's subject body parts."
  - "If there is a medical record that discusses a problem with a subject body part, it must be produced even if it also mentions another body part that is not the focus of this lawsuit."
  - "By way of example, if Plaintiff went in for a routine physical and complained of back pain, but also underwent blood tests and had a PAP smear conducted, the records relating to blood screening and the PAP would need to be redacted."
  - "If, however, when talking about back pain she also discussed other orthopedic pain, there would be no need for a redaction."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash the deposition subpoena for medical records is granted. The defendant is ordered to propound new subpoenas that seek medical records relating to the subject body parts only. The parties are ordered to meet and confer concerning mutually agreeable language for the subpoenas and the duration of the records to be produced. The judge notes that the defendant has not shown "good cause" for production of medical records unrelated to the plaintiff's subject body parts. The judge also notes that medical records related to unrelated conditions may be discoverable on a showing of "good cause" if the condition is relevant to the issue of proximate causation. The judge has not imposed sanctions on either party. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on the proposed subpoenas and to give notice to the court.
