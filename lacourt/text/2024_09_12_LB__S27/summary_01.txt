And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel responses to special requests for examination (SROGs) and a motion to compel a deposition. The deposition was originally scheduled for August 2, 2024, but was unable to proceed due to issues with the facility. The parties rescheduled the deposition for August 13, 2024, and it went forward as scheduled. The judge finds that no party is at fault for the delay and that plaintiff made a good faith effort to schedule the deposition. However, the judge will not impose sanctions on defendant for the delay.

The judge is also considering SROG 38, which seeks identifying information about hospitals where plaintiff received treatment due to bipolar disorder and/or 5150 holds. The judge finds that the interrogatory is reasonably susceptible to both parties' interpretations and orders plaintiff to provide identifying information for all hospitals where she was treated for bipolar disorder, for a 5150 hold, and/or for both.

Finally, the judge notes that plaintiff previously filed a motion for a stay of discovery due to her incarcerated status, but since she is no longer incarcerated, the motion is moot. The judge orders LBUSD to give notice and reminds the parties to take motions off calendar promptly when they become moot.
