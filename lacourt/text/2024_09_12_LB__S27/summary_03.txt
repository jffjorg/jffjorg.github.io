And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cheryl Garlow Garcia against John F. Kellogg regarding their joint ownership of Island Donuts, LLC. The plaintiff filed an ex parte application to preclude the defendant from withdrawing funds from the company, and the court issued an order restricting the defendant's access to funds. The court has set a hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction, but notes that the parties have been repeatedly filing stipulations to continue the hearing, indicating they are attempting to resolve their outstanding issues. The court is hopeful that the parties have concluded their settlement negotiations and the request for injunctive relief is now moot. If that is not the case, the temporary restraining order (TRO) will remain in place and the court will hear from the parties concerning the status of their dispute at the time of the hearing. The court will reschedule the hearing on the preliminary injunction and require both parties to file briefs and evidence concerning the status of the dispute prior to the continued hearing date.
