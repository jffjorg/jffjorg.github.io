And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to compel Plaintiff's compliance with an independent medical examination filed by Defendants Peter Brueggeman and Josephy Brueggeman without prejudice. The judge finds that Defendants have not shown that any modification of the demand for the physical examination was unwarranted, and that Plaintiff did not refuse to submit to the examination. Therefore, the judge concludes that Defendants have not established a basis for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250. The judge orders the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
