 Case Number:  20STCV34742    Hearing Date:   March 13, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
September 11, 2020, Plaintiffs Shaun Zhao (“Shaun Zhao”) and Derek Zhao (“Derek
Zhao”), by and through their guardian ad litem Qiyu Chen, filed this action
against Defendants Chin Ho See, Jane Yuk Yin Lee, and Does 1-100 for motor
vehicle, general negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
On
March 16, 2022, Defendants Chin Ho See and Jane Yuk Yin Lee (“Defendants”)
filed an answer. 
On
February 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement conditioned on the
Court’s approval of petitions for minor’s compromise. 
On
November 14, 2023, Petitioner Qiyu Chen (“Petitioner”) submitted petitions to
approve minor’s compromise for each Plaintiff to be heard on November 16, 2023. 
On
November 16, 2023, the Court denied the petition to approve the compromise of
Shaun Zhao’s claims without prejudice and granted the petition to approve the
compromise of Derek Zhao’s claims conditioned on Petitioner submitting an order
consistent with the Court's ruling for the Court’s signature. 
On
December 19, 2023, the Court signed the revised order approving the compromise
of Derek Zhao’s claims. 
On
January 11, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition to approve the compromise of
Shaun Zhao’s claims to be heard on January 12, 2024. The Court continued the
hearing to January 16, 2024.  On January
16, 2024, the Court denied the petition without prejudice. 
On March
11, 2024, Petitioner filed a third amended petition to approve the compromise
of Shaun Zhao’s claims to be heard on March 13, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromises of the pending claims of Plaintiff Shaun Zhao. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION         
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $49,162.00.
Section 12a(3) of the petition states that this amount was reduced by $17,455.02.  The difference between these amounts ($31,706.98)
should be the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) states
that only $25,750.49 of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $5,956.49
of the medical expenses (the difference between $31,706.98 and $25,750.49) are
not accounted for. 
In
Attachment 12, counsel’s legal assistant states that the $5,956.49 figure
represents “the amount in insurance adjustments, write-offs, and/or
co-payments.” Petitioner has also provided a one-page summary document from The
Rawlings Company listing a “Bill Amount” of $49,162.00 and a “Paid Amount” of
$43,205.51. 
The Court concludes that $5,956.49 represents an
additional reduction of the total $49,162.00 in medical expenses, even though
the petition does not include this amount in Section 12a(3).  Therefore, the total reduction amount listed
in Section 12a(3) should be $23,411.51.  The
difference between the total medical expenses of $49,162.00 and the reduction
amount of $23,411.51 is $25,750.49, the amount to be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds (Section 12a(4)). 
With this understanding, the Court grants the petition. 
Petitioner
asks that the net settlement proceeds ($148,160.84) be invested in a single-premium
deferred annuity with terms and conditions specified in Attachment 18b(3),
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  The Court grants the request. 
CONCLUSION    
          The Court GRANTS the third amended petition
to approve the compromise of minor Shaun Zhao’s action filed by Petitioner Qiyu
Chen on March 11, 2024. The Court
orders that the net balance be distributed into the single-premium deferred
annuity described in Attachment 18b(3). 
          The Court sets an order to show cause
re: distribution of settlement proceeds on May 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department
28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
          The Court sets an order to show cause re: dismissal
(settlement) on May 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
