          Granted: 1, 3-4
          Denied: 2, 5-8 (see also below) 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Demurrer 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides in part: 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint
has been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30,
to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds: 
* * *
“(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. 
“(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this
subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subds. (e), (f).) 
In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a) [“When any ground
for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading”].) 
“For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded (i.e., all ultimate
facts alleged, but not conclusions, deductions, or conclusions of facts or
law).”  (L. Edmon and C. Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 7:43, p. 7(l)-25 (Cal.
Practice Guide), emphasis omitted.) 
B.   Negligence
and premises liability 
 “The elements of a negligence claim and a
premises liability claim are the same: a legal duty of care, breach of that
duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.” (Kesner v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1159.) 
“A
defendant's control over property is sufficient to create a duty to protect
owed to persons using the property.” (Colonial Van & Storage, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 487, 497, citing Alcaraz v. Vece
(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1162, 1166; Soto v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.
(2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 168, 177 (Soto) [“the rationale being that whoever
has the means to control the property can take steps to prevent the harm”].)
“Conversely, absent any control of the property, a defendant cannot be held
liable for a dangerous condition on that property.” (Ibid., citing Cody
F. v. Falletti (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1241 [“ ‘[t]he law does not
impose responsibility where there is no duty because of the absence of a right
to control’ ”]; Soto, supra, 45 Cal.App.5th at p. 177; Vasilenko
v. Grace Family Church (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1077, 1084 [generally, there is no
right to control another's property].) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The original complaint 
The
original complaint alleged that on or about September 10, 2018, defendants
negligently, carelessly, and recklessly owned,
maintained, controlled, possessed, repaired, inspected, operated, designed,
built, managed and cleaned a sidewalk located at 11642
Washington Blvd., Whittier, CA., 90606, creating a dangerous condition that
caused Plaintiff to trip and fall and suffer injuries. 
B.   The previous demurrer ruling 
On
August 11, 2022, the Court sustained Moving Defendants’ demurrer to the original
complaint, ruling that judicially noticed public property records showed that
Moving Defendants had no interest in the property located at 11642 Washington Blvd., Whittier, CA., 90606.  Instead, Moving Defendants had an interest in
the adjacent property located at 11646 Washington Blvd. 
The Court
rejected Plaintiff’s argument that she had sufficiently alleged defendants
controlled the premises where she fell because Plaintiff’s allegations of
control were conclusory.  The Court
granted leave to amend. 
C.   The first amended complaint 
The first
amended complaint alleges the following: 
On
or about September 10, 2018, defendants negligently, carelessly, and recklessly
owned, maintained, controlled, possessed, repaired, inspected, operated,
designed, built, managed and cleaned “certain Alleyway surfaces located at and around 11642 Washington Blvd., 11648
Washington Blvd., 11664 Washington Blvd., and 11646 Washington Blvd., Whittier,
CA., 90606” (the “Properties”), creating a dangerous condition that caused
Plaintiff to trip and fall and suffer injuries. 
Plaintiff
is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Moving Defendants own
property at 11646 and 11664 Washington Blvd., Whittier, CA 90606, and that
these properties are on either side of the alleyway on which Plaintiff fell and
was injured. 
D.   The demurrer to the first amended complaint 
1.    Sham pleading doctrine 
Moving
Defendants argue the first amended complaint is a “sham pleading” because it
alleges facts contrary to the allegations which the
Court found defective in the original complaint.  Plaintiff’s
original complaint alleged that Plaintiff fell on a sidewalk located at 11642
Washington Blvd., Whittier, CA 90606. 
The first amended complaint, in contrast, alleges that Plaintiff fell in
an alleyway located at and around 11642
Washington Blvd., 11648 Washington Blvd., 11664 Washington Blvd., and 11646
Washington Blvd., Whittier, CA., 90606. 
“Under
the sham pleading doctrine, plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints
to omit harmful allegations, without explanation, from previous complaints to
avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment. [Citations.]
 A noted commentator has explained, ‘Allegations
in the original pleading that rendered it vulnerable to demurrer or other
attack cannot simply be omitted without explanation in the amended pleading.
The policy against sham pleadings requires the pleader to explain
satisfactorily any such omission.’ ” (Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006)
139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425-426, fn. omitted (Deveny), quoting Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2005) ¶ 6.708.)   
“The
sham pleading doctrine is not ‘intended to prevent honest complainants from
correcting erroneous allegations . . . or to prevent correction of ambiguous
facts.’ ” (Deveny, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 426, quoting 5
Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Amendment of Pleadings § 1122, pp.
577–578.)  “Instead, it is intended to
enable courts ‘to prevent an abuse of process.’ ”  (Ibid. [holding sham pleading doctrine
did not apply where plaintiff’s attorney “offered a plausible explanation for
the amendment”].) 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel has explained why the first amended complaint alleges facts that are different from the facts in the original complaint.  Plaintiff's counsel submitted a declaration
stating: “Subsequent investigation has revealed that: (1) the incident took
place in alleyway located at the intersection of four different properties and
businesses located 11642, 11646, 11648, and 11664 Washington Boulevard; and (2)
[Moving Defendants] own the two parcels of land located at 11646 Washington and
11664 Washington Boulevard.” 
Moving
Defendants do not show that Plaintiff’s counsel’s explanation is implausible.  The Court concludes that the sham pleading
doctrine does not apply here. 
2.    Service of motion for leave to file amended complaint 
Moving
Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not serve her motion for leave to file an
amended complaint on them.  The motion
for leave to file an amended complaint included a proof of service stating that
Plaintiff served Moving Defendants’ counsel. 
The Court granted the motion on August 29, 2023. 
Moving
Defendants have not previously informed the Court that Plaintiff did not serve
the motion for leave to file an amended complaint on them.  They do not state when they first became
aware that the Court had granted the motion. 
On these facts, Moving Defendants have waived any objection to the first
amended complaint based on the asserted lack of service of the motion for leave
to file an amended complaint. 
3.    Request for judicial notice of Google Maps printouts 
Citing
a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Moving
Defendants ask the Court to grant their request for judicial notice of Google Maps
printouts which, Moving Defendants argue, show Moving Defendants “have no legally cognizable
ties to the property where Plaintiff was allegedly injured.” 
This
Court is required to follow the rulings of California’s appellate courts.  In Jolley v. Chase Home Finance LLC
(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872 (Jolley), the Court of Appeal held the trial
court erred in granting the defendant’s request for judicial notice of a
document found on the FDIC’s website. 
The Court of Appeal initially observed that the document (a purchase and
assumption agreement) was attached to the declaration of the defendant’s
counsel, who stated that the document was found on the FDIC’s website.  (Jolley, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th
at p. 886.)  Yet “[t]he declarant was not a custodian of records, was
not a party to the Agreement, gave no indication she was involved in
negotiating or drafting it, and provided no background as to how she acquired
knowledge of the document.”  (Ibid.) 
Here
too, counsel is not a custodian of records. 
And counsel did not explain the basis for Moving Defendants’ assertion
that the Google Maps printouts contain “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of indisputable accuracy.”  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (h).) 
Indeed,
“ ‘ [s]imply because information is on the Internet does not mean that it is
not reasonably subject to dispute.’ ”  (Jolley,
supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 889, quoting Huitt v. Southern
California Gas Co. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1586, 1605, fn. 10.)  While “it might be appropriate to take
judicial notice of the existence of the [Google Maps website], the same is not
true of [the website’s] factual content.” (Searles Valley Minerals
Operations, Inc. v. State Bd. Of Equalization (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 514,
519 [court properly denied request for judicial notice of materials contained
on website pages of American Coal Foundation and United States Department of
Energy under Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (h)].) 
The
Court denies Moving Defendants’ request for judicial notice of the Google Maps
printouts.  As a result, the Court does
not consider whether the Google Maps printouts support Moving Defendants’
demurrer. 
4.    Uncertainty 
Moving
Defendants argue the first amended complaint is uncertain because it refers to
the location where Plaintiff fell as the “sidewalk's Alleyway.”  (First amended complaint ¶ 20.)  The reference to a sidewalk appears to be a
typographical error, possibly left over from the original complaint.  The first amended complaint elsewhere refers
to the location as “the alleyway on which [Plaintiff] fell and was injured”
(First amended complaint ¶ 4), “Alleyway
surfaces” (First amended complaint ¶ 9), and “Alleyway” (First amended complaint ¶ 19).  The first amended complaint is sufficiently
certain. 
The
Court overrules the demurrer. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court OVERRULES the demurrer filed by Defendants Margaret A. Rahm and Emily R. Rahm. 
Defendants
Margaret A. Rahm and Emily R. Rahm are ordered to file a responsive pleading within ten
days of the hearing on the demurrer. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
