Background
Plaintiffs Lawrence
Vallely, Therese Vallely, Mary Bestwick, Nilan Gunewardena, Jessica Millan, Lubna Ibrahim, Taurell Lebeau,
Julian Payton, David Ross, Hothyfa James Museitif, Giancarlo Samson, Curtis Saulnier, Suraj Sundar,
Michael Capovilla, Lucia Senzatimore, Dustin Clark, Natalia Nowicka, Michael Samu, and Majan
Zaldana (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on July 12, 2023 against
Defendant Equity Residential Management, LLC (“Equity”). The original Complaint
alleged causes of action for (1) violations of the Investigative
Consumer Reporting Agencies Act, (2) invasion of privacy, and (3) declaratory
relief. 
On October 26, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging causes
of action for (1) violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting
Agencies Act, (2) invasion of privacy, and (3) declaratory relief. 
Equity demurs to the
second and third causes of action of the Complaint. Equity also moves to strike
portions of the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes both. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, Equity
demurs to the second and third causes of action of the original Complaint and
moves to strike portions of the original Complaint. However, after Equity’s
demurrer and motion to strike were filed, Plaintiff filed the operative FAC on
October 26, 2023.
The Court notes that “[a]n amendatory pleading
supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a
pleading. The amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause of
action, and the original complaint ceases to have any effect either as a
pleading or as a basis for judgment…Because there is but one complaint in a
civil action…the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a
prior complaint…Thus, the filing of an amended complaint renders moot a
demurrer to the original complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477 [internal
quotations and citations omitted].) 
Accordingly,
Equity’s demurrer to second and third causes of action of
the Complaint and motion to strike portions of the Complaint are moot. 
Equity is ordered to
provide notice of this ruling.¿¿
