Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on a motion by Exquisite Apparel Corp. to set aside/vacate a default that was entered against it. The default was a result of Exquisite Apparel's failure to respond to discovery and its attorney's mistake in not serving Exquisite Apparel with notices of the motions to compel and for terminating sanctions. The Judge finds that Exquisite Apparel has demonstrated grounds for relief under the discretionary portion of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) on the grounds of mistake and/or inadvertence. The Judge grants Exquisite Apparel's motion and vacates the default.
