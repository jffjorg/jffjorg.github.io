Apparel Corp. to Complaint.”  


[2]The Court notes
that in Hover v.
MacKenzie (1954) 122 Cal.App.2d
852, 856, the Court of Appeal noted that “Code
of Civil Procedure, section 473, providing that a
trial court may relieve a party from ‘a judgment, order, or other proceeding
taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect,’ is remedial in its nature and is to be liberally construed…The policy
of the law is to have every litigated cause tried on its merits…”
