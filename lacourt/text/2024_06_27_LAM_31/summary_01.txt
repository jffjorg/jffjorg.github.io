```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for an order to stay proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal. The motion is unintelligible because it is unclear whether the defendant is appealing the court's denial of the motion for reconsideration or the grant of the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs. Additionally, the defendant has not provided any proof that it has posted an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception, which is required to stay enforcement of the plaintiff's judgment. As a result, the motion for stay of proceedings is denied.
