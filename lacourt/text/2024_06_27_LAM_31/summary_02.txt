And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Mutiu Olatunji Durosinmi-Etti, et al. The judge has overruled the demurrer and found that the plaintiff, The Redeemed Christian Church of God-Jesus Embassy, Los Angeles, has adequately pleaded its fraud cause of action. The judge has also found that the Fourth Amended Complaint is not a sham pleading and that the breach of oral contract claim does not fail for lack of a promissory estoppel claim.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fraud cause of action in the previous amended complaints, but has now found that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded the fraud cause of action in the Fourth Amended Complaint. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has taken possession of the property and has made substantial modifications to it pursuant to the parties' oral agreement, and has therefore adequately pleaded the part performance exception to the statute of frauds.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file and serve their answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint within 15 days of the date of the order. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
