  Case Number:  21STCV22340    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  31 Tentative Ruling Judge Kerry Bensinger, Department 31  HEARING DATE:     June 27, 2024                                     TRIAL DATE:  Not set                                                          CASE:                         John Cadusale v. Alameda Restaurant LLC, et al. CASE NO.:                 21STCV22340  MOTION FOR STAY OF PROCEEDINGS MOVING PARTY:               Defendant/Cross-Complainant Lauro Calonzo RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant John Cadusale  I.         INTRODUCTION             Plaintiff, John Cadusale, initiated this wrongful termination action against Defendants, Alameda Restaurant LLC, Noypitz Bar & Grill LLC, Lauro Calonzo (“Calonzo”), and Wokcano Cerritos, LLC.  Calonzo filed a Cross-Complaint, and later, his First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC).  Calonzo is self-represented.  Plaintiff moved to strike the entire FACC pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.  The court granted Plaintiff’s special motion to strike on October 31, 2023.  Judgment was entered on November 15, 2023. Calonzo filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s October 31, 2023, order.  The court denied the motion for reconsideration on December 13, 2023. Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party in his anti-SLAPP motion.  On December 14, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s fees motion in the sum of $7,294.29. On February 13, 2024, Calonzo filed a Notice of Appeal of the court’s December 13, 2023 order. On March 15, 2024, the court stayed this action pending the outcome of the appeal. Calonzo now moves for an order to stay proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal.                                                                Plaintiff filed two oppositions.  Calonzo replied.   II.        DISCUSSION             The motion for stay of proceedings is unintelligible.  Calonzo filed a Notice of Appeal of the court’s December 13, 2023 order denying his motion for reconsideration.  Yet, the Notice of Motion states that Calonzo seeks an order staying proceedings “regarding Order Awarding Attorney Fees and Cost pending Outcome of Appeal of said Interlocutory Judgment pursuant to CCP Section 1286.”  Section 1286 concerns the enforcement of money judgments.  In other words, the court cannot tell whether Calonzo has appealed the court’s December 13, 2023 order (denial of the motion for reconsideration) or the December 14, 2023 order (granting Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs).  The lack of clarity alone warrants denial of this motion for a stay.             Further, to the extent Calonzo seeks a stay of enforcement of the Plaintiff’s money judgment, a stay is not justified.  “[A] SLAPP plaintiff's perfecting of an appeal from a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs to a prevailing SLAPP defendant under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 does not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment. To stay enforcement of such a judgment, the SLAPP plaintiff must give an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule.”  Dowling v. Zimmerman (2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1400, 1434.)  Here, Calonzo does not offer any proof that he has posted an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception.           IV.       CONCLUSION             Accordingly, the motion for stay of proceedings is DENIED. Plaintiff to give notice.   Dated:   June 27, 2024                                            Kerry Bensinger    Judge of the Superior Court
