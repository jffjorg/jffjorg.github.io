And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to serve verified responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories and special interrogatories. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery requests despite a meet and confer effort and has been ordered to serve the responses within 20 days of service of the order. The judge has also awarded sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $910.00, which is based on two hours of attorney time billed at $395.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests, which constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
