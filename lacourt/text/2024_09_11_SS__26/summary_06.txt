And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Delta Elevator Company, Inc. v. Tulum Wellness, LLC, et al. The defendants, Greenleaf RB, LLC and Behrokh Tabibian aka Ben Tabibian, filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, which alleged breach of contract and enforcement of a mechanic's lien. The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, and the defendants must file an answer to the first amended complaint within 20 days.

The court found that the first amended complaint adequately states a cause of action for breach of contract, and that the defendants' arguments that the statute of limitations bars the claim are without merit. The court also found that the plaintiff is not required to allege compliance with the preliminary notice requirement for recording a mechanic's lien, and that the lien was properly recorded.

The court's ruling means that the case will proceed to the next stage, where the defendants will have to respond to the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments in support of its claims, and the defendants will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments in support of their defenses.
