Summary:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Maria Vera's motion to reclassify the action as an unlimited civil case. The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown a possibility of damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit of $35,000.00, and that good cause exists for the timing of the motion. The Court notes that Plaintiff's counsel was swamped with four major trials in a short period of time, which delayed the filing of the motion. The Court finds that this delay was reasonable and not in bad faith. As a result, the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment to an unlimited jurisdiction court.
