The plaintiff, Mold Masters, Inc., seeks leave to file an amended complaint in this case against the defendants, Lahiji, et al.

The judge finds that the policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is strong, and that there is no indication of excusable delay or prejudice to the opposing party. Therefore, the requirements for leave to amend are satisfied, and the motion is granted.
