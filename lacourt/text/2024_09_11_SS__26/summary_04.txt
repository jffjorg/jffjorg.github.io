And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCP01494, Sierra MHP Associates, LP v. Christman, et al. The case involves a petition to declare a mobilehome abandoned and award rent due on the mobilehome site from November 1, 2023 to the present. The Petitioner, Sierra MHP Associates, LP, seeks a court order deeming the mobilehome abandoned and awarding rent, attorney's fees, and court costs.

The Judge has continued the petition to December 11, 2024, at 8:30 am in Department 24 of the Spring Street Courthouse. By November 13, 2024, the Petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers addressing the continuation of this action with respect to Respondent Shari Christman.

The Judge notes that the Petitioner has not provided information on how the petition may be asserted against Respondent Christman's personal representative or successor in interest, as Respondent Christman is deceased. The Code of Civil Procedure section 377.40 states that a cause of action against a decedent that survives may be asserted against the decedent's personal representative or, to the extent provided by statute, against the decedent's successor in interest.

The Judge has ordered the Petitioner to provide supplemental papers addressing this issue, and has given notice to the moving party.
