Discussion
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a court order deeming Respondents’ mobilehome, (“the Mobilehome”) located
at 18204 Soledad Canyon Road, Space 13, Santa Clarita, California (“the
Space”), to be abandoned, and awarding Petitioner rent due on the Mobilehome
site from November 1, 2023 to the present, accruing at $680.31 per month, attorney’s
fees, and court costs. (Pet., ¶26 and Prayer ¶¶1-6.) 
 
A. Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “abandoned mobilehome” means
a mobilehome about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a
mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for
the preceding 60 days.
 
(B)
It is unoccupied.
 
(C)
A reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.
 
(D)
It is not permanently affixed to the land.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (a)(1).) As set forth in the supporting
declaration, no rent has been paid for the Premises and the Mobilehome has been
unoccupied since November 2023. (Pet., Torres Decl., ¶7.) However, the
supporting declaration, by Petitioner’s on-site manager, also states that
Respondent Christman, the registered owner of record of the Mobilehome, is
deceased. (Id. at ¶16.) No other information is provided, including Respondent
Christman’s date of death. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.40, “a
cause of action against a decedent that survives may be asserted against the
decedent’s personal representative or, to the extent provided by statute,
against the decedent’s successor in interest.” Petitioner must address the
manner in which this Petition may be asserted against Respondent Christman’s
personal representative or successor in interest.
