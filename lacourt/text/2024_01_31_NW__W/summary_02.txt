Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Jemeker Thompson-Hairston's motion to quash service of summons and complaint, as the court finds that the service was not code compliant. The judge also grants Defendant Netflix, Inc.'s special motion to strike, finding that Plaintiff Dino Bradley's claims of defamation and misappropriation are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute and lack minimal merit. The judge finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish that he is "Dino" and has not presented sufficient evidence to support his claims. As a result, Defendant Netflix, Inc.'s demurrer with motion to strike is moot.
