Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on an intervenor's motion to vacate a default and default judgment against the defendant, Crescencio Polanco. The intervenor, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, seeks to set aside the default and default judgment on equitable grounds, arguing that it was not notified of the lawsuit or default until March 8, 2023, and that it has a meritorious case. The court finds that State Farm has not shown that it has authority to appear or file an Answer on Polanco's behalf, and therefore denies State Farm's request to file a responsive pleading on behalf of Polanco. However, the court grants State Farm's motion to set aside the February 24, 2022 default judgment only, and denies the remaining requests. The court also notes that State Farm may litigate all appropriate defenses that Polanco could have asserted without Polanco needing to be relieved from default.
