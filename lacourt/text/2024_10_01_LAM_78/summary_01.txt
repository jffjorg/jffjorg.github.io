And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Abhay Gokani Corporation (AGC) to the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Johana Serratos, Maria Nunez Barrueta, Edith Nava Mar, Johanna Gonzalez, and Blanca Ramirez-Guerra. The Plaintiffs are suing AGC and other defendants for alleged violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA).

The judge finds that AGC's demurrer to the first cause of action (unlawful retaliation under Lab. Code § 1102.5) is sustained because the complaint does not plead sufficient facts to support a cause of action. The judge also sustains AGC's demurrer to the second cause of action (disparate treatment under Gov. Code § 12940(a)) because the complaint lacks specific facts to support a prima facie case.

The judge sustains AGC's demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action (failure to provide reasonable accommodation and failure to engage in interactive process under Gov. Code § 12940(n) and (m)) because the complaint lacks specific facts to support a cause of action.

The judge sustains AGC's demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action (retaliation under Gov. Code § 12940(h) and failure to prevent discrimination/retaliation under Gov. Code § 12940(k)) because the complaint lacks specific facts to support a prima facie case.

The judge sustains AGC's demurrer to the seventh and eighth causes of action (violation of CFRA rights and CFRA retaliation) because the complaint lacks specific facts to support a cause of action.

The judge gives Plaintiffs 15 days to amend their complaint and orders AGC to give notice.
