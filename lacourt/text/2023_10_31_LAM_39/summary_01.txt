And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion from the defendants to permit the designation of an untimely expert witness. The defendants claim that they were unrepresented between July 21, 2020, and September 16, 2020, which prevented them from designating experts before the deadline. The court finds that good cause exists to grant the motion and permits the defendants to notice an untimely expert witness on the condition that they stipulate to the plaintiff's counsel designating his own expert in response, do not object to the plaintiff calling an undesignated expert in rebuttal, and stipulate to a trial continuance if necessary. The court requires the defendants' counsel to provide notice and file proof of such with the court.
