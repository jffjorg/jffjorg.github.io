And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorney's fees by Porch.com, Inc. (Petitioner) to enforce an arbitration award. The Petitioner is seeking $93,975.50 in attorney's fees. The judge notes that the prevailing party must seek an award of attorneys' fees via a noticed motion and bears the burden of proof to justify the amount sought. The judge also cites relevant laws, including Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A) and Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2, and a relevant case, Austin v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1812, 1815-1816.

However, the judge has ordered the Petitioner's counsel to file a revised declaration and billing records on or before November 6, 2023, due to the heavily redacted billing records that cannot be evaluated for reasonableness. The judge has also continued the hearing on the motion to November 17, 2023, at 10:30 a.m., and ordered the Petitioner's counsel to provide notice and file proof of such with the Court. The Respondent, Kandella, LLC, may file a response to the revised declaration and billing records on or before November 13, 2023.
