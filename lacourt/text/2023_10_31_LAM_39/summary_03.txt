The court has granted the defendant's ex parte application for a temporary stay of enforcement of the judgment, pending the court's decision on their motion to set aside the defaults and default judgment. However, the court has denied the request for the return of seized funds prior to the default judgment being set aside. The court has ordered that the levying officer hold the funds and not release them to anyone without further order of the court. The court has also denied the request for the funds to be deposited with the court.
