 Case Number:  23STCV21683    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  39 Dewey Demetro, Jr. v. Spring Street
Courthouse Dept. 32 Clerk of Court
Case No. 23STCV21683
Minute Order
 
            Notice: The Court posts this
tentative order in advance of the hearing on October 31, 2023, at 8:30
a.m.  The Court provides notice: If
Plaintiff does not appear at the hearing, either remotely or in-person, he
shall waive the right to be heard and shall submit to entry of this order.  If Plaintiff wishes to appear remotely but is
experiencing difficulty, he may contact the Court’s clerk, Roberto Mendoza, at
(213) 633-0159 for assistance.  
 
            Plaintiff Dewey Demetro, Jr.
(“Plaintiff”), a self-represented party, filed a handwritten complaint with no
causes of action against the “Asian male” judicial assistant in the Spring
Street Courthouse, Department #32.  In
his complaint, he writes: “The biggest sirele [sic] killer in the word!” and
“Killed 3,000 people.”  It is unclear
whether he is referring to the judicial assistant or someone else.  However, the gravamen of Plaintiff’s
complaint relates to the judicial assistant’s handling of the following case:
Dewey Demetro, Jr. v. LA Police Station, Case Number 22STCV07146.  Plaintiff alleges that when he appeared in
Department #32, the judicial assistant was displeased that he arrived 20
minutes early and did not like his “shirt color” and his “shoes.”  Plaintiff then writes in his complaint:
“WTF?”  Plaintiff also writes the
following:  “Now I have to fight the
worlds [sic] biggest sireal [sic] killer!  And a blond hair, Asian man!  This should be interesting! . . .  How do you fight with someone who has control
of the scoreboard?”  Plaintiff suggests
that he is displeased with the judicial assistant because the case was “push[ed]
back” by seven months.  As a result,
Plaintiff is seeking “Eight Billion Dollars.” 
The complaint alleges no other facts and asserts no causes of action.
 
            This complaint is meritless on its
face, not only based upon the nature of the allegations, but also because it
asserts no causes of action.  Further,
even if the judicial assistant—rather than the judge—was responsible for the continuances
of Plaintiff’s case, “[c]ourt clerks have absolute quasi-judicial immunity from
damages . . . when they perform tasks that are an integral part of the judicial
process.”  (See, e.g., Mullis v. United
States Bankruptcy Court, 828 F.2d 1385, 1390 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Acres v.
Marson (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 417, 442.)  
 
The Court has inherent authority
to dismiss cases that are patently frivolous.  (See Huang v. Hanks (2018)
23 Cal.App.5th 179, 181-182, citations omitted).  The Court also may
notice its own motion for judgment on the pleadings, per Code of Civil
Procedure section 438(b)(2).  Based upon
the foregoing authorities, the Court issues an Order to Show Cause why this
case should not be dismissed and notices its own motion for judgment on the
pleadings.  The hearing shall be held on
October 20, 2023, at 8:30 a.m., at the following location:
 
            Stanley
Mosk Courthouse
            111 North
Hill Street
            Department
#39 (Goorvitch, J.)
            Los
Angeles, California 90012
 
The Court authorizes both in-person and remote
appearances.  If Plaintiff would like to
appear remotely but is having difficulty doing so, he may contact the Court’s
clerk, Roberto Mendoza, at (213) 633-0159 for assistance.  
 
            Plaintiff
may file a written opposition on or before October 9, 2023, or he may address
the issues orally at the hearing.  The
Court provides notice: If Plaintiff does not demonstrate that this action is
viable, absent good cause, the Court will dismiss this case with prejudice at
the upcoming hearing.  Similarly, if
Plaintiff does not appear at the hearing, absent good cause, the Court will
dismiss this case with prejudice. 
 
            The Court’s
clerk shall serve this order upon Plaintiff.
