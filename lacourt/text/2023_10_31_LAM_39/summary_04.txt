And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dewey Demetro, Jr. v. Spring Street Courthouse. Plaintiff Dewey Demetro, Jr. is a self-represented party who filed a handwritten complaint against the Asian male judicial assistant in Department #32. The complaint is meritless on its face, as it asserts no causes of action and makes bizarre allegations against the judicial assistant. The Judge notes that court clerks have absolute quasi-judicial immunity from damages and that the case is patently frivolous. The Judge has issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed and has noticed its own motion for judgment on the pleadings. The hearing is scheduled for October 31, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department #39. Plaintiff may file a written opposition by October 9, 2023, or may address the issues orally at the hearing. If Plaintiff does not demonstrate that the action is viable, the Court will dismiss the case with prejudice.
