Kandella, LLC
Case No.
22STCP03332
Motion for
Attorney’s Fees
 
Petitioner Porch.com, Inc.
(“Petitioner”) seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $93,975.50 to enforce the
arbitration award.  The prevailing party
must seek an award of attorneys’ fees via a noticed motion, and bears the
burden of proof to justify the amount sought. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).)  Petitioner is entitled to recover its fees in
the proceedings to enforce its arbitration award.  (See Code Civ. Proc,. § 1293.2; Austin v.
Allstate Ins. Co. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1812, 1815-1816.)  However, the billing records are so heavily
redacted that the Court cannot evaluate the reasonableness of the amounts
sought.  Therefore, the Court orders as
follows:
 
1.         If
Petitioner’s counsel intends to proceed with this motion, she shall file a
revised declaration and billing records on or before November 6, 2023. 
 
2.         Respondent
may file a response to the revised declaration and billing records on or before
November 13, 2023.
 
3.         The
hearing on the motion is continued to November 17, 2023, at 10:30 a.m.
 
4.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
