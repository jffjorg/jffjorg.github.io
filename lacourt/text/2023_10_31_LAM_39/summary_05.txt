And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Goorvitch in the case of Dewey Demetro, Jr. v. R. Ebe, et al. (Case No. 23STCV22019). The case involves a self-represented plaintiff who filed a handwritten complaint against two security guards at the Spring Street Courthouse, alleging that a security guard prevented him from entering the courthouse due to security protocols. The complaint is meritless on its face, as it asserts no causes of action and lacks jurisdiction. The Court has inherent authority to dismiss frivolous cases and may notice its own motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court orders the plaintiff to show cause why the case should not be dismissed and sets a hearing for October 20, 2023. The plaintiff may file a written opposition or address the issues orally at the hearing. If the plaintiff fails to appear or demonstrate the viability of the case, the Court will dismiss the case with prejudice.
