A motion
for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer,
and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by
matters that can be judicially noticed. (See, e.g., Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1998) PP 7:275,
7:322, pp. 7-78, 7-84; Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity
Co. (1996) 44 Cal. App. 4th 194, 198 [51 Cal. Rptr. 2d 622].) Presentation of
extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. (Ibid.) 
 
(Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998)  67 Cal. App. 4th 995, 999.)

(a) A public entity is liable for
injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public
entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart
from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee
or his personal representative.
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided by
statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or
omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from
liability.

     (Gov.
Code § 815.2(a) & (b)[enacted 1963].)


[3] 
A public entity is liable for
injury proximately caused by a tortious act or omission of an independent
contractor of the public entity to the same extent that the public entity would
be subject to such liability if it were a private person. Nothing in this
section subjects a public entity to liability for the act or omission of an
independent contractor if the public entity would not have been liable for the
injury had the act or omission been that of an employee of the public entity.

     (Gov.
Code § 815.4 [enacted 1963].)


[4] 
Where a public entity is under
a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against
the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an
injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty
unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to
discharge the duty.

     (Gov
Code § 815.6 [enacted 1963].)
