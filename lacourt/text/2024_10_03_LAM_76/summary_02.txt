And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the legal principles governing a public entity's liability for injuries caused by its employees or independent contractors. The court notes that a motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and that presentation of extrinsic evidence is not proper on such a motion. The ruling also references California Government Code sections 815.2, 815.4, and 815.6, which set forth the public entity's liability for injuries caused by its employees and independent contractors. The court concludes that public entities are liable for injuries caused by their employees or independent contractors, except where the employee is immune from liability. The ruling will be revised and finalized after considering further arguments and evidence at the upcoming court hearing.
