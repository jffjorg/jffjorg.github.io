Background
 
This
action arises out of an ownership dispute concerning the real property located
at 1901 E. Carson Street, Long Beach, CA (the “Subject Property”). On
April 1, 2022, Robert Gentino, Trustee of the BN Family Trust Dated June, 5,
2000 (“Plaintiff Gentino”) filed a real property action against Bob Termechi
(“Defendant Termechi”) and Bizhan Yaghoobia (“Defendant Yaghoobia”), and Does 1
to 100. The Complaint alleges four causes of action: 
 
1)    
Reformation
of Contract – against Defendant Termechi;
2)    
Partition
of Property – against all Defendants;
3)    
Breach
of Constructive Trust – against Yaghoobia;
4)    
Accounting
– against Yaghoobia. 
 
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed
the first and second causes of action alleged against Defendant Termechi and
dismissed Termechi as a defendant. 
 
On September 18, 2024, Defendant
Yaghoobia filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings (“MJOP”). Plaintiff
Gentino opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
MOtion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) A motion for judgment on
the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.)
“In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant Yaghoobia requests
judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit A: Plaintiff’s verified Complaint
under Case Number BC706408. 
2)    
Exhibit B: Minute Order dated October 26,
2021, reflecting the Court dismissal of the action. 
 
Defendant Yaghoobia’s request for
judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        Relevant Procedural Facts 
 
On May 16, 2018, Plaintiff Gentino filed a complaint in an
underlying action entitled Robert Gentino, Trustee of BN Family Trust Dated
June 5, 2000 v. Bob Termechi, et al. (LASC Case No. BC706408) (the
“Underlying Action”). The Underlying Action sought to quiet title of the
subject property located in Long Beach, CA, and brought claims of conversion
and accounting against Defendant Yahoobia and partition against both Defendants
Termechi and Yaghoobia. (See TAC filed 10/03/2019.) On December 13, 2019, the
court sustained the demurrer to the conversion claim without leave to amend.
(See 12/13/2019 Order (BC706408).)
 
On October 26, 2021, the court dismissed the partition action
without prejudice and dismissed the action without prejudice, finding that
Plaintiff Gentino had failed to establish an ownership interest in the Subject
Property. (See 10/26/2021 Order (BC706408); Appeal Ruling dated 10/12/2023.) 
 
On April 1, 2022, Plaintiff Gentino refiled this action. Defendant
Yaghoobia now asserts that this action is barred by the doctrines of res
judicata and collateral estoppel. Gentino asserts the action is not barred by
res judicata or collateral estoppel because the dismissal was without
prejudice. 
“‘Dismissal with prejudice is determinative of the issues in the
action and precludes the dismissing party from litigating those issues again.’
” (Estate of Redfield (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1526, 1533.) “‘The
statutory term ‘with prejudice’ clearly means the plaintiff's right of action
is terminated and may not be revived.’ ” (Torrey Pines Bank v. Superior
Court (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 813, 820–821.) “It is established in California
that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not a judgment on the
merits, and, as such, has no claim-preclusive effect upon a later suit.” (Gray
v. La Salle Bank, N.A. (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 932, 950 [italics original].)
However, “a judgment based upon an involuntary dismissal will constitute a bar
to the later suit if it is shown that ‘the judgment was given upon a
consideration of the merits of the controversy.” (Id., [internal
citation and quotation marks omitted].) “Thus, a judgment of dismissal is not
deemed on the merits and has no claim-preclusive effect when the involuntary
dismissal is, for example, based upon (1) a finding of laches [citation] ; (2)
application of the statute of limitations [citation]; (3) absence of
jurisdiction [citation]; (4) lack of prosecution; or (5) mootness and/or lack
of ripeness of the issues [citation].” (Id., at 950, fn. 9.) 
 
Plaintiff Gentino’s two-page opposition fails to address how the
involuntary dismissal of the underlying action is not a judgment on the merits.
Nevertheless, the court finds that the underlying action was not a
determination on the merits because the court determined that Plaintiff failed
to show that he had an ownership interest in the Subject Property, not that
Plaintiff had no ownership interest. Bob Termechi is no longer a party to this
action and the first and second causes of action alleged against him have been
dismissed.
 
            B.        Allegations in Complaint
 
“In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange
v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) On August 24, 2018,
Plaintiff Gentino and Termechi signed a Settlement Agreement that conferred
onto Plaintiff a 50% ownership of the Subject Property. (Compl, ¶ 12, Ex. A.)
Accordingly, as an owner of the Property, Plaintiff is entitled to seek
partition. “A partition action may be commenced and maintained by any of the
following persons: (1) A co-owner of personal property.” (CCP, ¶ 872.210(a).) 
 
As to the third cause of action for breach of constructive trust,
the Complaint alleges that from October 2014 to the present, Defendant
Yaghoobia held income received from the Subject Property at a Chase Bank in
constructive trust for the benefit of Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶¶ 19-23.) Defendant
Yaghoobia wrongfully dispersed the income to himself without Plaintiff's
consent. (Id., ¶¶ 21-23.) Consequently, “[a]n accounting is necessary
from Yaghoobia to account for all Property income and expenses after September
28, 2014 to determine the amount due Plaintiff.” (Id., ¶ 25.) 
 
Defendant Yaghoobia posits that Plaintiff Gentino did not have
standing to demonstrate any ownership interest in the subject property before
entering the settlement agreement, thereby making the settlement agreement
unenforceable. On an MJOP, the court does not interpret documents. (See Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
113-114.) Gentino’s standing at the time the settlement agreement was signed is
irrelevant because what matters is Termechi’s ownership interest and his right
to transfer his ownership interest to Gentino. Yaghoobia does not assert that
Termechi lacked an ownership interest in the Subject Property such that he had
no ownership interest to transfer or confer to Plaintiff Gentino. Moreover,
even if Yaghoobia asserted that Termechi had no ownership interest in the
Subject Property, such an issue is a disputed fact not subject to adjudication
at the pleading stage. “The hearing on demurrer may not be turned into a
contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the court take
judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are
disputable.” (Fremont, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at p. 114.) 
 
Defendant Yaghoobia further asserts that Plaintiff Gentino has no
standing to bring this action because he has not demonstrated that he is a real
party in interest.) “Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded
facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610; see also Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula
Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.) Plaintiff Gentino need not
prove at this stage of the pleadings that he does have an ownership interest in
the subject property. It is sufficient that the Complaint alleges that Gentino
has a 50% ownership interest by virtue of the settlement agreement with Termechi.
(Compl., ¶ 12, Ex. A.) 
 
As the Motion is without merit, the motion is denied. The court
also denies Defendant Yaghoobia’s request for sanctions under CCP § 128.5. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Yaghoobia’s MJOP is denied. Defendant’s request for sanction
under CCP § 1289.5 is also denied.
