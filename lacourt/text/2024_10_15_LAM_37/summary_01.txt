**Significant Statements**
```
The court finds that the underlying action was not a determination on the merits because the court determined that Plaintiff failed to show that he had an ownership interest in the Subject Property, not that Plaintiff had no ownership interest.
Plaintiff Gentino need not prove at this stage of the pleadings that he does have an ownership interest in the subject property. It is sufficient that the Complaint alleges that Gentino has a 50% ownership interest by virtue of the settlement agreement with Termechi.
The hearing on demurrer may not be turned into a contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the court take judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are disputable.
Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) and also denies the defendant's request for sanctions under CCP § 128.5. The case centers around an ownership dispute over the subject property located at 1901 E. Carson Street, Long Beach, CA. The plaintiff, Robert Gentino, Trustee of the BN Family Trust, filed a complaint against the defendant, Bizhan Yaghoobia, and others, alleging four causes of action, including reformation of contract, partition of property, breach of constructive trust, and accounting. The defendant argues that the action is barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel due to a previous dismissal of an underlying action without prejudice. However, the court finds that the previous dismissal was not a determination on the merits and that the plaintiff has standing to bring the action. The court also finds that the settlement agreement between the plaintiff and Bob Termechi, which conferred a 50% ownership of the subject property on the plaintiff, is enforceable. Therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
