MOTION TO COMPELA propounding party may demand a responding party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) A party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)Defendant Paul Lincoln Davidge (Defendant) moves to compel responses to Form and Special Interrogatories and Inspection Demands from Plaintiff Andie Jane de la Torre (Plaintiff). Defendant served the discovery on July 19, 2024. (Haber Decl. ¶ 2.) No responses were served by August 22, 2024, so Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter granting additional time. (Haber Decl. Exb. B.) No responses were served by the extended deadline of September 5, 2024, or since then. (Haber Decl. ¶¶ 3–4.)Defendant has shown that discovery was served upon Plaintiff, and that no responses have been received. Plaintiff has filed no opposition to the motion.The motions to compel are GRANTED.II. SANCTIONSThe prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Defendant seeks $455.34 in connection with each motion, representing two hours of attorney time at $160.17 per hour, plus an hour of paralegal time at $75 per hour, and a $60 filing fee. (Haber Decl. ¶ 5.) This comes to a total for the three motions of $1,366.02. The court grants sanctions in the reduced amount of $295.17 per motion, reflecting one hour of attorney time, one hour of paralegal time, and filing fee. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $885.51.
