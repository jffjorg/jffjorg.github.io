And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the Defendant City of Los Angeles without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Matthew C. Folke, had filed a complaint against the Defendant on February 21, 2024, alleging claims for money or damages. However, the complaint was filed more than one year after the Defendant's notice of rejection of the Plaintiff's government claim, which was filed on July 14, 2022, and rejected on August 16, 2022. The Plaintiff had attempted to file the complaint on April 27, 2023, but it was rejected on May 1, 2023. The Judge held that the complaint was not legally sufficient as it was filed outside the statutory time limit for filing a claim against a public entity. The Plaintiff had argued that the delay was excusable due to various legal doctrines, but the Judge found that these arguments were not supported by relevant case law or authority. As a result, the demurrer was sustained, and the Plaintiff is not allowed to amend the complaint to correct the defects.
