And here is a brief summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for preliminary injunction filed by Talun Hsu and Fawnia Hsu, seeking to prevent foreclosure on their property located on Hillview Place in Los Angeles. The Plaintiffs argue that allowing foreclosure would cause them to lose their home, which they have lived in for years and have invested tens of thousands of dollars in. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have shown a sufficient basis for the injunction and that the equities favor the issuing of the injunction. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to post an undertaking of $100,000.00 to secure the Defendants against potential damages. The Judge also notes that the Defendants may seek an undertaking securing them against fees incurred to dissolve the injunction if it is ultimately dissolved.
