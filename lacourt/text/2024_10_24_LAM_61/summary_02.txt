The defendant, Paul Lincoln Davidge, has moved to compel responses to form and special interrogatories and inspection demands from the plaintiff, Andie Jane De La Torre. The defendant served the discovery demands on July 19, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant sent the plaintiff a letter granting additional time to respond, but still, no responses were received. The plaintiff has not opposed the motion.

The court grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to the discovery demands. The court also awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $885.61, which represents one hour of attorney time, one hour of paralegal time, and a filing fee. The sanctions must be paid within 30 days. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
