And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling striking certain affirmative defenses filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, in response to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The court has also denied the defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer. The defendant is granted leave to file an amended answer, but only after it remedies the defects identified in the court's order. The court has struck the defendant's affirmative defenses, including those alleging that the plaintiff's claims fail to state a cause of action, do not contain ultimate facts, or are improperly pled. The court has also denied the defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer in its current form, but has given the defendant 30 days to file an amended answer that addresses the court's concerns.
