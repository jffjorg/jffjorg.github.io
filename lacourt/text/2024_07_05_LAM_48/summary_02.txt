And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding the petition to confirm an arbitration award filed by Stris & Maher LLP (Petitioner) against Tony Diab, et al. (Respondents). The Petitioner filed the petition on November 8, 2023, and Respondent Daniel S. March filed an opposition on January 4, 2024. The Petitioner then filed a motion to grant the petition on May 23, 2024, which was stricken by the court due to non-compliance with the law or a court order. The Petitioner also filed a notice of entry of dismissal and proof of service on May 29, 2024, which was also stricken. On June 3, 2024, the Petitioner dismissed Respondent Tony Diab. The court found that the Petition does not include a copy of the agreement to arbitrate and that arbitration of attorney-client fee disputes is voluntary for a client and only mandatory for an attorney when commenced by the client. Therefore, the hearing on the motion to confirm the arbitration award is continued to August 29, 2024, and the Petitioner is ordered to file a copy of the agreement to arbitrate no later than five court days before the continued hearing.
