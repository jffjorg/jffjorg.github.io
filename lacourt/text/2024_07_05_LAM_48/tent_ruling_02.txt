  CASE NO.: 23STCP04122
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING PETITION TO
  CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 9, 2024



 
On November 8, 2023, Petitioner
Stris & Maher LLP sfiled a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award.  On January 4, 2024, Respondent Daniel S. March
filed an opposition.
On
May 23, 2024, Petitioner filed a Motion to Grant the Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client
Fee Arbitration Award.  The Court did not
grant Petitioner leave to amend the Petition, and Respondent March had already responded
to the Petition.  The Court orders the May
23, 2024 Motion STRICKEN for not being filed in accordance with law or a court order.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)
On
May 29, 2024, Petitioner filed a Notice of Entry of Dismissal and Proof of Service.  No dismissal was entered—or even requested—and
the Notice does not attach a copy of any dismissal.  The Court orders the May 29, 2024 Notice STRICKEN.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)
On
June 3, 2024, Petitioner dismissed Respondent Tony Diab.
On
June 21, 2024, Respondent March filed an opposition to the May 23, 2024 motion.
On
June 28, 2024, Petitioner filed a reply.
A
party may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate an arbitration award,
and a response to a petition may request that the court dismiss the petition or
confirm, correct, or vacate the award.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1285, 1285.2.)  The petition
or response must set forth (1) the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement
to arbitrate, (2) the names of the arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written
opinion of the arbitrators, or attach a copy. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1285.4, 1285.6.) 
The court must either confirm the award as made, correct the award and confirm
it as corrected, vacate the award, or dismiss the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
The
Petition does not include a copy of the agreement to arbitrate.  Arbitration of attorney-client fee disputes is
voluntary for a client and is only mandatory for an attorney when commenced by the
client.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6200, subd.
(c).)  This arbitration was commenced by Petitioner,
the attorney/firm in the underlying dispute, so arbitration was not statutorily
mandated.  (See Petition Ex. 6(c) [Arbitration
Award] at p. 1.)
“[T]he
party seeking to enforce an award must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
that a valid arbitration contract exists. 
The court may not confirm an award without first finding the parties agreed
in writing to arbitrate their dispute, unless a judicial determination of the issue
has already been made (e.g., by a court considering a petition to compel arbitration).  The burden upon the award’s proponent to prove
the existence of a valid agreement, and the court’s duty to determine the issue,
are reflected in the statutory requirement that the proponent recite or attach the
contract.”  (Toal v. Tardif (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 1208, 1220.)
Accordingly,
the Hearing on Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award is CONTINUED to August 29, 2024
at 8:30 a.m.
Petitioner
is ORDERED to file a copy of the agreement to arbitrate no later than five court
days before the continued hearing.
 
 
 
 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 9th day of July 2024
