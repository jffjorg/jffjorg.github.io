 Case Number:  23VECV03882    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  T  
Gasca v Honda 23VECV03882
Defendant Honda’s Motion to compel plaintiffs’
depositions: Granted. The court orders that the depositions of plaintiffs take
place on 2/23/2024 at 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. or any other alternative dates
and times agreed to in writing by the parties.  Monetary sanctions as noted below.
On 11/9/2023, defendant served a notice for
the deposition of Araceli Fuentes De Gasca aka Araceli Fuentesdegasca for 12/18/2023.
Additionally, on 11/9/2023, defendant served a notice for the deposition of
George Gasca for 12/18/2023.
On 11/13/2023, dates were requested for the
plaintiffs’ depositions but there was no response.
On 12/7/2023, Plaintiffs served objections to
the deposition notices indicating that plaintiffs would not appear pursuant to
their respective notices. Specifically, plaintiffs indicated that they and
their counsel were not available as noticed but did not provide alternative
dates. 
On 12/7/2023, defense asked again for dates
for depositions as part of meet and confer and again there was no response. The
motion to compel was filed on 12/15/2023.
The opposition was filed on 11/17/2024.  It does not deny the allegations of the motion
but, instead, claims that as of 1/17/2024, plaintiffs had offered 2/23/2024,
3/1/2024 and 3/8/2024 for depositions.
The court finds that there were two attempts to
meet and confer and obtain deposition dates, there was no responses to the meet
and confer, and that dates were provided only after the motion was filed.  The motion was reasonable and necessary in
order to obtain the depositions.  The
plaintiffs did not engage in good faith and failed to attend their depositions
or provide alternative dates until after the motion was filed.  This is discovery abuse without substantial
justification. 
Monetary sanctions are awarded against
plaintiffs ARACELI FUENTES DE GASCA AKA ARACELI FUENTESDEGASCA & GEORGE GASCA
for failing to attend their depositions and their counsel Knight Law Group, LLP
for failing to meet and confer in good faith , jointly and severally, in the
amount of $560 payable by 3/1/2024 to the Client Trust Account of Bowman and
Brooke LLP, 970 West 190th St., Suite 700 Torrance, CA 90502.
