And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between GOLF PROJECTS LINDERO, INC. (GPL) and LAKE LINDERO (LLHOA). The judge grants GPL's ex parte application to continue the hearing on the Motion for Sanctions, which is now set for hearing on April 24, 2024. The judge orders electronic service of papers concerning this motion and requires that any pleadings be served on Hinshaw & Culbertson, the counsel for LLHOA. The judge also grants monetary sanctions as attorney fees claimed by GPL against LLHOA, Allan, and their counsel Myers Widders, leaving only the allocation to be determined at the hearing. The judge notes that while GPL claims that Ilana Makovoz, counsel for GPL, contacted Desmond Hinds of Hinshaw & Culbertson on January 19, 2024, to obtain their signature on the stipulation, GPL's own email dated January 10, 2024, reveals that the stipulation was actually signed on that date. The judge orders that briefs be limited to 15 pages and include a Table of Contents and Table of Authorities, and that declarations be limited to 15 pages in total. The judge also notes that the court expects counsel to be cooperative and not petty.
