Summary in English:

The Court issues a tentative ruling on the pending motions and sets a hearing date for January 30, 2024. The Court finds that Superior Life Finance failed to file and serve its complaint in intervention after being granted leave to intervene on September 13, 2023. As a result, the Court strikes the order granting leave to intervene and all pleadings filed by Superior Life Finance since September 13, 2023. The Court also finds that Superior Life Finance has no standing in the case and has engaged in improper purpose, harassment, and delay.

The Court sets an OSC for January 30, 2024, to determine whether monetary sanctions of $5,000 should be issued against Superior Life Finance and its counsel for presenting papers for an improper purpose, including harassment, causing unnecessary delay, and needlessly increasing the cost of litigation.

The Court also denies the motion to intervene for The Reeds and is inclined to deny the motion to compel the Receiver to commence premium collection and pay premiums, revert to limited receivership, and produce communications with judgment creditors and all counsel that sought Receiver's appointment.

Finally, the Court sets an OSC for January 30, 2024, to determine whether the Receiver should be continued to serve as the Receiver in this matter, and will entertain suggestions for the substitution of the Receiver if the Court determines that the Receiver is not acting in the best interest of Reliant.
