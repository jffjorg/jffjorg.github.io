 Case Number:  23STCV30422    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental papers, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  December 13, 2023, Plaintiff Myung Shin (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Elizabeth Yang, individually and as Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang  Trust (“Yang”), L&M California, Inc. (“L&M”), and Does 1-50 for general  negligence, premises liability, violations of Health & Safety Code § 19995,  Civil Code §§ 51, 51.5, 52(a), 54, 54.1, and 54.3, and Title II of the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  On  February 21, 2024, the clerk entered L&M’s default. On May 13, 2024, the  Court vacated the default based on the parties’ stipulation. On May 14, 2024,  L&M filed an answer.  On  April 2, 2024, Yang filed an answer.  On  August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed (1) a motion to compel the responses of Defendant  Elizabeth Yang as Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust (“Trustee”) to  Plaintiff’s request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions,  (2) a motion to compel Trustee’s responses to Plaintiff’s special  interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, and (3) a motion to compel Trustee’s  responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The motions were set for hearing on October 1  and 2, 2024. On September 17 and 18, 2024, Trustee filed oppositions. On  September 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed replies.  On  October 1, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling and heard argument on Plaintiff’s  motion to compel Trustee’s responses to special interrogatories.  Trustee's counsel informed the Court that he  served Trustee's responses to the special interrogatories on September 30,  2024. Plaintiff's counsel responded that the responses contained objections  even though Trustee waived any objections by serving late responses.  The Court modified the tentative ruling and  adopted the ruling as modified.  On  October 2, 2024, the Court on its own motion vacated the portion of the October  1, 2024 order addressing Plaintiff’s motion to compel Trustee’s responses to  special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The Court continued the hearings on  Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories (set for  October 1, 2024) and Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to form  interrogatories and requests for production of documents (set for October 2,  2024) to November 20, 2024.  The Court  granted Plaintiff and Trustee leave to file supplemental briefs addressing Sinaiko  Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 390 (Sinaiko) and its application to the issues raised by  Plaintiff’s motions to compel discovery responses and Trustee's untimely  discovery responses.  On November  13, 2024, Plaintiff and Trustee filed supplemental briefs.  Trial  is currently scheduled for June 11, 2025.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiff  asks the Court to impose sanctions on Trustee and her counsel of record due to Trustee's late responses to Plaintiff’s  request for production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one,  and form interrogatories, set one.  Trustee  asks the Court to deny the sanctions requests or, if the Court imposes  sanctions, to impose them only on Trustee’s former counsel.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides:  “If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the  following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling  a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent  exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or  any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored  information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of  the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If  a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,  the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)  DISCUSSION  On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff served request for production  of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form  interrogatories, set one, on Trustee.   Trustee did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses  by the time Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses on August 22, 2024.  In  her September 17 and 18, 2024 oppositions to Plaintiff’s motions to compel,  Trustee admitted that she had not served timely responses to the request for production  of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.  Trustee blamed the failure to serve responses  on a clerical error by Trustee’s prior counsel and asserted that she would  serve responses by October 1, 2024.  Trustee  asked the Court to impose any sanctions only on her prior counsel.  On  September 30, 2024, Trustee served late responses to Plaintiff’s request for  production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.  Because the responses were late, Plaintiff  asks the Court to impose sanctions on Trustee and her counsel.   In Sinaiko,  the Court of Appeal held that service of an untimely interrogatory response “does  not divest the trial court of authority to hear and grant a motion to compel  responses under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2030.290.”  (Sinaiko, supra, 148  Cal.App.4th at p. 396.)  “In many cases  involving untimely response, the propounding party will take the motion off  calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions.  If the propounding party proceeds with the  motion, however, the trial court has discretion to rule on the motion.”  (Id. at p. 409, emphasis added; see  Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a) [“The Court may award sanctions under the  Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even  though . . . the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the  motion was filed”].)  Here,  Plaintiff asks the Court to impose sanctions because Trustee’s late discovery  responses required Plaintiff to engage in extensive meet and confer efforts and  prepare and serve motions to compel responses. Trustee asks the Court to deny Plaintiff’s request for sanctions  because Trustee’s responses, while untimely, were substantive.  Trustee suggests that Sinaiko  authorizes sanctions only when discovery responses are both untimely and  deficient.  (Brief p. 2.)  The Court does not read Sinaiko as  restricting the trial courts’ discretion in this manner.  The Court of Appeal observed: “The trial  court might compel responses without objection if it finds no legally valid  responses have been provided to one or more interrogatories; it might deny the motion  to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just  impose sanctions . . . .”  (Sinaiko,  supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 409.)   The statement suggests that a trial court may properly exercise its  discretion to impose sanctions even if the court does not determine that the  late discovery responses were deficient.The Court does not address the adequacy of Trustee's late discovery responses in this ruling.  However, the Court finds that sanctions are appropriate because of Trustee's long delay in providing discovery responses. Plaintiff  requests $8,430.00 in sanctions based on 30 hours of attorney time at a rate  of $250.00 per hour and three $60.00 filing fees.  For each of Plaintiff’s three motions to  compel, counsel spent four hours to prepare the motion and 1.5 hours on meet  and confer efforts and anticipated spending one hour to review Trustee’s  opposition, 1.5 hours to prepare Plaintiff’s reply, and two hours to attend the  hearing.  The  Court grants $1,430.00 in sanctions based on five hours of attorney time and  three filing fees. Trustee  asks the Court to order her former counsel to pay the sanctions award.  But the Court may impose a monetary sanction  only on parties and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to  compel responses to requests for production or interrogatories.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300., subd. (c),  2030.290, subd. (c).)  Trustee’s former counsel  did not make or oppose Plaintiff's motions to compel.   The Court instead orders Trustee and her counsel of record to pay the  sanctions award to Plaintiff.  CONCLUSION The  Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Myung Shin’s motions to compel Defendant Elizabeth Yang as Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust’s  responses to request for production of documents, set one, special  interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one.  The Court orders Defendant  Elizabeth Yang as Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust and her counsel of record to pay Plaintiff Myung Shin $1,430.00 in sanctions within 30 days of the  hearing on this motion.  In all other respects, the Court denies the motions. Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
