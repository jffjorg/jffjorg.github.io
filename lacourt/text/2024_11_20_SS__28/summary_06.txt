And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Myung Shin, has filed a motion to compel the responses of the defendant, Elizabeth Yang, as Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust, to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The defendant has admitted that she did not provide timely responses and blamed the failure to serve responses on a clerical error by her prior counsel.

The court finds that sanctions are appropriate due to the defendant's long delay in providing discovery responses. The plaintiff requests $8,430.00 in sanctions, and the court grants $1,430.00 in sanctions. The court orders the defendant and her counsel of record to pay the sanctions award to the plaintiff.

The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses, but denies the motion in all other respects. The court sets the hearing on the motion to November 20, 2024, and orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling and file proof of service with the court within five days.
