 Case Number:  23STCV17876    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 31, 2023, Plaintiff Bella Yebeyan filed this action against Defendants
Nshan Ivanyan (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle tort and general
negligence. 
On
November 8, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
August 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel
Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, set one, and for
sanctions.  The motion was set for
hearing on September 30, 2024.  Plaintiff
did not file a proof of service of the motion to compel. 
On
September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion to
compel.  Plaintiff did not file a proof
of service of the non-opposition. 
On September
30, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel.  After conferring with the parties, the Court
took the motion to compel off calendar. 
Also
on September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed another motion to compel Defendant’s
responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on November 20,
2024.  On November 6, 2024, Defendant
filed an opposition.  On November 13,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to compel Defendant’s responses to form interrogatories, set
one, and to impose sanctions on Defendant. 
Defendant
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff served form
interrogatories, set one, on Defendant.  Defendant
did not provide timely responses and had not provided verified objection-free responses
by the time Defendant filed this motion on September 30, 2024. 
In
Defendant’s November 6, 2024 opposition, Defendant asserts that, after
Plaintiff filed the motion to compel on September 30, 2024, Defendant served
verified, objection-free responses to the form interrogatories.  According to Defendant, service of the
responses rendered Plaintiff’s motion moot. 
Defendant does not state when he served the responses or provide any
reason for the delay. 
In her
reply, Plaintiff asks the Court to impose sanctions on Defendant based on
Defendant’s delay in serving the interrogatory responses. 
In Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390 (Sinaiko), the Court of Appeal held that service of an
untimely interrogatory response “does not divest the trial court of authority
to hear and grant a motion to compel responses under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 2030.290.”  (Sinaiko, supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 396.)  “In many
cases involving untimely response, the propounding party will take the motion
off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions.  If the propounding party proceeds with the
motion, however, the trial court has discretion to rule on the motion.”  (Id. at p. 409; see Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a) [“The Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though . . .
the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed”].) 
Plaintiff
requests $5,200.00 in sanctions based on 8 hours of attorney time at a rate of
$650.00 per hour. 
Counsel spent approximately 3.5 hours drafting and reviewing the motion
and anticipated spending approximately 4.5 hours reviewing any opposition,
drafting a reply brief, and appearing at the hearing. 
The
Court awards $750.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES as moot Plaintiff Bella
Yebeyan’s motion to compel Defendant Nshan
Ivanyan’s responses to form interrogatories, set one. 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Bella Yebeyan’s request for sanctions and orders
Defendant Nshan Ivanyan and his counsel, jointly and severally, to pay
Plaintiff Bella Yebeyan $750.00 within 30 days of the date of this order.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the
sanctions request. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
