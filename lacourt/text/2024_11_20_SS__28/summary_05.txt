And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the case. Blue Hill wants to intervene to protect its interests as the insurer of Defendant Jun Chen, who has stopped responding to his counsel and Blue Hill. Although Blue Hill has not submitted a proposed answer-in-intervention, the judge is denying the motion because it does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 387. The judge orders Blue Hill to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
