 Case Number:  22STCV18394    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  28 On
September 23, 2024, Defendants City of Beverly Hills and Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Moving Defendants”) filed (1) a motion to set the
compensation of Plaintiff’s expert Rajan M. Patel, M.D.,
and (2) a motion to set the compensation of Plaintiff’s expert Andrew Morris,
D.C.  The motions were set for hearing on
November 20, 2024. On November 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions.  On November 19, 2024, Moving Defendants filed
replies. 
The
proofs of service attached to the motions did not show that Moving Defendants
served the motions on Rajan M. Patel,
M.D. or Andrew Morris, D.C.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2034.470, subd. (a) [“Notice of this motion shall also be given
to the expert”].) 
On
November 19, 2024, one day before the scheduled hearing, Moving Defendants
filed replies asserting that they had provided proper notice of the motions to
Rajan M. Patel, M.D. and Andrew Morris, D.C. 
 In light of Moving Defendants’ recently-filed replies,
the Court needs additional time to consider the motions.  The Court therefore continues the hearing to
a date to be provided at the November 20, 2024 hearing.
