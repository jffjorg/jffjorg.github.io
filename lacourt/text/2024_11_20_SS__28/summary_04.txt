And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the parties' requests and has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel defendant's responses to plaintiff's form interrogatories. The plaintiff has requested that the court compel the defendant's responses and impose sanctions on the defendant for failing to timely respond to the interrogatories. The defendant argues that the motion is moot since the defendant has now served verified, objection-free responses to the interrogatories.

The court finds that the defendant's delay in serving the responses does not divest the court of authority to hear and grant the motion to compel responses. The court awards $750.00 in sanctions to the plaintiff for the defendant's delay in serving the responses, but denies the rest of the plaintiff's sanctions request. The court also denies the plaintiff's motion to compel as moot since the defendant has now served the responses.

The court orders the defendant and his counsel to pay the plaintiff $750.00 within 30 days of the date of this order.
