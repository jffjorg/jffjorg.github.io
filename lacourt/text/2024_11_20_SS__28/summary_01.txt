```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ashley Torres's action. The petition presents several inconsistencies and lacks explanation for certain calculations. Specifically, the petition states that $3,250.00 of medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, but also states that $3,249.00 has already been paid. Additionally, the petition fails to explain who paid the remaining $2,096.15 in medical expenses. The court cannot grant the petition without proof that all medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Therefore, the court denies the petition without prejudice.
