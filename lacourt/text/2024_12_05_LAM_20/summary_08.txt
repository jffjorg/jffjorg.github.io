And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Motion for Protective Order filed by Wax Paper, LLC, Wax Paper Frogtown, LLC, and Wax Paper Chinatown, LLC. The defendants argued that the discovery propounded by Plaintiff Christensen was excessive, unnecessary, and objectionable, and that it was meant to harass and overwhelm them. However, the Judge found that while some of the requests were objectionable, the discovery was not harassing or inappropriate in volume. The Judge noted that the defendants had not shown good cause for a protective order and that the discovery was necessary for the case. The Judge also declined to award sanctions and ordered the moving party to give notice.
