And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is in regards to a lemon law matter involving Plaintiff Miguel Hernandez and Defendant General Motors, LLC. On July 1, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from Defendant. However, Defendant failed to provide further responses in compliance with the Court's discovery order. As a result, Plaintiff is seeking issue, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions. The Court finds that Defendant's actions constitute a misuse of the discovery process, but will not award issue or evidentiary sanctions since Defendant has since provided the required responses. With respect to monetary sanctions, the Court will award reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,200, rather than the requested $2,522.85. The Motion is granted in part as set forth herein.
