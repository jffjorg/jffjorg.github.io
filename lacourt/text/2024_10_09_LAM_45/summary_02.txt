And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The plaintiff, Joseph Allen, is seeking to quash the subpoena issued by the defendant, County of Los Angeles, to the San Francisco Fire Department for production of business records. The defendant is seeking to obtain documents from the plaintiff's subsequent employer regarding his ADHD, disability, and medical condition.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena in part, finding that the documents sought are not directly relevant to the plaintiff's claims against the defendant. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in its entirety, finding that the request was procedurally deficient.

The judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's motion to quash is procedurally improper, and has ruled that the defendant has not shown a compelling need for the discovery sought in the subpoena. The judge has found that the defendant has not established a sufficient connection between the documents sought and the issues in the case, and has concluded that the subpoena is overly broad and seeks information that is not directly relevant to the plaintiff's claims.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to quash the deposition subpoena in part, and denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions.
