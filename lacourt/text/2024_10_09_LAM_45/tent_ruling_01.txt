Background
            On
April 21, 2022, Plaintiff Tamar Kaloustian (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
Injunctive Relief and Civil Penalties against Defendant LesserEvil LLC
(“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 100, alleging a single cause of action under
Violations of the Health & Safety Code §25249.6, et seq.  
The Complaint
alleges the following: Defendant manufactures, distributes, and/or sells “Lesser
Evil - Lil' Puffs - Vegg-ie Blend - UPC #: 18099900029 5; Lesser Evil - Lil'
Puffs -Strawberry Beet - UPC#: 18099900028 8; Lesser Evil - Paleo Puffs -
"No Cheese" Cheesiness" - UPC#: 85676200746 3
("Products") in California (Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 5.) Defendant allegedly
introduces Products contaminated with lead into the California marketplace and
exposes consumers of the Products to lead, and Defendant has constructive
knowledge of this due to media coverage. (Id., ¶ ¶ 2, 23.) Plaintiff
brings this claim on behalf of the public interest, and under the initiative
declared by Proposition 65 to inform the People of the State of California “to
be informed about exposures to chemicals that cause cancer, birth defects, or
other reproductive harm. (Proposition 65 § 1(b).) (Id. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
sets forth a one-year period in which Defendant failed to provide a warning
with the Products regarding the reproductive hazards of lead. (Id., ¶
15.) Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that prior to filing the complaint, Plaintiff
provided (1) two sets of 60-Day "Notice of Violation of Proposition 65"
and (2) a Certificate of Merit to the California Attorney General, the District
Attorneys of every county in California, the City Attorneys of every California
city with a population greater than 750,000 and […] Defendant.” (Id., ¶¶
17-18.) Plaintiff asserts that none of the public prosecutors have commenced
prosecution of Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant. (Id., ¶ 20.)
            On
February 17, 2023, Plaintiff served the first Notice of Deposition of
Defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK Deposition”), set for April 3, 2023.
(Declaration of Tro Krikorian (“Krikorian Decl.”) ¶3.) 
On July 11,
2024, Plaintiff served the Fifth Amended Notice of the PMK Deposition, set for
July 23, 2024, and notified Defendant of its intent to file a motion to compel
deposition attendance should Defendant fail to present its PMK on that date.
(Krikorian Decl. ¶11; Ex. B.)  On July
19, 2024, Defense counsel notified Plaintiff of Defendant's unavailability due
to a board meeting for July 23, 2024. (Krikorian Decl. ¶ 12.) On July 22, 2024,
the parties corresponded and were unable to reach an agreement. (Krikorian
Decl. ¶14; Exs. D & C.)
            On
August 23, 2024, Plaintiff Tamar Kaloustian, in the public interest
(“Plaintiff”) filed this motion compelling the deposition of Defendant
LesserEvil LLC’s Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”) and imposing sanctions on
Plaintiff. 
            On
August 27, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for terminating sanctions, which
Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 9, 2024. 
            On
September 17, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the instant motion.
            On
September 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an order
to shorten the time for hearing on the instant motion.  On the same day, Plaintiff also filed a reply
to Defendant’s opposition.
            On
September 20, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s ex parte
application for an order to shorten the time for hearing on the instant motion.

Also on
September 20, 2024, the Court, considering the ex parte application and
opposition, denied Plaintiff’s ex parte application. (9-20-24 Minute
Order)
            On
the Court’s own motion, the hearing on the instant motion was continued to Wednesday,
October 9, 2024.
Legal
Standard
CCP § 2025.450(a) states: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.
The motion must
be accompanied by a declaration showing a reasonable and good faith attempt to
informally resolve each issue presented or, when the deponent fails to attend
the deposition and produce the requested documents or things, the motion must
be accompanied by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).)
 
Discussion
            Motion to Compel Deposition of Person
Most Knowledgeable
            Merits of the Motion
            Plaintiff
moves to compel the deposition of Defendant LesserEvil LLC’s person most
knowledgeable. Plaintiff contends that several Deposition notices were served
on Defendant, with the Fifth Amended Deposition Notice on Defendants, served on
July 11, 2024, setting the PMK Deposition for July 23, 2024, a date where both
the PMK and defense counsel were available. (Motion, pp. 1,2.) Defendant did
not object to said depositions, and Plaintiff engaged in meet and confer
efforts. (Krikorian Decl., ¶ 13.) On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff was notified of a
board meeting scheduled for July 23, 2023, rendering Defendant’s PMK unavailable.
(Id.) Plaintiff moves for an
order compelling the PMK Deposition within 10 days of this hearing. (Id.) 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff is a serial Proposition 65 litigant, and that Plaintiff
unilaterally noticed these depositions. (Opposition, p. 1; Declaration of David
H. Kwasniewski (“Kwasniewski Decl.”) ¶ 2.) Defendant argues that objections
were issues on March 24, 2023, and Plaintiff refused to appear for her
scheduled deposition or provide alternative dates. (Id., ¶¶ 4, 5.)
According to Defendant, on July 19, 2024, it learned of an emergency board
meeting set for July 23, 2024, which required the attendance of the intended
witness, and it promptly notified Plaintiff of the need to reschedule. (Id.,
¶ 17.) Rather than rescheduling, Plaintiff announced its intent to move to
compel. (Id., ¶ 18.)
The court finds
Plaintiff sufficiently showed this motion should be granted. Plaintiff’s
counsel shows they property noticed these depositions on July 11, 2024. (Krikorian
Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. A.) On July 19, 2024, Defendant’s counsel notified Plaintiff’s
counsel by telephone that a board meeting was scheduled for July 23, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 12.) On July 22, 2024, the parties corresponded via email; Plaintiff
reiterated the request for alternative deposition dates in writing, and
Defendant’s counsel stated that due to Plaintiff discarding the LesserEvil Puffs,
Plaintiff committed destruction of evidence, requiring the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Id., ¶ 14, Exs. C, D; Williams v. Russ, (2008) 167
Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1223.)
In reply,
Plaintiff argues its obligation to preserve evidence and comply with the
Discovery Act should lead to the issuance of sanctions because the alleged
destruction of the Product occurred during the ordinary course of business and
was not an intentional or egregious attempt to evade discovery. (Reply, p. 1.)
“Spoliation of evidence means the destruction or significant alteration of
evidence or the failure to preserve evidence for another's use in pending or
future litigation.” (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223; see also Reeves v.
MV Transp., Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 666, 681.) “Such
conduct is condemned because it ‘can destroy fairness and justice, for it
increases the risk of an erroneous decision on the merits of the underlying
cause of action.¿ Destroying evidence can also increase the costs of litigation
as parties attempt to reconstruct the destroyed evidence or to develop other
evidence, which may be less accessible, less persuasive, or both’”¿(Williams,
167 Cal.App.4th at 1223 quoting Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Superior
Court (1998) 18 Cal.4th 1, 8.) “While there is no tort cause of action for
the intentional destruction of evidence…it is a misuse of the discovery process
that is subject to a broad range of punishment, including monetary, issue,
evidentiary, and terminating sanctions.” (Williams, 167 Cal.App.4th at
1223 citing CCP §§ 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a)-(d); see also New Albertsons,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1426 [“if it is
sufficiently egregious, misconduct committed in connection with the failure to
produce evidence in discovery may justify the imposition of nonmonetary
sanctions even absent a prior order compelling discovery, or its
equivalent.”].) 
Plaintiff
further argues that Defendant was not prejudiced due to Plaintiff’s alleged
destruction. (Motion, pp. 1-2.) 
Plaintiff states that Defendant as the manufacturer, and distributor of
the Products, has ample Product in its possession to test. (Id.)  Moreover, Plaintiff delivered met and
conferred letters to Defendant prior through email prior to filing the motion
to compel. (Krikorian Decl. Exs. C and D.)
The emails
provided by Defendant do not appear to show Defendant actually ever gave any
specific dates for the depositions. (Id., Ex. D.) Plaintiff’s counsel
attests that during the July 19, 2024, phone call, Defense counsel was asked to
“send their reasoning and alternative dates in writing” and that Defendant
failed to do so, requiring a fifth cancellation of the PMK Deposition. (Id.,
Ex.C.) The court finds that failing to provide any alternative dates, when
Defendant had plenty of opportunities to do so, will not sustain Defendant’s
burden and does not justify avoiding depositions. The court notes that the
Fifth Deposition Notice was not unilaterally selected, since Plaintiff selected
July 23, 2024, to proceed with the deposition when Defendant objected on June
25, 2024. (Kwasniewski Decl., ¶ 16.) Even if the deposition was unilaterally
noticed, the fact that a deposition was unilaterally noticed is not a legally
recognized ground to object and avoid the deposition. It is the responding
party’s burden to provide alternative dates for a deposition, which Defendant
failed to do so in these matters.
The court
therefore rules as follows:
The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant Lesser Evil LLC’s Person Most
Knowledgeable deposition. 
Request for
Monetary Sanctions 
            Plaintiff
requests $1,800.00 for the motion, as monetary sanctions against Defendant.
(Motion, p. 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is $450.00. (Krikorian Decl.,
¶ 15.) Plaintiff requests to recover 2.5 hours for the motion and anticipated
an additional 1.5 hours in preparing a reply and attending the hearing. (Id.)
The court finds reducing Plaintiffs’ recoverable time to 2.5 hours for the work
on the motion and 1.5 hours to prepare a  reply and attend the motion hearing is
reasonable. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s total recoverable
amounts in attorney’s fees and costs are $1,800.00 for the motion, reply, and
hearing attendance ([(1 hour + 1.5 hours) x $450]).
The court
therefore rules as follows:
The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant in the amount $1,800.00 for
the motion to compel Defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable deposition. The
court orders Defendant to pay $1,800.00 Plaintiff, through their counsel of
record, within 20 days of the date of this motion.
 
            It
is so ordered.
