And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Peachtree Settlement Funding, LLC v. Anthony Macklin. The petitioner, Peachtree, has moved for approval to transfer Anthony Macklin's structured settlement payment rights. However, the petitioner failed to provide a declaration from the payee, Anthony Macklin, attesting to the facts of the petition. Without this declaration, the court cannot determine whether Anthony Macklin understands and does not wish to exercise his right to cancel the transfer agreement. Therefore, the petition is denied without prejudice.
