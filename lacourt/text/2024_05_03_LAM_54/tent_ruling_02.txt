Responding
Party: None
 
T/R:       THE PETITION
IS DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
PETITIONER TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the
hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers. 
No opposition has been received.
 
Petitioner moves for approval to transfer Payee Anthony Macklin’s
structured settlement rights. But Petitioner has failed to provide a
declaration from the payee attesting to the facts of the petition. Without this
declaration the Court cannot determine, for example, whether Payee understands
and does not wish to exercise their right to cancel the transfer agreement. The
petition is DENIED without prejudice.
