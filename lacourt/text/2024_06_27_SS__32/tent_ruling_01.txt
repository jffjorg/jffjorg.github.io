TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


June
  27, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV37981




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Leave to File Cross Complaint




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Garfield Beach CVS LLC




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On October 14, 2021, Plaintiff
Barrett Business Services, Inc. filed a complaint against Defendants Kevin
Green, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and Does 1 through 100.
 
On September 27, 2022,
Defendant Garfield Beach CVS, LLC, erroneously sued and served as CVS Pharmacy,
Inc. (“Defendant”), filed an answer. On the same date, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant Single Source Security, Inc.
 
On May 31, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Larisa
Notkin, individually and doing business as Secure Plus Services. No opposition
has been filed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the
initial complaint or cross-complaint against the cross-complainant must be
filed before or at the same time as the answer to the initial complaint or
cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days of service of the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 412.20(a)(3),
428.50(a), 432.10.)  Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any time
before the court has set a trial date.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§428.50(b).)   
 
If a party fails to file a cross-complaint within the time
limits described above, they must obtain permission from the court to file the
cross-complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 426.50, 428.50(c).)  Leave to
file a mandatory cross-complaint must be granted absent bad faith.  (Silver
Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.)  Leave to
file a permissive cross-complaint need only be granted in the interest of
justice.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 428.50(c).)          
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant seeks to file a
cross complaint against Larisa Notkin, individually and doing business as
Secure Plus Services, alleging causes of action for indemnity, contribution/
apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. The complaint and
cross-complaint arise from the same incident and should be litigated together. There
does not appear to be prejudice to any party by the filing of the
cross-complaint. Accordingly, the Court finds it to be in the interests of
justice to grant leave to file a cross-complaint.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for leave to file a
cross-complaint.  Defendant is ordered to file and serve the
cross-complaint within 10 days.
 
Defendant shall give notice of the
Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
