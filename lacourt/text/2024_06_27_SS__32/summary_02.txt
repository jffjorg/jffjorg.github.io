Significant Statements:
  - The size of the defect weighs in favor of Defendant, but there is a triable issue of fact regarding the additional factors that courts typically consider in assessing a sidewalk condition's triviality as a matter of law.
  - The condition here is different than a raised portion of sidewalk because of its concave nature that created a lip for Plaintiff's shoe to get caught.
  - Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that the defect was trivial.

And here is a brief English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Defendant City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment, which sought to dismiss the Plaintiff's claim that the City is liable for her injuries resulting from a fall on a sidewalk. The Defendant argued that the sidewalk defect was trivial, but the Judge found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the visibility of the defect, the lighting conditions at the time of the fall, and the Plaintiff's ability to see the defect. The Judge also found that the Defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the defect was trivial as a matter of law.
