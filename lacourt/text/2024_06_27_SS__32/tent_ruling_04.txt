RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


June
  27, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV29247




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Leave to File Cross Complaint




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant City of South Gate




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 8, 2022,
Plaintiff Robert Mendoza filed a complaint against Defendants City of South
Gate, Armor Cast Products Company, Inc., and Does 1 through 100, alleging
dangerous condition of public property and negligence.
 
On November 21, 2022,
Defendant City of South Gate (“Defendant”), filed an answer. 
 
On March 4, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against I. Guerra,
Inc., DBA L.W. Reinhold Plastics. No opposition has been filed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the
initial complaint or cross-complaint against the cross-complainant must be
filed before or at the same time as the answer to the initial complaint or
cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days of service of the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 412.20(a)(3),
428.50(a), 432.10.)  Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any time
before the court has set a trial date.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§428.50(b).)   
 
If a party fails to file a cross-complaint within the time
limits described above, they must obtain permission from the court to file the
cross-complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 426.50, 428.50(c).)  Leave to
file a mandatory cross-complaint must be granted absent bad faith.  (Silver
Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.)  Leave to
file a permissive cross-complaint need only be granted in the interest of
justice.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 428.50(c).)          
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant seeks to file a
cross complaint against I. Guerra, Inc. dba L.W. Reinhold Plastics, alleging
causes of action for indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The
complaint and cross-complaint arise from the same incident and should be
litigated together. There does not appear to be prejudice to any party by the
filing of the cross-complaint. Accordingly, the Court finds it to be in the
interests of justice to grant leave to file a cross-complaint.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for leave to file a
cross-complaint.  Defendant is ordered to file and serve the
cross-complaint within 10 days.
 
Defendant shall give notice of the
Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
