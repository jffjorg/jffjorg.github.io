BACKGROUND
 
On May 25, 2022, Plaintiff Tamara
Bitner (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant City of Los Angeles
(“Defendant”) for injuries related to a fall on a sidewalk. Plaintiff asserts a
cause of action for negligence and premises liability.
 
Defendant now moves for summary judgment arguing that: (1) the area
where Plaintiff fell was trivial as a matter of law; and (2) Defendant is not
liable for a negligence cause of action.
 
Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion
that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law[.] There is a triable issue of material fact if,
and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the
underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with
the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)  “[T]he party moving for summary judgment
bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the
nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of
production, he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie
showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.” (Ibid.;
Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474
[summary judgment standards held by Aguilar apply to summary
adjudication motions].)  Further, in line
with Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., “[o]n a motion for summary
adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as
to the challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no
triable issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay
Cruise Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)  As to each claim
as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential
element, or to establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v.
D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520)
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the
court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a
factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the evidence
in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to
identify issues rather than to determine issues.  Only when the inferences are indisputable may
the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict,
the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839 [cleaned up].) 
Further, “the trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a
factfinder to determine whose version is more likely true.  Nor may the trial court grant summary
judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Id. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)            
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
 
The Court declines to rule on Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s
evidence as they have no effect on the ruling herein. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
 
A. Dangerous Condition of Public Property
 
Government Code section 815 provides that “[a] public entity is not
liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of
the public entity or a public employee or any other person” except as provided
by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a); see Hoff v. Vacaville Unified
School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932.) “[D]irect tort liability of
public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be
liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care, and not on the general
tort provisions of Civil Code section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule of
immunity for public entities would be largely eroded by the routine application
of general tort principles.” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.)
 
Government Code section 835 sets out the exclusive conditions under
which a public entity is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of
public property. (Metcalf v. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1121, 1129, citing Brown v. Poway Unified School Dist. (1993) 4 Cal.4th
820, 829; see also Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th
1112.) A dangerous condition is “a condition of property that creates a
substantial (as distinguished from a minor, trivial or insignificant) risk of
injury when such property or adjacent property is used with due care in a
manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used.”  (Gov. Code § 830(a).)  
 
To establish a claim of dangerous condition on public property, a
plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant owned or controlled the property;
(2) that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury;
(3) that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the
kind of injury that occurred; (4) that defendant had notice of the dangerous
condition for a long enough time to have protected against it; (5) that
plaintiff was harmed; and (6) that the dangerous condition was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff’s harm.  (Gov. Code, § 835; CACI No.
1100.)  Consequently, a public entity is
only liable for a dangerous condition of property if it either creates the
condition or has actual or constructive notice of the condition.  (Gov Code §835(b).) 
 
1.      The
Trivial Defect Doctrine
 
“Property owners are required to
maintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition and
to use due care to eliminate dangerous conditions on their property.  But a property owner is not liable for
damages caused by a minor, trivial, or insignificant defect on its property.  The so-called ‘trivial defect doctrine’
recognizes that persons who maintain walkways, whether public or private, are
not required to maintain them in an absolutely perfect condition.  The duty of care imposed on a property owner,
even one with actual notice, does not require the repair of minor defects.”  (Fajardo v. Dailey (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 221, 226 [cleaned up].) 
 
“A condition is not a dangerous condition . . . if the
trial or appellate court, viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff,
determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the condition was of
such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding
circumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created
a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property was used
with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it would
be used.” (Gov. Code, § 830.2.)  
 
“In limited circumstances a court
may determine a walkway defect is trivial as a matter
of law.  Where reasonable minds can
reach only one conclusion—that there was no substantial risk of injury—the
issue is a question of law, properly resolved by way of summary judgment.  But where sufficient evidence has been
presented so that reasonable minds may differ as to whether the defect is
dangerous, summary judgment is inappropriate.”  (Id. at p. 226.)  
 

California courts have developed
two substantially similar tests to determine whether a sidewalk defect is
trivial, i.e., not dangerous, as a matter of law.  In Stathoulis v. City of Montebello (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 559, 567-68, the Court of Appeal set out a two part test.
“First, the court reviews evidence regarding the type and size of the
defect.  If that preliminary analysis
reveals a trivial defect, the court considers evidence of any additional
factors such as the weather, lighting and visibility conditions at the time of
the accident, the existence of debris or obstructions, and plaintiff’s
knowledge of the area.  If these
additional factors do not indicate the defect was sufficiently dangerous to a
reasonably careful person, the court should deem the defect trivial as a matter
of law ....” (See also Nunez v. City of Redondo Beach (2022) 81
Cal.App.5th 749, 758 [adopting two-step framework]; Huckey v. City of
Temecula (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1105 [same].)
 
More recently, in Stack v. City
of Lemoore (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110, the Court of Appeal read
Government Code section 830.2 to require a more “holistic” approach, stating,
“[a]lthough we agree with the premise that the size of the defect is the
primary determinant of triviality, as discussed below, we modify the prevailing
two-step framework into a holistic, multi-factor analysis.”  
 
            “We begin with the most important
factor: the defect’s size.” (Stack, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 110 [cleaned
up].)  “Sidewalk elevations ranging from
three-quarters of an inch to one and one-half inches have generally been held
trivial as a matter of law.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1107; see Stathoulis, supra, 164 Cal.App.4th at p. 568 [“Several
decisions have found height differentials of up to one and one-half inches
trivial as a matter of law.”]) “That said, there is no firmly fixed arbitrary
measurement in inches below which a defect is trivial as a matter of law and
above which it becomes a question of fact whether or not the defect is
dangerous.  This is because a court
should not rely solely upon the size of the defect ...
although the defect’s size ‘may be one of the most relevant factors’ to the
court’s decision.”  (Id. at pp.
112–113 [cleaned up].) 
 
The Court next considers
additional factors.  “Beyond size,
additional factors courts typically consider in assessing a sidewalk condition’s
triviality as a matter of law are: the nature and quality of the defect
(including whether it has jagged breaks or cracks); whether anything was
obstructing or concealing the defect (for instance, an object, debris, or other
substance); the lighting and weather conditions at the time of the incident;
whether the defect has caused other accidents; and plaintiff's familiarity with
the area.”  (Stack, supra,
91 Cal.App.5th at p. 115.)  With respect
to the various foregoing factors, Stack held that “individual
familiarity is not a proper factor for consideration within the trivial defect
doctrine.” (Id. at p. 120.)
 
Here, Defendant offers the
following facts:
 
-         
At
her deposition, Plaintiff testified that she tripped and fell on December 16,
2021 at about 7:10 to 7:20 p.m., and that it was fully dark, and a little
drizzly, and that she had never been in the area of the Location before. (UMF
7.) 
-         
At
her deposition, Plaintiff testified that at the time that she tripped and fell
she had no reason to believe that any debris or foreign substance caused her to
trip and fall. (UMF 13.)
-         
At
her deposition, Plaintiff testified that at the time she tripped and fell that
the ground was not slippery and she did not slip when she fell. (UMF 14.) 
-         
At
her deposition, Plaintiff testified that at the time she tripped and fell at
the Location there was nothing blocking her view of the sidewalk towards the
asphalt. (UMF 16.) 
-         
A
search of the City’s database for the Location revealed that no other claims
for the Location were retrieved for the period December 16, 2017, though
December 16, 2021. (UMF 18.) 
-         
At
his inspection of the Location, Dr. Blanchette measured and photographed the
uplift on which Plaintiff testified caused her to trip and fall and the
measurement was 7/16 of an inch. (UMF 21.) 
-         
At
his inspection of the Location, Dr. Blanchette photographed the Location at
6:22 p.m., when the astronomical twilight was consistent with the lighting
conditions at the time of Plaintiff’s trip and fall. The moon was up at the
time of the incident at 96.3% full, whereas at the time of Dr. Blanchette’s
inspection photo, the moon as up and 53.7 full. The contrast by color and shape
between the asphalt patch and the adjacent concrete sidewalk was conspicuous.
(UMF 22.) 
 
Defendant also provides
photographs of where Plaintiff fell, that were marked during Plaintiff’s
deposition. Plaintiff confirmed the following characterizations during her
deposition. The circle in exhibit D depicts where Plaintiff tripped. (Marston
Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. C, Pl. Depo. 26:1–6; Exh. D [exhibit B in the deposition].) The
star in exhibit F reflects the area where Plaintiff tripped. (Id., Pl.
Depo. 28:16–29:2, Exh. F [exhibit D in the deposition].) Plaintiff testified
that the toe of her shoe hit the raised edge, causing her to trip. (Id.,
Pl. Depo. 30:22–31:5.) Plaintiff then identified that the circle in exhibit G
was the area that caused her toe to get caught. (Id., Pl. Depo.
32:13–22; Exh. G [also labeled exhibit G in the deposition].) Plaintiff also
confirmed that the end of the ruler shown in exhibit H also represents the
location that caused her toe to be caught. (Id., Pl. Depo. 53:12–22 [exhibit
K in the deposition].) 
 
Defendant’s safety expert, Mark
Blanchette, conducted an inspection of the asphalt mound and measured the
maximum elevation change to be 7/16 inches. (Blanchette Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. D1-2.)
Mr. Blanchette observed no jagged or crumbling pieces at the subject location.
(Id. ¶ 9.)  Mr. Blanchette also
took a photograph of the subject sidewalk during the same astronomical twilight
as the time of the incident. (Id. ¶ 8, Exh. E.) 
 
Although the size of the defect
weighs in favor of Defendant, Defendant has not established the absence of a
triable issue of fact as to the additional factors that courts typically
consider in assessing a sidewalk condition’s triviality as a matter of law. The
photograph in Exhibit E of Blanchette’s declaration shows that in the lighting
conditions, there is a triable issue of fact as to what can be seen.[1]
It appears that there is a discoloration, but it is not apparent that at that particular
time (at least as depicted in the photograph) there is a visible defect of the
asphalt mound not being flushed with the sidewalk. Plaintiff testified that it
was too dark for her to see any debris on the ground. (Pl. Depo. 48:1–4.) She
also testified that her shoe was caught in the space between the sidewalk and
the raised portion of the mound. Even though Defendant sets forth evidence that
the defect is only 7/16 inches, the condition here is different than a raised
portion of sidewalk because of its concave nature that created a lip for
Plaintiff’s shoe to get caught. Particularly in the lighting condition, there
is a triable issue of fact regarding the visibility of that space where
Plaintiff’s shoe was caught, and Defendant does not set forth facts that
Plaintiff was asked whether she was able to observe that the asphalt patch was
not flush with the sidewalk. Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences
in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court cannot conclude as a matter
of law that the defect was trivial. 
 
Because Defendant did not
alternatively move for summary adjudication, and has not disposed of the entire
action, the Court will not address its arguments surrounding the second cause
of action for negligence. 
 
Accordingly, the motion for
summary judgment is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendant City
of Los Angeles’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.  
 
            Defendant shall
provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
