[1] In Kasparian v.
AvalonBay Communities, Inc.
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 11, 24-25, the court explained that “[s]ummary judgment
cannot be based on photographs where the reviewing court concludes either
reasonable minds might differ regarding whether the photographs correctly
depict the alleged defect and the surrounding environs or whether the
photographs conclusively establish the defect was open and obvious.” Here, based
on Exhibit E, the Court cannot say that reasonable minds cannot differ
regarding whether the defect is trivial.
