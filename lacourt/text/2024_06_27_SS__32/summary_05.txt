And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the complaint and attachments filed by Infinity Insurance Company against Alexandra Delgado and has issued a tentative ruling. The complaint alleges that Delgado breached a settlement agreement between the parties. Delgado demurs to the complaint, arguing that it does not contain facts that a contract was formed, does not allege a written contract, and is barred by the statute of limitations.

The Court has reviewed the pleadings and attachments and finds that the complaint and attachments establish a binding contract between the parties. The Court overrules Delgado's demurrer to the complaint.

The Court notes that the statute of limitations for a breach of contract action is four years if based on a written instrument, and since the purported settlement agreement is contained within the offer and acceptance letters, it is based on a written instrument and subject to the four-year statute of limitations.

The Court orders that Delgado shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
