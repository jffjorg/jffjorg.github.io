MOTION
 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff Infinity Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendant Alexandra Delgado (“Defendant”) alleging
breach of contract of a settlement agreement.
 
Defendant now demurs to the complaint arguing it does not contain
facts that a contract was formed between the parties, does not allege a written
contract, and is barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiff opposes and
Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the
complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar
recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) A general demurrer may be brought where the dates
alleged in the complaint show the cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitations. (See Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries (1978) 81
Cal.App.3d 292, 300.) If dates are missing from the complaint that would show
the statute of limitations bars recovery, then there is no ground for a general
demurrer. The party demurring must instead ascertain the factual basis for the
contentions and file a motion for summary judgment. (See United Western
Medical Centers v. Superior Court (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Claudia
A. Smith, Defendant’s counsel, the parties had a telephone conversation on
January 22, 2024 to discuss the instant demurrer. (Smith Decl. ¶ 4.)  Therefore, the meet and confer requirement has
been met. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Breach
of Contract
 
The
elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are: (1)
the formation of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.”  (Coles v. Glaser (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 384, 391,
internal quotations omitted.)  “A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms—set out verbatim
in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and
incorporated therein by reference—or by its legal effect. [Citation.] In order
to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance
of its relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it requires a careful
analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of
legal conclusions.”¿ (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993, citations omitted.)¿ Terms of an oral
contract may be pleaded generally as to its effect because it is rarely
possible to allege the exact words. (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 635, 640; Khoury
v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  In
pleading the existence of a contractual relationship, “the complaint must
indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by
conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (g).)”  (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59.)   
 
 “‘A settlement agreement is a contract, and the legal
principles [that] apply to contracts generally apply to settlement contracts.’
[Citation.] Its validity is ‘judged by the same legal principles applicable to
contracts generally.’ [Citations.]”  (Stewart v. Preston Pipeline Inc.
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1565, 1585.) “Contract formation requires mutual
consent, which cannot exist unless the parties ‘agree upon the same thing in
the same sense.’ (Civ. Code, §§ 1580, 1550, 1565.) ‘If there is no evidence establishing
a manifestation of assent to the “same thing” by both parties, then there is no
mutual consent to contract and no contract formation.’ [Citation.].”  (Bustamente
v. Intuit, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 199, 208.) 
 
An essential element of any contract is the consent of the
parties, or mutual assent. Mutual assent to a contract usually is manifested by
an offer communicated to the offeree, and an acceptance communicated to the
offeror. An “offer” is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain
so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that
bargain is invited and will conclude it. Determination of whether a particular
communication constitutes an operative offer, rather than an inoperative step
in the preliminary negotiation of a contract, depends upon all the surrounding
circumstances. The objective manifestation of the party's assent ordinarily
controls in determining whether a communication constitutes an operative offer,
and the pertinent inquiry is whether the individual to whom the communication
was made had reason to believe that it was intended as an offer.  (Donovan
v. RRL Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 261, 271, rehearing denied, as modified.) 
 
“Contract law …
requires that an acceptance be communicated in a clear and unequivocal
fashion.”  (Gray v. Stewart (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1394,
1397.)  “ ‘[T]erms proposed in an offer must be met exactly, precisely and
unequivocally for its acceptance to result in the formation of a binding
contract [citations]; and a qualified acceptance amounts to a new proposal or
counteroffer putting an end to the original offer ....’ [Citation.]”  (Panagotacos
v. Bank of America (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 851, 855-56; J.B.B. Investment
Partners Ltd. v. R. Thomas Fair (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1, 13 n.10.) 
For example, when the recipient of an offer responds “I agree,” “I accept,” and
“we have a deal,” the communications “permit only one reasonable conclusion –
the parties agreed to a binding settlement.”  (J.B.B. Investment
Partners Ltd., 37 Cal.App.5th at 11.)   
 
“[W]hen parties agree on the
material terms of a contract with the intention to later reduce it to a formal
writing, failure to complete the formal writing does not negate the existence
of the initial contract.” (CSAA Ins. Exchange v. Hodroj (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 272, 276-77 [finding that letters of an offer and acceptance sent
between insurer and third-party to settle claim, formed a contract].) 
 
            Here, Plaintiff alleges that it
provided insurance coverage to three individuals involved in an accident with
Defendant. (Complaint ¶ 10.) On September
16, 2020, Defendant sent a letter offering to settle her claim with Plaintiff.
On October 6, 2020, Plaintiff timely accepted the offer and formed a binding
contract to settle the claim for the policy limits. (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff attaches the letters to its
complaint. (Complaint, Exh. A, B.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached
this agreement by filing a complaint against Plaintiff’s insureds. (Id. ¶ 18.) 
 
            Defendant appears to argue that
Plaintiff’s acceptance was not complete because it did not accept all the terms
of the offer. However, in a demurrer, the Court is limited by the pleading and any
attachments. Here, exhibit A attached to the complaint shows that Defendant
offered to settle the claim with Plaintiff for “the policy limits, subject to written
confirmation of same, and declarations under penalty of perjury from your
insured( s) that they were not in the course of any agency or employment when
the loss occurred.” This offer expired on October 6, 2020. (Complaint, Exh. A;
see Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94 [evidentiary facts found
in recitals of exhibits attached to a complaint or superseded complaint can be
considered on demurrer].) Exhibit B shows a letter dated October 6, 2020, where
Plaintiff writes that it accepts Defendant’s demand to resolve the claim for
the policy limits and enclosed declarations of its insureds stating they
carried no other insurance and were not in the course and scope of employment. Plaintiff
also enclosed a proposed release. (Complaint, Exh. B.) Contrary to Defendant’s
argument in reply, exhibits C and D in the complaint do not establish as a
matter of law that there was no contract formation.  
 
Therefore,
it is not apparent on the face of the pleading that acceptance was deficient. Defendant
also argues that there are no facts that she signed a written settlement
agreement or release form. However, she cites no authority supporting her
argument. (Demurrer, 4.) 
 
Lastly,
Defendant argues that the two-year statute of limitations under Code of Civil
Procedure section 339 applies.  
 
The
statute of limitations for a breach of contract action is four years if based
on a written instrument and two years if not based on a written instrument.
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 337(a), 339.)  “According to the Supreme Court, ‘[t]he
contract may be “in writing” for purposes of the statute of limitations even
though it was accepted orally or by an act other than signing. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]
‘When a party has agreed to the writing, there is no reason to invoke the
two-year statute of limitations applicable to oral agreements. The four-year
statute of limitations, unlike the statute of frauds, does not require that the
writing be signed by the party to be charged.’” (Pietrobon v. Libarle
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 992, 997.) 
 
Here,
based on the complaint and its attachments, the purported settlement agreement
is contained within the offer and acceptance letters. Therefore, it is based on
a “written instrument” and subject to the four-year statute of limitations. Because
it is alleged that contract was formed on October 6, 2020, the statue of
limitations expires on October 6, 2024. Because the complaint was filed on
January 2, 2024, it is timely. 
 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED.

 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
