And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a lawsuit filed by Nicole Rio against Myth Division, LLC, and Ramon Govea. The defendants demurred to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that she had failed to state a claim for each of the seven causes of action. The court disagrees with the defendants' arguments for the first, second, and third causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, demand for accounting, and unfair business practices. However, the court sustains the demurrer for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action, allowing the defendants 15 days to amend their complaint. The court also denies the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages.
