English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against John Gonzales, based on the terms of the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment (SEJ) between the parties. The SEJ required Gonzales to make consecutive monthly payments of $1,295.30 from December 2021 to November 2026. However, Gonzales failed to make the payments, and the plaintiffs sent repeated Notices of Default. The judge found that the relief sought should be granted and ordered a total judgment amount of $42,796.82, including 10% interest on the default amount.
