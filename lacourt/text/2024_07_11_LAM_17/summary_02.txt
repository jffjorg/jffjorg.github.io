And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' arguments and has determined that Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant to produce a Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) on nine topics of examination is denied. The Court has also determined that Defendant must comply with Document Request No. 1 by producing the Appraisals of Promotability for 2020-2023 for those Battalion Chiefs who had never had a 40-hour position before promoting to Battalion Chief.

The Court has found that Plaintiff failed to engage in a good faith attempt to meet and confer regarding Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's notice and Amended Notice of the PMK deposition. The Court has also found that Defendant need not produce a PMK because the document requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome.

The Court has limited the scope of the document request to only include the Appraisals of Promotability for 2020-2023 for those Battalion Chiefs who had never had a 40-hour position before promoting to Battalion Chief. The Court has also ordered that the Appraisals of Promotability be redacted to preserve the confidentiality of the applicants.

If all parties to the motion submit, the Court will adopt this tentative as the final order. If no parties submit, the motion may be placed off calendar.
