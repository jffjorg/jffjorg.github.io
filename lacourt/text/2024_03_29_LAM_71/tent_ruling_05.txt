1.    
Motion
to Compel Deposition- Bermero
          Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a declaration stating
facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P.
§§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Petitioner’s
counsel declares that on November 10, 2023, she served a notice of deposition
on Bermero’s counsel setting his deposition for December 20, 2023.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶2, Exh. A.)  Petitioner’s counsel declares that she
received no return phone call or email and received no objection to the
deposition.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶5.)  Petitioner’s counsel declares that on December
20, 2023, she moved forward with Bermero’s deposition and waited for Bermero
from 10:00 am to 10:30 am, but neither Bermero nor his counsel arrived for the
deposition and the court reporter prepared an Affidavit of Nonappearance.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶6, Exh. D.)  Petitioner’s counsel declares on January 5,
2024, she sent a meet and confer correspondence to Bermero’s counsel via email
seeking his availability for a deposition by January 12, 2024, and did not
receive a response, necessitating the filing of the instant motion.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶7, Exh. E.)   Petitioner’s
counsel’s declaration does not indicate if she attempted to meet and confer
with Bermero’s counsel by telephone.  Petitioner’s
counsel’s declaration does not substantially comply with the requirements of
C.C.P. §2016.040.  Regardless, the Court
in its discretion will consider Petitioner’s motion.
 
Background
On November 10, 2023, Petitioner’s counsel served a
notice of deposition on Bermero’s counsel setting his deposition for December
20, 2023.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶2.)  On December 6, 2023, Petitioner’s counsel’s
office reached out to Respondent’s counsel via e-mail to confirm the deposition
but did not receive a response.  (Decl. of
Kahen ¶3.)  On December 18, 2023,
Petitioner’s counsel’s office sent another email to confirm the deposition and
was again met with no response. (Decl. of Kahen ¶4.)  Petitioner’s Counsel received no return phone
call or email and received no objection to the deposition.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶5.)
On December 20, 2023, Petitioner’s counsel moved
forward with Bermero’s deposition and waited for Bermero to appear from 10:00
am to 10:30 am, but neither Respondent nor his counsel arrived for the
deposition.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶6). As
such, Petitioner asked the court reporter for an Affidavit of Nonappearance.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶6).  On January 5, 2024, Petitioner’s Counsel sent
a meet and confer correspondence to Bermero’s counsel via email seeking Bermero’s
availability for his deposition by January 12, 2024. Petitioner’s counsel did
not receive a response necessitating the filing of the instant motion. (Decl. of
Kahen ¶7). 
Petitioner filed the instant motion on March 5,
2024.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part, “[t]he
service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require any
deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to testify, as well
as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent part, as
follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, . . . described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document, . . .  described in the
deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document . . . described in the deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents . . . described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          The
Court grants Petitioner’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Bermero
to appear
for deposition within fifteen (15) days of this Court’s ruling.
          Accordingly,
Petitioner’s motion is granted.
 
Sanctions
Petitioner’s request for sanctions against Bermero
is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450(g). 
Petitioner requests sanctions in the amount of $600.00.  However, Petitioner’s request for sanctions
includes two anticipated hours to review and opposition and draft a reply,
which included attorneys’ fees for hours that are not reasonably incurred.  Therefore, the Court calculates sanctions as
follows:
($180.00/hour x 1 hour) + $60.00 filing fee = $240.00
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Bermero is
granted in the reduced amount of $240.00.
 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s motion to compel Bermero to appear for
deposition is granted.  Bermero is to
appear for deposition with 15 days of this ruling.
Petitioner’s request for sanctions
against Bermero is granted in the reduced amount of $240.00, payable within 15
days.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.

for Gonzalez from 10:00 am to 10:30 am, but neither Gonzalez nor his counsel
arrived for the deposition and the court reporter prepared an Affidavit of
Nonappearance.  (Decl. of Kahen ¶6, Exh.
D.)  Petitioner’s counsel declares on

(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice

of $600.00.  However, Petitioner’s

fee = $240.00
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Gonzalez is granted in the reduced amount of $240.00.
