 Case No.: 23STCV28540
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 29, 2024



 
Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center’s demurrer to Plaintiffs Mildred O. Watson by
and through her successor-in-interest Lisa Watson’s and Lisa Watson’s complaint
is overruled.
Defendant
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s motion to strike is denied.
 
          Defendant
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Cedars”) (“Moving
Defendant”) demurs to the 1st cause of action in Plaintiffs Mildred O. Watson
by and through her successor-in-interest Lisa Watson’s (“Mildred”) and Lisa
Watson’s (“Lisa”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) complaint (“Complaint”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e),
(f); Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 148, 165; Carter
v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 407.)  Moving Defendant also moves to strike
portions of Plaintiffs’ Complaint. 
(Notice of MTS, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer, the moving party must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the
need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41.) 
Moving Defendant’s
counsel filed a declaration stating met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel
via telephone on December 12, 2023, and again on January 18 and 16, 2024, and
the parties were unable to reach an agreement regarding the issues raised in
the instant demurrer.  (See Decl.
of Pruett ¶¶5-6.)  Moving Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration is proper under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Therefore, the Court will consider Moving Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiffs
filed the operative Complaint on November 21, 2023, against Moving Defendant
and Non-moving Defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC (“BHRC”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) alleging four causes of action: (1) elder abuse; (2) negligence;
(3) violation of residents rights; and (4) wrongful death.  Plaintiffs’ causes of action stem from Mildred’s
death on March 28, 2023.  (See Complaint
¶1.)
          Moving Defendant
filed the instant demurrer on March 1, 2024. 
Plaintiffs filed their opposition on March 18, 2024.  Moving Defendant filed its reply on March 22,
2024.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of
Demurrer
Moving Defendant
demurs on the basis that Plaintiffs’ 1st cause of action for elder abuse
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Moving
Defendant as the facts alleged pertain to the provision of medical services by
a hospital not services by a custodial caretaker.  (C.C.P. §430.10(e); Winn, 63 Cal.4th at
pg. 165; Demurrer, pg. 6; C.C.P. §430.10(e).) 
Moving Defendant also demurs on the basis the 1st cause of action is uncertain
and not stated with sufficient particularity against it because “the facts
constituting the neglect and establishing the causal link between the neglect
and the injury ‘must be pleaded with particularity,’ in accordance with the
pleading rules governing statutory claims.” 
(C.C.P. §430.10(f); Carter, 198 Cal.App.4th at pg. 407; Demurrer,
pg. 6.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Elder Abuse (1st
COA)
A cause of action for elder abuse that alleges physical abuse must
allege the following elements: (1) defendant physically abused plaintiff; (2)
plaintiff was 65 years of age or older or a dependent adult at the time of the
conduct; (3) plaintiff was harmed; and (4) defendant’s conduct was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff’s harm. 
(CACI 3106.)
A cause of action for elder abuse that alleges neglect must allege the
following elements: (1) defendant had a substantial caretaking or custodial
relationship with plaintiff involving ongoing responsibility for her basic
needs, which an able-bodied and fully competent adult would ordinarily be
capable of managing without assistance; (2) plaintiff was 65 years of age or
older or a dependent adult while she was in defendant’s care or custody; (3)
defendant failed to use the degree of care that a reasonable person in the same
situation would have used in providing for plaintiff’s basic needs, including
providing medical care for physical and mental health needs; (4) plaintiff was
harmed; and (5) defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing
plaintiff’s harm.  (CACI 3103.)
Plaintiffs allege at all relevant times, Mildred was over the age of 65
years and resided in this state and had physical or mental limitations that
restricted her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect her rights,
including, but not limited to, physical or developmental disabilities, and who
was admitted as an inpatient to a 24-hour health facility pursuant to 1250.3 of
the Health and Safety Code, and thus, was a “elder adult” as that term is
defined in the Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.23.  (Complaint ¶15.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendants were to provide
“care or services” to dependent adults and the elderly, including Mildred and
were to be “care custodians” of Mildred and in a trust and fiduciary
relationship with Mildred.  (Complaint
¶16.)  
Plaintiffs allege Defendants “neglected” Mildred as that term is
defined in Welfare and Institutions Code §15610.57 in that the Defendants
themselves, as well as their employees, failed to exercise the degree of care
that reasonable persons in a like position would exercise by denying or
withholding goods or services necessary to meet the basic needs of Mildred as
is more fully alleged.  (Complaint
¶17.)  Plaintiffs allege as a result of
the Defendants’ wrongdoing, Mildred suffered physical harm, pain and mental
suffering.  (Complaint ¶18.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendants had advance
knowledge of the unfitness of their employees and employed them with a
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, “authorized or ratified
the wrongful conduct,” and the Defendants’ conduct was “on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.” (Complaint ¶18; Civ.
Code §3294(b).)
Plaintiffs allege while under the care and treatment of Defendants, Mildred
developed multiple pressure injuries, sepsis, UTI and other injuries which
caused her to endure extreme pain and suffering and an untimely demise.  (Complaint ¶19.)  Plaintiffs allege on or about April 25, 2022,
Mildred was admitted to RCBH with clear skin.  (Complaint ¶20.)  Plaintiffs allege Mildred was transferred to
Cedars on or about May 15, 2022, for high sodium and BUN level.  (Complaint ¶20.)  
Plaintiffs allege on or about December 21, 2022, Mildred was readmitted
to BHRC with a Stage 2 sacral pressure injury, right mid foot with arterial
ulcer and right medial heel arterial ulcer all in violation of 42 CFR 483.25
(c) and 22 California Code of Regulations 72315(f).  (Complaint ¶21.)  Plaintiffs allege on or about December 21,
2022, records indicate that Mildred’s sacrococcyx pressure injury was Stage 2,
measuring 1.5 x 2 with skin loss. 
(Complaint ¶22.)  Plaintiffs
allege Mildred’s right lateral foot pressure injury was stage 3, measuring 1.5
x 2.2. (Complaint ¶22.)  Plaintiffs
allege Mildred’s right medial heel arterial ulcer was measured at 1.5 x 2.3
with black skin ulcer all in violation of 42 CFR 483.25 (c) and 22 California
Code of Regulations 72315(f).  (Complaint
¶22.)  
Plaintiffs allege Between January 8, 2023, through February 25, 2023, Mildred’s
wounds were treated by Beverly Hills Wound Care while she was a resident of
BHRC.  (Complaint ¶23.)  Plaintiffs allege on or about January 24,
2023, nursing notes indicate Mildred’s sacral pressure injury was Stage 4,
measuring 4.3 x .5 x 3.2.  (Complaint
¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege Mildred also
developed a new pressure injury on her right trochanter, measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.1. ulcer all in violation of 42 CFR 483.25 (c) and 22 California Code of
Regulations 72315(f).  (Complaint
¶24.)  
Plaintiffs allege Mildred was admitted to Cedars on February 25, 2023,
in acute distress.  (Complaint ¶25.)  Plaintiffs allege it was noted that on
admission Mildred was bacteremic from her sacral wound and had a UTI.  (Complaint ¶25.)  Plaintiffs allege on or about February 28,
2023, sharp excisional debridement of Mildred’s sacral pressure injury down to
and including bone with removal of devitalized necrotic tissue was performed.  (Complaint ¶26.)  Plaintiffs allege Mildred’s pressure injury
measured 8.4 x 9.5 x 1.5.  (Complaint

California Code of Regulations 72315(f). 
(Complaint ¶27.)  Plaintiffs
allege on or about March 14, 2023, sharp excisional debridement of Mildred’s

(Complaint ¶28.)

(Complaint ¶29.)  Plaintiffs
allege on or about March 28, 2023, sharp excisional debridement of Mildred’s

(Complaint ¶30.)

¶32.)  Plaintiffs allege the summary
states that Mildred “likely died of sepsis with the enterically infected sacral
decubitis ulcer as the likely source of the infections.  (Complaint ¶32.)
Plaintiffs allege Cedars neglected to provide medical care for Mildred’s
physical and mental health needs by failing to take all the necessary steps to
properly care for her emergent deep tissue pressure injuries.  (Complaint ¶33.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars failed to adequately
inform Mildred’s physician of the nature and extent of her pressure injuries
and failed to adequately and completely carry out doctor’s orders for their
treatment and failed to adequately and appropriately document Mildred’s plan of
care.  (Complaint ¶34.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars’ neglect of Mildred was
reckless, oppressive, and malicious.  (Complaint ¶35.)  Plaintiffs allege the individuals who cared
for Mildred knew that taking the necessary precautions to prevent her from
incurring avoidable pressure injuries, was critical to her health, well-being,
and prognosis.  (Complaint ¶35.)  Plaintiffs allege by failing to address Mildred’s
patient care issues, Cedars knew that it was highly probable that she would
suffer worsening pressure injuries and they knowingly disregarded that risk.  (Complaint ¶35.)  
Plaintiffs allege Mildred’s injuries would not have occurred had Cedars
simply adhered to applicable rules, laws, and regulations, as well as the
acceptable standards of practice governing the operation of a general acute
care hospital.  (Complaint ¶36.)  Plaintiffs allege that as a direct result of
the chronic understaffing at Cedars by its managing agents in both number and
training, and in deliberate violation of Title 22 §§ 70214 (staff training) and
702117 (staffing ratios), Cedars staff failed to provide Mildred with proper
care (repositioning and skin inspections) to prevent skin breakdown.  (Complaint ¶37.)  Plaintiffs allege Mildred suffered these
injuries because the Cedars staff simply did not have adequate time or the
knowledge base to provide her with the required care and to document and
address his emergent conditions. 
(Complaint ¶37.)  
Plaintiffs allege in addition to their direct liability for the abuse
and neglect of Mildred, Cedars ratified the mistreatment of Mildred.  (Complaint ¶38.)  Plaintiffs allege knowing of Mildred’s
pressure injuries, and knowing of her neglect, Cedars, through its managing
agents, failed to terminate, discipline, reprimand, or otherwise repudiate the
acts and omissions of any employee due to or based upon the care, treatment,
monitoring or supervision, or lack thereof, rendered to Mildred at Cedars.  (Complaint ¶38.)  
Plaintiffs allege at all relevant times hereto Cedars was aware of the
legally mandated minimum staffing ratios and requirements of general acute care
hospitals as set forth in Title 22 C.C.R. §70217.  (Complaint ¶39.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars was also aware that
where they failed to meet this regulatory requirement, injuries such as those
suffered by Mildred could, would, and did occur.  (Complaint ¶39.)  Plaintiffs allege notwithstanding this
knowledge and requirement of law, Cedars failed to comply with this regulatory requirement proximately causing
injury to Mildred.  (Complaint ¶39.)
Plaintiffs allege Cedars failed to report Mildred’s pressure injuries
to the California Department of Public Health pursuant to Health and Safety
Code §1279.1 in a transparent and intentional effort to fraudulently cover up
their malfeasance and reckless neglect of Mildred.  (Complaint ¶40.)  Plaintiffs allege that at all times relevant
hereto Cedars owed a duty to Mildred pursuant to Title 22 C.C.R. §70211 and
promised to provide nursing service that was organized, staffed, equipped, and
supplied to meet the needs of Mildred.  (Complaint ¶41.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars did not comply with
this requirement of law in their care of Mildred thereby causing injury to her.  (Complaint ¶41.)  
Plaintiffs allege Cedars owed a duty to Mildred to protect her right to
be free from all forms of abuse pursuant to 42 C.F.R. §482.13(c)(3).  (Complaint ¶42.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars did not comply with
this requirement of law in their care of Mildred thereby causing injury to her.  (Complaint ¶42.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars owed a duty to
Mildred to provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest
practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each patient in
accordance with a written plan of care pursuant to 22 C.C.R. §70709.  (Complaint ¶43.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars did not comply with
this requirement of law in their care of Mildred thereby causing injury to her.  (Complaint ¶43.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars owed a duty to Mildred
pursuant to 42 C.F.R. §482.28(b)(2) in that nutritional needs must be met in
accordance with recognized dietary practices and in accordance with orders of
the practitioner or practitioners responsible for the care of the patients.
CEDARS did not comply with this requirement of law in their care of Mildred, thereby
causing injury to her.  (Complaint
¶44.)  
Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a cause of action for elder abuse.  Plaintiffs allege Mildred is an elder.  (Complaint ¶15.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars assumed the care or
custody of Mildred.  (Complaint
¶16.)  Plaintiffs allege that one or more
of Cedars’ employees failed to use the degree of care that a reasonable person
in the same situation would have used by failing to protect Mildred from health
and safety hazards and failing to provide medical care for her physical and
mental health needs.  (Complaint
¶17.)  Plaintiffs allege Cedars’ employees’
conduct was a substantial factor in causing Mildred’s harm.  (Complaint ¶¶19-44.)  Plaintiffs allege that an officer, director,
or managing agent of Cedars ratified or authorized the employees’ conduct.  (Complaint ¶¶7, 18, 19-44.)  Plaintiffs allege that Cedars’ employees
acted with recklessness, malice, oppression, or fraud.  (Complaint ¶¶19-44.)  Further, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege their
first cause of action with the requisite particularity. 
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 1st cause of
action is overruled.
 
Uncertainty
A demurrer for uncertainty
will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond—i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must
be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or
her.¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)¿ 
If the complaint contains
enough facts to apprise defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet,
failure to label each cause of action is not ground for demurrer: “Although
inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the lack of labels . . . does not substantially
impair [defendant’s] ability to understand the complaint.” (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)¿ 
Where a demurrer is made upon
this ground, it must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears (by reference to page and line
numbers of the complaint).¿ (See Fenton v. Groveland Community Services
District (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)¿ 
Plaintiffs’ pleading is not
so bad that Moving Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against them.¿ (Khoury,
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s
demurrer on the basis of uncertainty is overruled.¿
 
          Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is overruled.

B.    Motion to Strike
Summary of Motion
Moving Defendant
moves to strike the following portions from the Complaint as improper, false,
and irrelevant language, and language not drawn in conformity with the laws of the
State of California: (1) ¶¶14-64 in its entirety as to Cedars; (2) Prayer ¶3;
(3) Prayer ¶4; and (4) Prayer ¶6.  (Notice
MTS, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading,” or any pleading or part thereof “not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.”  (C.C.P. §436.)
 
Punitive Damages
Punitive damages may be recovered upon a
proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression.  (Civ. Code §3294(a).)  “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to
cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.  (Turman
v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53,
63.)  “Oppression” means despicable
conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious
disregard of the person’s rights.  (Id.)  “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known by defendant, with intent to
deprive a person of property, rights or otherwise cause injury.  (Id.)
 Conclusory allegations, devoid of any
factual assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted
with oppression, fraud or malice.  (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)
Plaintiff sufficiently alleges a cause of
action for elder abuse, as stated in the demurrer.  Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s motion to
strike Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages is denied.
 
Attorneys’ Fees
An award of attorney’s fees is proper when
authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (C.C.P. §§1032(b), 1033.5(a)(10).)
Plaintiffs have sufficently pled sufficient
facts to support a cause of action for Elder Abuse and are therefore entitled
to attorney’s fees and costs as provided for under the Elder Abuse Act pursuant
to Welfare and Institutions Code §15657(a). 
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s motion to
strike Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees is denied.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendants’
motion to strike is
denied.
Moving Party to
give notice.
