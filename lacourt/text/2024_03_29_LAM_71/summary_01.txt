And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The motion was filed in pro per, meaning without an attorney. The court rules that Cross-Defendant does not have standing to amend the complaint because he is not a plaintiff in the original complaint. Instead, he is a party to a cross-complaint, in which entry of default was entered against him in March 2023. The court relies on two California cases, Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. and W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial District, to support its decision. The court's jurisdiction to consider motions is limited after an entry of default, and Cross-Defendant's motion does not fall within this limited scope.
