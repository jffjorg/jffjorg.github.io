The motion is unopposed
as of March 27, 2024. 
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
 
This
is about a fight that occurred among students at Downey High School. Defendants
Downey Unified School District, Jack Williams, Thomas Nunley, and James Bashman
move for leave to file a cross-complaint against Nick Kelly, Jallen Grey, and
ROES 1 through 10. Jack Williams, Thomas Nunley, and James Bashman are football
coaches at Downey High School. Nick Kelly and Jallen Grey are the students purportedly
involved in the fight. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A defendant can cross-complain against a
codefendant or third person not yet a party to the action only if the cause of
action asserted “(1) arises out of the same transaction,
occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences [set forth in
the complaint] … or (2) asserts a claim, right, or interest in the property or controversy which is the subject of the cause [of action]
brought against him.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10, subd. (b).) Leave may be
granted in the interest of justice at any time during the action. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 428.50.) 
 
Leave
to File Cross-Complaint
 
Here,
Defendants assert equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief in the proposed cross-complaint arising out of the
underlying action. (Decl. Hylton, ¶ 2.) 
 
Because
the causes of action asserted arise out of the same occurrence as the original
action, the Court grants leave to file the cross-complaint. 
 
The
motion is GRANTED.
