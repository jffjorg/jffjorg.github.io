TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Joe’s Sweeping Inc. dba Nationwide
Environmental Service’s Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED. No sanctions. 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of March 27, 2024. 
 
This is about a motor
vehicle accident that occurred on April 20, 2022 in Norwalk, California. Defendant
Joe’s Sweeping Inc. dba Nationwide Environmental Services moves to compel
compliance with a deposition subpoena of business records served on non-party Shin
Imaging Center. Defendant also seeks sanctions. 
 
Legal
Standard

A
deposition subpoena for business records directs a nonparty's “custodian of
records” to deliver a copy of the requested documents to a “deposition officer”
or to make the original documents available to the subpoenaing party for
inspection and copying. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2020.410, subd. (c); 2020.430,
subd. (a)-(e).) 
If
a deponent does not produce a requested document under his or her control, the
subpoenaing party may bring a motion to compel production “no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (b); Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 123, 127.) 
Meet
and Confer
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.480, subd. (b).) Defendant complied with the meet and confer
requirements. (Decl. Ruiz, ¶ 9.)
Timeliness
The
deposition record is “complete” as of the “date specified for production.” (Board
of Registered Nursing v. Super. Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59
Cal.App.5th 1011, 1032-1033.)
Defendant issued a deposition
subpoena for business records to Shin Imaging Center on May 16, 2023 and again
on October 16, 2023. (Decl. Ruiz, ¶¶ 5, 8.) Defendant filed the instant motion
on December 19, 2023. The Court infers that the date specified for production in
the October 16, 2023 deposition subpoena is later than October 19, 2023. 
 
Thus, Defendant is
timely. 
 
Compel Compliance
 
“‘An order compelling discovery must rest on a showing that
the discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible
evidence….’"  (Cadiz Land Co. v.
Rail Cycle (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 117.) The burden rests upon the party
seeking the discovery to provide evidence from which the court may determine
these conditions are met. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Super. Ct.
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-224.) 
 
Defendant advances the declaration of its counsel, Jennifer
A. Ruiz. She states, “Plaintiff alleges significant injuries and claims damages
as a result of the incident. Defendant received plaintiff’s responses to form
interrogatories and production of documents on April 4, 2023. Plaintiff
identified Shin Imaging as a facility where she underwent an MRI of her
cervical spine following the subject accident. In order to fairly and
accurately evaluate Plaintiff’s claim, Defendant caused Notice of Deposition
Subpoena of Business Records (hereinafter “Subpoenas”) to be served upon Shin
Imaging Center and its custodian of records.” (Decl. Ruiz, ¶¶ 2 to 5.) 
 
Because the information will help Defendant evaluate
Plaintiff’s claim, the Court finds that Defendant has provided evidence to show
that the requested discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible
evidence. 
 
Sanctions
 
The court may award
“monetary and contempt sanctions” against nonparties and their attorneys “who
flout the discovery process by suppressing or destroying evidence.” (Temple Cmty. Hosp. v. Super. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 466, 476-77.) The
Code provides a catch-all provision that gives the Court wide powers to
sanction “anyone” who misuses the discovery process. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)
 
In its discretion, the Court does not award monetary
sanctions. 
 
Based on the above, the motion to compel compliance is
GRANTED. No sanctions are awarded.
