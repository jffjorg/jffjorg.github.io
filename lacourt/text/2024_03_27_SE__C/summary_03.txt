And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of the plaintiffs, Luis Acevedo Rojas and Aquetzali Acevedo Sanchez, to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents and special interrogatories served on defendant FCA US LLC. The motion is unopposed and the judge finds that the defendant has not served verified responses to the requests, which is a requirement under the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have shown good cause for compelling further responses, citing specific facts and evidence that the requested information is relevant to the case.

The judge orders the defendant to serve verified discovery responses within 30 days. The judge also finds that the defendant has not acted with substantial justification in failing to serve verified responses and therefore does not award sanctions. The judge notes that the parties have met and conferred and that the motion is supported by evidence showing that the discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Song-Beverly Act, which govern the handling of consumer reports under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge's decision is intended to ensure that the parties are able to obtain the discovery they need to prove their case and to prevent the defendant from withholding information that is relevant to the case.
