v. Huerta, et al., Case No. 22NWCV01185
 
This
is a defamation case. Plaintiff seeks ex parte relief to extend the time to
file his opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion. 
 
Parties
appearing at the ex parte hearing must serve the ex parte application on all
other appearing parties at the first reasonable opportunity. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1206.) Absent exceptional circumstances, no hearing may be
conducted unless such service has been made. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1206.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff has not filed proof of service of the ex parte application upon the
opposing party. 
 
Thus,
the ex parte application is DENIED.  
 
Clerk
