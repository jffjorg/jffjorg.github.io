The judge has granted the motion filed by the defendant Downey Unified School District, Jack Williams, Thomas Nunley, and James Bashman to file a cross-complaint against Nick Kelly, Jallen Grey, and others. The cross-complaint seeks equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 428.10 and 428.50, which allow a defendant to file a cross-complaint if the cause of action arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original action. In this case, the fight among students at Downey High School is the same occurrence that is the subject of the original action. The judge has given notice to the moving party to proceed with the filing of the cross-complaint.
