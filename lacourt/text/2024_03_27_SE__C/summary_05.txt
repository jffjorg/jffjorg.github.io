And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for business records served on non-party Shin Imaging Center, without awarding sanctions. The motion is unopposed as of the hearing date, March 27, 2024. The subpoena was served on May 16, 2023, and again on October 16, 2023, and the motion was filed on December 19, 2023.

The court finds that the defendant has provided evidence to show that the requested discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence, as the business records will help the defendant evaluate the plaintiff's claim. The court infers that the date specified for production in the October 2023 deposition subpoena is later than October 19, 2023, and therefore the defendant is timely.

The court does not award monetary sanctions, as the defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirements and has provided evidence to support its motion. The motion to compel compliance is granted.
