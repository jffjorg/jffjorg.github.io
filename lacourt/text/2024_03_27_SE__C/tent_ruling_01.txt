  Case Number:  19STCV19908    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  C DOMINGUEZ,
ET AL. v. ESTES TERMINALS OF CALIFORNIA, LLC, ET AL. 
CASE
NO.:  19STCV19908
HEARING: 
 3/27/24 @ 9:30 A.M. 
 
#6
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiffs Claudia
Dominguez, Angelica Dominguez, and Giselle Dominguez’s Motion to Compel Further
Deposition Testimony is CONTINUED. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
 
Background
 
While
working at a trucking terminal, Plaintiff Gilbert Dominguez was struck by a
tractor. Defendant Estes Terminals owned and operated the trucking terminal. Plaintiffs
move to compel further deposition testimony of the person most knowledgeable of
Estes Terminals. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 states that a meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. 
 
Counsel
for plaintiffs states that he met and conferred with opposing counsel during
the deposition. (Decl. Orland, ¶ 5.) However, he does not state more in his declaration.
In the reply brief, plaintiffs state that on the same day they served the
motion, counsel for plaintiffs sent an electronic mail correspondence as a
formal meet and confer. But this was not stated in the declaration. Further,
the Court does not understand why the plaintiffs purportedly met and conferred
on the day of the service of the motion rather than earlier. 
 
Based
on this, the Court CONTINUES the hearing to Wednesday, May 8, 2024 at 9:30 A.M.
in Dept. SE-C. The parties are to submit a joint statement within 20 days and
if discovery issues have not been resolved at the time of the hearing, the
Court will hear arguments at the hearing.
