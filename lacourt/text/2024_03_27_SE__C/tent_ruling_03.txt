TENTATIVE RULING
 
I.            
Plaintiff Luis Acevedo Rojas and Aquetzali Acevedo Sanchez’s motion to
compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED.  No sanctions. 
 
II.           
Plaintiff Luis Acevedo Rojas and Aquetzali Acevedo Sanchez’s motion to
compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.  No sanctions. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
The motion is unopposed as of March 27, 2024. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  
 
The
Court finds Plaintiffs adequately met and conferred. (Decl. Lopez, ¶¶ 5-6, Ex.
C.) 
                                 
Timeliness 
 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
On July 28, 2023, the defendant
served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s first set of requests for production
of documents. (Decl. Lopez, ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Responses consisted of both factual
responses and objections. (Decl. Lopez, ¶ 4, Ex. B.) The 45-day clock runs only
upon service of verified responses, and responses consisting of both factual
responses and objections must be verified. (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc.
v. Super. Ct. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136.) Defendant has not served
verifications. (Decl. Lopez, ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Thus, the clock has not run. 
 
Requests for Production of Documents 
 
Plaintiffs Luis Acevedo Rojas and Aquetzali
Acevedo Sanchez move to compel further responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One served
on defendant FCA US LLC.    
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further responses to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection is without merit or too
general.  
 
Good Cause
 
Plaintiffs
move to compel further responses to request numbers 45 and 46.
 
As
to motions to compel further document responses, moving parties must file
evidence showing good cause based on specific facts that the requested matter
is admissible evidence, or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of such evidence. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Super. Ct.
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-24.) "[E]ven when no . . . supporting
affidavits are filed . . .good cause may be found in the pleadings theretofore
filed in the action." (Greyhound Corp. 
v.  Super.  Ct.  (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 389.)
 
In their moving papers and separate
statement, Plaintiffs assert that request number 45 seeks complaints by owners
of the same subject vehicle type and request number 46 seeks documents
evidencing warranty repairs of the same subject vehicle type. Plaintiffs argue
that evidence regarding other similar vehicle complaints would tend to show
whether a widespread defect or nonconformity exists, when the defect first
arose, defendant’s knowledge of widespread problems, and defendant’s failure to
act despite this knowledge. This is relevant to proving whether a civil penalty
is warranted because it would tend to show the willfulness of defendant’s
conduct. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that information
about repairs may support whether a defect or nonconformity exists in the
subject vehicle type and when the defect or nonconformity first arose. And it
may refute affirmative defenses that plaintiffs misused or abused the vehicle
or engaged in unauthorized or unreasonable use. 
 
Based on the above, the Court finds
good cause. 
 
The
motion is granted. Defendant is ordered to serve verified discovery responses
within 30 days. 
 
Special
Interrogatories
 
Plaintiffs Luis Acevedo Rojas and Aquetzali
Acevedo Sanchez move to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One served
on defendant FCA US LLC.    
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a) allows a party to
file a motion compelling further responses to interrogatories if it finds that
the response is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection is without
merit or too general.  
 
Special Interrogatory numbers 19-23,
25, 29, 31, 43-44, and 45-48
 
Plaintiffs move to compel further
responses to interrogatory numbers 19 to 23, 25, 29, 31, 43 to 44, and 45 to
48. 
 
“‘An order compelling
discovery must rest on a showing that the discovery is reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence….’"  (Cadiz
Land Co. v. Rail Cycle (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 117.) The burden rests
upon the party seeking the discovery to provide evidence from which the court
may determine these conditions are met. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-224.) 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that interrogatory numbers 19 to 23, 25,
29, 31, and 43 to 44 seek information regarding defendant’s policies, procedures, and training
that defendant provides with respect to its handling of consumer reports under
the Song-Beverly Act. They seek this information to determine whether the
defendant willfully violated the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that interrogatory numbers 45 to 48 seek repair rates for the subject
vehicle. Plaintiffs argue that this information is relevant to proving that
their vehicle contained a defect and could refute defendant’s affirmative
defenses claiming that Plaintiffs and others misused or abused the vehicle or
engaged in unauthorized or unreasonable use of the vehicle. 
 
Based on the
above, the Court finds good cause. 
 
Sanctions
 
In a
motion to compel further discovery responses, the court shall impose a monetary sanction
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
 
Because the instant
motions are unopposed, the Court does not award sanctions.
