And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the ex parte application filed by Schweizer, the plaintiff, seeking to extend the time to file his opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion. The reason for the denial is that Schweizer has not filed proof of service of the ex parte application upon the opposing party, Huerta, as required by the California Rules of Court. The judge notes that absent exceptional circumstances, no hearing may be conducted unless such service has been made. As a result, the ex parte hearing is denied and the clerk is instructed to give notice of the ruling.
