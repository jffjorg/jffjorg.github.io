Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiffs Asuncion
Jimenez and Huntington Investments Corporation move to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Request
for Production of Documents (Set One) and Requests for Admissions (Set
One).   
 
Timeliness

 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the response or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
The 45-day rule to bring a motion to compel is
mandatory and jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders court without
authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
On August 8, 2023, Defendant electronically
served verified responses to Plaintiff’s first set of form interrogatories.
(Decl. Saeedian, ¶ 8, Ex. 2.) The 45-day deadline to file a motion to compel
further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One is September
22, 2023, extended by two court days for electronic service.
 
Plaintiffs filed the instant motions
on September 25, 2023. Thus, the motion is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such a reasonable and good faith
attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with
opposing counsel; rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the
matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v.
Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
The
Court finds Plaintiffs met and conferred in good faith, but Defendant did not. Defendant
did not respond to Plaintiffs’ meet and confer correspondence, including
Plaintiffs’ request to extend the time to file the instant motion for Defendant’s
counsel to review the letter and for the parties to resolve the issues. (Decl.
Saeedian, ¶ 9, Ex. 3.) Instead, Defendant argued that Plaintiffs demanded
verifications within three days and did not reasonably tailor the requests to
the specifics of this case. (Decl. Vasseghi, ¶ 7.) The Court does not know why
Defendant did not address this with Plaintiffs. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court continues the hearing to Wednesday, May 22, 2024 at
9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. The parties must submit a joint statement by May 13,
2024.  If discovery issues have not been
resolved, the Court will hear arguments at the hearing.
