Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is overruled as to the causes of action for disability discrimination, retaliation, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, failure to engage in good faith interactive process, failure to prevent/remedy discrimination, wrongful termination, and constructive discharge. The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages allegations and attorney fees allegations from the complaint. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded his claims and that the defendant's demurrer was improper. The judge has also applied the doctrine of equitable tolling to extend the statute of limitations for the wrongful termination and constructive discharge claims.
