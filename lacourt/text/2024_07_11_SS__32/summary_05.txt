And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Plaintiff Jin Kim Hong's Counsel, Benjamin G. Berkley Esq., to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff. The motion states that Counsel and Plaintiff have come to irreconcilable differences regarding the handling of the case. However, the Court has denied the motion because Counsel has not provided the correct address of the Court and department number, which does not provide proper notice of the hearing. Additionally, Counsel has not provided information for all future proceedings in this case. The Court finds that Counsel's withdrawal would work injustice upon the Plaintiff and therefore denies the motion.
