And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (Cross-Complainant) to be relieved from waiver of objections to requests for admissions and requests for production of documents. The motion was opposed by A.J. Molino & Associates, Inc. (Cross-Defendant). The judge has denied the motion, finding that the Cross-Complainant's failure to serve timely responses was not the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge notes that the Cross-Complainant experienced technical issues with the file, but the delay in providing responses undermines the argument that the technical issue was the cause of the delay. The judge also finds that the responses were not substantially compliant. The motion is denied.
