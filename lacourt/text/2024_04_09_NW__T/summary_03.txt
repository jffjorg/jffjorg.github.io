And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication. The judge found that there is a triable issue of fact as to the defendant's knowledge and acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud. The defendant had argued that it did not know about the scheme to defraud, but the plaintiff provided evidence that the defendant had knowledge of the scheme and participated in it. The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that there is a triable issue of fact as to the plaintiff's claims for conspiracy to defraud, violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and conspiracy to violate RICO.
