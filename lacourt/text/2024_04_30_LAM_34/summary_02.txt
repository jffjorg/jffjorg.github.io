Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint and motion to strike punitive damages. The demurrer challenges the second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court disagrees with the defendant's argument that the complaint does not state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that the plaintiffs' allegations of exposure to vermin infestation, plumbing defects, and other defects, and the defendant's alleged reckless disregard for tenants' well-being, satisfy the elements of a prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court also denies the motion to strike punitive damages, as the plaintiffs are entitled to plead their allegations and request relief.
