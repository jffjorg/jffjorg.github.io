Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining PVHMC's demurrer to the Plaintiff's first cause of action for dependent adult abuse and neglect. The court finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of neglect are not sufficient because the injury was allegedly caused by the use of a sequential compression device, rather than a failure to provide care. The court also grants PVHMC's motion to strike, seeking to strike attorney fees and punitive damages requested under the EADACPA. The court orders PVHMC to file its answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days.
