ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Right to Recovery
 
An award of
attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the Song-Beverly Act
authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds
that the instant motion is authorized by statute.
 
B.    
Attorney Fees Incurred
 
A buyer prevailing
under the Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as
determined by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) “The burden is on the
party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.” (Gonzalez
v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162,
169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar
method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,
Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs
seek to recover $15,957.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 40.5 hours of their
attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:

1.      Counsel’s
Hourly Rate
 
When
determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates
“are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded
[to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med.
Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs assert that “the attorneys’ fees sought in this matter for the fees
incurred by the mere five attorneys who worked on this matter are consistent
with numerous court findings that Plaintiffs’ counsels’ hourly rates are
reasonable.” (Pls.’ Mot. 2:26–28.) Plaintiffs support their argument with their
counsel’s sworn declaration attesting to various Los Angeles Superior Court
cases approving Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly billing rates. (Decl. of Kevin Y.
Jacobson ¶¶ 21–28.) The Court notes that Defendant has failed to oppose the
instant motion.
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that their
attorneys’ hourly billing rates are commensurate with their experience and fall
within the range of reasonable rates charged by attorneys and judicially
awarded in similar cases.
 
2.      Hours
Expended
 
Plaintiffs
seek to recover attorney fees for the 40.5 hours expended by their attorneys on
this matter, totaling $15,957.00. Plaintiffs proffer an itemized list of time
entries detailing their attorneys’ work on this matter. (Ex. A to Jacobson
Decl.) The Court again notes that the instant motion is unopposed, therefore
Defendant has failed to challenge any of the hours expended by Plaintiffs’
counsel.
 
C.   
Costs Incurred
 
Plaintiffs assert
that they incurred costs and expenses totaling $5,818.43, which encompasses:
(1) $505.85 in filing and motion fees; (2) $150.00 in jury fees; (3) $30.89 in
process server fees; (4) $66.69 in electronic filing/service fees; and (5) $65.00
in court appearance costs. (Ex. B to Jacobson Decl.) The Court again notes that
Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motion and challenge the purported
costs incurred by Plaintiffs in this action. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiffs are awarded $21,775.43 in attorney fees
and costs
