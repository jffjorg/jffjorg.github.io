TENTATIVE RULING


Plaintiff’s renewed
request for default judgment is denied.
 
The Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend the operative complaint to
specify the damages amount.
 
Plaintiff’s request
to reinstate terminating sanctions is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
VIP Tours of
California, Inc. (“VIP”) is a sightseeing tour company in Southern
California.  
 
Plaintiff used to
work for VIP as a bus driver.  
 
On March 6, 2014, Plaintiff sued VIP and Marco Khorasani, asserting
causes of action for violations of the Labor Code and Unfair Competition Law,
negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.
 
On November 27, 2018, Judge Elihu Berle granted terminating sanctions
against VIP and entered default.  
 
On February 4, 5, and 6, 2019, Judge Berle held a bench trial regarding
Plaintiff’s fraud cause of action against Khorasani.  
 
On July 30, 2019, Judge Berle issued a final statement of decision,
finding Khorasani liable for fraud.  
 
On August 16, 2019, Judge Berle entered judgment against Khorasani as to
the fraud cause of action.  
 
On December 19, 2019, Plaintiff filed a request for default judgment
against VIP, yet Judge Berle entered default judgment against VIP and Khorasani.

 
On June 5, 2023, this Court vacated the default judgment and denied
Plaintiff’s motion to amend the default judgment to add Khorasani as a judgment
debtor.
 
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a renewed request for default judgment
against VIP and a renewed motion to amend the default judgment against
Khorasani.
 
On September 14, 2023, the Court heard oral arguments, ordered Plaintiff
to file a supplemental brief concerning the renewed request for default
judgment, and found the renewed motion to amend the default judgment to be
premature.
 
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed his supplemental brief.
 
Now, the Court considers whether the supplemental brief supports granting
or denying the renewed request for default judgment.
 
DISCUSSION
 
In his renewed request for
default judgment, Plaintiff asks the Court to award more than $500,000 in
damages against VIP.
 
The reason the Court ordered
supplemental briefing is because Plaintiff failed to include the operative
complaint in the renewed default-judgment package.  The Court could not see whether the complaint
specifies the damages amount that Plaintiff seeks (it is not scanned on
eCourt).
 
Plaintiff has attached the
complaint to his supplemental brief.  It
does not allege a specific damages amount. 
(See Supp. Brief, Ex. 1, pp. 17-18.)
 
Nevertheless, Plaintiff contends
the Court should enter default judgment and should award the requested damages
amount because VIP has had notice of the amount for over three years given that
Judge Berle specified the amount in the default judgment entered on December
19, 2019.  Plaintiff claims this
purported notice satisfies VIP’s right to due process.  (See Supp. Brief, pp. 5-6.)
 
The Court disagrees.  Generally, “when recovering damages by a
default judgment, [the] plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint.”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 5:241.5,
emphasis in original.)    “Relief not
demanded in the complaint cannot be granted by default judgment even though
that relief otherwise would have been proper.” 
(Id. at ¶ 5:233 [citing Code of Civil Procedure section 580].)  Plaintiff fails to cite authority recognizing
an exception to these rules under the facts presented here.
 
Indeed, the December 2019 default
judgment appears to have been based on an error.  Plaintiff’s counsel utilized Judicial Council
form CIV-100 to request default judgment. 
In paragraph 2.a. of form CIV-100, counsel represents that the damages
amount demanded in the operative complaint is $524,534.40 (see 12/19/19 Request
for Court Judgment, ¶ 2.a.), which is the exact amount that Judge Berle
ended up awarding.  (See 12/19/19
Default Judgment, ¶ 6.a.(1) [utilizing Judicial Council form JUD-100].)  To repeat, the complaint fails to specify a
damages amount.  It does not contain a
request for $524,534.40.  Bottom line,
counsel’s representation to Judge Berle was incorrect.
 
The remedy available to Plaintiff
is to amend the complaint to demand a specific damages amount.  But, as the Court warned at the last hearing,
“[s]uch an amendment [would] vacate[] the underlying default and
put[] the entire matter back at issue[.]” 
(Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 5:257, emphasis in original.)
 
Plaintiff requests leave to
amend.  (See Supp. Brief, pp. 8-9.)  Also, though, he asks the Court to reinstate
terminating sanctions following the amendment, effectively saying the matter
should not be put back at issue. 
(See id. at pp. 9-10.)
 
The Court grants Plaintiff leave
to amend.
 
The second part of Plaintiff’s
request is denied.  Plaintiff’s cited
case – Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495 –
does not help him.  There, the Court of
Appeal set aside a default judgment because the plaintiff failed to either
demand a damages amount in the complaint or serve the defendant with a
statement of damages.  The justices held
that the plaintiff needed to amend the complaint and to serve the
defendant.  Relevantly, terminating
sanctions had been entered against the defendant earlier in the
litigation.  The Court of Appeal hinted
that, after service of the amended complaint, the defendant “should be allowed
to litigate the case” instead of reimposing the terminating sanctions:
 
Assuming Gilbert timely
files an answer to Van Sickle’s amended complaint, the question arises as to
whether Gilbert must be allowed to litigate the action thereafter without any
consequences for the conduct that led the trial court to impose the terminating
sanction on him in the first place. That question is not before us in this
appeal. It is a question to be answered by the trial court in the first
instance, in the proper exercise of its broad discretion of discovery matters. However, we note that in Greenup v.
Rodman [(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822,] 830, 231 Cal.Rptr. 220, 726 P.2d
1295, the California Supreme Court, faced with similar facts, suggested
that a defendant in Gilbert’s position should be allowed to litigate the case
and only if the defendant “thereafter continue[d] to disobey discovery orders”
would the imposition of “a second default judgment as a sanction” be
appropriate. Of course, even if
reimposition of the terminating sanction is not appropriate, the trial court
could substitute some lesser sanction in place of the terminating sanction.
 
(Van Sickle, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th
at 1530, emphasis and underlined case name added.)  In light of Van Sickle, the Court declines to reinstate terminating
sanctions against VIP.
