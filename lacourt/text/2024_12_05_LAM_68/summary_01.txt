And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's (Jeff Goldstein) request for an order to sell the interest of the defendant (Nishant Ramachandran) in two dwellings to satisfy a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The dwellings, located at 2104 and 2106 Plant Avenue in Redondo Beach, California, were acquired jointly during the marriage of the defendant and his former wife, Katy Ramachandran (Third-Party Claimant).

The judge found that the dwellings are presumed to be community property, but that a valid transmutation agreement was executed in 2016 to transfer ownership of 2106 Plant from community property to separate property of the Third-Party Claimant. The judge also found that the Dissolution Judgment entered in 2023 rendered both dwellings separate property of the Third-Party Claimant.

The judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that the Third-Party Claimant's attempts to convert the dwellings to separate property after the debt was acknowledged in 2015 and again in 2023 were voidable as fraudulent transfers under California Civil Code Section 3439.05. The judge also found that the Dissolution Judgment from a family court is not a fraudulent transfer.

Therefore, the Court denied the plaintiff's request for an order to sell the dwellings to satisfy the judgment, and instead held that the dwellings are the separate property of the Third-Party Claimant.
