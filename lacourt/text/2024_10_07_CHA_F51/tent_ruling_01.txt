  Case Number:  24CHCV02866    Hearing Date:   October 7, 2024    Dept:  F51  OCTOBER 4,  2024    MOTION FOR SUMMARY  JUDGMENT  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 24CHCV02866    Motion Filed: 9/18/24                                                                             Non-Jury Trial: 10/21/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff RIF II – Bledsoe Avenue, LLC  (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Mole-Richardson Co., LLC  (“Defendant”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication  in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted.   BACKGROUND    This is a  commercial unlawful detainer action in which Plaintiff alleges that on 6/30/21,  it entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant, whereby Defendant  agreed to pay Plaintiff $6,466.91 in monthly rent until 6/30/25, for the leased  premises located at 15148 Bledsoe Street, Unit A, Sylmar, CA 91342. (Compl. ¶¶  3a, 6.) On 6/14/24, Plaintiff served Defendant with a 3-day notice to pay rent  or quit, at which time Defendant allegedly owed Plaintiff $79,044.29 in unpaid  rent. (Id. at ¶¶ 9a, 12.)   On 8/8/24,  Plaintiff filed its complaint. On 9/6/24, Defendant filed its answer. On  9/11/24, default was entered against all unknown occupants.    On 9/18/24,  Plaintiff filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On 9/30/24, Defendant  filed its opposition. No reply has been filed to date.    ANALYSIS   The function of a motion for  summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an  opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to  enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v.  Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure  section 437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary  judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably  deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or  evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.  Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of  the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the  issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether  there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the  pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65,  citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,  381–382.)    As to each claim as framed  by the complaint, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment has met its “burden  of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has  proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on  the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the  plaintiff has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant “to show that  a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action  or a defense thereto.” (Id.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in  support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning  the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)  39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)    A.     Unlawful  Detainer   Plaintiff’s sole cause of  action against Defendant alleges Unlawful Detainer. “The basic elements  of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent … are (1) the tenant is in  possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the  tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly  served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the  three-day notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th  Supp. 10, 16.)   Here, Plaintiff proffers the sworn declaration of its  property manager, stating that Defendant is in possession of the premises, at  the exclusion and without the permission of Plaintiff; Defendant is delinquent  in the payment of rent for the premises in the amount of $79,044.29; Defendant  was served with a written three-day notice to pay rent or quit on 6/10/24, yet  remains in default. (Decl. of Bridgette Chavez ¶¶ 1–8.)   Defendant argues in opposition that the Court must  disregard Ms. Chavez’s declaration because it “does not explain how Ms. Chavez  may be informed on the business between Plaintiff and Defendant.” (Def.’s Opp.  1:26–27.) The Court disagrees and finds sufficient that Ms. Chavez has stated  the following: “I am a property manager for RIF II - Bledsoe Avenue, LLC  (“Plaintiff”). The facts set forth in this Declaration are made of my own  personal knowledge, and if called on to do so, I could and would testify thereto.”  (Chavez Decl. ¶ 1.)   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff  has met its initial burden of persuasion to prove each of the elements for a  cause of action for unlawful detainer. The burden thus shifts to Defendant to  show a triable issue as to one or more material facts or a defense thereto  exists.    In opposition, Defendant  argues that: (1) the fair market rental value claimed in the instant motion  differs from that alleged in the complaint; (2) Plaintiff’s request for  holdover damages in the amount of “$1,370.41 per day since June 10, 2024” seeks  compensation already accounted for in the principal amount due; and (3)  Defendant has made three payments to Plaintiff on 7/8/24, 8/28/24, and 9/6/24.  (Def.’s Opp. 3:7–4:15.) The Court notes that none of these arguments raise a  triable issue of material fact, as they do not relate to any of the  essential elements of an unlawful detainer cause of action.   Based on the foregoing, the  Court finds that Defendant has failed to meet its responsive evidentiary burden  to show that a triable issue of material fact exists. Accordingly, the Court  grants Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.   CONCLUSION   The motion is granted. Judgment is ordered for Plaintiff.  Plaintiff to file proposed judgment within 10  days.     Monetary damages to be addressed at the hearing.
