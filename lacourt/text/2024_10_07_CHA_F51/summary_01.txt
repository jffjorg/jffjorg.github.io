And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in a commercial unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, RIF II – Bledsoe Avenue, LLC, alleges that the defendant, Mole-Richardson Co., LLC, is in possession of the premises without permission and is delinquent in the payment of rent. The plaintiff served the defendant with a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit, but the defendant failed to comply. The judge found that the plaintiff has met its burden of proving each element of the cause of action for unlawful detainer, and the defendant has failed to show that a triable issue of material fact exists. As a result, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and ordered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The judge also ordered the plaintiff to file a proposed judgment within 10 days and scheduled a hearing to address monetary damages.
