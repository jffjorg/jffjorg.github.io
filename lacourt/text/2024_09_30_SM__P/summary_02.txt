And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff originally sued the defendant for wrongful eviction, harassment, breach of lease contract, statutory violations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff now seeks to add two new causes of action based on a subsequent eviction notice that occurred after the original complaint was filed. The judge has decided to allow the amendment because the defendant has not shown that it would be prejudiced by the addition of these new claims. The judge has instructed the plaintiff to file the supplemental complaint as a first amended complaint.
