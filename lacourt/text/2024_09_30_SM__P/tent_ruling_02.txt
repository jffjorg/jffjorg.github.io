Wainer v. Ota, Case No. 24SMCV01939
Hearing Date September 30, 2024
Plaintiff
Wainer’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint
Plaintiff
Wainer sues defendant Ota for wrongful eviction, harassment, breach of lease
contract, statutory violations and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. Plaintiff seeks leave to amend to add allegations arising from a
subsequent eviction notice that occurred after the complaint was filed. 
Courts
exercise liberality in allowing amendments to pleadings absent prejudice to the
adverse party. Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761. A
motion for leave to amend should only be denied if the opposing party can show
meaningful prejudice as a result of granting the motion. Id.
Defendant
does oppose. Plaintiff seeks to add two causes of action and may do so via the
filing of a first amended complaint. Attached to the moving papers is a
“Supplemental Complaint.” Such must be filed as a first amended complaint. GRANTED.
