The Plaintiff is suing Defendants McKinnon and Cedars-Sinai for personal injury. The Plaintiff is asking the court to reverse the default orders of July 15, 2024, stay the case or dismiss it without prejudice, and assign counsel for the Plaintiff. However, the court has denied all of these requests. The court did not issue default orders against the Plaintiff on July 15, 2024, and the Plaintiff failed to state a legal basis for his request to stay or set aside the default order. Additionally, the court cannot provide counsel for the Plaintiff as it is a civil case and the court does not have the power or discretion to do so.
