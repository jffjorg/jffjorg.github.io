Tebbens v. McKinnon, Case no.
23SMCV02548
Hearing date September 30, 2024
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Reconsider, Reverse, and Set Aside Default Judgement
Plaintiff
Tebbens, in pro per, sues defendants McKinnon and Cedars-Sinai for personal
injury. Plaintiff filed his complaint on 6/09/2023. He now asks the court to “reverse
the default orders of July 15, 2024,” “stay this case or dismiss this case
without prejudice and preserve the issue of timeliness,” and “if within its
power, assign counsel for Plaintiff.” Mtn. to Reconsider paras. 19-21. 
Plaintiff
asks the court to “reverse the default orders of July 15, 2024.” Mtn. to
Reconsider para. 19. The court did not issue a default or defaults against
plaintiff on 7/15/2024 or on any other date. The court’s 7/15/2024 minute order
granted defendants’ motions to compel discovery. If plaintiff is petitioning to
have the order compelling discovery set aside, he fails to state a legal basis
for such a request.
Plaintiff
asks the court to “stay this case or dismiss this case without prejudice and
preserve the issue of timeliness.” Mtn. to Reconsider para. 20. Plaintiff
failed to state a legal basis for his request to stay and offers no factual
support for such request. To the extent plaintiff wishes to dismiss the case,
he may do so, but the court cannot “preserve the issue of timeliness.” 
Defendants
argue the request is unsupported, and it denies defendants the statutory
defense of the statute of limitations. Plaintiff has not presented legal
argument or authority to allow the court to grant an indefinite stay or to toll
the statute. DENIED.
Plaintiff
finally asks the court to “if within its power, assign counsel for Plaintiff.”
Mtn. to Reconsider para. 21. This case is a civil case; it is not within the
court’s powers or discretion to provide counsel for plaintiff. DENIED.
