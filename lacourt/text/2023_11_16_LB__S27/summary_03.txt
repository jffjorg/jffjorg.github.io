And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to vacate default filed by Maneesh Ashley Bansal and finds that the default is void and must be set aside. The default was entered against Bansal on June 1, 2023, and he filed this motion on July 17, 2023, only six weeks later. The Court has a signed declaration from Bansal stating that he had not worked at the subject location (5540 N. Figueroa St.) since 2019, which is sufficient prima facie evidence to show that the default is void. The Court also finds that the attempts to serve Bansal personally were not reasonable and that the actual service was not proper because it was not at his usual place of business.

The Court notes that the plaintiff, Miracle Mile Healthcare Center, filed its opposition to the motion two days late, but the Court has considered the untimely opposition papers. The Court grants the motion to vacate default and orders Bansal to file a separate copy of his proposed answer within five days. The parties are reminded that there is a Case Management Conference and an OSC re: default packet on calendar, and the Court asks counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing and conference.
