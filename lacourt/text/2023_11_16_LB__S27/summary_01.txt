And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case that has been pending since 2019. The defendant has passed away, and the court has vacated the trial date and set a hearing on a motion for leave to amend and a motion to be relieved as counsel. However, no papers have been filed in connection with these motions, so the court has taken them off calendar. The court intends to set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: dismissal for failure to prosecute for December 15, 2023. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice. Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court and identify themselves, or they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
