  Case Number:  19LBCV00625    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  S27 The Court called this matter for an FSC on 9/06/23.  At the FSC, Defense Counsel informed the
Court that Defendant had passed away.  The
Court vacated the trial date and set a hearing on a motion for leave to amend
and motion to be relieved as counsel for 11/16/23.  
 
To date, no papers have been filed in connection with the motion for
leave to amend or the motion to be relieved as counsel.  The Court therefore takes them off
calendar.

failure to prosecute for 12/15/23.   CCP
