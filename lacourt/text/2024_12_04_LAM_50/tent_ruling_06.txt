ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiffs Daniel Acosta, Salvador Gomez, Marcos Ochoa, and Xiomara Sanchez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) request entry of default
judgment against Defendants Libra Hollywood, LLC and John Greenwood. Plaintiffs
seek judgment in the total amount of $32,735.31, comprising $26,480.00 in damages, $4,026.58 in
interest, $923.53 in costs, and $1,305.20 in attorney’s fees.  
On November 8, 2024, the
Court issued an Order in this action on Plaintiffs’ request for default
judgment providing, inter alia as follows: 
 
“The Court notes one remaining defect with the submitted
default judgment package. The Court’s June 26,
2024 Order on Plaintiffs’ prior request for default
judgment provides, inter alia, that ‘[i]n the April 16, 2024 Order on
Plaintiffs’ prior request, the Court noted that ‘Plaintiffs do not appear to
provide a supporting declaration from their counsel substantiating the
attorney’s fees requested.’
(June 26, 2024 Order at p. 3:4-7.) Plaintiffs still do not appear to provide evidence
supporting the attorney’s fees requested (e.g., work performed, hourly
rate, etc.). Plaintiffs’ counsel’s supporting declaration solely discusses the
calculation of attorney’s fees under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule
3.214. (Idrees Decl., ¶ 4.).” (November 8, 2024 Order at p. 1:19-27.) 
On November
13, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended declaration supporting the attorney’s
fees requested. Thus, the remaining defect identified in the Court’s November
8, 2024 Order has been corrected.
 The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently supported
their request for default judgment with the submitted declarations and evidence.
Plaintiffs’ request is granted, and the Court
will sign the judgment submitted on August 1, 2024. No appearance at the
hearing is necessary.¿¿
