And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions and ordering the defendant's answer to the complaint to be stricken. The judge finds that the defendant has failed to comply with court orders and discovery requests, and that the plaintiff's counsel has spent time and effort on the motion. The judge awards the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,935.00 to be paid within 30 days of the date of the order.

The judge notes that the defendant's failure to comply with court orders and discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process and that the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions is warranted. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to provide competent evidence to support her opposition to the motion, and that the plaintiff's counsel's requested hourly rate of $750/hr is reasonable.

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the plaintiff's declaration in support of the motion and the defendant's opposition. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide notice of the order, and the defendant to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days.
