[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Samer Habbas and Samar Hellar of Law Offices of Samer Habbas &
Associates, P.C. (“Counsel”) move to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Richard
Bower.  
The Court
notes that although Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, the
moving papers do not appear to have been timely filed and served.  
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), “[u]nless otherwise ordered or
specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served
and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. The moving and supporting
papers served shall be a copy of the papers filed or to be filed with the
court. However, if the notice is served by mail, the required 16-day period of
notice before the hearing shall be increased by five calendar days if the place
of mailing and the place of address are within the State of California.” Here,
the moving papers were filed on November 12, 2024. In addition, Counsel filed a
proof of service on November 12, 2024 indicating that the moving papers were
served on certain parties by mail on November 11, 2024. However, sixteen court
days prior to the December 4, 2024 hearing is November 7, 2024, and five
calendar days before November 7, 2024 is November 2, 2024.[1]
In addition, another proof of service Counsel filed on
November 12, 2024 indicates that Counsel’s client was served with the moving
papers by electronic service on November 11, 2024. Under ¿Code
of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B)¿, “[a]ny¿period of
notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any
period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time
period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended
after service by electronic means by two court days…” Eighteen court days
before the December 4, 2024 hearing is November 5, 2024.
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
