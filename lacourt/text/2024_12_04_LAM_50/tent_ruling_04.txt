Discussion 
Misuses
of the discovery process include “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery”
and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) There are a broad range of sanctions
available against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process, including the issuance of monetary, evidentiary, issue, and
terminating sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)
“The court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: (1)¿An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (2)¿An order staying further proceedings by that party until an
order for discovery is obeyed. (3)¿An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. (4)¿An order rendering a judgment by default against that
party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
Plaintiff
states that the instant motion is “made on the grounds that
Defendant did not comply with this Court’s March 6, 2024 and July 10, 2024
orders.” (Notice of Motion at p. 1:26-27.) In his declaration in support of the
motion, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[o]n August 28, 2023, Plaintiff served
the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Admissions, Set One on the Defendant…Defendant did not
respond timely to the discovery and Plaintiff brought motions to compel initial
responses and a motion to deem admitted…The motions were subsequently continued
to allow for the parties to attend an informal discovery conference on March 6,
2024.” (Medvei Decl., ¶ 4.) 
On March 6, 2024, the parties participated in an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”). The Court’s March 6, 2024 minute order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he parties attended the Informal Discovery Conference. The
Parties agreed and the Court ordered as follows: On or before May 6, 2024,
Defendant will serve Plaintiff with verified responses without objection to
Plaintiff’s first set of requests for production, requests for admissions and
form interrogatories and produce any responsive documents.” Plaintiff’s counsel
states that “[a]lthough following the order, Defendant responded, the response
to No. 5 was asserted as inadequate under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230, and Defendant did not ‘produce any responsive
documents’ as to Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 7. Likewise, the responses to Form
Interrogatory no. 17.1 was asserted as defective.” (Medvei Decl., ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]fter attempts to meet and confer with
Defendant’s counsel, on May 14, 2024, Plaintiff set an informal discovery conference
for July 10, 2024.” (Medvei Decl., ¶ 5.)  
On July 10, 2024, the parties participated in another IDC. The Court’s
July 10, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“The parties
attended the Informal Discovery Conference. The Parties agreed and the Court
ordered as follows: Defendant Cendejas needs more time to produce the documents
ordered to be produced on March 6, 2024. Defendant Cendejas is now ordered to
produce on or before August 7, 2024 the documents identified in Plaintiff’s
Informal Discovery Conference Statement numbers 1 through 7. Defendant will
either mail or email the documents to Plaintiff’s Counsel. On or before August
7, 2024, Defendant Cendejas will supplement her response to the Request for
Production number 5 to state that she does not have any responsive documents
and no such documents ever existed. On or before August 7, 2024, Defendant
Cendejas will supplement her response to Form Interrogatory number 17.1, to
explain how she has complied with the subject statute and to identify documents
that show her compliance.” 
In his September 5, 2024 declaration in support of the instant motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]s of the date of this declaration,
Defendant has not produced any documents or further responses post the July 10,
2024 order.” (Medvei Decl., ¶ 7.) 
Plaintiff argues that “[t]here have been ‘three strikes’ by the
Defendant in connection with providing code-compliant responses and documents,
the initial complete lack of responses, the non-compliance following the March
6, 2024 order, and non-compliance following the July 10, 2024 order…” (Mot. at
p. 6:1-3.) Plaintiff asserts that its “counsel is unable to complete discovery
and prepare the matter for trial and is therefore completely prejudiced by the
Defendant’s refusal to comply with the Court’s orders and meaningfully comply
with discovery. Therefore, terminating sanctions are warranted.” (Mot. at pp.
5:24-6:1) 
The Court notes that “¿the sanctioned
party’s history as a repeat offender is not only relevant, but also
significant, in deciding whether to impose terminating sanctions.¿” (¿Liberty
Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrators, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1106¿.)
“¿A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence
shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”¿ (¿Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280¿.) 
As discussed, the Court issued a minute
order on March 6, 2024 ordering Defendant to serve verified responses to
Plaintiff’s subject discovery requests and to and produce any responsive
documents. In addition, as discussed, on July 10, 2024 the Court issued a
minute order ordering Defendant to produce certain documents and to supplement
certain discovery responses. Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant did not
comply with the Court’s orders. (Medvei Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7.) Defendant filed an
opposition to Plaintiff’s instant motion. However, in the opposition, Plaintiff
does not address or oppose Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions.
Defendant does not provide any argument or evidence demonstrating that she
complied with the Court’s March 6, 2024 and July
10, 2024 Orders. Defendant does not dispute that she “has not produced any
documents or further responses post the July 10, 2024 order.” (Medvei Decl., ¶
7.) 
In instances where “¿the record is replete
with instances of delay and failure to comply with a court order, dismissal may
be proper.¿” (¿Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
481, 489 [disapproved on other grounds]¿.) This is particularly true
where, as here, Defendant does not oppose the instant motion for terminating
sanctions. (See Ibid. [“[A]ppellants had ample opportunity to present their
arguments and excuses to the trial court. Instead, they failed to file
opposition to the motion to compel or the dismissal motion, leading the trial
court and us to presume they had no meritorious arguments.”].) The Court
finds that Defendant’s discovery abuse demonstrates that less severe sanctions
will not produce compliance with the discovery rules. Accordingly, terminating
sanctions are appropriate. 
Plaintiff
also seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant. In the notice of motion,
Plaintiff states that it “requests that monetary sanctions in the
amount of $4,935 be imposed on Defendant pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010, 2023.030, 2030.300, 2031.310, and
2031.320.” (Notice of Motion at pp. 1:28-2:1.) 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that
one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising
that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct…If a monetary sanction is
authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” 
As set forth above, Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that “Defendant has
not produced any documents or further responses post the July 10, 2024 order.”
(Medvei Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel also asserts that Defendant did not
fully comply with the Court’s March 6, 2024 order. (Medvei Decl., ¶ 5.) This is
not disputed by Defendant in the opposition. The Court finds that Plaintiff has
demonstrated that Defendant engaged in a “misuse of the discovery process” such
that monetary sanctions are warranted. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2023.010, 2023.030.) The Court
does not find that Defendant has shown that she acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of a monetary
sanction unjust. 
In
the opposition, Defendant states that she “opposes Plaintiff’s
request for attorney fees.” (Opp’n at p. 1:16.) Defendant cites to Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 277, where the California
Supreme Court noted that “[i]n this
appeal we consider whether an attorney who chooses to litigate in propria
persona rather than retain another attorney to represent him in an action to
enforce a contract containing an attorney fee provision can nevertheless
recover ‘reasonable attorney’s fees’ under Civil
Code section 1717 (hereafter section 1717) as compensation for the time and
effort expended and the professional business opportunities lost as a result.”
The California Supreme Court concluded that “such an attorney litigant cannot
recover such fees under section 1717…Were we to
construe the statute otherwise, we would in effect create two separate classes
of pro se litigants--those who are attorneys and those who are not--and grant
different rights and remedies to each. We find no support for such disparate
treatment either in the language of section 1717,
in the legislative policy underlying it, or in fairness and logic.” (Ibid.) 
Defendant argues that “here, Plaintiff is both the client and the
attorney,” such that attorney’s fees should not be awarded. (Opp’n at p. 1:23-24.)
As set forth above, the Court sustains Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to
Defendant’s declaration in support of the opposition. The Court does not find
that Defendant has presented competent evidence that Plaintiff “Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC” is “both the client and the attorney” in this
action. (Opp’n at p. 1:23-24.) In addition, Plaintiff’s counsel submits a
declaration in connection with the reply indicating that “I have no ownership
of the Plaintiff or its parent company, IRDC Holdings, LLC, or its former
parent company, IRDC Holdings, Inc. Neither does my law corporation, Medvei Law
Group, APC.” (Medvei Reply Decl., ¶ 4.) 
In his declaration in support of the instant motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel states that “[i]n connection with bringing this motion I engaged in the
following tasks: 1) I drafted this motion on September 5, 2024, which took 1.5
hours; 2) I anticipate spending 4 hours drafting a reply brief to the
opposition, if any; 3) In the event that the tentative is not submitted to, I
anticipate spending 1 hour appearing at the hearing via LA Court Connect…Therefore,
I anticipate incurring a total of 6.5 hours in connection with this motion, for
total anticipated attorney’s fees of $4,875. In addition, I incurred a $60
filing fee for the motion. Therefore, the total sanctions being sought on the
motion is $4,935.” (Medvei Decl., ¶¶ 11, 8, p. 9.) Plaintiff’s counsel requests
an hourly rate of $750/hr. (Medvei Decl., ¶ 10.) In the opposition, Defendant
does not challenge 
Plaintiff’s
counsel’s requested hourly rate or the amount of monetary sanctions. The Court
finds that the requested $4,935.00 in monetary sanctions is reasonable.
