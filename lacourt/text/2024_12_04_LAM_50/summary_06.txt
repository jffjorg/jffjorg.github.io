And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Teresa A. Beaudet in a case where Plaintiffs Daniel Acosta, Salvador Gomez, Marcos Ochoa, and Xiomara Sanchez are seeking a default judgment against Defendants Libra Hollywood, LLC and John Greenwood. The Plaintiffs are seeking a total of $32,735.31 in damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. The Court had previously identified a defect in the Plaintiffs' request for default judgment, specifically the lack of a supporting declaration from their counsel substantiating the attorney's fees requested. After the Plaintiffs filed an amended declaration supporting the attorney's fees, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently supported their request for default judgment and grants the request.
