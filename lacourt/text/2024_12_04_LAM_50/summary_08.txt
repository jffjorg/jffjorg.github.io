And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion filed by counsel, Samer Habbas and Samar Hellar, to withdraw as counsel for the plaintiff, Richard Bower. The motion was filed on November 12, 2024, but the judge notes that it was not filed and served in a timely manner. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, all moving and supporting papers must be filed and served at least 16 court days before the hearing. In this case, the motion was filed and served on November 12, 2024, which is only 12 court days before the hearing. The judge also notes that the motion was not served on all parties in a timely manner, as required by law. As a result, the judge denies the motion without prejudice, meaning that counsel can refile the motion and provide sufficient evidence of timely filing and service.
