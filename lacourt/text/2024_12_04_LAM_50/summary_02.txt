And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the disputes related to the Partnership Agreement between Deang and Meir. The judge notes that the Partnership Agreement, as written, is the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties, and any other promises or representations not included in the agreement are not binding. The judge also points out that there is no evidence of any written amendments to the Partnership Agreement. The judge's ruling seems to imply that any disputes arising from the agreement will be resolved based on the terms of the written agreement, and any claims or arguments not supported by the written agreement will be rejected.
