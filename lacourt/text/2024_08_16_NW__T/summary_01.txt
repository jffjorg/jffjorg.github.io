English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the parties and counsel are ordered to stop referencing or attaching exhibits from Hart v. Sullivan, unless it is in conjunction with a motion in this case based on res judicata or collateral estoppel. The court has already advised against referencing Hart v. Sullivan, but it continues to occur. The court also directs parties to restrict their correspondence to each separate case and to refrain from discussing the issues in Hart v. Sullivan in their meet and confers concerning this case.

The ruling addresses several motions, including motions to compel further discovery responses, motions to quash subpoenas, and motions to compel further responses without objections. The court grants some of the motions and denies others.

Regarding the deposition of top-level executives, the court states that the general rule in California is that agency heads and other top governmental executives are not subject to deposition absent compelling reasons. The court grants the motion to quash the subpoena to take the deposition of the CEO of LPF Triana, LLC.

The ruling also addresses the issue of service of summons, stating that LaSalle Property Fund REIT, Inc. is in default and does not have standing to file a motion to quash the service of summons until and unless the default is set aside.
