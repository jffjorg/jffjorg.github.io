  Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  T HART v  LASALLE 23VECV010301 ORDER  DIRECTING THE PARTIES AND COUNSEL TO STOP REFERENCING OR ATTACHING EXHIBITS  FROM HART V. SULLIVAN UNLESS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MOTION IN THIS CASE BASED ON  RES JUDICATA OR COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL The  civil supervising judge has ordered that this case is not related to Hart v.  Sullivan.  Despite that, parties and  counsel continue to reference what is going on in Hart v. Sullivan, discussing  court orders, and otherwise bombarding this court with matters from Hart v.  Sullivan.  The court has already advised  counsel and parties to not do this but it continues, even more than before.  The court disregards references to Hart v.  Sullivan. The  court makes clear: Unless there is a motion relating in this case to res  judicata or collateral estoppel, both sides are ordered to stop making  reference to the Hart v. Sullivan case.   The court disregards these references as they are impeding the court from focusing only on the  issues in this case.  This applies with  equal effect to plaintiff and defendants. Other  than if there is a final determination of an issue in Hart v Sullivan which may  be relevant here on a motion relating to res judicata or collateral estoppel,  references to Hart v. Sullivan MUST STOP NOW. Counsel  and parties are reminded that Judge Watkins has been disqualified on Hart v.  Sullivan, which is an additional reason to cease referencing that case in this  case's pleadings.   The  court also directs counsel and parties (AGAIN) to restrict their correspondence  to each separate case and to refrain from discussing the issues in Hart v  Sullivan in their meet and confers concerning this case.  The court has been disregarding and will  continue to disregard those discussions. _______________________________________________________________ TENTATIVE  RULINGS ON MOTIONS SET FOR HEARINGS ON 8/16/2024 In  ruling on the discovery motions, as the court has previously stated, it will  consider only the discovery identified in the Notice of Motion.  Any discovery referenced in the Separate  Statement that was not identified in the Notice of Motion will be disregarded. 1.          HEARING ON  MOTION - IN CAMERA REVIEW OF O'BRIEN AND LEGACY PRIVILEGE LOGS - FILED BY  PLAINTIFF ON 6/18/2024 DENIED. The  motion is denied.  There is no legal  authority for the plaintiff’s motion.   Instead, the legal authority is against plaintiff’s motion.  Evidence Code section 915 provides, with  exceptions not applicable here, that "the presiding officer may not  require disclosure of information claimed to be privileged under this division  [division 8 of the Evidence Code] ... in order to rule on the claim of  privilege...."  In reviewing the  sample privilege logs, they appear to be in compliance with the law.  Accordingly, it is neither necessary nor  appropriate for the court to review a communication to determine whether the  attorney-client privilege protects it, unless the privilege log shows that  persons who are not protected by the attorney client privilege were included in  the emails.  None have been identified. 2.          HEARING ON  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET 2,  PROPOUNDED ON JONATHAN KYLE DUPREE; ISSUE SANCTIONS – FILED BY PLAINTIFF ON  4/25/2024 DENIED. Plaintiff  seeks a court order compelling further response and production to Nos. 46 – 51,  56, 58, 66 – 83.  The court denies the  motion.  The court is not going to  require an individual defendant to go to a co-defendant company to pull  documents to respond.  This results in  duplicative effort and is unnecessary and burdensome, particularly when there  are duplicates of discovery being sent to multiple defendants.  Furthermore, the responses of the defendant,  subject to reasonable objections, are Code complaint.   3.          HEARING ON  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET 2,  PROPOUNDED ON JONATHAN KYLE DUPREE; MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE SUM OF $91.50  AGAINST DUPREE AND ASHAN K. PEIRIS – FILED BY PLAINTIFF ON 4/23/2024 DENIED. Plaintiff seeks an order compelling further  responses to Nos. 69-74.  The court finds  that, subject to objections, the answers are sufficient.  The motion is denied. 4.          HEARING ON  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET 2,  PROPOUNDED ON LEGACY PARTNERS; SANCTIONS IN THE SUM OF $91.50 AGAINST MR.  BUBION AND LEGACY PARTNERS - FILED BY PLAINTIFF ON 3/28/2024   GRANT. The  motion to compel is granted.  There were  no substantive responses.  There was a  clear intent to only object without having sought a motion for protective  order.  The objections, therefore, are  inadequate.  Further, verified responses  within 20 days.  Monetary sanctions in  the sum of $91.50 against Legacy Partners payable to Shelly Hart by 9/16/2024  for discovery abuse without substantial justification.    5.          HEARING ON  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTIONS FROM DEANNA  O'BRIEN AS TO PLAINTIFF'S FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR  EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS AND MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE SUM OF $91.50 AGAINST  O'BRIEN AND MR.

The motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in  part. 2.1        Deny 2.2        Deny 2.3        Deny 2.5        Deny 2.7        Deny 12.1     Deny 12.2     Grant  as to witnesses concerning the plaintiff’s claims 12.3     Grant  as to witnesses concerning the plaintiff’s claims 12.4     Grant  as to witnesses concerning the plaintiff’s claims 12.5     Deny 12.6     Grant 12.7     Deny 16.1     Deny 16.2     Grant   16.3     Grant   16.7     Grant   16.8     Grant 16.9     Grant   16.10   Grant 17.1     Grant as  to RFA number 5 Monetary  sanctions in the amount of $91.50 are assessed against defendant Deanna O'Brien  payable to Shelly Hart by 9/16/2024 for  discovery abuse without substantial justification.               6.          HEARING  ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTIONS FROM STEVEN  LENARD SAPP AS TO PLAINTIFF'S FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR  EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS AND MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $91.50 AGAINST  SAPP AND MR. BUBION - FILED BY PLAINTIFF ON 4/2/2024 GRANT IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. The ruling is the same as the motion against Ms.  O'Brien except sanctions of $91.50 are against Steven Sapp. 7.          HEARING ON LPF  TRIANA, LLC, LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC., AND KYLE DUPREE’S MOTION TO  QUASH PLAINTIFF’S SUBPOENA TO JAMES GARVEY – filed on 5/17/2024 GRANT. GRANT  motion to quash.  The general rule in  California for taking the deposition of a top-level executive of a corporation  is correctly stated by the moving papers.    As stated by the court in Westly: “The general rule in California and  federal court is that agency heads and other top governmental executives are  not subject to deposition absent compelling reasons.  (Nagle v. Superior Court  (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1465, 1467-1468, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 281; ¿Deukmejian  v. Superior Court (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 632, 633, 191 Cal.Rptr. 905; ¿State  Board of Pharmacy v. Superior Court (1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 641, 644-645, 144  Cal.Rptr. 320; ¿Church of Scientology of Boston  v. IRS (D.Mass.1990) 138 F.R.D. 9, 12.)   The rule applies to officials  summoned to testify as third parties as well as those who are named defendants.   (State Board of Pharmacy v. Superior Court, supra, 78 Cal.App.3d at p. 643,  144 Cal.Rptr. 320; ¿Nagle v. Superior Court, supra,  28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1468, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 281.) . . .The general rule is based  upon the recognition that ‘· an  official's time and the exigencies of his everyday business would be severely  impeded if every plaintiff filing a complaint against an agency head, in his  official capacity, were allowed to take his oral deposition.   Such procedure  would be contrary to the public interest, plus the fact that ordinarily the  head of an agency has little or no knowledge of the facts of the case.’ ”  (Nagle v. Superior Court, supra, 28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1468, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d  281.) An exception to the rule exists only when the official has direct  personal factual information pertaining to material issues in the action and  the deposing party shows the information to be gained from the deposition is  not available through any other source.  (Ibid., citing Church of Scientology  of Boston v. IRS, supra, 138 F.R.D. at p. 12.)”   Westly v. Superior Court (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 907, 911;  Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v Superior Court (1979) 10 Cal.App.4th  1282. Here,  the plaintiff has failed to state compelling reasons to take the deposition of  the CEO of LPF Triana (as shown in plaintiff’s exhibit) nor has she shown that  the testimony of Mr. Garvey cannot be obtained by other discovery means.  The motion is granted. 8.          HEARING ON  MOTION TO QUASH SPECIALLY APPEARING LASALLE PROPERTY FUND REIT, INC.’S MOTION  TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS filed 5/22/2024 DENIED.   LaSalle  Property Fund REIT, Inc. is in default.   It does not have standing to file a motion to quash until and unless the  default is set aside.
