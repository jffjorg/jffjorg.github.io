```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the court's previous order issued on May 23, 2024. The Judge notes that had a motion for terminating sanctions been requested, they may have granted the request. Instead, the Judge reiterates the original order, changing the production due date and deposition date. The Judge also grants monetary sanctions against the defendant, General Motors, in the sum of $5,000, payable by September 16, 2024, to the Client Trust Account of The Margarian Law Firm. This is due to discovery abuse without substantial justification, as specified in California Code of Procedure sections § 2025.450(g), § 2023.010(a), § 2023.020, and § 2023.030(a). The Judge does not impose additional sanctions because the motions have been unnecessarily overworked.
