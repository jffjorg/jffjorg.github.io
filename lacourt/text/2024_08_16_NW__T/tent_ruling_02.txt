BAGDASARYAN V GM
The court already issued a court order for this
deposition on 5/23/2024.  Had a motion
for terminating sanctions been requested, the court may have granted that
request.  At this time, the court reiterates
its order of 5/23/2024 except changes the production due date to _____ and the
deposition date to ____. There were no timely objections served prior to the
time for the originally scheduled deposition and objections had been waived by
the 5/23/2024 hearing. The court grants monetary sanctions against defendant
General Motors in the sum of $5,000 for the original motion and the current
motion pursuant to CCP sections § 2025.450(g); § 2023.010(a); § 2023.020; §
2023.030(a) for discovery abuse without substantial justification, payable by
9/16/2024 to the Client Trust Account of THE MARGARIAN LAW FIRM 462 West
Colorado Street, Glendale, California 91204. 
Additional sanctions are not warranted because the motions have been unnecessarily
overworked.
