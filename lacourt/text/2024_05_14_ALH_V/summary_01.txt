And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively decided to continue the motion to compel further responses to defendant's verified responses to plaintiff's requests for production of documents. The court finds that plaintiff did not make a good faith effort to meet and confer with defendant's counsel, as plaintiff only sent one meet and confer letter and did not attempt to follow up by email or telephone. Despite defendant's offer to extend the deadline for the motion to compel, plaintiff did not respond. The court orders the parties to meet and confer and file a joint stipulation setting forth the discovery that is still at issue after their meet and confer efforts.
