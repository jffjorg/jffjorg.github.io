BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff Sonia Barahona filed the complaint on June 26,
2023, against defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Plaintiff alleges the
following causes of action: (1) violation of subdivision (d) of Civil Code
section 179.2; (2) violation of subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1793.2;
(3) violation of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code section 1739.2; and (4)
breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. Plaintiff alleges that on or
about August 14, 2020, plaintiff purchased a 2020 Toyota C-HR (subject
vehicle). Plaintiff alleges the subject vehicle had defects and nonconformities
that substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the subject vehicle.Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on March 4, 2024. Defendant filed its opposition on
April 18, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on April 24, 2024
LEGAL STANDARD
With respect to requests for production of documents there
are three appropriate responses: (1) a statement that the party will comply
with the request; (2) a statement of inability to comply; or (3) an objection.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210(a).)
The requesting party may move for an order compelling
further responses to request for production of documents if any of the
following apply: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete;
(2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b)(2).) The purpose of the meet and confer requirement is to encourage
the parties to make serious effort to work out differences informally and avoid
a need for a formal order. (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87
Cal. App. 4th 1006, 1016.)
Under Rule of Court 3.1345, the movant must submit a
separate statement along with the motion to compel further responses. The
movant must include specific facts showing good cause justifying further
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).)
DISCUSSION
A.     
  Timeliness

Defendant electronically served verified responses to
plaintiff on January 17, 2024. (Decl. of Rosario Stoliker, ¶ 23, Exh. 6.) Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 subdivision (c), plaintiffs had 45
days, plus two court days for electronic service, to file the motion to compel
further responses. Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses was filed on
March 4, 2024, and is timely
B. Meet and Confer
 Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310(b)(2), the parties are required to meet and confer
prior to filing a motion to compel further responses and are required to file a
declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution. Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter
regarding defendant’s responses on February 5, 2024 and defendant did not
respond. (Decl. of Rosario Stoliker, ¶ 28, Exh. 8.) On March 4, 2024, at 11:29
a.m. plaintiff’s counsel emailed defendant’s counsel saying given defendant’s
counsel failure to respond to meet and confer, plaintiff will be seeking court
intervention. (Decl. of Rosario Stoliker, ¶ 28, Exh. 10; Decl. of Sharon L.
Stewart, ¶ 7.) On March 4, 2024, at 11:40 a.m. defendant’s counsel replied to
plaintiff’s counsel’s email explaining the oversight and offered to respond to
plaintiff's meet and confer letter by March 15, 2024, and to extend plaintiff's
motion to compel deadline to March 29, 2024; however, plaintiff did not respond.
(Decl. of Sharon L. Stewart, ¶ 9.) Defendant’s counsel sent a follow-up email
on that same day at 4:13 p.m. confirming if plaintiff’s counsel was agreeable
to the proposed deadline extension, but plaintiff did not respond to that email
either. (Decl. of Sharon L. Stewart, ¶ 10, 11.)
The court finds that plaintiff’s counsel did not satisfy the
requirement to make a good faith effort to meet and confer with defendant’s
counsel. Plaintiff only sent one meet and confer letter and never attempted to
follow up by email or telephone. Furthermore, when defendant offered to extend
the motion to compel deadline so the parties could meaningfully meet and confer
and attempt to informally resolve the issues, plaintiff did not reply and
instead filed the instant motion. 
Based on the foregoing, the court CONTINUES the motion to
compel further responses to ______________. 
The court orders the parties to meet and confer. The parties
are ordered to file a joint stipulation setting forth the discovery that is
still at issue after their meet and confer efforts.
