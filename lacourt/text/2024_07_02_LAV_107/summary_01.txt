And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of its May 15 order granting Defendant's requests for monetary sanctions. The court finds that the motion is not based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The court also finds that Plaintiff shows no satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time. Additionally, the court notes that Defendant did provide evidence that the Original Motions were properly served on Plaintiff, which the court considered before making its order on the Original Motions. As a result, the court denies the motion for reconsideration. The court also denies Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,575.00 under California Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, as the court finds that Plaintiff did not engage in bad faith or bring the motion solely to cause unnecessary delay.
