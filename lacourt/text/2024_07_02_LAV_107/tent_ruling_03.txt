COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: REQUEST
  FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The
Request for Default Judgment is Denied.
Reasons
 

The
     filed proof of service of the complaint and summons indicates that
     substituted service was effected at a residential home, but the proof of
     service does not attach a showing of due diligence, such as three prior
     attempts, before substituted service was effected.

 

Service
     is deemed complete 10 days after the mailing of the complaint and summons
     to the same address where substituted service was effected. (California
     Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20.) Thus, in this case, since the
     summons and complaint were mailed to the defaulting defendant on December
     7, 2023, service was deemed complete on January 6, 2024. Default was
     entered against the defendant on January 23, 2024, which is less than 30
     days after the date on which service was deemed complete.

 

The
     proposed judgment is not on the JUD-100 form.

 

A
     summary of the case is missing. Plaintiff must file a summary of the case
     identifying the parties and the nature of the action.

 

Exhibits
     are missing from the Zadeh Declaration. The declarant references exhibits
     that are not attached. In particular, evidence of damages amount is
     missing.

 
 
The
Request for Default Judgment is therefore Denied. It is so ordered.
