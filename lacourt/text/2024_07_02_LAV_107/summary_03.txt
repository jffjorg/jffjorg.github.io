And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment. The reason for this denial is that the proof of service of the complaint and summons does not show due diligence. The proof of service indicates that substituted service was effect at a residential home, but it does not show that the defendant was given three prior attempts to serve them. Additionally, the proposed judgment is not on the correct form, and a summary of the case is missing. Furthermore, exhibits are missing from the Zadeh Declaration, including evidence of the damages amount. Therefore, the request for default judgment is denied.
