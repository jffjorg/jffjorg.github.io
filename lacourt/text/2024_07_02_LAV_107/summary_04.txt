English-text summary:
This is a tentative ruling by Judge Eric Harmon in a lawsuit between Hamid Reza Mirshojae and Ahang Mirshojae regarding a real property dispute. The lawsuit involves a 998 agreement and a lis pendens filing. The court previously granted a motion to expunge the lis pendens, but the plaintiffs have now moved for reconsideration. The court finds that the plaintiffs have shown that the Pledge Agreement effects a transfer of real property under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act and that Ahang has intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. The court grants the motion for reconsideration and denies the original motion to expunge the lis pendens. The court also awards the plaintiffs $7,570 in monetary sanctions against the defendants.
