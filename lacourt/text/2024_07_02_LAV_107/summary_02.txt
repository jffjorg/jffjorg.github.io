And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Counsel, Hamid R. Moussavian, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Michael MirMehdi. Counsel seeks to be relieved due to a conflict of interest between the plaintiff and himself. However, the court finds that the motion does not comply with the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d)(1)(B), which requires that the notice of motion and motion be served on the client at their current address, with an explanation of why the client's last known address was used instead. As a result, the court DENIES the motion.
