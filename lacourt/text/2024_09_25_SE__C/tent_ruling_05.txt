TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Itria Ventures, LLC’s Motion for Summary Adjudication
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This motion is unopposed as of September 23, 2024. 
 
 
Factual Background
 
This lawsuit arises from Defendants’ alleged failure to pay
Itria Ventures, LLC pursuant to the parties’ seven written agreements. Defendant
Basel Haddad executed the seven agreements, known as the Future Receivables
Sale Agreements (“FRSAs”), with Plaintiff Itria Ventures, LLC as the principal,
officer, and/or manager of Merchant Defendants. (SSUMF, ¶¶ 5, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 60.) As part of the FRSAs, Haddad also
executed a Guaranty (“Guaranty”) in his individual capacity as a personal
guarantor of Merchant Defendants’ performance under the FRSAs. (SSUMF, ¶ 7, 19, 29, 39, 49, 58, 67.) Itria
lived up to its obligations on each of the seven contracts by paying Merchant
Defendants as set forth in each FRSA to meet the Merchant Defendants’ working
capital needs. (SSUMF, ¶¶ 2,
12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 61.) Defendants took Itria’s money but breached the
contracts by failing to remit their accounts receivable as required. (SSUMF, ¶¶ 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 62.) Defendants
have suffered damage. (SSUMF, ¶¶ 4,14,24,34,44,5463.)
The Complaint asserts causes of action for Appointment of Receiver (Cause of
Action No. 1), Preliminary Injunction (Cause of Action No. 2), Breach of
Written Contract (Cause of Action Nos. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15), and Breach
of Written Guaranty (Cause of Action Nos. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16).  
 
Plaintiff seeks summary adjudication of the following: 
 
·       On
Plaintiff’s Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, and Fifteenth
Causes of Action for Breach of Written Contract;
·       On
Plaintiff’s Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Twelfth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth
Causes of Action for Breach of Written Guaranty. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“[A] motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the
papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  The moving party bears the initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing no triable material fact
issues.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.) 
If the moving party meets this burden, the burden shifts to the opposing
party to make a converse prima facie showing that a triable issue of
material fact exists. (Ibid.)  
 
Plaintiffs may shift the burden of proof by submitting
evidence as to every element of the cause of action. (Code Civ. Pro., § 437c,
subd. (p)(1); WRI Opportunity Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154
Cal.App.4th 525, 532.)
 
Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, and
Fifteenth Causes of Action: Breach of Written Contract
 
As discussed above, Plaintiff asserts that Merchant Defendants
Basel Haddad; Haddad Brothers W&B Enterprise, Inc.;; King Tut, Inc.; Shop
Rite Liquor, Inc.; HHH Property Management, LLC; Palm Liquor Management, Inc.; Santa
Fe Liquor, Inc.; Surf and Pierport Liquors, Inc.; Can Do No 2 Liquor and
Market; CVCO Management DBA CV Liquor and Market; and MQOC Market DBA Can Do
Country Liquor and Market breached the FRSAs by not remitting their accounts
receivable as required. 
 
To prove breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to
establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) 
 
Plaintiff has met the burden to prove that there is no
triable issue of material fact. The burden shifts to Defendants, but the motion
is unopposed. 
 
Thus, the Court grants summary adjudication as to the third,
fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth causes of action. 
 
Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Twelfth, Fourteenth, and
Sixteenth Causes of Action: Breach of Written Guaranty 
 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Haddad
executed the guarantees as part of the FRSAs. (SSUMF, ¶ 7.) Plaintiff
further asserts that Defendants breached the seven FRSAs by failing to
pay the Daily and Weekly Remittances and by failing to provide it with notice
of insufficient funds in the Approved Accounts. (Decl. Smalbach, ¶5.) Plaintiff
asserts that Defendant Haddad breached the Guaranties by failing and refusing
to perform his obligations to ensure the other Defendants’ full, complete, and
timely performance of all their obligations under each FRSA even after
Plaintiff notified Defendant Haddad. (Decl. Smalbach, Exhibit O.) 
 
Evidence that
guarantor had guaranteed payment of debtor's indebtedness to creditor; debtor
defaulted on its loans; creditor notified guarantor of debtor's default and
guarantor did not remit any funds to creditor establishes material elements of
cause of action for breach of guaranty agreement. (Torrey Pines Bank v.
Super. Ct. (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 813, 819.) 
 
Plaintiff has met the burden to prove that there is no
triable issue of material fact. The burden shifts to Defendants, but the motion
is unopposed. 
 
Therefore, the motion is GRANTED.
