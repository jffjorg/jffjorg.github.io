And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lorena Quiroz v. America Honda Motor Company, Inc. The plaintiff has moved to compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, but the motion is continued to January 22, 2025. The defendant has served unverified responses to the plaintiff's requests, and the 45-day clock has not run due to lack of verified responses. The judge notes that unverified responses are valid as to numbers containing objections, but the defendant has not served verifications. The judge also orders counsel to make further efforts to resolve the discovery disputes and to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required.
