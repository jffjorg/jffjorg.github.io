And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sentry Select Insurance Company's motion for leave to file an answer-in-intervention and cross-complaint on behalf of ING Logistics, Inc. The motion is unopposed, and the Court considers the issue of timeliness waived. Sentry Select Insurance Company seeks to protect ING Logistics' and its own interests in connection with claims brought against ING Logistics. The Court follows the reasoning in Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. vs. Performance Plastering, Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 212, which held that an insurance company must intervene in pending litigation to protect its interests and those of its insured. The answer-in-intervention and cross-complaint must be filed within 5 days, and notice of the Court's decision must be served on parties who have appeared.
