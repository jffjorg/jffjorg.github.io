And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Whittier's ex parte application to advance the hearing date for its Motion to Consolidate, currently scheduled for April 17, 2025. The City of Whittier had requested to move up the hearing date, but the judge ruled that a Notice of Related Cases must be filed, served, and approved by the Court before the motion can be heard. The notice must be filed in all pending cases and served on all parties in those cases. Since a notice has not been filed in another related case, Environmental Construction, Inc. v. City of Whittier, the moving party (City of Whittier) must give notice. The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after further consideration or argument.
