English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants Jose Vasquez Barajas and Veronica Nieves. The demurrer was unopposed as of September 19, 2024. The Court has determined that the demurrer is SUSTAINED in part and OVERRULED in part.

The first cause of action, indemnification, is OVERRULED as it alleges equitable indemnity, which applies to the facts of the case. The second cause of action, apportionment of fault, is SUSTAINED as it does not apply to breach of contract causes of action. The third and fourth causes of action, declaratory relief and breach of contract, are SUSTAINED as they do not allege the required elements.

The Court has also determined that the parties have adequately met and conferred, and that the demurrer is not a claim for contribution from a joint tortfeasor. The Court's ruling is based on the laws and cases cited in the ruling, including Prince v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., West v. Super. Ct., and Li v. Yellow Cab Co.
