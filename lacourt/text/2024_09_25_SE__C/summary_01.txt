And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendants WOLF BASCHUNG and DTLA REAL ESTATE, INC. The motion was initially filed on July 11, 2023, but was continued due to the pending appeal in the Santa Barbara action. The Santa Barbara Superior Court recently issued a remittitur on August 5, 2024, and the parties have not had the opportunity to brief or summarize the effect of the Appellate Court's decision.

The judge orders Defendants WOLF BASCHUNG and DTLA REAL ESTATE, INC. to file and serve a supplemental moving brief by October 4, 2024, and allows the parties to file supplemental opposition and reply briefs by October 9 and 11, 2024, respectively.

The case involves a dispute between THEE AGUILA, INC. and BLACKWOOD, LLC, WOLF BASCHUNG, and DTLA REAL ESTATE, INC. over the sale of a property and allegations of breach of oral contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and deceit, intentional misrepresentation, and unfair business practices. The case has a complex history, with multiple motions and rulings, including a previous abatement of the instant action and a recent remittitur in the Santa Barbara action.
