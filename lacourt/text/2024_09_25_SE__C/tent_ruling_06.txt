Carmen Colon Alamo’s motion for leave to file cross-complaint is GRANTED. Defendant is to file and serve the
cross-complaint within 5 days.   
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
The motion is unopposed
as of September 23, 2024. 
 
 
Background
 
This is about a
motor collision involving four vehicles. (Complaint.) They are the four parties
to this lawsuit. (Complaint.) 
 
Defendant Maria
Del Carmen Colon Alamo moves for leave to file a cross-complaint. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party against whom a cause of action has been
asserted in a complaint can file a cross-complaint against a codefendant or
third person not yet a party to the action only if the cause of action asserted
(1) arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
occurrences or (2) asserts a claim, right, or interest in the property or controversy which is the subject of the cause [of action]
brought against him. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10, subd. (b).) 
 
Leave may be granted in the interest of justice
at any time during the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.) 
 
Leave
to File Cross-Complaint
 
Here,
Defendant asserts
comparative indemnity and declaratory relief against the other defendants.
(Decl. Kandarian-Stein, ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
 
Because
the causes of action asserted arise out of the same occurrence as the original
action, the Court grants leave to file the cross-complaint. 
 
The
motion is GRANTED. Defendant Maria Del
Carmen Colon Alamo is to file and serve the cross-complaint within 5
days.
