TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Lorena Quiroz’s motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One is CONTINUED to January 22, 2025 at 10:30 A.M.
in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action about a 2019
Honda Odyssey vehicle. Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, request numbers 24-28, 32-34, and 37-38.
 
Timeliness

 
Notice
of the motion to compel further must be provided within 45 days of service of
the verified response or on or before any specific later date to which the
parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) This 45-day
deadline runs from the date the verified response is served and is extended for
service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure to timely move to compel
within the specified period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel a
further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
On April 4, 2023, Defendant served
responses to Plaintiff’s first set of requests for production of documents.
(Decl. Lupinek, ¶ 6, Ex. B.) The responses are not verified. 
 
The 45-day clock runs only upon
service of verified responses, and responses consisting of both factual
responses and objections must be verified. (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc.
v. Super. Ct. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136.) Defendant has not served
verifications. (Decl. Lupinek, ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Thus, the clock has not run. 
 
Verified
Responses
 
Where there are mixed objections and answers,
an unverified response is valid as to the numbers containing objections. (Food
4 Less Supermarkets, Inc.  v.  Sup. 
Ct.  (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
651, 658.) Unverified objections are effective responses. (Blue Ridge
Ins.  Co. 
v.  Sup.  Ct.  (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 339, 344.) An unverified
discovery response is treated as no response. (Steele v.  Totah (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 545, 549; Appleton
v.  Super.  Ct.  (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636-37.)
 
In
the Court’s discretion, the unverified discovery responses are treated as
responses. 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The Court issued a Case
Management Conference (“CMC”) Order. It outlines, in detail, the discovery to
be produced in this action.  To the
extent that the CMC Order covers the issues outlined in the instant Motion, the
Motion is rendered MOOT. 
The Court is not persuaded that counsel have
exhausted their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code.  Counsel are advised that their meet and confer
efforts should go beyond merely sending letters stating their respective
positions. (See Townsend v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1439.) “A determination of
whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate…involves the exercise of
discretion. The level of effort at an informal resolution which satisfies the
‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ standard depends upon the circumstances. In
a larger, more complex discovery request, a greater effort at informal
resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a
more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation, the nature of
the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope
of the discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors
can be relevant. Judges have broad powers and responsibilities to determine
what measures and procedures are appropriate in varying circumstances.” (Obregon
v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) 
 
Counsel
are ORDERED to make further efforts
to resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The
joint statement must be FILED no later than 10 days before the continued
hearing date.
