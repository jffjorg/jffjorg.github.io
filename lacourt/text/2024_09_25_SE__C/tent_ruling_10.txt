TENTATIVE RULING
 
Cross-Defendants
Jose Vasquez Barajas and Veronica Nieves’ demurrer is OVERRULED in part and
SUSTAINED in part without leave to amend as set forth below.  
 
Plaintiff to give NOTICE.
 
This motion is unopposed as of September 19, 2024. 
 
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
Jose Vasquez Barajas and Veronica Nieves (“Cross-Defendants”) bought property
known as 9919 Pomering Road, Downey, California 90240 from Defendants/Cross-Complainants
C.C.M. Investments, LLC, and Maria Pena (“Cross-Complainants”).  Cross-Complainants allegedly breached the sales
agreement by not correcting all the violations with the City of Downey. Cross-Defendants
allegedly had to spend more than $150,000.00 to finish the corrections. 
 
Cross-Complainants
countersue on the grounds that Cross-Defendants prevented Cross-Complainants
from completing the repairs. Cross-Complainants countersue for the following: 
 
1.   
Indemnification 
2.   
Apportionment of Fault 
3.   
Declaratory Relief 
4.   
Breach of Contract. 
 
Cross-Defendants demur to the first, second, third, and
fourth causes of action on the grounds that they do not state facts sufficient
to constitute causes of action and are uncertain. 
 

Meet and Confer
 
The parties adequately met and conferred. (Decl.
Khojayan, ¶¶ 3,4; Code.
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is
to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions of law. (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  
 
Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible
that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3.)  
 
First
Cause of Action: Indemnification 
 
In general, indemnity refers to the obligation resting on one
party to make
good a loss or damage another party has incurred. (Prince v.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1151, 1157.) Historically,
the obligation of
indemnity took three forms: (1) indemnity expressly provided for
by contract
(express indemnity); (2) indemnity implied from a contract not
specifically
mentioning indemnity (implied contractual indemnity); and (3)
indemnity arising
from the equities of particular circumstances (traditional
equitable indemnity). (Ibid.) Courts now recognize there are only two
basic types of indemnity: express
indemnity and equitable indemnity. (Ibid.) Though not
extinguished, implied contractual indemnity is now viewed as a type of
equitable indemnity. (Ibid.)  
 
The right to implied contractual indemnity is based on the
indemnitor’s
breach of contract. (West v. Super. Ct. (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 1625, 1633.) A contract under which the indemnitor agreed to do
work or perform services necessarily implies an obligation to do the work
involved in a proper manner and to discharge foreseeable damages resulting from
improper performance unless the indemnitee did something wrong to preclude
recovery. (Ibid.) An action for implied contractual indemnity is not a
claim for contribution from a joint tortfeasor; it is not founded upon a tort
or upon any duty which the indemnitor owes to the injured third party. (Ibid.)
It is grounded upon the indemnitor’s breach of duty owing to the indemnitee to
properly perform its contractual duties. (Ibid.)
 
In addition, to state a claim for equitable indemnity, a defendant must allege the same harm for which he may be held
liable is properly attributable—at least in part—to the cross-defendant. (Platt
v. Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d
1439, 1445, fn.7.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue this cause of action requires a third-party payment of a certain
obligation, but here, Cross-Complainants allege indemnity against their
contractual counterparts. Cross-Defendants also argue that there are no
allegations of damages or basis for restitution and the allegations in the cross-complaint
do not match the contractual language.   
 
Cross-Complainants allege that Cross-Defendants prevented
Cross-Complainants from completing the repairs. Further, Cross-Complainants
allege the following: “If I am found in some manner responsible to plaintiff or
to anyone else as a result of the incidents and occurrences described in
plaintiff’s complaint, my liability would be based solely upon a derivative
form of liability not resulting from my conduct, but only from an obligation
imposed upon me by law; therefore, I would be entitled to complete indemnity
from each cross-defendant.” (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 7c.)
 
The Court determines that equitable indemnity applies because Cross-Defendants’
alleged conduct is not addressed in the contract.  
 
The demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
Second Cause of Action: Apportionment
of Fault 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue the Cross-Complainant does not allege that any third party shares fault
for Cross-Complainants’ damages, this cause of action is an affirmative defense
rather than a separate cause of action, and Cross-Complainants do not allege
the specific conduct that constitutes apportionment of fault. 
 
Apportionment, or
comparative fault, is conduct on the part of the plaintiff which falls below
the standard to which he should conform for his own protection, and which is a legally
contributing cause cooperating with the negligence of the defendant in bringing
about the plaintiff's harm.¿ (Li v. Yellow Cab Co. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 804,
809.)
 
The comparative fault doctrine’s purpose is to permit the trier
of fact to
consider all relevant criteria in apportioning liability. (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1285.) The
doctrine is a flexible concept, under which a jury properly may consider and
evaluate the relative responsibility of various parties for an injury whether
their responsibility for the injury rests on negligence, strict liability, or
other theories of responsibility, in order to arrive at an ‘equitable
apportionment or allocation of loss. (Ibid.)
 
Apportionment
applies to tort causes of action, not breach of contract causes of action. (See
Li v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1975) 13
Cal.3d 804, 809; Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1285.) Because the cross-complaint
does not allege any tort causes of action, apportionment of fault does not
apply.
 
Leave to amend should be denied where the
facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no liability
exists under substantive law. (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.) 
 
The demurrer to the
second cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Third
Cause of Action: Declaratory Relief
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that because Cross-Complainants did not allege any facts to establish
their remaining causes of action, the Court cannot issue declaratory relief. 
 
To qualify for
declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action presented two
essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an
actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the party’s
rights or obligations.” (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 authorizes
actions for declaratory relief under a “written instrument” or
“contract.” There is no law prohibiting that an agreement be written,
rather than oral or implied by conduct. (See, e.g. Gaglione v. Coolidge
(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 518, 521-522.) But there
is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved. (Osseous
Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 357, 366, emphasis added.) 
 
Here, Cross-Defendants only allege past
wrongs; thus, declaratory relief does not apply. 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Fourth
Cause of Action: Breach of Contract
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that the breach of contract cause of action does not allege the required
elements and it is unclear how Cross-Complainants suffered any damages. 
 
To
state a cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to
establish the following: (1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff. (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman
(2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) 
 
If
a breach of contract claim is based on alleged breach of a written contract,
the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of
the written agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference. (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In
some circumstances, a plaintiff can also plead the legal effect of the contract
rather than its precise language. (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.) 
 
Here,
Cross-Complainants allege that Cross-Defendants breached by preventing
Cross-Complainants from completing the repairs. But the written contract
contains no such term.  
 
The
demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.  
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED in part and OVERRULED in part as set forth
above.
