And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of TABBAA v. General Motors LLC, ET AL. (Case No. 23NWCV04023). The defendant, General Motors LLC, has demurred to the plaintiff's complaint, alleging that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer in part and sustained it in part. The plaintiff has 20 days to amend its complaint.

The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The defendant had argued that there were no supporting allegations of fraud, but the judge found that the plaintiff properly alleged a fraud cause of action.

The judge has ruled that the economic loss rule does not bar the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant concealed material facts about the vehicle's battery and fraudulently induced the plaintiff to purchase the vehicle.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges a violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, with 20 days leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiff did not properly allege an "unfair" practice under the unfair competition law.

The judge has scheduled a hearing for September 25, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. to consider the parties' motions and make a final ruling.
