And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sentry Select Insurance Company's motion for leave to file an answer-in-intervention and cross-complaint on behalf of ING Logistics, Inc. The motion was unopposed and the court considers the issue of timeliness waived. The court finds that Sentry Select Insurance Company has a direct interest in the outcome of the litigation because ING Logistics, Inc. is suspended for nonpayment of taxes and the insurance company may be liable for any proceeds from the policy issued to ING Logistics, Inc. The court cites precedent from Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. vs. Performance Plastering, Inc. and holds that the insurance company must intervene in the action to protect its interests and those of its insured. The intervenor must separately file and serve the answer in intervention and cross-complaint and serve notice of the court's decision to parties who have appeared.
