State Farm v. Estrada, et al.MOTION
TO VACATE DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT(CCP §§ 473, 473.5, 418.10)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Eric Lopez Estrada’s
Motion to Quash Service, Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant
Eric L. Estrada (“Defendant”) on June 20, 2012. Following Defendant’s failure
to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered default judgment on December
22, 2012. The judgment was renewed on October 25, 2022. On the same date,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a Notice of Firm Name and Address Change. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion
to Quash Service of Summons, Vacate Default and Default Judgment on November
30, 2023. The Motion initially came for hearing on February 6, 2024 at which
time the Court found it was not accompanied by a proof of service. (Minute
Order, 02/06/24.) The Court ordered Defendant to file proof of service of the
Motion by April 9, 2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiff filed an opposition to the
Motion on April 24, 2024 stating that it has yet to be served with the Motion.
No proof of service of the Motion has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
First, as previously noted,
failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) The Motion cannot be granted without a showing
or waiver of proper notice.
 
Second, relief is not available
to Defendant pursuant to any of the statutes cited in the Motion because so
much time has passed since the judgment was entered. The deadline under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is six months. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b) [“an application for relief must be made within a reasonable
time, no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought”].) The deadline under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which also
applies to relief sought for improper service under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (d) of a facially valid judgment, is two years after
entry of judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a) [“The notice of motion
shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding
the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or
her”]; Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180 [“Where a
party moves under section 473, subdivision (d) to set aside “a judgment that,
though valid on its face, is void for lack of proper service, the courts have
adopted by analogy the statutory period for relief from a default judgment”
provided by section 473.5, that is, the two-year outer limit.”].)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
418.10 requires a motion to quash be filed within the time to file a responsive
pleading or any later time upon a showing of good cause. (Code Civl Proc., §
418.10, subd. (a) [“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time
to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow,
may serve and file a notice of motion].) Finally, a motion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1788.61 must be brought within six years of entry of default
or default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1788.61, subd. (a)(2)(A).)
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Eric Lopez Estrada’s Motion to Quash
Service, Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.  
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
