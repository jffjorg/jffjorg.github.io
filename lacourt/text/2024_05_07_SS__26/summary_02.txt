And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is that Defendant Edwin Chavez's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is granted. The default entered on January 4, 2024 is vacated. The motion was filed by Defendant Edwin on March 28, 2024, and no opposition was filed in response. The court finds that the motion is timely and that Defendant Edwin has demonstrated excusable neglect in failing to respond to the complaint. The court also notes that the motion is supported by a declaration of fault from Defendant Edwin, who states that he assumed that Defendant Cynthia's answer was sufficient to respond on behalf of both defendants.
