ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Dennis Deleon aka Dennis Martinez (“Defendant Deleon”) and Hertz
Vehicles, LLC (“Defendant Hertz”) on August 11, 2021. Defendant Hertz filed an
answer on December 1, 2021; Defendant DeLeon filed an answer on October 23,
2023. On December 11, 2023, the Court signed the parties’ stipulation to
continue the hearing date from March 11, 2024 to June 11, 2024. (Stip and
Order, 12/11/23.)
 
Following the hearing on
Defendant Hertz’s motion for summary judgment, the Court entered judgment in
its favor on January 5, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/04/24; Judgment, 01/05/24.) Due
to inadvertence, the trial date was not continued and was called on March 11,
2024. When the parties did not appear, the Court dismissed Plaintiff’s
Complaint without prejudice. (Minute Order, 03/11/23.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
April 22, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed less
than two months after dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney
affidavit of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they did not appear for trial
on March 11, 2024 in light of the continuance to June 11, 2024. (Motion, Reese
Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Therefore, the case must be reinstated under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Defendant DeLeon filed an opposition
requesting that the trial date be set for 90-120 days out, or setting a trial
setting conference for June 11, 2024.
