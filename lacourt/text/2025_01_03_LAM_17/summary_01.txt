And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jon R. Takasugi in a lawsuit brought by Lynn Stepanian against RCM Entertainment Services, Inc. and others. The plaintiff alleges various causes of action, including breach of contract, quantum meruit, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendants, including Raven Capital Management, LLC and others, demurred to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, arguing that it was defective and that they are not proper parties to the case. The court rejects these arguments and overrules the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's causes of action are sufficiently pled and that the defendants are proper parties to the case. The court also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged alter-ego liability and that the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff's individual causes of action are insufficiently pled are unpersuasive.
