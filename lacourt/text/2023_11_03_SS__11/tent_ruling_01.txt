TENTATIVE RULING
 
Nasiry’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is moot and/or denied in
full.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The second amended complaint
(“SAC”) alleges that M&N Financing Corp. (“M&N”) and Nasiry “operated a
business that purchased retail installment sales contracts [] from used car
dealerships.”  (Department of Fair
Employment and Housing v. M&N Financing Corp. (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th
434, 437 (“M&N”).)[1]  “In deciding how much to pay for the
contracts, defendants used a formula that considered the gender of the car
purchaser.”  (Id. at 437-438.)  “[D]efendants would pay more for a contract
with a male purchaser than for a contract with a female purchaser or female
coborrower[.]”  (Id. at 438.)
 
In late September 2021, following
summary adjudication and judgment on the pleadings, the Court of Appeal
reinstated the Department’s fifth cause of action.  (See ibid.) 
It was the only cause of action that the Court of Appeal revived.  (See ibid.; see also id. at 443-444, 446.)
 
On August 31, 2023, the
Department dismissed the fifth cause of action without prejudice.
 
On September 19, 2023, Nasiry’s
motion to order the Department to join him to the fifth cause of action as an
indispensable party came on for hearing. 
The Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the
motion.  (See 9/19/23 Minute Order, p.
1.)
 
Now, Nasiry moves for judgment on
the pleadings.[2]
 
DISCUSSION
 
Nasiry asks the Court to dismiss
the entire SAC without leave to amend. 
(See Notice of Motion, p. 2.)
 
The SAC contains nine causes of
action.  (See SAC, ¶¶ 66-138.)  Nasiry is named as a Defendant in the first,
second, third, and fourth causes of action. 
(See id. at ¶¶ 66-111.)  He is not
named in the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth.  (See id. at ¶¶ 112-138)  Five of the claims – the third, fourth,
fifth, eighth, and ninth causes of action – were voluntarily dismissed.  (See M&N, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th
at 439 n.3; see also 8/31/23 Request for Dismissal, p. 1.)
 
Nasiry lacks standing to
challenge the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action given
that he is not a named Defendant.
 
His motion is moot as to the
dismissed claims.  The Court lacks
jurisdiction over the third, fourth, fifth, eighth, and ninth causes of action
by virtue of the voluntary dismissals. 
(See Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before
Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 11:2 [instructing that a
plaintiff’s right to dismiss is absolute “any time before the actual
commencement of trial”]; see also id. at ¶ 11:6 [instructing that “[t]he clerk
of the court has no discretion to refuse to enter the dismissal; and the court
has no power to set it aside against plaintiff’s will”]; id. at ¶¶ 11:3, 11:4
[noting that these rules govern whether the plaintiff dismisses the entire
complaint or just a cause of action and whether the dismissal is with or
without prejudice]; id. at ¶ 11:34 [instructing that “a voluntary dismissal . .
. deprives the court of both subject matter and personal jurisdiction”].)
 
That leaves the first and second
causes of action.  On September 14, 2016,
Judge (now Justice) John Wiley “granted summary adjudication on the first and
second causes of action[.]”  (M&N,
supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at 439.) 
He found that M&N’s and Nasiry’s “conduct violated Civil Code
sections 51 and 51.5 as a matter of law.” 
(Ibid.)  The Court of Appeal
affirmed.  (See id. at 438, 446; see also
Rofael Decl., Ex. 1, pp. 5-15.)
 
Nasiry contends his motion is
timely under Code of Civil Procedure sections 438(f) and 439.  (See Motion, p. 9.)
 
The Department contends the
motion is untimely because the first and second causes of action have already
been adjudicated.  (See Opposition, p. 3
n.3.)
 
The Court agrees with the
Department.  Section 438(f) concerns
statutory motions for judgment on the pleadings.  It provides that “[a] defendant’s
motion . . . may be made after the time to demur and an answer has been
filed.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶
7:279, emphasis in original; see also Code Civ. Proc. § 438, subd. (f)(2).)  The deadline, though, is before “entry of a
pretrial conference order [citations] or 30 days before the initial trial
date (“the date the action is initially set for trial”), whichever is
later.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶
7:280, emphasis in original; see also Code Civ. Proc. § 438, subd. (e); Cal.
Rules of Court, rules 3.720-3.730.) 
Nasiry filed his motion after summary adjudication and appellate
review.  He filed it well beyond the
deadline.[3]
 
Even if the Court were to convert
Nasiry’s motion into a common law motion, it still would be late.  A common law motion “may be made at any time
either prior to the trial or at the trial itself.”  (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100
Cal.App.4th 644, 650; see also Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 7:285
[noting that a common law motion can be filed “shortly before” or “during
trial”].)  In effect, Nasiry waited until
after trial.
 
The motion also fails because
Nasiry requests a result that is inconsistent with the Court of Appeal’s
opinion and that exceeds the scope of the remittitur.  (See Opposition, pp. 2-3.)  To repeat, the Court of Appeal affirmed
summary adjudication of the first and second causes of action. (M&N,
supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at 438, 446; see also Rofael Decl., Ex. 1, pp.
5-15.)  The justices issued their opinion
in September 2021, and the remittitur was issued in December 2021.  The decision is final.  The claims have been finally adjudicated on
the merits, so the Court cannot reopen or retry the case.  (See Eisenberg & Hepler, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civ. Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group November 2022 Update) ¶ 14:2
[noting that “the terms of the remittitur define, and thus can limit, the trial
court’s jurisdiction to act on remand” and that “the trial court is revested
with jurisdiction of the case, but only to carry out the judgment as ordered
by the appellate court”], emphasis in original; see also Griset v. Fair
Political Practices Commission (2001) 25 Cal.4th 688, 701
[instructing that “[t]he lower court cannot reopen the case on the facts, allow
the filing of amended or supplemental pleadings, nor retry the case, and if it
should do so, the judgment rendered thereon would be void”].)    
 
Consequently, the Court finds that Nasiry’s whole motion is
moot and/or should be denied.
