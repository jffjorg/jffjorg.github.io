Nasiry is M&N’s chief executive officer. 
He is representing himself.

The Department claims Nasiry “has filed at least five motions for judgment on
the pleadings.”  (Rofael Decl., ¶
5.)  Judge Amy Hogue (Ret.) denied the
most recent one on January 15, 2019.  She
stated:
 
Although Nasiry
is not a defendant named in any of the remaining causes of action, he has filed
Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings and a Motion to Seal. The Court denies
the Motions because the causes of action against Nasiry have already been
adjudicated and because he is not a party with standing to challenge any of the
remaining causes of action. As a non-party to the remaining claims, Nasiry has
no standing to make any further motions in this Court or to present any
argument. With respect to the remaining claims, Nasiry is, at this point, a
witness or a corporate representative.
 
(Id. at
Ex. 4, p. 1.)

Section 439 does not help Nasiry.  It
requires the moving party to meet and confer with the opposing party prior to
filing a statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 439.)  It does not change the deadline.
