Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case BC591206, in which Nasiry is moving for judgment on the pleadings. The Judge has found that Nasiry's motion is moot and/or denied in full. The Judge has determined that Nasiry lacks standing to challenge the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action, as he is not a named defendant in those causes of action. Additionally, the Judge has found that the first and second causes of action have already been adjudicated, and the Court cannot reopen or retry the case. The Judge has also determined that Nasiry's motion is untimely, as it was filed after summary adjudication and appellate review.
