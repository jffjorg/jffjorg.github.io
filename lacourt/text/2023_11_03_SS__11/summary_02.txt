And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case involving Nasiry, the CEO of M&N, who is representing himself. Nasiry has filed at least five motions for judgment on the pleadings, but Judge Amy Hogue (Ret.) denied the most recent one on January 15, 2019. The judge found that Nasiry has no standing to challenge the remaining causes of action because he is not a party to the claims. According to Section 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the moving party must meet and confer with the opposing party before filing a statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings, but this does not change the deadline. The judge concludes that Nasiry's motions are without merit and that he has no further standing to make motions in the court or present arguments.
