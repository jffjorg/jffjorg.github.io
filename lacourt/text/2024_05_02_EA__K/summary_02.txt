And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by FMC, which was originally set for hearing on March 4, 2024. However, the hearing was continued to May 2, 2024, after a notice was filed on February 9, 2024. The judge notes that FMC's assertion that the Plaintiff's Complaint only alleges transmission defects in vehicles not the same year or model as the Subject Vehicle (a 2020 Ford Explorer) ignores allegations in the Complaint regarding Ford F-150s and Ford Raptors. The judge also references Paragraphs 28 and 73 of the Complaint, which discuss the issuance of Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) 18-2079 regarding 2017 F-150 vehicles. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that FMC's argument is flawed and may be rejected.
