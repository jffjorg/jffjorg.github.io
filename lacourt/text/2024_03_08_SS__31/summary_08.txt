Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to compel the defendants to appear for their depositions. The plaintiff had noticed the defendants' depositions for November 14, 2023, but the defendants failed to appear. Despite the plaintiff's attempts to contact the defendants' counsel, no explanation was provided for their failure to appear. The Court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's declaration complies with the requirements of CCP § 2025.450(b)(2) and that the defendants have failed to serve any valid objections to the deposition notices. The Court orders the defendants to appear for their depositions within 15 days and to pay $1,619.75 in sanctions to the plaintiff.
