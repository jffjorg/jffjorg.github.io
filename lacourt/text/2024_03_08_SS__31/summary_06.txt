And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the plaintiff's action against the defendant. The defendant had requested the motion due to the plaintiff's failure to serve verified discovery responses in compliance with a court order. The plaintiff had failed to serve responses and had not opposed the motion. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel had expressed difficulty in communicating with the plaintiff and had requested to be relieved as counsel. The judge denied the defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions, finding that the imposition of terminating sanctions was sufficient to meet the ends of justice.
