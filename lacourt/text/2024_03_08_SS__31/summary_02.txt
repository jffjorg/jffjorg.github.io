The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint filed by Keith L. Morgan against Independent Taxi Owners Associations and Hamidereza Eghbalpour. The complaint was filed on April 29, 2021, and was dismissed without prejudice on October 27, 2022. The Judge finds that the dismissal was caused by the mistake of the plaintiff's counsel, who mistakenly marked the plaintiff's file as settled/closed, and that the counsel has taken full responsibility for the mistake. The Judge also finds that the counsel has failed to serve the defendants, and sets an order to show cause re: dismissal for failure to file proofs of service. The counsel is required to appear at the order to show cause and provide evidence of service or why service has not occurred. If the counsel fails to appear and file proper proof of service, the action may be dismissed.
