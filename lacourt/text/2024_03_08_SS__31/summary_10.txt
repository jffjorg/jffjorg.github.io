Significant Statements: 
- "For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response." (Leach v. Superior Court)
- "A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 2030.290, subd. (a); ยง 2031.300, subd. (a))
- "The Court is guided by Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal. App.4th 651, which stands for the proposition that omission of the verification portion of the response containing fact-specific responses merely renders that portion of the response untimely and therefore creates a right to move for orders and sanctions as to those responses, but does not result in a waiver of objections made."

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses Defendant 21ST CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY's motions to compel Plaintiff Samuel Yun to respond to discovery requests, including request for production of documents (RPDs) and form interrogatories. The Defendant propounded these requests in October and December 2022, but Plaintiff's counsel served unverified responses. The Defendant has not received verified responses, despite multiple requests. The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to serve timely and verified responses, and therefore grants the motion in part, ordering Plaintiff to serve verifications to the outstanding discovery requests within 15 days. The Court also awards sanctions against Plaintiff and their attorney, jointly and severally, in the amount of $480, payable within 20 days.
