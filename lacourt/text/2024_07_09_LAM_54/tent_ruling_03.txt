Hearing Date: July 9, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion To Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production of Documents
Moving Party:
Plaintiff Fernando Garcia-Sotelo
Responding Party:
Defendant Volkswagen Group of America
 
T/R:     THE MOTION IS GRANTED IN PART.
 
PLAINTIFF TO GIVE
NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:30 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
            The Court
considers the moving papers, opposition and reply. 
 
This is a lemon law case. Plaintiff Fernando Garcia-Sotelo sued
defendant Volkswagen Group of America on July 26, 2023, for violations of the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant to provide further responses to his
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One). 
 
 
            Plaintiff
moves for further responses to his RPDs Nos. 16-21. Generally, those requests
seek:
 



16


Documents
  “concerning or relating to any internal analysis or investigation” of the
  defect Plaintiff alleges in her vehicle (“the Electrical Defect”), in
  vehicles of the same year, make, and model of the subject Vehicle
  (“equivalent vehicles”). (DSS, 2:3-11.)




17


Documents
  “concerning or relating to any communications” Defendant “ha[s] had”
  regarding the Electrical Defect in equivalent vehicles. (DSS, 17:9-12.)




18


Documents
  “concerning or relating to any decision” to issue “notices, letters,
  campaigns, warranty extensions, technical service bulletins and recalls”
  concerning the Electrical Defect in equivalent vehicles.
  (DSS, 25:12-15.)




19


Documents
  “concerning” customer complaints, reported failures, and warranty claims
  “related to” the Electrical Defect in equivalent vehicles. (DSS, 33:22-28.)




20


Documents
  “concerning failure rates” in equivalent vehicles “as a result of” the
  Electrical Defect in the Vehicle. (DSS, 42:12-14.)




21


Documents
  “concerning or relating to any fixes for” the Electrical Defect in equivalent
  vehicles. (DSS, 50:23-25.)



 
Although Defendant provided
partial responses to each RPD, each response was accompanied by various
boilerplate objections including overbreadth, vagueness, undue burden, seeking
information outside the bounds of discoverability, failure to identify
categories of documents with particularity, intrusion on confidential
information, and attorney-client or attorney work-product privilege.
 
            Plaintiff’s
requests are standard lemon law discovery. Defendant’s objections largely lack
merit. Defendant also has not provided any clear statement that conforms to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.240. That said, in certain areas
Defendant’s overbreadth and vagueness objections well-taken.  
 
            The
motion is granted as to RPD 16.
 
            The
motion is denied in its entirety as to RPD 17 and 18.
 
            As
to RPDs 19-21, Plaintiff’s motion granted only as to vehicles of the same make,
model, and year sold in California. 
 
With each response, Defendant
must provide a sworn statement stating its compliance according to sections
2031.220, 2031.230, or 2031.240 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
 
Sanctions have not been requested
and are not awarded.
