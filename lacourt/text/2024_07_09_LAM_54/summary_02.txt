And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, represented by Central Realty Inc. dba Coldwell Banker Hallmark Realty, Sevada Mkrdichian, Redfin Corporation, and Alin Glogovicean, have applied for approval of their good faith settlement with the plaintiff, Adam Amer. After extensive negotiations, the parties agreed to settle for $30,000, with the defendants admitting no fault and stating that the settlement is proportionate to their potential share of liability. Since no opposition was filed, the court has reviewed the moving papers and finds that the settlement is in good faith. Therefore, the defendants' motion to determine good faith settlement is granted.
