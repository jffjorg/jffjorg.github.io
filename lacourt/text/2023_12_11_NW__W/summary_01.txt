Significant Statements:
  - "Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits." (CRC Rule 3.1332(c))
  - "The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance." (CRC Rule 3.1332(c))
  - "We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely motions." (Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 919)
  - "The court finds there is good cause to continue trial. In this case, Northridge Specialty Imaging has timely filed its motion for summary judgment, but Northridge Specialty Imaging’s inability to have the motion heard is due to the court’s calendar."
