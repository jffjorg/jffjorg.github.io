And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Hudson Insurance Company, is entitled to be discharged from liability on the bond. The bond was issued to Donada Group, Inc. in the sum of $50,000, but has been reduced to $43,000 after Hudson paid $7,000 to resolve one lawsuit. The judge has ordered Hudson to deposit the remaining bond funds with the court, and once deposited, Hudson will be exonerated as a surety and discharged of liability on the bond.

The judge has also granted Hudson's request to restrain all parties from pursuing further claims related to the bond. Hudson is entitled to its reasonable court costs of $519.40, which will be disbursed from the remaining bond funds. Finally, the judge has ordered that the remainder of the proceeds be disbursed upon further order and at the direction of the court.
