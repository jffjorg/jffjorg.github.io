BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Hudson Insurance Company (Plaintiff) provided
Donada Group, Inc. (Donada), a motor vehicle dealer, with a dealer surety bond,
a prerequisite to having a dealership license, which allowed Donada to operate
and sell vehicles. (Mot. p. 3.) The bond went into effect on May 2, 2018. (Mot
p. 3.) Under the Vehicle Code, if a car dealership’s license is suspended, the
surety bond is liable for the dealership’s misconduct. (Vehicle Code §§
11710(b)-(c); 11711(a).)
 
On July 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
defendants Eugene Ndede and Feliciano Torres-Ramirez (Defendants) for (1)
interpleader and (2) injunctive relief. Plaintiff alleges it paid one of the
three claims before it became aware of the other claims and therefore only
$43,000 remains of the $50,000 Bond. (Compl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff named Jorge
Herrera and Eleyana Guidry as defendants Doe 1 and Doe 2, respectively.
 
On December 8, 2021, defendant Torres-Ramirez filed a
lawsuit against Donada and Plaintiff for (1) Violation of Consumer Legal
Remedies Act at Civ. C § 1770 et seq; (2) negligent misrepresentation; and (3)
bond liability. (Klitzke Decl., Exh. 1.) On January 31, 2022, Mitch Borja filed
a lawsuit against Donada and Plaintiff for (1) intentional misrepresentation;
(2) negligent misrepresentation; (3) breach of written contract; (4) violation
of Business and Professions Code § 17200; (5) bond claim; and (6) violation of
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. (Klitzke Decl., Exh. 2.) On March 22, 2022,
defendant Eugene Ndede (Defendant) filed a lawsuit against Donada and Plaintiff
in Los Angeles County Superior Court Case no. 22STCV09744 for (1) violation of
the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code § 1750, et seq.; (2) fraud &
deceit; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) civil theft (violation of Penal
Code § 496); (5) violation of Vehicle Code § 5753; (6) violation of the Unfair
Competition Law, Business & Professions Code § 17200, et seq.; and (7)
violation of Vehicle Code § 11711. (Klitzke Decl., Exh. 3.) That action and the
instant were related on August 8, 2023.
 
Plaintiff obtained entry of default against Jorge Herrera on
May 12, 2023.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
Plaintiff’s Motion for Exoneration is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
Hudson Insurance Company moves the court for an order (1) discharging Plaintiff
from all liability to all parties in this action, and to any other claimant
with reference to Bond No. 10073684 issued on behalf of Donada Group, Inc.
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §996.490(a);  (2) restraining all parties to this action
from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding in any other court
in the State of California, or any other jurisdiction, affecting the rights and
obligations between the parties to this interpleader as to the Bond funds; (3) dismissing
Hudson with prejudice from the instant action and from any legal actions
pending against the proceeds of said Bond, including LASC Case No. 22STCV09774
(Eugene Ndede v. Donada Group Inc., et al.); (4) awarding Hudson its reasonable
court costs of $519.40 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §386.6, which shall be
disbursed to Hudson from the remaining Bond funds; and (5) that the remainder
of the proceeds pending the outcome of this litigation, be disbursed upon
further order and at the direction of this Court.
 
“Performance
of the principal obligation, or an offer of such performance, duly made as provided
in this code, exonerates a surety.” (Civ. Code, § 2839.) “Payment by a surety
of the amount of a bond constitutes a full discharge of all the liability of
the surety on the bond.” (CCP § 996.490(a).)
 
Plaintiff Hudson Insurance Company has provided
authority that, as required by California Vehicle Code §11710 (a), Donada Group,
Inc. obtained the bond that is the subject of the complaint in this action as
well as LASC Case No. 22STCV09774 in the penal sum of s $50,000, which was
reduced to $43,000 after Hudson paid $7,000 from the bond to resolve one
lawsuit (LASC Case No. 22STCV03029). Plaintiff contends Hudson is unable to
determine the validity of the respective claims and rights to the remaining
$43,000 on the Bond and may be exposed to multiple liabilities if it delivers
the remaining penal sum of the Bond to Mr. Ndede, or Mr. Torres-Ramirez, or Ms.
Guidry, or any other claimant. Hudson asserts that it is in the process of
depositing the $43,000 bond funds with the court, and requests a court order
determining to whom the money is owed, and a finding that Hudson is discharged from
its obligations under the Bond under Code of Civil Procedure §386(b).
 
Hudson
is ordered to deposit the funds with the court. Once deposited, Hudson is
exonerated as a surety, and discharged of liability on the bond.
 
Next,
“[w]here the only relief sought against one of the defendants is the payment of
a stated amount of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld, such defendant may,
upon affidavit that he is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount or
any portion thereof and that conflicting demands have been made upon him for
the amount by parties to the action, upon notice to such parties, apply to the
court for an order discharging him from liability and dismissing him from the
action on his depositing with the clerk of the court the amount in dispute and
the court may, in its discretion, make such order.” (CCP § 386.5.) A party who
follows the procedure under Code of Civil Procedure, section 386.5, may request
costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the action, which the court may
award from the amount in dispute that has been deposited with the court. (CCP §¿386.6(a).)
 
Hudson
has provided the required affidavit with the Court and seeks dismissal and
discharge. (See Gascou Decl.) Hudson is entitled to their request of costs for $519.40
($435 for the filing fee and $84.40 for service).  Additionally, Hudson is entitled to an order
restraining all parties “from instituting or further prosecuting any other
proceeding” related to Hudson’s rights and obligations under the
bond. (CCP §386(f).) 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED.
