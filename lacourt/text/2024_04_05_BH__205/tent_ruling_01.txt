PIERRE CALAND,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
ALEXANDER J. DAVIS, et al.,
                        Defendants.


  Case No.: 21SMCV01083
  Hearing Date: 4/5/24
  Trial Date: 9/30/24   
 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
MOTION TO SEAL 



 
Background
 
This case arises
from a breach of contract claim. On June 18, 2021, Plaintiff Pierre Caland
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Alexander J. Davis
(“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 10. On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant alleging causes of
action for: (1) breach of oral agreement; (2) promissory estoppel; (3)
accounting; (4) conversion; (5) equitable lien; and (6) constructive trust. 
On February 26,
2024, Defendant filed an ex parte application for trial continuance. In
support of the ex parte application, Defendant provided a declaration
from his counsel, Michael D. Mulvaney (“Mulvaney”). On that date, Defendant
lodged the unredacted declaration of Mulvaney and its accompanying exhibit in
support of the ex parte application conditionally under seal with the
Court. 
Also, on February
26, 2024, Defendant filed and served the instant unopposed Motion to Seal the
Declaration of Mulvaney in support of Defendant’s ex parte application.
The motion is made on the grounds that Mulvaney’s declaration in support of the
ex parte application contains sensitive, private medical information
about Defendant. 
On February 27,
2024, after an in-chambers review, the Court granted Defendant’s ex parte application
to continue trial. (02/27/24 Minute Order.) Jury trial was continued from April
15, 2024 to September 30, 2024. (02/27/24 Minute Order.)  
Legal Standard/Applicable Law
 
            “[S]ubject to
certain exceptions . . . a court record must not be filed under seal without a
court order.” (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 486.) “A party requesting that a record be
filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing the
record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration
containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.” (Id.) “In doing so, the moving party must lodge with the court the
record for which the sealing order is sought. The court holds the record
conditionally under seal until it rules on the motion or application.” (Id.
at p. 486-487.)    
            In order for
records to be sealed, “a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find
that (i) there exists an overriding interest supporting closure and/or sealing;
(ii) there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced
absent closure and/or sealing; (iii) the proposed closure and/or sealing is
narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest; and (iv) there is no less
restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.” (Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th
1273, 1279.) “Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are
presumed to be open.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.550(c).) “Since court
records are public records, the burden rests on the party seeking to deny
public access to those records to establish compelling reasons why and to what
extent these records should be made private.” (Mary R. v. B. & R. Corp.
(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 308, 317.) 
            “[A] person’s
medical history . . . falls within the zone of informational privacy protected
by the state and federal Constitutions.” (Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211
Cal.App.4th 1036, 1068.) Medical records are deemed “as
presumptively private.” (Id. at p. 1070.) “The public, through tis
courts and legislatures, has recognized that medical records are
constitutionally private and statutorily confidential.” (Ibid.) 
Analysis
 
In support of the motion, Defendant provides a declaration
from his counsel, Robert E. Hess (“Hess”). On February 26, 2024, Defendant
filed an unopposed ex parte application for a trial continuance. (Hess
Decl., ¶ 2.) Mulvaney submitted a declaration in support of the application in
which Mulvaney discusses Defendant’s recent traumatic brain injury, its related
effects on Defendant’s medical condition, and Defendant’s ability to prepare
for and attend trial. (Hess Decl., ¶ 2.) The Mulvaney declaration also attaches
a letter from Defendant’s treating physician that discusses his injury and
provides standard recommended accommodations. (Hess Decl., ¶ 2.) The Mulvaney
declaration contains Defendant’s private, sensitive, and confidential medical
information, and Defendant does not wish for the information to be made public
generally or to be part of the public court record. (Hess Decl., ¶ 3.) Given
the sensitive information discussed in the Mulvaney declaration, Defendant
requests that the Mulvaney declaration (including its attachment) be sealed
from the public court file. (Hess Decl., ¶ 4.)
The Court finds that Defendant has stated sufficient facts
to justify sealing. Defendant only seeks to seal the Mulvaney declaration in
support of Defendant’s ex parte application and the attached
medical record thereto. Defendant has a right of privacy in his medical records.
The Court finds that Defendant has an interest in his medical privacy, which is
not connected to the allegations of the complaint or the operative FAC in this
action. Defendant does not have to “state the obvious in a declaration, that
[he] would be personally embarrassed to have [his] medical records copied into
court records.” (Oiye v. Fox, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th 1036,
1070.)
Moreover, given
that the motion is unopposed, there is an inference that the motion is
meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
1403, 1410.)    
 
 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Seal the Declaration of
Michael D. Mulvaney filed in support of the Ex Parte Application for
Trial Continuance.
