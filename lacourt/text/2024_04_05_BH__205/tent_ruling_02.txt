  Hearing Date: 4/5/24
  Trial Date: N/A   
 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS POST JUDGMENT 



 
Background
 
This action arises
from the breach of a lease agreement concerning rental property located at 10000
Santa Monica Boulevard, Unit 3403, Los Angeles, California 90067 (the “Subject
Property”). On December 23, 2021, Plaintiff SM 10000 Property, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Cristina Pecci (“Pecci”),
Justin Ligeri (“Ligeri”), Cheyenne Brands, L.L.C. (“Cheynne”), and DOES 1
through 100, for breach of contract. 
On July 19, 2022,
Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) in unlawful detainer against
Defendants Cristina Pecci, Justin Ligeri, Cheyenne Brands L.L.C., Emily
Muradyan, Larisa Pogosyan, and DOES 1 to 10, which arises from the failure of
Defendants to pay rent pursuant to the lease agreement between the parties. 
On May 17, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against
Defendants Pecci, Ligeri, and Cheyenne, alleging a single cause of action for
breach of contract. 
On December 11,
2023, non-jury trial commenced with only Defendant Pecci appearing at trial.
(See 12/11/23 and 02/09/24 Minute Orders.) Defendant Ligeri did not appear at
trial and Defendant Cheyenne was in default and did not appear. (02/09/24
Minute Order.) On February 9, 2024, the Court issued an order regarding its finding
of facts and conclusions of law and statement of decision. (02/09/24 Minute
Order.) The Court found that Plaintiff proved all the elements of its claims
for breach of contract. (02/09/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court awarded
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants Pecci, Ligeri, and
Cheyenne, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $446,992.91. (02/09/24
Minute Order at p. 5.) 
On March 5, 2024,
the Court entered judgment in this matter in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendants Pecci, Ligeri, and Cheyenne. 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed and served a memorandum of costs, in which Plaintiff seeks costs in the
amount of $7,653.16. 
On March 7, 2024,
Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
Post Judgment. Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of
$17,653.16. The motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff is the prevailing
party in this action and the lease agreement between the parties provides for
the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party. 
On March 18, 2024,
Defendant Pecci filed an opposition to the motion, to which Plaintiff replied
on March 27, 2024. 
Legal Standard/Applicable Law
 
            “In any action on
a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (a).) “Where a
contract provides for attorney’s fees . . . that provision shall be construed
as applying to the entire contract, unless each party was represented by
counsel in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and the fact of that
representation is specified in the contract.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (a).) 
            A prevailing
party is “the party with a net monetary recovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).) “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)    
Analysis
 
In support of the motion, Plaintiff presents the
declaration of Nicole Browne (“Browne”), who provides a copy of the lease
agreement giving rise to this action. (Browne Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. 1.) Paragraph 34
of the lease agreement provides that “[i]n the event of any litigation to
enforce this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
reasonable attorney’s fees, not to exceed a total of ten thousand dollars
($10,000), and its costs of litigation.” (Browne Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. 1 at ¶ 34.)

Plaintiff’s counsel, Thomas F. Olsen (“Olsen”), declares
that on December 11, 2024, trial in this matter was held. (Olsen Decl., ¶ 5.) The
Court issued its minute order on February 9, 2024, which contained the Court’s
finding of facts and conclusions of law. (Olsen Decl., ¶ 5.) To date, Plaintiff
has incurred $93,675.00 in attorneys’ fees and $7,653.16 in costs for bringing
this action to enforce the lease. (Olsen Decl., ¶ 6.) Counsel declares that the
fees and costs are current as of February 14, 2024, with the exception of
$195.50 in attorneys’ fees that have not yet been billed. (Olsen Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s
attorneys’ fees and costs include litigation and motion practice such as
bringing this action, a fully briefed and litigated motion for summary
judgment, discovery motions, and by trial in this matter wherein judgment was
entered in favor of Plaintiff. (Olsen Decl., ¶ 6.) Counsel provides billing
invoices pertaining to tasks completed in this action. (Olsen Decl., ¶ 6; Exhs.
1-1.22.) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in
this action as judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendants Ligeri, Pecci, and Cheyenne. The lease agreement giving rise to this
action explicitly states that the prevailing party shall be entitled to
attorneys’ fees in an amount not to exceed $10,000.00, as well as its costs of
litigation. Counsel has provided billing records substantiating the work done
in this action.  
Defendant Pecci’s sole argument in opposition to the motion
is that Plaintiff filed its motion for attorneys’ fees and costs before entry
of judgment. (See Opp’n at p. 1: 23-25.) The Court finds that such contention
is misplaced. Plaintiff filed the instant motion after judgment was entered. Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs is therefore timely under California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1700(a)(1). 
Defendant Pecci has not presented any substantive argument
in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. Defendant Pecci has not presented any
legal authority to rebut Plaintiff’s contention that it is entitled to
attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to the lease agreement. Defendant Pecci does
not dispute the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees and
costs. “Contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned
argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Post Judgment. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Post
Judgment.
