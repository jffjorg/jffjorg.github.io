And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to seal a declaration filed in support of an ex parte application for a trial continuance. The declaration contains sensitive and confidential medical information about the defendant, including information about his recent traumatic brain injury and its related effects on his medical condition. The judge finds that the defendant has stated sufficient facts to justify sealing the declaration, citing the defendant's right to privacy in his medical records. The judge notes that the defendant only seeks to seal the declaration and its attachment, and that the motion is unopposed, which suggests that the motion is meritorious. The judge concludes that the declaration and its attachment should be sealed from the public court file.
