And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order denying their motion to set aside entry of default. The defendants argue that the court's order was made in error and that they have new evidence that was not presented at the earlier hearing. However, the court finds that the defendants have not shown a basis for reconsideration and that their motion is procedurally defective. The court also notes that the defendants' contention that the court denied their motion based on the lack of a proposed answer is incorrect. The court denied the defendants' motion to set aside entry of default based on the defendants' motion failing to meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(d). The court further finds that the defendants have failed to provide any explanation as to why the critical fact of the photo documentation was not presented to the court at an earlier time.
