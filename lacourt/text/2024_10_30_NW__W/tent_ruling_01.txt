[Tentative] Ruling

Relief Petitioner from Provisions of Government Code section 945.4 is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Jae Hoon Chung moves this court for an
order relieving Petitioner from the provisions of Government Code section 945.4
to allow Petitioner to file a civil action against Respondent, City of Los
Angeles. Chung makes the motion on the grounds that Petitioner’s failure to
present a claim within the 6-month period provided by Government Code section
911.2 was the result of the inadvertence, excusable neglect and mistake of
Petitioner’s counsel who failed to timely present such claim.
 
Before a suit for damages may be filed
against a public entity, a claimant must present a timely written claim to the
public entity and the claim must have been acted upon by the board or deemed
rejected.¿ (Gov. Code § 945.4; Munoz v. State of Cal. (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1767, 1777.)¿ A claim relating to a cause of action for injury to
person or personal property must be presented to the public entity not later
than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.¿ (Gov. Code § 911.2; Munoz,
supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1777.)¿ 
 
If a claimant fails to present a claim
within the statutory period, he may apply “within a reasonable time not to
exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action” to the public entity
for leave to present a late claim.¿ (Gov. Code § 911.4.)¿ If the public entity
denies leave to present a late claim, a claimant may petition the Court under
Government Code section 946.6 for relief from the requirements of Government
Code section 945.4.¿ (Munoz, supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at p.
1777.)¿ 
 
The excusable neglect standard assumes
that there has been some sort of inattention or carelessness and asks “whether
a reasonably prudent person might have made the same error under the same or
similar circumstances.”¿ (Munoz, supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1783
(citations omitted).)¿ In applying this standard, a court must also examine
whether the party or her counsel were “otherwise diligent in investigating and
pursuing the claim.”¿ (Id. at pp. 1782-1783; see also Dep't of Water
& Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal. App. 4th 1288, 1293.)¿ Once
the petitioner meets the prima facie burden, the burden shifts to the entity to
establish it would be prejudiced in its defense if the petition as granted. (Dep't
of Water & Power, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 1297.) If the
petitioner fails to meet the prima facie burden, prejudice to the entity is
irrelevant and the petition must be denied. (Black v. County of Los Angeles
(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 670, 678.)
 
On February 25, 2023, when Petitioner
was operating his motor vehicle on Huston Street, a tree fell onto Petitioner’s
vehicle causing him to suffer personal injuries. (Hoffman Decl. ¶3.) Counsel
for Petitioner mistakenly assumed the location of the tree was on premises at 13456
Huston Street, on the north side of Huston Street, whereas the subject tree was
actually located on the south side of Huston Street. (Hoffman Decl. ¶¶3, 4.) After
learning of the mistake and after contacting the correct property owner, the
correct property owner notified Petitioner’s counsel that the City of Los
Angeles controlled the subject tree though an easement on the property.
(Hoffman Decl. ¶7.) This notification by the property owner of the City of Los
Angeles’ easement was first discovered more than six months following the
incident. (Hoffman Decl. ¶¶5-7.) Counsel for Petitioner did not receive actual
notice of the easement until February 24, 2024. (Hoffman Decl. ¶¶6-7.) 
 
In opposition, the City argues the
court lacks jurisdiction because the underlying application was made more than one
year after accrual of Petitioner’s claim. As noted above, if a claimant fails
to present a claim within the statutory period, he may apply “within a
reasonable time not to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of
action” to the public entity for leave to present a late claim.  (Gov.
Code § 911.4.) The City argues the tree-falling incident allegedly occurred on
February 25, 2023 and the application for leave to present a late claim was
presented to the City more than one year later, on February 26, 2024. Because
the application was not made within one year of the date of accrual of
Petitioner’s claim, the court is without jurisdiction to grant the requested
relief. (Munoz, supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1779.)
 
The court disagrees. As noted by
Petitioner, since the one-year period fell on a Sunday, Petitioner had until
Monday, February 26, 2024 to file the application. Code of Civil Procedure
section 12a provides “If the last day for the performance of any act provided
or required by law to be performed within a specified period of time is a
holiday, then that period is hereby extended to and including the next day that
is not a holiday.” “Holiday” includes every Sunday within its meaning. (CCP
¶10.) As a result, the latest Petitioner could file was the next day, February
26, 2024. Petitioner did so. 
 
Next, the City argues the Petition must
still be denied because there is no evidence that Petitioner exercised
reasonable diligence in pursuit of his claim during the claims presentation
period. The City contends “[r]elief on grounds of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or excusable neglect is available only on a showing that the claimant’s failure to timely present a
claim was reasonable when tested by the objective ‘reasonably prudent person’
standard.” (Dep't of Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000)
82 Cal. App. 4th 1288, 1293.)¿ In this case, the City argues, there is no
evidence identifying any action taken by the Petitioner or his counsel during
the six-month claims presentation period to determine which entities may have
responsibility for the tree that fell on Petitioner’s vehicle. Even though
Petitioner’s counsel believed the tree fell on Petitioner’s vehicle in another
location, City states “California courts have repeatedly held that the failure
of a claimant or claimant’s attorney to identify the owner of a governmental
facility is not excusable neglect.” (See Life v. County of Los Angeles
(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 894, 900-901; DeYoung v. Del Mar Thoroughbred Club
(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 858, 864-865; Shank v. County of Los Angeles
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 152, 157; Black v. County of Los Angeles (1970) 12
Cal.App.3d 670, 676-677.) 
 
The court disagrees. In DeYoung,
counsel relied on an adversary’s assurance that the responsible party was one
other than the State. The Court of Appeal found it unreasonable for counsel to
rely on this statement. Similarly, in Black v. County of Los Angeles
(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 670, Plaintiff’s counsel did not investigate the condition
of the road after he was retained by a wife whose husband was killed in an
automobile accident. Had he done any investigation rather than rely on the
wife’s statements of where the accident occurred, he would have discovered the
potential claim against the county. 
 
Here, Counsel testifies he did
investigate the claim. During that investigation, it was discovered that the
tree was actually located at another premises. Once in contact with the actual
owner of the property, the actual owner disclosed to him that the City retained
an easement over that portion of the property where the fallen tree was
located. (Hoffman Decl. ¶7.) That following Monday, Counsel presented the late
claim to the City. Although Counsel’s declaration is vague as to how or when it
was finally discovered Plaintiff had the wrong premises, “these omissions do
not by themselves provide a proper basis for denying relief. Although counsel's
declaration could have been more specific, any doubts must be resolved in favor
of granting relief.” (Bettencourt v. Los Rios Community College Dist.
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 280.) The court also notes the cited above language by
the City is not from any of the cases cited by the City.
 
Lastly, the City argues they would be
prejudiced by the granting of the petition on the grounds the City was deprived
of the opportunity to engage in an early investigation, including
identification of potential witnesses, or consider early settlement of Petitioner’s
claim because he failed to present a timely claim and the application for late
claim was submitted more than one year after the alleged incident. The court
finds the City has failed to show prejudice. The City does not provide why they
cannot locate the witnesses now or consider settlement. 
 
Accordingly, Petition to Relief Petitioner from Provisions of Government Code section
945.4 is GRANTED.
