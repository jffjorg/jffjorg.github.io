And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Philip Chatalos's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Trinhnology, Howard Quoc Trinh, Cloud & Sky Enterprises, and Does 1-50. The cross-complaint alleges breach of contract and violation of the California Independent Wholesale Sales Representative Contractual Relations Act. The judge has determined that Chatalos is acting in good faith and has granted the motion. The court has not received any timely opposition from Trinhnology. The ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 426.50, which allows a defendant to file a cross-complaint at any time before the court has set a date for trial. The judge has also considered the liberality conferred upon the trial courts by the section and prior law. The ruling is intended to rectify Chatalos's earlier error in failing to file the cross-complaint when he filed his answer.
