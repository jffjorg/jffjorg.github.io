And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the demurrers filed by defendants Satish Mahajan, Humble Retailers, Inc., and Mennu Mahajan to the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The defendants' counsel is ordered to meet and confer with the plaintiffs' counsel regarding the demurrers and file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing. The judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, as the meet and confer declaration filed by the defendants' counsel does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a).
