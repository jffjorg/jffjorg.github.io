 Hearing
  Date:  August 8, 2024



 
Defendants Gregory Peck’s and Otis Partners, LLC’s demurrer to
Plaintiff Sitrick Group, LLC’s second amended complaint
is overruled.
 
          Defendants Gregory Peck (“Peck”) and
Otis Partners, LLC (“Otis”) (collectively, “Defendants”) demur to the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd causes of action in the second amended complaint (“SAC”) of Plaintiff
Sitrick Group, LLC (“Sitrick”) (“Plaintiff”). 
(Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10(d), (e).)  
 
          Request for Judicial Notice
          Defendants’ 6/21/24 request for
judicial notice of the letter fee agreement of Sitrick and Company, a unit of
Sitrick Group, LLC, addressed to attorney Marc Kasowitz, and signed by Michael
Sitrick, Marc Kasowitz, and Peck, dated May 2, 2019, is granted.  (D-RJN, Exh. A.)
 
          Background
          On March 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed its
initial Complaint against Defendants.  On
September 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint (“FAC”).  On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
operative SAC against Defendants, alleging three causes of action: (1)
intentional misrepresentation [against Peck]; (2) negligent
misrepresentation [against Peck]; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty [against
Defendants].
          Plaintiff alleges Peck is, directly or
indirectly, a member of Woodstock 50 LLC (“Woodstock 50”).  (SAC ¶6.) 
Plaintiff alleges Woodstock 50 was formed to produce a music festival
marking the fifty-year anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival held in
Woodstock, New York.  (SAC ¶6.)  Plaintiff alleges Woodstock 50 and Dentsu, a
Japanese advertising company, teamed up to produce the festival.  (SAC ¶6.) 

          Plaintiff alleges disputes arose between
Woodstock 50 and Dentsu concerning the production of the music festival.  (SAC ¶7.) 
Plaintiff alleges Dentsu withdrew from the production and claimed that
the music festival had been cancelled.  (SAC
¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges litigation ensued
in the State of New York between Woodstock 50 and Dentsu.  (SAC ¶7.) 

          Plaintiff alleges Sitrick is one of
the premiere public relations/crisis management firms in America.  (SAC ¶8.) 
Plaintiff alleges on May 4, 2019, Michael Sitrick (“M. Sitrick”), the
chairman, CEO and founder of Sitrick,
received an email
from attorney Marc Kasowitz (“Kasowitz”) of Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, a New
York City based law firm representing Sitrick in the dispute with Dentsu.  (SAC ¶8.) 
Plaintiff alleges Kasowitz wanted to set up a call with M. Sitrick “in
the Woodstock 50 matter” for Sunday, May 5, 2019. (SAC ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges M. Sitrick responded in the
affirmative and a call was set for May 5, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. Pacific.  (FAC ¶8.)
          Plaintiff alleges Kasowitz sent an
email on May 4, 2019, to Peck and Susan Cronin (“Cronin”), copied to M. Sitrick,
in which he wrote: “Greg and Susan, please meet Mike Sitrick, the beat [sic]
crisis/pr guy in the business. Let’s do a call with him tomorrow about joining
the team, 11 am/2 pm est. We will circulate a call-in. We can discuss social
media and the proposed release, which we will send to him.”  (SAC ¶8.)
          Plaintiff On Sunday, May 5, 2019, at
11:00 a.m. Pacific, a conference call was held among Kasowitz, Peck, Cronin,
and M. Sitrick.  (SAC ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges M. Sitrick participated in
the call from his home in Los Angeles, California and is informed and believes
that Kasowitz participated from his New York residence and that Peck and Cronin
participated from their respective residences in Los Angeles, California.  (SAC ¶9.) 
Plaintiff alleges Kasowitz introduced Peck to M. Sitrick as the managing
member of Woodstock 50, and during the call the dispute between Woodstock 50 and
Dentsu was discussed and M. Sitrick made suggestions as to how to manage the
public relations crisis.  (SAC ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges M. Sitrick said in this
call that the Sitrick professionals charged between $195 and $1,200 per hour
for their services, depending on the person performing the services.  (SAC ¶9.) 
Plaintiff alleges M. Sitrick said in this call that Sitrick required a
non-refundable retainer of $60,000 as a minimum annual fee and that Sitrick’s
invoices would likely exceed the retainer due to the anticipated work on behalf
of Woodstock 50.  (SAC ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges Peck said in response to M.
Sitrick’s statement that such financial arrangements were fine, no problem for Woodstock
50.  (SAC ¶9.)
          Plaintiff alleges following the May 5,
2019, conference call, M. Sitrick emailed Sitrick’s standard engagement
agreement dated May 2, 2019, to Kasowitz.   (SAC ¶10.) 
Plaintiff alleges in the public relations/crisis management business,
speed is everything; thus, in reliance upon and believing Peck’s express
statements
about the LLC’s
financial ability to retain Sitrick and pay for Sitrick’s services, M. Sitrick immediately
went to work on behalf of Woodstock 50.  (SAC ¶10.) 
Plaintiff alleges on Sunday, May 5, 2019, M. Sitrick spent 4.25 hours
reviewing emails and drafting a letter for Woodstock 50 to send to Dentsu.  (SAC ¶10.) 
Plaintiff alleges on the same day, Sitrick senior executive Sallie
Hofmeister (“Hofmeister”) spent 1.75 hours reviewing emails, texts, setting up
Google alerts, reviewing stories about the festival and working on the letter
to
Dentsu.  (SAC ¶10.) 

          Plaintiff alleges that on Monday May
6, 2019, again in reliance upon Peck’s statements concerning Woodstock 50’s
finances made in the May 5, 2019, conference call, Sitrick professionals spent
8.5 hours working with media reporters, including Harvey Levin of TMZ, and
putting in place a strategy to
blunt the negative
publicity surrounding Woodstock 50’s dispute with Dentsu.   (SAC ¶11.) 
Plaintiff alleges on the same day, M. Sitrick sent Kasowitz and his
associate an email: “Given that we worked the weekend and I have been working
on this since this morning, we would appreciate it if we could get the executed
engagement letter and retainer sent.”  (SAC
¶11.)
          Plaintiff alleges within a day or two
of the above email, Sitrick received the engagement agreement signed by Kasowitz
and by Peck.  (SAC ¶11, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiff alleges by signing the engagement
agreement and sending it to Sitrick, Peck confirmed and re-stated the representations
made in the May 5, 2019 conference call, i.e., that he was the managing member (written
in his own hand) of Woodstock 50, that Woodstock 50 would pay the
non-refundable retainer of
$60,000 as a minimum
annual fee and that Woodstock 50 would pay Sitrick’s invoices within 20 days of
receipt.  (SAC ¶11, Exh. 3 at ¶2).
          Plaintiff alleges following receipt of
the executed engagement agreement, and in reliance on the representations made
by Peck in the May 5, 2019, conference call and as repeated in the engagement
agreement, Sitrick professionals continued to provide services to Woodstock 50
regarding the crisis caused by Dentsu.  (SAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges, among other things, on May 15, 2019, Hofmeister and
Peck spoke by telephone about a proposed press release to be drafted by
Hofmeister concerning financing for the festival.  (SAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges Peck told Hofmeister that Oppenheimer & Co., an
investment banking firm, had been engaged by Woodstock 50 to complete the
financing for the festival and event preparations will continue as planned. (SAC
¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges Hofmeister then
drafted a press release that Peck and the Kasowitz lawyers approved.  (SAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges the press release was distributed on May 17, 2019, and
read in part: “The Woodstock 50 team is pleased to announce that Oppenheimer &
Co. has signed on as a financial advisor to complete the financing for the
festival following a legal victory earlier this week. Event preparations will
continue as planned as Oppenheimer & Co. joins the list of strong
institutions producing the festival.”  (SAC
¶12, Exh. 4.)  Plaintiff alleges during May
2019 the Sitrick professionals spent 170.25 hours working on Woodstock 50’s
behalf, to the
tune of $145,961.25.
 (SAC ¶12.)
          Plaintiff alleges Sitrick emailed its
invoice to Woodstock 50 for May 2019 services on June 3, 2019.  (SAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges shortly after that date M. Sitrick and Hofmeister
spoke to Peck via telephone about payment of the
invoice.  (SAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges Peck stated that the invoice would be paid promptly.  (SAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges in reliance on Peck’s statement that the Sitrick
invoices would be paid as agreed, Sitrick professionals continued to provide
crisis public relations services to Woodstock 50 through August 3, 2019,
including travel by Hofmeister to upstate New York at Peck’s specific request,
to be onsite at the anticipated new location of the festival, incurring not
only significant additional professional fees, but significant out of pocket expenses.
 (SAC ¶13.)  
          Plaintiff alleges between July 14,
2019, and July 19, 2019, Hofmeister spent 57 hours traveling to and from
upstate New York to meet with Woodstock 50’s team producing the festival,
develop strategy and “game plans” and to manage the media that were onsite.  (SAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges in reliance on Peck’s statements made in the May 5,
2019, conference call, the engagement agreement, the meeting with M. Sitrick at
the Sitrick offices and numerous telephone call among M. Sitrick, Hofmeister
and Peck wherein Peck stated that Sitrick’s invoices would be paid, the Sitrick
professionals spent 49.75 hours in June 2019 providing services to the LLC,
139.25 hours in July 2019 providing services to the LLC, 78.75 hours in August
2019 providing services to the LLC and 8.25 hours in August 2019 providing
services to the LLC.  (SAC ¶13.)  
          Plaintiff alleges on August 15, 2019,
while Woodstock 50’s lawsuit against Dentsu was pending, Peck met with M.
Sitrick in the conference room at the Sitrick offices located 11999 San Vicente
Boulevard, Penthouse, Los Angeles, California.  (SAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges during this meeting Peck offered explanations as to
why Sitrick’s invoices had not been paid, stated “I will make sure you get
paid.”  (SAC ¶13.)
          Plaintiff alleges Woodstock 50 failed
to pay Sitrick the sum due of $360,145.11.  (SAC ¶14.) 
Plaintiff alleges Sitrick commenced an arbitration against Woodstock 50
and judgment on an Arbitrator’s award was entered in favor of Sitrick and
against Woodstock 50 on November 22, 2022, in LASC Case No. 22STCP02422, for
the full amount of Sitrick’s invoices, interest, attorney’s fees and
arbitration expenses. (SAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges as entered, the judgment totaled $520,317.06.  (SAC ¶13, Exh. 5.)  
          Plaintiff alleges following entry of
judgment, Sitrick obtained an order for the debtor examination of Peck as the
managing member of Woodstock 50.  (SAC ¶15.)  Plaintiff alleges the exam took place on
February 21, 2023, on the 9th floor (cafeteria) of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
 (SAC ¶15.)  Plaintiff alleges Peck testified at the debtor
exam as follows: (1) he was never the managing member of Woodstock 50; (2) at
the time he signed Sitrick’s engagement agreement Woodstock 50 had no cash available
to pay any expenses or any creditors, including for Sitrick’s services; (3)
Woodstock 50’s lawsuit against Dentsu was settled for $7 million and that on December
15, 2020, Woodstock 50 received $3,689,000.00 from the settlement proceeds; (4)
the $3,689,000.00 in settlement proceeds was used to repay investors, including
Otis Partners, an entity owned by Peck and Cronin; and (5) none of the
$3,689,000.00 in settlement proceeds was used to pay any trade creditors, and
no allocation of any of the settlement proceeds was intended for or paid to
Sitrick.  (SAC ¶15.)
          Plaintiff alleges Sitrick did not know
of, suspect, or could have discovered Peck’s misrepresentations as alleged in ¶¶9,
11, and 13 above prior to the February 21, 2023, debtor examination of Peck.  (SAC ¶16.)
          Defendants filed the instant demurrer
on June 21, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its
opposition on July 26, 2024.  Defendants
filed their reply on August 1, 2024.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action
on the basis they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action.  (Notice of Demurrer pg. 2; C.C.P.
§430.10(e).) 
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Peck’s counsel’s declaration states that on May
22, 2024, counsel met and conferred telephonically on the instant demurrer, but
were unable to reach a resolution. 
(Decl. of Furman §2.)  Peck’s
counsel’s declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3)(B).  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.

 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Intentional
Misrepresentation (1st COA)
          “The elements of fraud that will give
rise to a tort action for deceit are: ‘(a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.’”  (Engalla
v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974, internal
quotation marks omitted.)
          “In California, fraud must be pled
specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations.]
Thus, the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings . . . will not
ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect. [Citation.]
[¶] This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.”  (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645, internal quotations omitted.)
          “[A] cause of action for
misrepresentation requires an affirmative statement, not an implied assertion.”
 (RSB Vineyards, LLC v. Orsi
(2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1089, 1102.)
          Plaintiff alleges each of Peck’s
representations as alleged in SAC ¶¶9, 11, and 13 was materially false.  (SAC ¶18.) 
Plaintiff alleges Peck knew, as he admitted at his February 21, 2023,
debtor examination, that the representations were false.  (SAC ¶18.) 
Plaintiff alleges the representations were made with the intent to
induce Sitrick to provide the public relations/crisis management services to Woodstock
50.  (SAC ¶18.)  Plaintiff alleges Sitrick was unaware of the
falsity of Peck’s representations and justifiably relied thereon.  (SAC ¶18.) 
Plaintiff alleges Sitrick would not have provided the valuable and extensive
public relations/crisis management services to Woodstock 50 had it known that
Peck’s representations were false.  (SAC
¶18.)  Plaintiff alleges Sitrick did not
learn of the falsity of Peck’s representations until Peck’s February 21, 2023,
debtor examination, and Sitrick did not have any reason to suspect or discover
that those representations were false prior to February 21, 2023.  (SAC ¶18.) 

          Plaintiff alleges Peck’s
misrepresentations to Sitrick were made by Peck for his own personal financial
benefit (including as referenced in SAC ¶¶9, 11, and 13) and were made by Peck
to induce Sitrick to continue to provide valuable public relations/crisis
management services that Sitrick would otherwise not have provided.  (SAC ¶19.) 
Plaintiff alleges as a result of Peck’s misrepresentations, Sitrick has
been damaged in a sum within the jurisdiction of this court and according to
proof.  (SAC ¶20.)  
          The Court finds that Plaintiff adequately
alleges a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.  Plaintiff alleges Peck executed a fee
agreement and promised to pay invoices, knowing that the LLC had no ability to
pay for the services, that he did so with the intent to cause Plaintiff to
perform services for the LLC for which the LLC would not pay, and that
Plaintiff relied on those promises to its detriment. (SAC ¶¶ 18 -20.)  These allegations sufficiently state a cause
of action for intentional misrepresentation. 

          Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is overruled.
 
          Negligent Misrepresentation (2nd
COA)
          “Negligent misrepresentation requires
an assertion of fact, falsity of that assertion, and the tortfeasor’s lack of
reasonable grounds for believing the assertion to be true. It also requires the
tortfeasor’s intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance by the person to
whom the false assertion of fact was made, and damages to that person. An
implied assertion of fact is ‘not enough’ to support liability.”  (SI 59 LLC v. Variel Warner Ventures, LLC
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 146, 154, internal citation omitted.)
          Plaintiff alleges each of Peck’s
representations as alleged in SAC ¶¶9, 11, and 13 was materially false.  (SAC ¶23.) 
Plaintiff alleges Peck had no reasonable grounds for believing that the
representations were true.  (SAC ¶23.)  Plaintiff alleges the representations were
made with the intent to induce Sitrick to provide the public relations/crisis
management services in order to benefit Peck financially.  (SAC ¶23.) 
Plaintiff alleges Sitrick was unaware of the falsity of Peck’s representations
and justifiably relied thereon.  (SAC ¶23.)  Plaintiff alleges had Sitrick known that Peck’s
representations were false, Sitrick would not have rendered the valuable and
extensive public relations/crisis management services to Woodstock 50.  (SAC ¶23.) 
Plaintiff alleges Sitrick did not learn of the falsity of Peck’s
representations until Peck’s February 21, 2023, debtor examination, and Sitrick
did not have any reason to suspect or discover that those representations were
false prior to February 21, 2023.  (SAC
¶23.)  
          Plaintiff alleges as a result Peck’s
negligent misrepresentations, Sitrick has been damaged in the sum within the
jurisdiction this court and according to proof. 
(SAC ¶24.)
          The Court finds that Plaintiff adequately
alleges a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.  Plaintiff alleges Peck executed a fee
agreement and promised to pay invoices without reasonable grounds for doing so (knowing
that the LLC had no ability to pay for the services), that he did so with the
intent to cause Plaintiff to perform services for the LLC for which the LLC would
not pay, and that Plaintiff relied on those promises to its detriment. (SAC ¶¶
18 -20, 23.)  These allegations
sufficiently state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.  
          Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action is overruled.
 
          Breach of Fiduciary Duty (3rd COA)
          “A fiduciary relationship is ‘“any
relation existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties
is . . . duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the
other party. Such a relation ordinarily arises where a confidence is reposed by
one person in the integrity of another, and in such a relation the party in
whom the confidence is reposed, if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept
the confidence, can take no advantage from his acts relating to the interest of
the other party without the latter’s knowledge or consent.”’” (Wolf v.
Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29.)
          “It is settled that a director or
officer of a corporation may not enter into a competing enterprise which
cripples or injures the business of the corporation of which he is an officer
or director. An officer or director may not seize for himself, to the detriment
of his company, business opportunities in the company’s line of activities
which his company has an interest and prior claim to obtain. In the event that
he does seize such opportunities in violation of his fiduciary duty, the
corporation may claim for itself all benefits so obtained.” (Xum Speegle,
Inc. v. Fields (1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 546, 554, internal citations omitted.)
          Plaintiff alleges at all times
material hereto, Peck and Otis were and are a single business enterprise and
lack identities separate from each other.  (SAC ¶26.)  
Plaintiff alleges Otis is merely a conduit through which money is
disbursed to Peck and for Peck’s direct benefit.  (SAC ¶26.)  
Plaintiff alleges at the time Woodstock 50 entered into the engagement
with Sitrick on May 2, 2019, Woodstock 50 was insolvent and unable to pay
creditors, as admitted by Peck in his February 21, 2023, debtor examination.  (SAC ¶27.) 

          Plaintiff alleges at all relevant
times, Peck, as the ostensible managing member of Woodstock 50, owed a fiduciary
duty to Woodstock 50’s creditors consistent with the trust fund doctrine, i.e.,
a duty to avoid actions that diverted, dissipated or unduly put assets at risk
that might be otherwise used to pay creditors, including, but not limited to,
self-dealing or the preferential treatment of creditors.  (SAC ¶28.) 
          Plaintiff alleges Peck breached this
fiduciary duty by directing Woodstock 50 to pay $3,689,000.00 in settlement proceeds
from the Dentsu litigation to favored creditors including Otis, which he and
Cronin own and control.  (SAC ¶29.)  Plaintiff alleges on information and belief
that Peck personally received and benefitted from some or all of the monies Woodstock
50 paid to Otis.  (SAC ¶29.)
          Plaintiff alleges as a result of Peck’s
breach of fiduciary duty, Otis and Peck have been unjustly enriched and Sitrick
has been damaged in a sum equal to the amount received by Otis and by Peck from
the Dentsu settlement proceeds.  (SAC ¶30.)  Plaintiff alleges Otis and Peck much disgorge
to Sitrick all monies received from the Dentsu settlement proceeds.  (SAC ¶30.)
          Plaintiff alleges Peck and Otis are
alter egos, (see SAC ¶¶26 [“At all times material hereto, Peck and Otis
Partners were and are a single business enterprise and lack identities separate
from each other. Otis Partners is merely a conduit through which money is
disbursed to Peck and for Peck’s direct benefit”]), Plaintiff fails to allege any
relief against Peck.  Plaintiff alleges
that Peck obtained funds with Otis from the Dentsu litigation, and that Peck
favored Otis, and thereby, himself, to the detriment of other creditors,
including Plaintiff.  The Court finds that
allegations adequately plead a cause of action for Breach of Fiduciary
Duty.  
          
          Accordingly, Peck’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of action is overruled.
           
          Conclusion
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is overruled.
