English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the City of Santa Monica's motion regarding further proceedings on remand, allowing the parties to file briefs explaining their respective positions on how the City's election system measures up under the new standard for dilution articulated by the California Supreme Court. The briefs may address the last three Santa Monica City Council elections. The parties are also allowed to file simultaneous supplemental briefs of up to 25 pages, excluding declarations and exhibits, and have 30 days to file simultaneous supplemental responding briefs of up to 15 pages each.

The judge denies the plaintiffs' motion to re-issue judgment, as the California Supreme Court did not reinstate the trial court's judgment and instead only identified the proper way to analyze the California Voting Rights Act. The judge concludes that further proceedings are necessary to determine the correct legal standard for evaluating vote dilution under the California Voting Rights Act.
