Background
On
January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint against Specially
Appearing Defendant alleging a single cause of action for violation of the
California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”). 

On
March 28, 2024, Specially Appearing Defendant filed the instant motion.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on July 29,
2024.  As of the date of this hearing no
reply has been filed.
 
Motion
to Quash
“When
a motion to quash is properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the
plaintiff to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the
evidence.”  (Aquila, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.) 
When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint,
the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court
jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868; see also Elkman v. National States Insurance Co.
(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-1313 [“Where a nonresident defendant
challenges jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the
burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts
exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of
personal jurisdiction.”].)
California’s
long-arm statute permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction on any basis
consistent with state or federal constitutional principles.  (C.C.P. §410.10.)  “When a defendant moves to quash service of
process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of
demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.  Once facts showing minimum contacts with the
forum state are established, however, it becomes the defendant’s burden to
demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.”  (Vons
Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 449,
citations omitted.)  Plaintiffs must meet
their initial burden by a preponderance of competent and relevant evidence, as
shown in affidavits and documentary evidence. 
(See Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232-1233.)
          “Personal jurisdiction may be either
general or specific. A nonresident defendant may be subject to the general
jurisdiction of the forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are
‘substantial . . . continuous and systematic.’ In such a case, ‘it is not
necessary that the specific cause of action alleged be connected with the
defendant’s business relationship to the forum.’ Such a defendant’s contacts
with the forum are so wide-ranging that they take the place of physical
presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction.”  (Vons
Companies, Inc., 14 Cal.4th at pgs. 445-446, citations omitted.)
“If
the nonresident defendant does not have substantial and systematic contacts in
the forum sufficient to establish general jurisdiction, he or she still may be
subject to the specific jurisdiction
of the forum, if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of
forum benefits, and the ‘controversy is related to or ‘arises out of’ a
defendant’s contacts with the forum.’”  (Id. at pg. 446, citations omitted.)  The purposeful availment test is only
satisfied if the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities
toward California so that the defendant should expect, because of the benefits
it receives, to be subject to jurisdiction here based on its contacts with
California.  (Snowney v. Harrah’s
Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1062.)  Purposeful availment occurs when a
nonresident defendant purposefully directs its activities at California
residents, deliberately engages in significant activities here, or creates “continuing
obligations” between itself and California residents.  (Id. at pg. 1063.)
“The
crucial inquiry concerns the character of defendant’s activity in the forum,
whether the cause of action arises out of or has a substantial connection with
that activity, and upon the balancing of the convenience of the parties and the
interests of the state in assuming jurisdiction.”  (Vons
Companies, Inc., 14 Cal.4th at pg. 448, citing Cornelison v.
Chaney (1976) 16 Cal.3d 143, 147-148). 
Jurisdiction is proper when the defendant’s contacts proximately result
from its actions that create a “substantial connection” with the forum
state.  (Hanson v. Denckla (1958)
357 U.S. 235, 253.)
Plaintiff fails to
demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that Tempur Sealy International has
sufficient contacts with California for this Court to exercise general
jurisdiction over it.  Plaintiff’s
opposition does not explicitly argue the issue of general jurisdiction, and
therefore concedes this Court lacks general jurisdiction over Tempur Sealy
International.  (See Opposition,
pg. 4.)[1]  However, Plaintiff raises the argument that Tempur
Sealy International has been registered to do business within the state of California
and has registered agents for service of process located within California.  (Opposition, pg. 14; Decl. of Ferrell ¶11,
Exhs. 9-10.)  Business licenses and
service-of-process agents do not alone support general jurisdiction findings.  (Gray Line Tours v. Reynolds Electrical
& Engineering Co. (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 190, 194; DVI, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1080, 1095.)  
Nonetheless, Plaintiff does demonstrate
by a preponderance of evidence that Tempur Sealy International has sufficient
contacts with California for this Court to exercise specific
jurisdiction over it.  
In
the context of internet activity for jurisdictional purposes, the California
Supreme Court adopted the “sliding scale” test set forth as follows:
At one end
of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the
Internet. If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign
jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer
files over the Internet, personal jurisdiction is proper. [Citation.] At the
opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on
an Internet Web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions. A
passive Web site that does little more than make information available to those
who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise [of] personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.] The middle ground is occupied by interactive Web
sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer. In these
cases, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of
interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs
on the Web site.
 
(Pavlovich
v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 274, quoting Zippo Manufacturing
Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. (W.D.Pa. 1997) 952 F.Supp. 1119, 1124.)
          Plaintiff argues that Tempur Sealy
International’s website is sufficiently interactive to subject it to personal
jurisdiction because it functions as an online store.  (Decl. of Ferrell ¶2, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff also states that the website
expressly references the rights of Californians under the Consumer Privacy Act
of 2018, and thus argues that the website was constructed with an eye toward
California.  (Decl. of Ferrell ¶5, Exh. 3.)
 Plaintiff thus distinguishes Tempur
Sealy International’s website from Pavlovich, where the website had no
interactive features nor reference to California and argues that it is
sufficiently interactive and commercial to subject Tempur Sealy International
to specific jurisdiction.  (Pavlovich,
29 Cal.4th at pg. 274.)
For
cases falling within the “middle ground” of the sliding scale, as Plaintiff
admits that this case does, federal courts “have been less than consistent.” (Snowney
v. Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1064.)  The California Supreme Court in Snowney declined
to address what interactivity was required to establish personal jurisdiction
because the website in that case spoke to the proximity of the defendant’s
hotels to California and provided driving directions from California to those
hotels.  (Id. at pgs. 1064-1065.)  However, the Court of Appeal stated in Thurston
v. Fairfield Collectibles of Georgia, LLC that a facially neutral website
through which a substantial number of sales of goods or services to California
residents are made constitutes purposeful availment.  (Thurston v. Fairfiled Collectibles of Ga.,
LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 1231, 1241.)  Under California authority, even a small
number of sales may be “substantial.”  (As
You Sow v. Crawford Laboratories, Inc. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1859, 1864 [16
sales totaling no more than 1% of annual sales sufficient to establish personal
jurisdiction].)  That said, Plaintiff has
offered no evidence of the quantity of sales made to California, even though
the website appears to have been designed with this state in mind. 
The
Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to
demonstrate purposeful availment through operation of its interactive website,
and that the claim asserted arises out of those activities.  The burden now shifts to Defendant to
demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.
 
If
a plaintiff has satisfied their burden on a motion to quash for lack of
personal jurisdiction, the burden shifts to the moving party to demonstrate
that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.  (Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985)
471 U.S. 462, 476-78.)  The moving party
must show that litigating the case in a foreign state would be “so gravely
difficult and inconvenient that it would put him at a severe disadvantage in
comparison to his opponent.”  (Doe v. Damron
(2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 684, 693.)  Mere
inconvenience is insufficient to defeat jurisdiction.  (Id.)  
When
evaluating the reasonableness of the exercise of jurisdiction, Courts commonly
balance several factors in making that determination, including (1) the extent
of the defendant’s purposeful interjection into the forum state; (2) the burden
on the defendant; (3) the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the
defendant’s state; (4) the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute;
(5) the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy; (6) the
importance of the forum to the plaintiff’s interests in convenient and
effective relief; and (7) the existence of an alternate forum.  (See Core-Vent Corp. v. Nobel Indus.
(9th Cir. 1993) 11 F.3d 1482, 1488-1489.) 
Here,
Specially Appearing Defendant offers no evidence demonstrating why the exercise
of jurisdiction would be so inconvenient and difficult as to put it at a severe
disadvantage.  Mere statements that Specially
Appearing Defendant has a principal place of business in Kentucky and does not
have offices in California is not sufficient to demonstrate unreasonableness by
itself, because those statements are not evidence of burden.  (See Decl. of Millar ¶¶4, 8.)  Specially Appearing Defendant has therefore
failed to demonstrate that the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be
unreasonable. 
          Based on the foregoing, Tempur Sealy
International’s motion to quash service of summons is denied.
 
Conclusion
Specially Appearing
Defendant Tempur Sealy International, Inc.’s motion to quash service of summons
is denied.
Moving Party to give
notice.
