English-text summary:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendant, Tempur Sealy International, Inc., had argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over it because it did not have substantial and systematic contacts with California. However, the plaintiff, Daryl Levings, Jr., had demonstrated that the defendant had purposefully availed itself of the forum through its interactive website, which functions as an online store and references the rights of Californians under the Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. The judge found that the defendant had sufficient contacts with California to exercise specific jurisdiction over it. The defendant had failed to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable, and therefore, the motion to quash was denied.
