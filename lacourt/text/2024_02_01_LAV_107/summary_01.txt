And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment filed by Virtue Recovery Center, LLC against Kick Digital Media, et al. The judge's ruling is based on several reasons, including:

* The plaintiff has failed to provide a summary of the case, which is required by the court.
* The plaintiff has not explained how the damages of $160,000 are calculated.
* The interest calculation is missing, and the plaintiff must file a declaration setting forth the interest calculation.
* The complaint does not seek interest on damages, but the Request for Judgment does, which is unclear.
* The complaint alleges alter ego, but no evidence is provided supporting this allegation, and therefore, there is not sufficient evidence that judgment should be entered against Jason Fritz as the alter ego of Kick Digital Media.
* The judgment calculations are incorrect, and the total judgment is $171,726.70, not $171,200 as stated.
* There is an issue with whether the actual defendant has been named/served in this action. The defendant Kick Digital Media is merely a trade name of Azonaco, LLC, an Arizona LLC, which is not a listed defendant. The plaintiff personally served Jason Fritz, alleging that he is the agent for service of process of Kick Digital Media.
