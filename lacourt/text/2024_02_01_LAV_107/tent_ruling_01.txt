COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: REQUEST
  FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
[Tentative] RulingThe
Request for Default Judgment is Denied.    Reasons

Summary
     of the case is missing. Plaintiff must file a summary of the case.

None
     of the filed documents explain how the damages being sought ($160,000) is
     calculated. Per the Complaint, Plaintiff paid $7,450 to Defendants for
     services not rendered in breach of the contract. As for the other
     $152,550, Plaintiff pleads “substantial monetary damage,” impliedly from
     lost expected business growth but not expressly stated. (Complaint ¶¶
     14–15, 20, 27.)

Interest
     calculation is missing. Plaintiff must file declaration setting forth
     interest calculation.

Complaint
     does not seek interest on damages, but Request for Judgment does.

Complaint
     alleges alter ego, but no evidence is provided supporting the alter ego
     allegations. Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence that judgment
     should be entered against Jason Fritz as the alter ego of Kick Digital
     Media, the entity that entered into the contract at issue.

Judgment
     calculations are incorrect. The sum of $160,000 in damages + $11,200 in
     interest + $526.70 in costs is $171,726.70, not $171,200 as is stated.

Issue
     with whether the actual defendant has been named/served in this
     action.  Defendant Kick Digital
     Media is merely a trade name of Azonaco, LLC, an Arizona LLC. Azonaco, LLC
     is not a listed defendant, probably because Plaintiff alleges in the
     Complaint to not know Kick Digital Media’s entity status. Plaintiff
     personally served Jason Fritz, alleging that he is the agent for service
     of process of Kick Digital Media.

 
The
Request for Default Judgment is therefore Denied. It is so ordered.
