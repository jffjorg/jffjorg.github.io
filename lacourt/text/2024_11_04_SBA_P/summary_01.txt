Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's complaint, with leave to amend. The court finds that Plaintiff's allegations sound of professional negligence, which is barred by MICRA. The court also agrees with Defendant that the shower was incidental to Plaintiff's treatment, and therefore, Defendant's duty to maintain the shower arises from the patient-medical provider relationship between Defendant and Plaintiff, rather than its general duty to keep the premises safe for all invitees.
