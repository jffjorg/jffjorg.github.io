English text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint without leave to amend and dismisses the case. The court held that both defendants, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Public Transportation Services Corporation, are public entities subject to the claim presentation requirements. The court took judicial notice of various documents and exhibits, including the court's previous October 11, 2023, ruling and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Administrative Code.
