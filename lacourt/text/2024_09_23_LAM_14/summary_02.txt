And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the parties' motions and has decided to deny Plaintiff's motion to vacate the notice of settlement and deny Plaintiff's motion to sever and enter judgment against the Contractor Defendants.

**Reasoning**

The court has declined to vacate the notice of settlement because there is no dispute over whether the parties reached a binding settlement. The court has also declined to sever the sixth through eighth causes of action and enter judgment on these causes of action because doing so would result in a piecemeal resolution of the action, which runs afoul of the one final judgment rule.

**Background**

The Plaintiff, Beacon Sales Acquisition, Inc., brought this action against the Contractor Defendants, Deaton and DRSI, as well as Public Storage and North River Insurance Company, alleging breach of contract, common counts, damages under Civ. Code section 1719, foreclosure of mechanics liens, and enforcement of claim on contractor's license bond. The parties allegedly entered into a credit agreement in March 2019, but the Contractor Defendants failed to pay for the materials supplied by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement on October 31, 2023, and subsequently filed motions for entry of judgment and to sever on June 12, 2024. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the notice of settlement on August 28, 2024.

**Conclusion**

The court has denied Plaintiff's motions and has determined that the case will proceed as previously set.
