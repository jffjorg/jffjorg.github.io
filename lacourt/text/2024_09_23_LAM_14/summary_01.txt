Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the parties' joint motion to continue the trial and final status conference. The new dates for these events will be determined at the hearing. The Judge has also deemed the parties' request to be ordered to participate in a mediation status conference moot, as they have already participated in the court's Mediation Settlement Conference (MSC) Program. The Judge finds that good cause exists to continue the trial because the MSC took place less than one week before the scheduled trial date, and the parties require more time to settle the case and two related cases.
