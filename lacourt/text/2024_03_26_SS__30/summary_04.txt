And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motions to compel responses to supplemental interrogatories, supplemental special interrogatories, and supplemental request for production as moot, since verified responses have been served. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's counsel has provided substantial justification for failing to serve the responses in time. The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.070, 2030.290, 2031.050, 2031.300, 2023.010, and 2023.030, as well as case law.
