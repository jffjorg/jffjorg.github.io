And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise of disputed claims of the minors A.L. (age 5) and G.L. (age 11). The judge finds the settlement reasonable and approves it. The judge also excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference instead. Finally, the judge sets an order to show cause (OSC) for proof of deposit in 60 days, which does not require a personal appearance if the receipt is filed.
