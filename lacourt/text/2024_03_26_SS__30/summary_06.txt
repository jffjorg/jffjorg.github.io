```

And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages brought by the defendant. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the defendant's intoxication while driving do not support the imposition of punitive damages. The Judge notes that the plaintiff must allege specific factual circumstances that show the risk of injury was probable, such as weaving through lanes of traffic or a previous conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. The Judge also finds that the proposed amended complaint does not cure the defects outlined above and therefore will not allow leave to amend. The Judge grants the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages without leave to amend.
