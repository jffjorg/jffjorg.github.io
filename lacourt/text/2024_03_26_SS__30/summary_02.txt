Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion for Protective Order, limiting the scope of discovery in this case. The Defendant had argued that the Plaintiff's excessive use of special interrogatories (141 in total) was unnecessary and burdensome. The Judge agreed, finding that the Plaintiff had not justified the need for so many special interrogatories and that the Defendant's financial burden in responding to them was substantial. As a result, the Judge has imposed sanctions on the Plaintiff's counsel, Justin Farahi, in the amount of $960. The Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant was denied.
