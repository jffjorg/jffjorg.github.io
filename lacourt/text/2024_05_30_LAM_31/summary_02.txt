* The court sustained Defendant's demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Open Book Account because it depended on the existence of contract.
* The court disregards the "new" allegations in the First Amended Complaint because Plaintiff has not sufficiently pleaded the existence of a contract between the parties.
* Leave to amend is granted, but if Plaintiff is unable to correct the failings, leave to amend will likely not be granted again.
```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer to the First and Third Causes of Action in the First Amended Complaint. The court finds that the breach of contract claim fails because the existence of a contract between the parties has not been sufficiently pleaded. The court also finds that the open book account claim fails because it relies on the existence of a contract. The court orders Plaintiff to file and serve the Second Amended Complaint within 20 days. Leave to amend is granted, but if Plaintiff is unable to correct the failings, leave to amend will likely not be granted again.
