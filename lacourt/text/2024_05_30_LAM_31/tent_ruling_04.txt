I.          INTRODUCTION
 
Laurentia Popa and Andrea Princess Popa Williams, as Trustees
of The Popa Family Living Trust (“Plaintiffs”), are the owners of the real
property located at 4803 Bonvue, Los Angeles, California (“Bonvue Property”).  Irma M. Fitzgibbons, individually and as
Trustee of the Irma M. Fitzgibbons Survivor’s Trust (“Defendants”), is the
owner of the real property located at 4822 Glencairn Dr., Los Angeles, California
(“Glencairn Property”).  The Glencairn
Property is located directly above and bordering the Bonvue Property.  Plaintiffs allege that, since July 13, 2022
to the presents, Defendants caused water and soil to flow from the Glencairn
Property onto Plaintiffs’ Bonvue Property.
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint for (1) Negligence,
(2) Trespass, and (3) Nuisance against Defendants.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and punitive
damages.
 
On February 20, 2024, Defendants filed this Demurrer and
Motion to Strike punitive damages from the Complaint.[1]
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendants replied.  
 
II.        DISCUSSION
RE DEMURRER
 
A.   
Legal Standard
“The primary function of a
pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its¿case
[citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party
cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa
Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)¿ 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the factual
allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of¿America, N.A.¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint
alleges¿facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete
defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in
isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the¿complaint ‘as a
whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank,¿N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)  The Court
“assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded¿factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of¿which
judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p.
240.) “The court does not,¿however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v.¿Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿ 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)¿“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)¿¿ 
 
B.    
Application
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised by
the demurrer.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41(a).)¿Defense counsel has satisfied
the meet and confer requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Scott Gutjahr, ¶¶ 2-4.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Analysis 
            
            Defendants argue
each cause of action fails on the grounds that they are uncertain.  The court addresses each cause of action in
turn.
 
1.     
First Cause of Action for Negligence
 
The elements of a cause of action for negligence are well
established.¿ They are (a) a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such
legal duty; and (c) the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting
injury.¿ (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917; CACI
No. 400.)
 
Defendants argue the First Cause of Action is
uncertain.  Not so.  As alleged, Defendants “had and have a
non-transferable, non-delegable duty to design, construct, engineer, operate,
manage, inspect and properly maintain their property [Glencairn Property]to
prevent water and soil from flowing onto Plaintiffs’ [Bonvue Property].”  (Complaint, ¶ 16.)  Defendants breached that duty by “(1) failing
to design, construct, engineer, operate, manage, inspect and properly maintain their
property; (2) failing to develop and maintain drainage to prevent water flowing
from their property onto Plaintiffs’ property; (3) failing to install a
retaining wall to prevent soil flowing from their property onto Plaintiffs’
property.”  (Complaint, ¶ 17.)  As a result of Defendants’ actions and/or
omissions, Plaintiffs suffered damages, including, but not limited to, “damage
to landscape and hardscape, fixtures, and structures on their property” (Complaint,
¶ 19) and “costs relating to storage, clean up, disposal, repair, depreciation
and/or replacement of their property” (Complaint, ¶ 21).  Each element for a cause of action for
negligence has been adequately pleaded. 
The First Cause of Action is not uncertain.  
 
2.     
Second Cause of Action for Trespass
 
To establish a prima facie case of trespass, plaintiff must
prove the following elements: (1) the plaintiff’s lawful possession or right to
possession, as the owner or otherwise, of described property; (2) the
defendant’s wrongful act of trespass on the property; and (3) damage to
plaintiff proximately caused by the trespass.  (CACI No. 2000; see also Elton v.
Anheuser-Busch Beverage Group, Inc. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1304-1307.)
 
Defendants argue the Second Cause of Action is uncertain.  Defendants’ argument again misses the
mark.  As alleged, Plaintiffs are the
owners of the Bonvue Property. 
(Complaint, ¶ 6.)  Defendants, as
the owners of the bordering Glencairn Property, caused water and soil to flow
onto Plaintiffs’ Bonvue Property, which constitutes a continuing and/or
permanent trespass on the Bonvue Property. 
(Complaint, ¶ 28.)  Plaintiffs’
have suffered damage to landscape and hardscape, fixtures, and structures on
the Bonvue Property, among other damages. 
(Complaint, ¶ 29.)  Each
element  for a cause of action for
trespass has been adequately pleaded. The Second Cause of Action is not
uncertain.  
 
3.     
Third Cause of Action for Nuisance
 
            The
elements of an action for private nuisance are: “First, the plaintiff must
prove an interference with his use and enjoyment of its property. Second, the
invasion of the plaintiff's interest in the use and enjoyment of the land must
be substantial, i.e., it caused the plaintiff to suffer substantial
actual damage. Third, the interference with the protected interest must not
only be substantial, it must also be unreasonable, i.e., it must be of
such a nature, duration, or amount as to constitute unreasonable interference
with the use and enjoyment of the land. (Today's IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles
Cnty. Metro. Transportation Auth. (2022) 83 Cal. App. 5th 1137, citing San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 938; CACI No.
2021.)
 
            Defendants
argue the Third Cause of Action is uncertain. 
The challenge fails.  Each element
of a nuisance claim has been pleaded. 
(See Complaint, ¶¶ 6, 39-42.)  The
Third Cause of Action is adequately pleaded.
 
III.       DISCUSSION
RE MOTION TO STRIKE
 
A.   
 Legal Standard
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading,
may serve and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd.
(b).)¿ On a motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a motion to strike are limited to matters
appearing on the face of the challenged pleading or matters which must or may
be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a); Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia
v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 20.)¿ 
 
B.    
Application
 
Defendants seek an order striking allegations supporting
Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages.
            
Punitive damages may be imposed
where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been
guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).)
“Malice” is conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff
or despicable conduct which is carried on with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.  (Civ. Code § 3294, subd.
(c)(1).) “‘Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to
levels of extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent
citizens should not have to tolerate.’ [Citation.]”  (Lackner v. North (2006)
135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)  “As amended to include [despicable], the
[Civil Code section 3294] plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the
plaintiff, ‘malice’ requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of
the plaintiffs’ interests.  The additional component of ‘despicable
conduct’ must be found.”  (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994)
8 Cal.4th 704, 725.) The statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a
“new substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.”  (Id.) 
Despicable conduct is “conduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable,
wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by
ordinary decent people.  Such conduct has been described as ‘having the
character of outrage frequently associated with crime.’”  (Tomaselli v.
Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.)  Further,
“[t]here must be evidence that defendant acted with knowledge of the probable
dangerous consequences to plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to
avoid these consequences.”  (Flyer’s Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v.
Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1155; see also Angie M.
v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 [“Conscious disregard
for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the
probably dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully
fails to avoid such consequences”].) 
 
A motion to strike punitive
damages is properly granted where a plaintiff does not state a prima facie
claim for punitive damages, including allegations that defendant is guilty of
oppression, fraud or malice.  (Turman v. Turning Point of Cent.
California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)  “Mere negligence,
even gross negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive
damages.  (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50
Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)  The allegations supporting a request for punitive
damages must be alleged with specificity; conclusory allegations without
sufficient facts are not enough.  (Smith v. Superior Court (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041-1042.) 
 
Defendants argue that the Complaint alleges
in conclusory fashion and without any factual support that Defendants’ conduct
was malicious, willful, wanton, and despicable as defined by Civil Code section
3294.   
Plaintiffs argue that punitive damages may
be available in a trespass actions, and further, there are allegations to
support punitive damages.  The court
agrees with Plaintiffs.  “Punitive damages may be awarded when a trespass is
committed from malicious motives or reckless disregard of the rights of others.”  (Armitage v. Decker (1990)
218 Cal.App.3d 887 907.)  Here,
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants caused water and soil to flow onto
Plaintiffs’ property even after being told by Plaintiff Laurentia Popa of the
issue.  (Complaint, ¶ 10.)  Further, the injury is
ongoing and has not been remediated, according to Plaintiffs. (Id.)  From these facts, a  reasonable inference supports the contention Defendants’
failure to correct the problem amounts to a reckless disregard of Plaintiffs’
rights, considering they were apprised of the issue (at this point) almost two
years ago.  There are sufficient
allegations to support the request for punitive damages.
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The
Demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
            The Motion
to Strike is DENIED.
 
            Defendants
are ordered to file their Answer to the Complaint within 20 days of the date of
this order.
 
Plaintiffs to give notice.
