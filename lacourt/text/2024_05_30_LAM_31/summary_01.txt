And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling granted the motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of allowing the plaintiff, TCR Services, Inc., to obtain the defendant's, Great American Insurance Co, et al., substantive responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. The court considered the relevant factors, including the necessity and reason for discovery, the diligence or lack of diligence of the parties, and the likelihood that permitting discovery would prevent the case from going to trial or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar. The court found that the plaintiff had made good cause to reopen discovery, given the delay in obtaining the original documents from the City of Pasadena and the need to obtain the defendant's substantive responses. The court ordered that the defendant's discovery responses be due 30 days from the date of the order, and that expert discovery cut-off dates would run from the current trial date of October 14, 2024.
