[1] Defendants appear to conflate the sufficiency
of each cause of action with the sufficiency of the allegations to support
requests for punitive damages and injunctive relief.Â  To the extent Defendants challenge each cause
of action and the allegations supporting the punitive damages request, the
court addresses each challenge separately.
