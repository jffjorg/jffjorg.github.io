```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Cross-Complainant Ideal's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. Ideal sought to freeze Cross-Defendants' assets and prevent them from diverting funds from the Bank Account. However, Ideal failed to show ownership interest in the Bank Account and did not present evidence that LA GreenWheels, a company allegedly controlled by Cross-Defendants, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ideal. Ideal also failed to show that LA GreenWheels has a continued obligation to send checks to Ideal. Without this evidence, the court cannot find that Cross-Defendants have diverted funds and that the damages they currently seek are inadequate to compensate Ideal.
