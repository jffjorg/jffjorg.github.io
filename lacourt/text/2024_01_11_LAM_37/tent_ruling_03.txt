§ 473(a) states: “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party,
or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The
court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party,
allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be
made after the time limited by this code. (2) When it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the
amendment renders it necessary, the court may postpone the trial, and may, when
the postponement will by the amendment be rendered necessary, require, as a
condition to the amendment, the payment to the adverse party of any costs as
may be just.”
