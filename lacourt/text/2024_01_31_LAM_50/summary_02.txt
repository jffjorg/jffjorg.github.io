  - "If the terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 474 have not been complied with, the purported defendant has not been named as such in the complaint.

  - "The requirements of section 474 are met when the identity of the Doe defendant is known, but at the time of the filing of the complaint, the plaintiff did not know facts that would cause a reasonable person to believe that liability is probable." (McOwen v. Grossman (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 937, 943-944.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Pinchas (Paul) Wintner's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The judge found that the plaintiff, Meir Levy, had properly named Wintner as a defendant in the lawsuit, despite not knowing his true identity at the time of the filing of the complaint. The judge concluded that the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 474 were met, which allows a plaintiff to delay suing a particular person as a named defendant until they have knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a reasonable person to believe liability is probable. The judge also found that Wintner's awareness of sexual abuse and molestation suffered by his sisters, and his attempt to resolve a family issue with Plaintiff's son, did not make him liable for any cause of action. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
