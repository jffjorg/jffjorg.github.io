  ORDER RE: 
 
LOS ANGELES
  UNIFIED SCHOOL MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 



Background
On June 7, 2021,
Plaintiff R&R Masonry (“R&R”) filed this action against Defendants H.A.
Lewis, Inc. (“H.A. Lewis”), Los Angeles Unified School District (the “District”),
and U.S. Specialty Insurance Company (“U.S. Specialty”). The Complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) quantum meruit, (3) account
stated, (4) open book account, (5) enforcement of stop payment notice, (6)
enforcement of stop payment notice release bond, and (7) recovery on payment bond.
 
In the Complaint, R&R
alleges that prior to September 10, 2018, H.A. Lewis entered into a prime
contract to provide labor, services, equipment, and materials for a work of
improvement known and described as Marshall High School Towe Repair, Contract
No. 1810063, Project No. 23A10590. (Compl., ¶ 11.) On or about September 10,
2018, R&R and H.A. Lewis entered into a subcontract for R&R to provide
labor, services, equipment, and materials necessary to do a portion of the
subject project, identified in the subcontract as “Historical Restoration,
Façade Renovation and Masonry.” (Compl., ¶ 12.) H.A. Lewis ordered extra work
from R&R, which increased the total compensation under the subcontract to
the sum of $1,008,741.80. (Compl., ¶ 13.) R&R alleges that on or about
September 30, 2020, H.A. Lewis breached the subcontract by failing to pay the
sum then due and owing in the amount of $388,059.94. (Compl., ¶ 15.)  
On July 28, 2021, H.A.
Lewis filed a Cross-Complaint against R&R, the District, and Fidelity
and Deposit Company of Maryland. On October 24, 2023, H.A. Lewis filed
the operative Third Amended Cross-Complaint, asserting causes of action for (1)
breach of contract, (2) breach of warranty, (3) breach of subcontract, (4)
breach of warranty, (5) recovery on performance bond, (6) intentional fraud
(concealment), (7) negligent fraud (concealment), (8) disgorgement, (9) implied
contractual indemnity, (10) declaratory relief, and (11) declaratory relief. 
On
March 24, 2023, the District filed a Cross-Complaint against H.A. Lewis,
asserting causes of action for (1) breach of contract and (2) express
indemnity. 
In the original Cross-Complaint, the District alleges, inter alia,
that on or about August 23, 2018, the District and H.A. Lewis entered into a
written prime contract (“Contract”) for a construction project known as the
Tower Repair project at John Marshall High School (project no. 23A10590)
(“Project”). (Cross-Compl., ¶ 5.) The District alleges that H.A. Lewis
“breached the Contract by, without limitation, failing to timely and properly
perform work on the Project, failing to properly coordinate work on the
Project, including the work of its subcontractor R&R, and failing to timely
and properly deliver and/or furnish materials to the Project site.”
(Cross-Compl., ¶ 17.) 
The District further alleges in the Cross-Complaint that “H.A. Lewis
is obligated to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless, among others, the
District pursuant to, without limitation, Article 6.53 of the General
Conditions of the Contract.” (Cross-Compl., ¶ 23.) The District alleges that it
“has incurred, and continues to incur, necessary and reasonable attorneys’
fees, consultant fees, and other costs in connection with R&R’s Complaint
and Stop Payment Notice, H.A. Lewis’ breaches of Contract, and in prosecuting
the instant Cross-Complaint,” and that “[b]y reason of the foregoing, the
District is entitled to defense and indemnity from H.A. Lewis.” (Cross-Compl.,
¶¶ 25-26.) 
The
District now moves for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint.
H.A. Lewis and U.S. Specialty
filed a response to the motion, stating, inter alia, that they “do not
oppose the granting of the DISTRICT’s Motion for Leave to File a First Amended
Cross-Complaint.” (Response at p. 4:2-3.) 
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1),
“[t]he court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper,
allow a party to amend any pleading.” Amendment may be allowed at any time
before or after commencement of trial. ((Id., § 576.) “[T]he court’s
discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the
pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in
which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” ((Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 [internal
citations omitted].) “If the motion to
amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the
opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend….” ((Morgan v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of critical
evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.)
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (¿¿Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a).)¿¿ The motion must
also state what allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, by page,
paragraph, and line number.  (¿Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd¿. (a).)
Finally, “¿[a] separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify: (1)¿The effect of the amendment; (2)¿Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)¿When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4)¿The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.¿” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)  
The
District submits a “copy of the District’s proposed First Amended
Cross-Complaint showing the revisions and additions to the District’s original
Cross-Complaint in redline form.” (Rayburn Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) The proposed
First Amended Cross-Complaint adds a third cause of action for disgorgement
pursuant to Business and Professions Code section
7031(b). ((Ibid.) The proposed First Amended
Cross-Complaint also adds additional factual allegations. (Ibid.)  
In the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint, the District alleges, inter
alia, that “R&R failed to replace Rennie Tejeda, the qualifier on its
license, within 90 days of his disassociation by death as required by Business and Professions Code section 7068.2(a), which
resulted in the automatic suspension of R&R’s contractor’s license on or
about 90 days after December 25, 2018.” (Rayburn Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A, ¶ 46.) The
District alleges that “R&R was therefore not a licensed contractor at any
time while performing work on the Project.” (Rayburn Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A, ¶ 47.)
The District further alleges that “[p]ursuant to Business
and Professions Code section 7031(b), the District is entitled to recover
all sums it paid to H.A. Lewis for work performed by R&R, an unlicensed
subcontractor, on the Project. Further, H.A. Lewis’ affirmative claim in this
action against the District for recovery of monies purportedly still owed to
R&R for its work on the Project is barred as a matter of law pursuant to,
without limitation, Business and Professions Code
section 7031(a).” (Rayburn Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A, ¶ 49.) 
In his supporting declaration, the District’s counsel states that
“[t]he District did not discover that R&R was unlicensed during the Project
until Rennie Tejeda’s death certificate was produced pursuant to a subpoena to
the Los Angeles County Registrar/Recorder in this case in October 2023.” (Rayburn
Decl., ¶ 11.) The District asserts that “the new allegations against H.A. Lewis
are necessary and proper as they will allow the District to fully adjudicate
its claims related to the Project and will allow all of the parties to this
action to fully adjudicate their respective claims and/or defenses.” (Mot. at
p. 7:17-19.) 
As set forth above, in their response, H.A. Lewis and U.S. Specialty state that they
“do not oppose the granting of the DISTRICT’s Motion for Leave to File a First
Amended Cross-Complaint.” (Response at p. 4:2-3.) 
Based on the foregoing, and in light of the lack of any
opposition, the Court finds that the District has demonstrated good cause to
file the proposed First Amended-Cross-Complaint.    
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the District’s
motion for leave to file First Amended
Cross-Complaint is granted. The Court orders the District to file and serve its
First Amended Cross-Complaint
within three days of the date of this order. 
The District is ordered to give notice of this order.
