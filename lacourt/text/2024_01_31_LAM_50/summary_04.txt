And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, she is providing notice that if either party believes she is biased, they may file a verified statement of disqualification under CCP 170.3(c)(1) by February 5, 2024. The Case Management Conference is continued to February 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
