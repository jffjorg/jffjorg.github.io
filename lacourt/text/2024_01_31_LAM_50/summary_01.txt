And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet grants the Los Angeles Unified School District's motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The District's original Cross-Complaint alleged that H.A. Lewis, Inc. breached the prime contract for a construction project at Marshall High School. The District has proposed adding a new cause of action for disgorgement pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 7031(b), alleging that R&R Masonry, an unlicensed subcontractor, failed to replace its qualifier, resulting in the automatic suspension of its contractor's license. The District also alleges that it is entitled to recover all sums it paid to H.A. Lewis for work performed by R&R Masonry, an unlicensed subcontractor. The Court finds that the District has demonstrated good cause to file the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint and grants the motion.
