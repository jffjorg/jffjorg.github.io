JOSHUA T. MARCUSON,
 
                        Plaintiff(s),
            v.
GENERAL
  MOTORS, LLC., et al , 
                        Defendant(s).


 
  Case No.: 23STCV24458
 
    DISCLOSURE AND ORDER
 



            
Judge
Beaudet hereby discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband
purchased a pickup truck for her husband’s use that he recalled was either a
Dodge or Chrysler pickup; Judge Beaudet does not remember the maker of the
pickup.  The pickup developed electrical
problems.  Judge Beaudet’s husband took
the pickup in to the dealer many times for the same electrical problem.  The pickup was tested with some device while it
was operating, and eventually, the manufacturer and the dealer agreed to take
the pickup back and refund the purchase price. 
No litigation was involved.  Judge
Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or
against either party.  However,
if you believe differently, you will have until February 5, 2024, to file and
serve a verified statement of disqualification per section CCP 170.3(c)(1) (the
“Statement”).  If you do not file and
serve a Statement, grounds for recusal will be deemed waived. The hearing on the
Case Management Conference will be continued to February 13, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 50 unless
both parties waive the right to file the Statement. Plaintiff is ordered to
give notice of this Disclosure to any new parties who are added to the case and
to file proof of service of same promptly after service, with a courtesy copy
delivered to Department 50. Any new party has 14 calendar days from the date of
service to file and serve the Statement per section CCP 170.3.
DATED:  January 30, 2024                                           _____________________________
                                                                                     Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet
                                                                                 Judge, Los Angeles Superior Court
