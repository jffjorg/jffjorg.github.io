And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge Beaudet discloses that 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. To avoid any potential bias, Judge Beaudet provides an opportunity for the parties to file a statement of disqualification per CCP 170.3(c)(1). If a party believes Judge Beaudet's experience will cause her to be biased, they must file and serve the statement by February 5, 2024. If no statement is filed, grounds for recusal will be deemed waived. The Case Management Conference will be continued to February 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement.
