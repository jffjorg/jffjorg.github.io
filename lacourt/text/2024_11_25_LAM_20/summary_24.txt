And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to transfer venue from the current court to the Alameda County Superior Court. The defendants, Shidong Jia and Predicine, Inc., seek to transfer the venue based on Code Civ. Proc. ยง 397, which allows the court to change the place of trial if it would promote the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice. The defendants argue that Predicine's principal place of business is located in Hayward, California, and that the alleged wrongful acts occurred in Predicine's Hayward office. They also point to a relocation bonus of $100,000 that was given to the plaintiff to move from Los Angeles to Hayward. The judge agrees to grant the motion and transfer the venue to Alameda County, as the defendants reside in Alameda and Santa Clara County, the alleged acts arose from the plaintiff's employment in Alameda County, and no evidence was provided to support the allegation that the plaintiff worked for the defendants in both Los Angeles County and Alameda County. The defendants also request $3,900 in sanctions, which the judge awards in the amount of $2,000.
