And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to demurrer filed by defendant Kevin Tsujihara. The plaintiffs, a group of investors, have filed a complaint alleging fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and other claims against the defendants. Tsujihara argues that the plaintiffs' claims for direct breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy to defraud are deficient. The judge agrees that the plaintiffs' claim for direct breach of fiduciary duty is barred under Delaware law and sustains the demurrer as to that cause of action. However, the judge overrules the demurrer as to the first cause of action, which alleges fraudulent misrepresentation, finding that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded their claims. The judge grants the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint as to the fourth cause of action, which alleges breach of fiduciary duty.
