And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Gohar's Motion to Compel Jila to provide further discovery responses because the Motion is moot. Jila had already provided supplemental responses to the discovery requests after the Motion was filed. Additionally, the Judge found that Gohar failed to meet and confer in good faith with Jila. Jila had requested a written meet and confer correspondence in June 2023, but Gohar provided it on August 3, 2023, at 5:26 PM, when Jila's counsel was unavailable due to vacation. The Judge also found that Gohar's separate statement was deficient because it provided incorrect numbers for the discovery requests at issue. The Judge declined to award sanctions and instructed the moving party to give notice.
