And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving unpaid attorneys' fees and an outstanding loan. The plaintiff, Thris Van Taylor, A Law Corporation, and Thris Van Taylor, filed a complaint against the defendant, Katie Little, alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract. After judgment was granted on the pleadings for the second through eighth causes of action, only the breach of contract claim remains.

The plaintiffs are seeking to compel a further response to a special interrogatory regarding the location of funds, but the defendant objected based on Civil Code ยง 3295(c), which prohibits discovery of financial condition as it relates to punitive damages. The judge found that the objection lacks merit because punitive damages are no longer at issue and the interrogatory does not seek information revealing financial condition.

However, the judge also found that the interrogatory is not relevant or could lead to admissible evidence and denied the motion. The court also declined to award sanctions. The moving party is required to give notice of the ruling.
