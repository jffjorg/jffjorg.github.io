And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action, where the plaintiff, Martin Ansoorian, seeks to quash business record subpoenas issued to his current and prior employers by the defendant, Tesla Motors, Inc. The subpoenas seek documents relating to various employment-related topics, including hiring, termination, compensation, job performance, and complaints. The judge has determined that the motion is not late, despite the defendant's argument that it was served too close to the production date. The judge has also determined that the subpoenas are overbroad, and has limited the scope of document production for the plaintiff's current and prior employers. The motion to quash is granted in part, and the defendant is ordered to comply with the limitations on document production. The judge has declined to award sanctions and has ordered the moving party to give notice.
