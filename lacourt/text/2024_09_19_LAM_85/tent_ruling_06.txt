Simple Speed failed to provide a courtesy copy of its 66-page opposition in
violation of the Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order on Electronic
Filing.  The court has exercised its
discretion to read and consider only Simple Speed’s opposition memorandum and
supporting declarations but not its exhibits. 
For this reason, the court need not consider ADD’s objection to Exhibits
E and F.  See Reply at 3-4.


[2] Although ADD never
informed Soto of the nature of the meat product, the bill of lading required
that the reefer temperature be set to -20° Fahrenheit.  Soto had adjusted it to only 27° Fahrenheit
due to First Star’s inaccurate instructions. 
Soto Decl., ¶10; Espinoza Decl., ¶12.
