is not to suggest that LAPD may not be held responsible when it unduly delays
an administrative hearing and, as such, be guilty of unlawful conduct.  But the Petition alleges no facts concerning
the reasons for the Board of Rights delay while Petitioners were on
administrative leave.

argues that, if a statute is subject to interpretation, as Petitioner contends,
the action cannot then also be a ministerial duty.  Reply at 4. 
This contention is unsupported by any of the cited authorities and is
untrue.  A statute or ordinance that is
properly interpreted to impose a ministerial duty does so.
