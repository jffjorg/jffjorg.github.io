And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case between ADD and Simple Speed. Simple Speed failed to provide a courtesy copy of its 66-page opposition, which is in violation of the Presiding Judge's order. As a result, the court will only consider the opposition memorandum and supporting declarations, but not the exhibits. Additionally, the court will not consider ADD's objection to Exhibits E and F. The judge also notes that Soto, a representative of ADD, was never informed of the nature of the meat product, which is relevant to the case. The judge is currently considering the opposition and will issue a final ruling at a later date.
