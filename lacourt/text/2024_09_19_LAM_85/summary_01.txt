And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus filed by Marlon Bellini, seeking to overturn the decision of the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB) that he is ineligible for family leave unemployment compensation benefits.

The Judge found that Bellini failed to present a full and fair statement of facts supported by citations to the Administrative Record, and therefore the court must disregard the facts as unsupported. The Judge also found that Bellini did not meet his burden of proof to show that CUIAB abused its discretion in upholding the denial of his claim.

The Judge noted that Bellini's claim was denied because he did not provide a certified birth certificate for his son, and he did not register his son's birth with Los Angeles County. The Judge also found that the documents Bellini submitted did not satisfy the requirements of section 2708(c)-1 of the California Code of Regulations.

The Judge ruled that the Petition is denied, and ordered CUIAB's counsel to prepare a proposed judgment and serve it on Bellini for approval as to form.
