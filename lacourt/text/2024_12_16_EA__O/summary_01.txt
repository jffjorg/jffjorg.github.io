And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The case is a lemon law case, and the plaintiffs filed suit on June 30, 2022. The defendant filed its motion on February 9, 2023, and the plaintiffs filed their opposition and reply. The court has previously continued the hearing due to the ongoing appeal of the Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, and it continues to do so in this case. The judge has determined that the motion to compel arbitration is continued due to the reliance of the plaintiffs on the Ford Motor Warranty Cases, which is still on appeal.
