Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in the case of DONGYI (USA) TRADING GROUP, INC. vs. SUNSHINE EDUCATION ACADEMY (corporation) and Wenying Sun (CEO and General Manager of Sunshine). The case arises from a partnership dispute, where Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Sunshine transferred the $200,000 investment to herself and other third parties without justification. The Plaintiff seeks default judgment against the defendants in the total amount of $239,994.23. However, the judge denies the application for default judgment without prejudice due to insufficient evidence of the $200,000 payment made to the defendants. The judge notes that while the Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence that the individual defendant, Wenying Sun, directed the harm, the application is denied due to the lack of evidence to support the claim.
