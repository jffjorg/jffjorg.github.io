Background
 
This case
arises from a partnership dispute. Plaintiff DONGYI (USA) TRADING GROUP, INC.
alleges the following against Defendant SUNSHINE EDUCATION ACADEMY
(corporation) (“Sunshine”) and Wenying Sun (“Sun”) (collectively, “Defendants”):
Plaintiff was established in 2017 and it later determined to invest an
education business in Southern California. In November 2018, Plaintiff and
Defendant Sunshine entered into an Investment Agreement whereby Plaintiff
agreed to invest $200,000 in Defendant Sunshine for 51% its shares; Sun (CEO
and General Manager of Sunshine) is a 49% shareholder of Sunshine. In 2022,
Plaintiff requested Defendants to provide certain financial documents of
Sunshine because Plaintiff was preparing a non-immigration petition for its
owner to enter the United States. 
However, Defendant Sun had refused to produce them. 
 
On November
2, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit for: 
 
1.     Breach of Fiduciary Duty
2.     Shareholder’s Derivative Action for
Damages Due to Breach of Fiduciary Duty
3.     Accounting—Request for Appointment of
Receiver
 
On November
9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) for:
 
1.     Breach Of Fiduciary Duty
2.     Shareholder’s Derivative Action For
Damages Due To Breach Of Fiduciary Duty
3.     Accounting – Request For Appointment
Of Receiver
4.     Fraud
5.     Conversion
6.     Restitution Based On Unjust Enrichment
 
On June 1,
2023, Defendants Sunshine and Sun filed an answer.
 
On August 16,
2023, Plaintiff filed amendments to the complaint/fictitious/incorrect name
naming the following defendants: US Sunshine
International Group, a California corporation, Sunshine Medias, Inc., a
California corporation (Defendant), Sunshine Boarding School, a California
corporation), World Celebrity Club, a California corporation, and World
Federation Of Youth Literary Art, a California nonprofit corporation. 
 
On November 30, 2023, the court discharged the Order to Show Cause Re:
Plaintiffs Failure to Appear on October 4, 2023, and the Order to Show Cause
Re: Why the Court Should not Dismiss this Case in its Entirety for Lack of
Prosecution. 
 
On January 31, 2024, the court conducted its IDC; there was no
appearance by Defendants.[1]

 
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motions.
 
On April 16, 2024, the court heard the Motion to Compel Defendant Sunshine
Education Academy’s Form Interrogatories Set No. One And Request For Monetary
Sanctions (Set By The Court) And Motion To Compel Defendants Wenying Sun And
Sunshine Education Academy’s Request For Production Of Documents Set No. One
And Request For Monetary Sanctions. The granted the motions and ordered that “Documents
and complete responses to interrogatories are to be produced within 60 days of
this order.” (April 16, 2024 Minute Order, emphasis added.)[2] 
 
On July 16, 2024, the court held an IDC Re: Deposition; MSC; and CMC. The
minute order provides, in relevant part, the following: “The Court and Counsel
confer re: discovery sought by Plaintiff's Counsel, specifically with regard to
the Court Order made on April 16, 2024. The Court states it has read and
considered the minute order dated April 16, 2024, documents and complete
responses to interrogatories are to be produced within 60 days of this order.
After conducting the Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), the issues remain
unresolved. Plaintiff is now permitted to file formal discovery motions and is
to contact court staff for scheduling/reservation dates. Defense Counsel [Andion]
represents to the Court that he intends to file a motion to be relieved as
counsel.” (Minute Order, emphasis added.)  
 
On July 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed a instant motion for terminating sanctions and default
judgment.
 
On August 12,
2024, Counsel Andion filed a motion to be relieved as counsel as to Sunshine
and Sun. 
 
On September
17, 2024, the court held its hearing regarding the foregoing motions. The court
granted Counsel Andion’s motion to be relieved as counsel. The Motion for
Terminating Sanction of Default Judgment was granted “but the amount of
judgment is to be determined pending Plaintiff's Application for Default
Judgment.” (See 9/17/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On October 8,
2024, the court clerk entered default as to defendants.
 
On October 9,
2024, the court issued a Nunc Pro Tunc Order stating in relevant part the
following: “The Answer of SUNSHINE EDUCATION ACADEMY, a California corporation,
Defendant on the Amended Complaint (1st) filed by DONGYI (USA) TRADING GROUP,
INC.., a California corporation on 11/09/2022, filed herein on 05/01/2023 is
ordered stricken and the default is entered this date. The Answer of WENYING
SUN, Defendant on the Amended Complaint (1st) filed by DONGYI (USA) TRADING
GROUP, INC.., a California corporation on 11/09/2022, filed herein on
05/01/2023 is ordered stricken and the default is entered this date.”
 
On October
10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application for entry of default
judgment.
 
On November
12, 2024, the court continued the hearing to 12/16. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the total amount of $239,994.23 against both
defendants ($200,000 in damages, $37,534.23 in interest, $2,400 in attorney
fees, and $60 in filing fee).[3] 
 
At the outset, the court notes that Plaintiff’s
request for entry default judgment against the individual defendant based upon
her role as the sole owner of the corporation is proper. While directors
or officers do not incur personal liability for corporate torts merely because
of their official position, they may be liable should they participate in the
wrong or authorize or direct that it be done. (United States Liab. Ins. Co.
v. Haidinger-Hayes (1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 595; see also Wyatt v. Union
Mortg. Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 773, 785.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff states that “[f]rom the limited amount of information obtained, it became clear that
the $200,000 investment into Sunshine Education Academy was transferred within
one month by Defendant Wenying Sun to herself and other third parties without
justification.” (Gao Decl., p. 3.) Thus, based
off the financial records produced during discovery, Plaintiff has provided
sufficient evidence that the individual defendant directed the harm. 
 
That said, the
application is denied for the lack of sufficient evidence as to the $200,000
investment. It is up to
plaintiff to “prove up” the right to relief, by introducing sufficient evidence
to support his or her claim. Without such evidence, the court may refuse to
grant a default judgment for any amount, notwithstanding defendant's default. (Taliaferro
v. Hoogs (1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 559, 560; Holloway v. Quetel (2015)
242 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1434-1435.)  
 
Here, however, no deposit of sorts has been submitted to substantiate
that Plaintiff did indeed make a $200,000 payment to Defendant. And according to the complaint, Plaintiff’s owner
lives in China such that it is presumed any money was electronically
transferred for there to be a paper trail/record to submit as evidence. Thus, the application for default
judgment is denied for that reason. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the default judgment application is denied without prejudice for
insufficient evidence.
