And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses a dispute between Plaintiff's Counsel and the court regarding the response period for a Initial Disclosure Conference (IDC) brief. According to Counsel's declaration, he did not attend the IDC hearing on 1/31/24 because he believed that if Plaintiff deposed Sun, supplemental discovery responses would be unnecessary, and the IDC would be taken off the calendar. However, Plaintiff's Counsel later filed the IDC brief with the court and served it upon Counsel Andion. The judge's tentative ruling initially intended to give 30 days for responses, but instead gave 60 days. The JUD-100 form does not provide a total amount. The dispute revolves around Plaintiff's Counsel's disagreement with the 60-day response period given by the court.
