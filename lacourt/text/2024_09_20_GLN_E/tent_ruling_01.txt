For an order compelling Defendant Richard
Valenzuela to provide responses to the request for production of documents (set

PLEASE
TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that Plaintiff will also move and seek an award of monetary

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES,
INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
fails to serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand may move
for an order compelling response to the demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). (CCP
§2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver
on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer”
requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to
hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
TENTATIVE
RULING
On
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel, Reyes Valenzuela, propounded Plaintiff,
Guadalupe Castrellon’s, Demand for Production of Documents and Other Tangible
Things, Set One, on Defendant Richard Valenzuela. Plaintiff’s counsel argues
that the responses were due on May 21, 2024.
As
of the date of Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, on August 20, 2024, Plaintiff
had not received responses to the instant discovery request. 
Therefore,
ordinarily, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses would be granted because
Defendant did not provide responses within 30 days of service of the discovery
request.
However,
it appears based on Defendant’s Exhibit 3 in opposition, that Defendant
provided responses to the instant discovery request on September 3, 2024. [The
Court notes that the instant motion was filed on 8/21/2024; therefore, the
responses provided by Defendant on September 3, 2024 would have been provided
after the filing of this motion.]
The
Court also notes that Defendant’s opposition is confusing and that it is
unclear what Defendant’s opposition seeks to argue. Defendant asserts all kinds
of arguments that are entirely irrelevant for his opposition. 
For
example, Defendant argues that Plaintiff propounded similar discovery that has
minor, indistinguishable variations, on a different Defendant (Valenzuela
Properties). Presumably, although not clear, Defendant is attempting to argue
that since similar discovery was propounded on a different Defendant
(Valenzuela Properties), and since Plaintiff received the responses from the
other Defendant (Valenzuela Properties) in May 2024, Plaintiff already has the
instant discovery responses with respect to the Defendant here, Richard
Valenzuela. The Court finds this argument irrelevant. The instant discovery
requests pertain to Defendant Richard Valenzuela, not Valenzuela Properties. It
does not matter that similar discovery was propounded on Defendant Valenzuela
Properties and that Valenzuela Properties provided responses. 
Defendant
also attempts to argue about how the demands were repetitive and onerous. This
argument is unavailing and not rooted in any legal authority. 
Defendant
also argues that Plaintiff spent an inordinate amount of time on this motion.
The Court notes it is unclear what Defendant is arguing here. Defendant fails
to explain why this is legally relevant or what this argument is attacking.
The
Court will hear argument because although Defendant attaches Exhibit 3 in his
Opposition that seems to indicate that responses to the instant discovery were
provided on September 3, 2024, which is after the filing of this motion, Defendant
does not explicitly argue that the instant motion is moot. It is unclear what
Defendant’s Opposition is arguing. Since it appears Defendant provided
responses after the filing of this motion, the Court is inclined to deny the
motion as moot, with respect to compelling responses, but not with respect to
sanctions.
Further,
it doesn’t help that Plaintiff did not submit a Reply.
At
the hearing, it is possible that Plaintiff explicitly argues the motion is not
moot. In Opposition, Defendant notes how it made an objection to Richard
Valenzuela’s personal tax returns. The Opposition does not indicate which
specific request this is. However, since Plaintiff moved for compelling
responses without objection, Plaintiff may argue at the hearing that since an
objection was served somewhere in the initial responses, Defendant should be
ordered to provide responses without objections because the responses were
untimely and a motion for relief from waiver of objection was not filed.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). (CCP
§2031.300(a).)
Sanctions
In
relevant part, CCP § 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff
seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,460.00 against Defendant Richard
Valenzuela and his attorney of record, Dan M. Shapiro.
Plaintiff
bases this request on: (1) An hourly rate of $400.00; (2) Four hours in
preparing this motion; (3) Three hours spent reviewing the opposition and
preparing a Reply; (4) 1.5 hours appearing at the hearing; and (5) $60.00 for
filing the motion.
The
Court will hear argument as to sanctions. In no explicit or clear manner does
Defendant oppose the sanctions request; it is unclear if Defendant is opposing
the sanctions request. At best, the only portion of the opposition that can be
construed as to attacking sanctions is that Defendant argued that Plaintiff
spent an inordinate amount of time on this motion.
The
Court notes that Plaintiff’s counsel requested time for preparing a Reply;
however, no Reply was submitted to the Court.
