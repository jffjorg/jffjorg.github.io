And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to grant a protective order to prevent Jane Doe from having to answer special interrogatories 36-244 and requests for admissions 36-79 propounded by William Clyde Allen. The judge finds that Allen did not justify the additional discovery requests and that they are not relevant to the subject matter of the case. The judge also finds that Jane Doe has shown good cause for the protective order and that Allen's arguments in opposition are not persuasive. The judge will hear argument on the issue of sanctions, which Jane Doe is seeking in the amount of $3,000.
