And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is granted and the action is stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration. The plaintiff, Jiaoning Shang, opposed the motion on the grounds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply to the arbitration agreement and that the agreement is unconscionable. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's arguments were unavailing. The judge noted that the parties agreed to be bound by the FAA in the arbitration agreement and that the agreement was not unconscionable, as it did not force the plaintiff to arbitrate in a location that would cause a financial burden or waive his right to bring representative claims under the California Private Attorney's General Act of 2004 (PAGA). The judge also found that the agreement did not waive the ability to pay the arbitrator's fees and costs, as required by law. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action pending the conclusion of arbitration.
