```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel responses is moot, with respect to compelling responses, because Defendant Richard Valenzuela provided responses to the discovery request after the filing of the motion. However, the judge is inclined to deny the motion as moot, with respect to sanctions, because Defendant did not explicitly argue that the instant motion is moot. The judge also notes that Plaintiff did not submit a Reply to the opposition.

The judge finds Defendant's opposition to be confusing and unclear, and therefore, the judge will hear argument as to sanctions. The judge notes that Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $3460.00 against Defendant Richard Valenzuela and his attorney, Dan M. Shapiro, based on the time spent preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, and appearing at the hearing.

The judge will hear argument as to whether Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions, and whether Defendant's failure to serve timely responses constitutes an abuse of the discovery process. The judge also notes that Plaintiff's counsel requested time for preparing a Reply, but no Reply was submitted to the Court.
