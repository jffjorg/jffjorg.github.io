TENTATIVE RULINGS – MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Jane Doe, filed the instant action on 1/25/2022. Plaintiff alleges that she is
the victim of childhood sexual assault. (Compl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff alleges the
abuse started during the 1996/1997 school year when she was fourteen years old
in her freshman year of high school and that it continued until approximately
the end of 2000. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges she was victimized by Defendant
William Clyde Allen, a Los Angeles USD long-term substitute teacher. (Compl. ¶
10.)
 
Of the six causes of action in the
Complaint, the first cause of action for childhood sexual assault and the
second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are the
two causes of action alleged against Defendant William Clyde Allen.
 
MOTION 1
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Plaintiff
JANE DOE (“Plaintiff”) will move the Court for a protective order that
Plaintiff need not answer the entirety of Special Interrogatories, Set One, on
the grounds that Plaintiff will suffer unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§
2030.090(b), 2030.090(b)(1), and 2030.090(b)(2). Alternatively, should the
Court deny the relief requested, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court
limit her responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 34, 35, 110, 111, 114, 115,
116, 117, 217-225, of Set One.
Plaintiff will also move the Court for a protective
order that the number of special interrogatories is unwarranted, contrary to
the representations made by Defendant William Clyde Allen in his declaration of
necessity as required under C.C.P. § 2030.050. (C.C.P. §
2030.090(b)(2)). Moreover, pursuant to Code of Civil Proc. § 1708.5.5
minor consent to sexual abuse is not a defense, therefore Allen’s
interrogatories suggesting Plaintiff consented to his abuse are improper and
harassing. Similarly discovery concerning the plaintiff's sexual conduct with
individuals other than the alleged perpetrator is impermissible without a
showing of good cause. Code of Civil Proc. § 2017.220. 
 
Plaintiff will also move the Court for an order of
monetary sanctions as against Defendant William Clyde Allen, in the amount of
$3,000 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.090(d). 
This Motion is made and based on the grounds that
Defendant William Clyde Allen propounded more than 35 specially prepared
interrogatories that are not relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action and do not relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking
discovery or of any other party to the action as required by Code of Civil
Procedure § 2017.010.
 This motion
will be based upon this Notice, the attached Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, the records and files in this action, and on such further oral
and/or documentary evidence which may be presented at the time of the hearing.”

ANALYSIS
SROGs 36-244
Under CCP § 2030.030(a)(1) a party may propound
thirty-five specially prepared interrogatories. Although 2030.040(a) explains
how a party may propound a greater number of specially prepared interrogatories
by attaching a declaration meeting the requirements of 2030.040(a), CCP
§2030.040(b) explains how if the responding party seeks a protective order on
the grounds that the number of specially prepared interrogatories is
unwarranted, the propounding party shall have the burden of justifying the
number of these interrogatories.
“If the responding party seeks a protective order on
the ground that the number of specially prepared interrogatories is
unwarranted, the propounding party shall have the burden of justifying the
number of these interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.040(b).)
One of the grounds on which Plaintiff moves for a
protective order is that the number of special interrogatories is unwarranted.
As stated in CCP § 2030.090:
(a) When interrogatories have been
propounded, the responding party, and any other party or affected natural
person or organization may promptly move for a protective order. This motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
(b) The court, for good cause shown,
may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or other natural
person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include, but
is not limited to, one or more of the following directions:
(1) That the set of interrogatories,
or particular interrogatories in the set, need not be answered.
(2) That, contrary to the
representations made in a declaration submitted under Section 2030.050, the
number of specially prepared interrogatories is unwarranted.
(3) That the time specified in
Section 2030.260 to respond to the set of interrogatories, or to particular
interrogatories in the set, be extended.
(4) That the response be made only on
specified terms and conditions.
(5) That the method of discovery be
an oral deposition instead of interrogatories to a party.
(6) That a trade secret or other
confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed
or be disclosed only in a certain way.
(7) That some or all of the answers
to interrogatories be sealed and thereafter opened only on order of the court.
(c) If the motion for a protective
order is denied in whole or in part, the court may order that the party provide
or permit the discovery against which protection was sought on terms and
conditions that are just.
(CCP § 2030.090(a)-(c).)
Here, as to SROGs 36-244, the Court fails to see how
Defendant met his burden under 2030.040(b) in justifying the number of
additional interrogatories.
As stated in CCP § 2017.010:
Unless otherwise limited by order of the
court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery regarding
any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,
if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Discovery may
relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other
party to the action. Discovery may be obtained of the identity and location of
persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the
existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any
document, electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other
property.
(CCP § 2017.010.)
The Court admits that the
scope of discovery appears to be very broad based on 2017.010.
In opposition, Defendant
submits the declaration of William Clyde Allen. This declaration appears to address
some, but not all, of the SROGs numbered 36-244. For those of the SROGs between
36-244 that Defendant does in fact address, the Defendant provides explanations
why he thinks the requests are relevant, but these explanations do not help the
Court at all. These explanations explain why Defendant believes them to be
relevant, but Defendant does not root his arguments in any sort of legal
authority as to how they are legally relevant for his defense of the two causes
of actions that are alleged against him in the Complaint. Therefore, the Court
does not find that Defendant met his burden in justifying the additional SROGs
numbered 36-244.
1-35
Plaintiff
also argues that the 244 SROGs that were propounded should not be answered
because Plaintiff will suffer unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression,
or undue burden. Plaintiff argues that the SROGs are oppressive and burdensome
in that they revictimize Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that they are entirely
irrelevant to the limited claims against the Defendant.
The Court will hear
argument as to SROGs 1-35.
The difficulty the Court
faces in analyzing SROGs 1-35 is that when a party moves for a protective order
under 2030.090(b), that subsection sets out the standard of “for good cause
shown.” 
Therefore, unlike SROGs
36-244, which it appears Defendant would have the burden in justifying, SROGs
1-35 appear to be governed by Plaintiff showing good cause for the basis for
her protective order.
It appears as if
Plaintiff has shown good cause in the sense that it is entirely unclear to the
Court how these requests are relevant.
However, since the scope
of discovery is broad, the Court will require further argument before finding
that 1-35 are irrelevant. The Court notes that, in Opposition, Defendant’s
explanations as to why any these requests are relevant are confusing and nonsensical
at times; none of Defendant’s arguments as to why the requests are relevant are
rooted in legal authority explaining why the requests would help in
establishing a defense to the two causes of actions asserted against him.
Meet and Confer
The
Opposition’s argument that Plaintiff did not met and confer before filing this
motion is unavailing. 
TENTATIVE RULING
MOTION 1
The
Court is inclined to grant the protective order as to SROGs 36-244 and find
that Plaintiff does not have to answer SROGs 36-244 on the basis that Defendant
did not justify the additional SROGs.
As to SROGs 1-35, the
Court is also inclined to grant the protective order and find that Plaintiff
does not have to answer SROGs 1-35. Plaintiff appears to have demonstrated good
cause for the protective order in that the SROGs are entirely irrelevant, and
Defendant’s arguments are borderline incomprehensible because they are not
rooted in legal authority explaining the relevance of the requests.
Sanctions
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion for a protective order under this section, unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2030.090(d).)
Plaintiff requests
sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00. Plaintiff’s counsel argues that sanctions
are warranted because the 244 SROGs were designed to revictimize Plaintiff by
directing her to respond to SROGs that suggest she was a gifted minor and
therefore capable of consenting to Defendant’s sexual abuse as part of his
unconventional teaching methods. 
Plaintiff’s counsel does
not provide an explanation as to how the number $3,000.00 was reached in the
request for sanctions.
Defendant argues
sanctions should be denied because he acted with substantial justification in
propounding discovery. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s case makes hundreds of
allegations against Allen, and propounding 244 SROGs is a reasonable expense.
Defendant also argues sanctions are unjust due to his financial situation and
that the filing of this action has already imposed financial sanctions on Allen
because it prevented him from obtaining employment that would help him improve
his financial situation. 
The Court will hear
argument.
MOTION 2
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Plaintiff
JANE DOE (“Plaintiff”) will move the Court for a protective order that
Plaintiff need not answer the entirety of Defendant William Clyde Allen’s
Request for Admissions, Set One, on the grounds that Plaintiff will suffer
unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2033.080(b), 2033.080 (b)(1), and 2033.080
(b)(2).
Plaintiff will also move the Court for a protective
order that the number of requests for admission is unwarranted, contrary to the
representations made by Defendant William Clyde Allen in his declaration of
necessity as required under C.C.P. § 2033.050. (C.C.P. § 2033.080(b)(2)). 
Moreover, pursuant to Code of Civil Proc. § 1708.5.5
minor consent to sexual abuse is not a defense, therefore Allen’s requests
suggesting Plaintiff consented to his abuse are improper and harassing. 
Plaintiff will also move the Court for an order of
monetary sanctions against Defendant William Clyde Allen, in the amount of
$3,000 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.080(d). 
This Motion is made and based on the grounds that
Defendant William Clyde Allen propounded more than 35 requests for admissions
that are not relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action and
do not relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any
other party to the action as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 2017.010. 
This motion will be based upon this Notice, the
attached Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the records and files in this
action, and on such further oral and/or documentary evidence which may be
presented at the time of the hearing.”

TENTATIVE
RULING MOTION 2
The moving and opposing arguments of
both parties in this motion are nearly identical to the arguments asserted in
Motion 1, except this motion pertains to RFAs.
Similarly
here, under § 2033.040(b), when the responding party seeks a protective order
on the ground that the number of RFAs is unwarranted, the propounding party
shall have the burden of justifying the number of requests for admission.
As to RFAs 36-79,
and as explained in the Court’s analysis with respect to SROGs 36-244,
Defendant does not appear to meet his burden in justifying the additional number
of RFAs. Defendant provides explanations why he thinks the RFAs
are relevant, but these explanations do not help the Court at all. These
explanations explain why Defendant believes them to be relevant, but Defendant
does not root his arguments in any sort of legal authority as to how they are
legally relevant for his defense of the two causes of actions that are alleged
against him in the Complaint. The Court is inclined to grant the protective
order as to RFAs 36-79 and find that Plaintiff does not have to answer RFAs
36-79 on the basis that Defendant did not justify the additional RFAs.
As to RFAs
1-35, the Court is also inclined to grant the protective order and find that
Plaintiff does not have to answer RFAs 1-35. Plaintiff appears to have
demonstrated good cause for the protective order in that the RFAs are entirely
irrelevant, and Defendant’s arguments in opposition are borderline
incomprehensible because they are not rooted in legal authority explaining the
relevance of the requests.
The Court
does not find Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff did not meet and confer to be
availing. 
Sanctions
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a
protective order under this section, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2033.080(d).)
Plaintiff
requests sanctions of $3,000.00. The Court incorporates its section in Motion 1
pertaining to sanctions into this section on sanctions as the parties asserted
identical arguments.
The Court
will hear argument.
