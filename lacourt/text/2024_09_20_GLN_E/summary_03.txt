Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside default filed by Defendant Jubilio Escalera. The motion is based on the argument that the alleged service of the summons and complaint was not proper, as Escalara did not reside at the address where substitute service was effectuated. The Judge has granted the motion to set aside default because the Plaintiff has stated that it does not oppose setting aside the default. The Judge has also scheduled a hearing to discuss the issue of service of summons and whether it should be quashed due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The Judge notes that the Defendant has included a proposed answer to the Verified Complaint with the moving papers, which suggests that he intends to participate in the action and makes it unnecessary to quash service of summons.
