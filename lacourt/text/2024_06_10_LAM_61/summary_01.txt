And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the Plaintiffs' motion to compel compliance with the August 10, 2023 order. The Plaintiffs, CV Communities, LLC and City Ventures LLC, moved to compel the Defendant, ANTELOPE VALLEY-EAST KERN WATER AGENCY, A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ENTITY, to comply with the August 10, 2023 order. The court found that the August 10, 2023 order was limited to the specific requests presented by the Plaintiffs and that the court was not empowered to grant relief except as to those requests. The court also found that the Defendant had failed to produce a privilege log and settlement communications, but that the Defendant had produced all responsive documents. The Plaintiffs' motion was denied because there was no basis to conclude that documents responsive to the requests were being withheld pursuant to privilege.
