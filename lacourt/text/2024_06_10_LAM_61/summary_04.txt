And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

Plaintiff Sylvia Santiago's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is DENIED.

The proposed amendment would add allegations related to a disparate impact theory of discrimination, which is barred by applicable case law. The proposed amendment is time-barred and does not relate back to the original charge. The court finds that the proposed amendment would be futile and denies the motion.

The court notes that the proposed amendment would occasion expansive discovery demands and related motion practice, and that the parties would be spared much trouble and expense if the court rules upon the sufficiency of the amendment in this motion.
