And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Daniel Moore, moves to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and to Deem Matters Admitted against defendant Maria Litwin. The plaintiff served the discovery requests on October 6, 2023, and the responses were due by December 16, 2023. However, no responses were provided. The defendant claims that the failure to provide responses was due to medical issues affecting their counsel. The court denies the plaintiff's motions as moot since responses have been provided. The court also declines to impose sanctions, finding that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was substantially justified by the medical issues.
