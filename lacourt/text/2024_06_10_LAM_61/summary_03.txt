And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies plaintiff Daniel Moore's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, requests for production, and to deem matters admitted against defendant Marta Litwin. The motions are denied as moot since defendant has since provided the requested responses. The ruling also declines to award sanctions to plaintiff, finding that defendant's failure to provide timely responses was substantially justified by medical issues affecting defendant's counsel.
