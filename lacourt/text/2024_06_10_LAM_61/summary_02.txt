And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Brandon C. Murphy's motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant and cross-complainant David Bogner. The motion was filed on behalf of Murphy, who seeks to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the client's refusal to participate in the litigation. The Judge notes that while the proof of service was initially missing, Murphy has since filed a proof of service indicating service of the client and parties on May 9 and 10, 2023. However, the Plaintiff has objected to the failure to serve Bogner at his current residence or business address and to the failure to list future hearing dates in the proposed order. The Judge agrees with the Plaintiff that the order to be entered and served upon the client must contain the motion to compel hearings currently set for July 16, 2024, and August 6, 2024, as well as the Mandatory Settlement conference set for October 22, 2024. The notice must likewise include pending due dates for discovery, if any, and the address where responses must be sent.
