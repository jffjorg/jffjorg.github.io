I. BACKGROUND   A. Factual  On July 3, 2024, Petitioner, Amalia Martinon  (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition to Assign Case Number for Purpose of Discovery  Motions against Respondent, James River Insurance Company (“Respondent”).    On March 14, 2024, Petitioner asserts that she served  Respondent with Set Two discovery including Form Interrogatories, Set Two and  Requests for Admission, Set Two. Specifically, Petitioner contends that Request  for Admission Nos. thirty (30) and thirty-one (31) seek an admission or denial of  the proposition that Edgar Jeske was at fault for the incident and whether  Edgar Jeske was partially at fault for the incident. Petitioner also states  that a response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 was also requested.    On April 16, 2024, Petitioner received Respondent’s  responses to Requests for Admissions and Form Interrogatories, Set Two, but  Respondent did not admit Requests for Admissions Nos. 30-31. On May 20, 2024,  Petitioner emailed Respondent’ counsel a meet and confer letter regarding  Respondent’s non-code compliant discovery responses. On May 28, 2024,  Respondent subsequently served further discovery responses, including further  responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 and Requests for Admission Nos. 30-31.  That same day, Petitioner’s counsel sent Respondent’s counsel a meet and confer  letter and Respondent’s counsel stated further responses would only be provided  for Special Interrogatory No. 22 and Request for Production of Documents No.  24.    On July 11, 2024, counsel further met and conferred  regarding Respondent’s further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 and  Requests for Admission Nos. 30-31. Further, the parties agreed to participate  in an IDC and ultimately granted Petitioner an extension to file Motions to  Compel Further responses to September 13, 2024. The IDC took place on August  27, 2024. During that IDC, Petitioner is under the impression that Respondent’s  counsel possessed indicated Respondent possessed information from its experts  regarding determination of liability, but that despite that information,  Respondent’s response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 failed to incorporate  Respondent’s legal position including its experts’ opinion and rests solely on  Respondent’s understanding that it does not have personal knowledge of the  incident.    On September 5, 2024, Respondent’s counsel stated in  an email that in light of the IDC, Respondent finds their responses to be  code-compliant and that Respondent would not be amending its responses.  Petitioner asserts she is asking Respondent to take a stance on liability in  this case and state who it is placing at fault for the incident. Petitioner  emphasizes that Respondent has two (2) countervailing lawsuits and is trying to  argue that simultaneously Mr. Edgar Jeske as well as Petitioner are at fault  for this incident.    Thus, Petitioner is seeking an order from this court  to compel Respondent to promptly serve full and complete further responses to  the discovery requests without objection and any objections in its responses  should be ordered and deemed stricken.     B. Procedural                On September 13, 2024, Petitioner filed these Motions to  Compel Further Responses. On October 9, 2024, Respondent filed an opposition  brief. On October 21, 2024, this Petitioner filed a Notice of Continuance. On  November 15, 2024, Petitioner filed a reply brief.     II. ANALYSIS   A.     Legal  Standard     A party must respond to  interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,  subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide  timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling  responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party  also waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege  or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is  no time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than  the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer  efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the  discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.  v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Under Code of Civil Procedure  § 2033.280(c), the court shall make the order deeming the truth of the matters  admitted unless the responding party serves before the hearing a proposed  response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with  Code Civ. Proc § 2033.220. Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.220 requires that  each answer either admits, denies or specifies that the responding party lacks  sufficient information or knowledge. As stated in Demyer v. Costa Mesa  Mobile Home Estates, the moving party is not required to meet and confer  before bringing this action. (Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates,  36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395.)¿¿Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,  subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a  monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to  pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a  result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to  respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿    B.     Discussion                Here, after discussions during and  earlier unreported IDC about similar topics, Petitioner has now formally moved  to compel further responses to Requests for Admission, Set Two Nos. 30 and 31  as well as Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 as it pertains to those Requests for  Admission.    ““[S]ince  requests for admissions are not limited to matters within personal knowledge of  the responding party, that party has a duty to make a reasonable investigation  of the facts before answering items which do not fall within his personal  knowledge. (Lindgren v. Superior Court (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 743, 746  [47 Cal.Rptr. 298]; Chodos v. Superior Court (1963) 215  Cal.App.2d 318, 323 [30 Cal.Rptr. 303]).” (Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014)  228 Cal.App.4th 729, 751–752, . . . quoting Smith v. Circle P Ranch Co. (1978)  87 Cal.App.3d 267, 273, 150 Cal.Rptr. 828.) The duty imposed is only to have  made a reasonable investigation. Respondent’s original responses it stated that  “[a] reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in this particular request has  been made, and that information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to  enable Responding Party to admit.” Further, in the supplemental responses, it  provides an even clearer answer that “[i]t is Responding Party’s  understanding that the traffic collision report has placed Claimant at fault  for the accident. A trier of fact has not determined the factual dispute.  Discovery and investigation is [sic] ongoing.”  The Court  interprets the motion to compel as a formal attempt to have the Court rule on  Respondent’s objections.  To over simplify  the law, CCP section 2033.220(b) and (c) require a party responding to a  Request for Admission to choose from among 3 options: admit, deny or state the  responding party lacks sufficient information to admit or deny after reasonable  inquiry.  Petitioner’s response elected  option 3, after stating objections.   Similar to a very recently published appellate  decision, if the responding party’s “objections are ignored, it is clear his  substantive answers were far more ‘complete and straightforward’ than not. (§  2033.220, subd. (a).)”   (Katayama v. Continental Investment Group  (2024) 105 Cal.App.5th 898, 326 Cal.Rptr. 297, 306.)  Here, were the Court to ignore Respondent’s  objections, it would find the substantive response that follows to substantially  comply with Section 2033.220.  But this  is motion to compel a further response and the Court overrules the objections  to RFAs 30 and 31.  The Court also  overrules the objection asserted to each sub-part of form interrogatory  17.1.   No further response needs to be ordered to  either the RFAs nor the FROG, because stripped of the overruled objections, the  verified substantive responses are Code-compliant and shall stand.   C.     Sanctions   The  court does not find good cause to grant Petitioner’s Requests for Sanctions of  $1,925 per motion. The Court finds Respondent had a good faith dispute regarding  the matters asserted by objection, the substantive response is found by the  Court to be substantially in compliance with the statutory requirements for RFA  and FROG responses, and there is thus substantial justification for the  Respondent’s position.    III.  CONCLUSION               Respondent’s objections to the three  discovery responses in question are overruled but eh substantive responsive  that follow shall stand.  Sanctions  requests from both parties are denied at this time. Unless waived by both  sides, Petitioner shall give notice of the Court’s rulings.
