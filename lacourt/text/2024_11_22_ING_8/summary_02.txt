The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The motion was filed by Petitioner Amalia Martinon against Respondent James River Insurance Company. The judge has overruled Respondent's objections to certain requests for admission and form interrogatories, finding that the substantive responses provided by Respondent substantially comply with the statutory requirements. The judge has denied Petitioner's requests for sanctions and has ordered that the verified substantive responses shall stand. The judge has also denied Petitioner's request for monetary sanctions. The parties are ordered to give notice of the court's rulings.
