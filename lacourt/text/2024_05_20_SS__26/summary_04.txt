Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration, which was filed on February 8, 2024. The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which allows a party to request reconsideration of a prior ruling based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. However, the Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling if the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court also requires diligence in presenting new or different information, which the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate.
