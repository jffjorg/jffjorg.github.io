ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Aspire
General Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile
subrogation against Defendant Martha Orozco aka Martha Orozco Lopez (“Defendant”)
on June 7, 2021. Defendant filed an answer on November 5, 2021. On October 21,
2022, Plaintiff filed a copy of its
settlement agreement with Defendant with a request for dismissal and retention
of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.4. The Court granted
the request for dismissal with retention of jurisdiction on December 6, 2022.
(Order for Dismissal, 12/06/22.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce
Settlement and Enter Judgment on March 12, 2024. No opposition has been filed
to date.
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement here complies with the statutory
requirements set forth above because it was signed by both parties’ attorneys.
(Stip and Order, filed 10/21/22, p. 5.)
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed. (Stip
and Order, filed 10/21/22, ¶9.) Therefore, the Court finds that the parties’
settlement agreement is enforceable, and the request for the Court’s retention
of jurisdiction is proper, under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
The settlement agreement provides
that Defendant would pay Plaintiff $7,860.00 by way of $4,860.00 from
insurance, followed by monthly payments starting on November 1, 2022. (Id.
at ¶¶2-3.) The settlement agreement also provides that if Defendant defaults, judgment
in the demand of the complaint ($11,746.22), plus costs and interest from June
7, 2021, less monies paid, may be entered in Plaintiff’s favor. (Id. at
¶¶1, 5-6.) Defendant made total payments in the amount of $4,960.00 and
thereafter defaulted. (Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶5.) Plaintiff seeks an order
entering judgment against Defendant based on the demand of the complaint in the
amount of $6,786.22 less monies paid ($11,746.22 - $4,690.00), $1,818.34 interest
that accrued at ten percent per annum from June 7, 2021, and $225.00 costs. (Id.
at ¶6.) The request to enter judgment in the above amount is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Aspire General
Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement Agreement
and Enter Judgment is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $6,786.22 PRINCIPAL, $1,818.34 INTEREST,
AND $225.00 COSTS.
