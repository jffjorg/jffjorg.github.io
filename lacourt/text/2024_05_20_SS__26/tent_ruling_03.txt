ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Emeka
V. Peter (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed the instant action for numerous
causes of action against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Defendant”),
erroneously sued as Cedars Sinai Health Ventures, on December 21, 2022.
Following Defendant’s filing of a demurrer and motion to strike with respect to
the Complaint, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint on February 28,
2023. Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike with respect to the First
Amended Complaint on April 20, 2023. The demurrer and motion to strike came for
hearing on July 7, 2023 but the unlimited jurisdiction court did not rule on
the motions. Instead, the case was transferred to the limited jurisdiction
court. (Minute Order, 07/07/23.) On January 23, 2024, the Court sustained the
demurrer with respect to all causes of action except negligence. (Minute Order,
01/23/24.) 
 
Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One; and (3) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set
One, Admitted, on April 23, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff on July
20, 2023. (Motions, Watson Decl., Exh. A.) Following Plaintiff’s failure to
respond and a meet and confer effort, Defendant re-sent the discovery requests
on January 17, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶5-6 and Exh. B.) On February 21, 2024,
Plaintiff requested a 30-day extension of the time to respond, which Defendant
granted. (Id. at ¶7 and Exh. B.) As of the filing of these Motions, no
responses have been served. (Id. ¶8.) 
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling
Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without
objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against
Plaintiff.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One; and (3) Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF EMEKA V. PETER IS TO SERVE
VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’
NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
