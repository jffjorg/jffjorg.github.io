**Significant Statements**

- "A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings."
- "A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack, or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable."
- "A right of contribution may be enforced only after one tortfeasor has, by payment, discharged the joint judgment or has paid more than his pro rata share thereof."
- "The survival statutes do not create a cause of action. Rather, they merely prevent the abatement of the cause of action of the injured person, and provide for its enforcement by or against the personal representative of the deceased."
