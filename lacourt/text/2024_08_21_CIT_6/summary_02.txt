Summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Defendant Bolun Zhang's motions for terminating sanctions, dismissing the Second Amended Complaint against him and All Good Escrow, Inc. with prejudice. The ruling is based on Plaintiff Weijun Zhang's failure to comply with discovery requests and court orders, and his failure to pay monetary sanctions. The Court finds that Plaintiff's actions are willful and that lesser sanctions will not produce compliance. The Court also notes that Plaintiff's lack of opposition to the motions is a tacit admission that the defendants' arguments are meritorious.
