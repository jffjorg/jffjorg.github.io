BACKGROUND 
This is a
real property dispute. On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff Weijun Zhang (Plaintiff)
filed this action against Defendants Bolun Zhang (Bolun), Jinghan Zhang
(Jinghan), All Good Escrow, Inc. (All Good), Taikoo Supply Chain, Inc. (Taikoo)
(collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 20. On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against the same Defendants,
alleging causes of action for promissory fraud, breach of oral contract,
rescission of contract pursuant to Civil Code § 1689(b), breach of covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, conversion, actual fraudulent conveyance,
constructive fraudulent conveyance, quiet title, common count: money had and
received, breach of fiduciary duty, imposition of constructive trust, and civil
theft under Penal Code section 496(c). 
On June 24, 2024, Bolun moved for terminating sanctions based on
Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s May 9, 2024 order regarding Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. On
July 15, 2024, Bolun filed amended versions of the same motions. On July 25,
2024, All Good joined Bolun’s motions. The motions are unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
The court is authorized, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
to impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence
sanctions, terminating sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030,
subds. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing
the action of the party that brought the action. (Id., § 2023.030, subd.
(d)(3).) 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination. [Citation.]” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (Doppes); see J.W. v.
Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th
1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) “Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what
is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’” (Id.) “But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky); Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702, quoting Doppes
and Mileikowsky.) 
The court should consider the totality of the circumstances,
including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful, the
determent to the propounding party, and the number of formal and informal
attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th
1225, 1246.) Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are
justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express
finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the
required discovery responses. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118 (Fairfield).) The party who
failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the
failure was not willful. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
788 (Deyo); Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)
Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.010, subdivisions (d) and
(f) provide that a misuse of the discovery process includes, but is not limited
to, “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery”
and “[m]aking an evasive response to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subds. (d), (f).) 
PRELIMINARY
ISSUE
            The Court notes that Bolun filed
two separate motions for terminating sanctions based on two separate sets of
written discovery. All Good then joined each of Bolun’s motions, but based on
two other separate sets of written discovery. However, the Court’s May 9, 2024
order was one order, as was the June 4, 2024 order. (See Order re Tentative
Ruling (5/9/24); Order re Tentative Ruling (6/4/24).) Motions for terminating
sanctions are tied to court orders, not separate sets of discovery requests.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) Accordingly, the Court will
construe these motions as one motion.
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer 
Although meeting and conferring is generally not required before
bringing a motion for terminating sanctions, this Court does request that
parties attempt to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or video conference
before filing any motions. (See Dept. 6 Courtroom Information, p. 2.) While the
Court appreciates that counsel for Bolun at least sent an email before bringing
these motions, (Tanji Decls., Ex. D), the Court requests meeting and conferring
be conducted in person, by telephone, or video conference, as the Court finds
those methods more effective than letters or emails, (see Dept. 6 Courtroom
Information, p. 2). The Court finds the meet-and-confer efforts of All Good’s
counsel to be satisfactory. (Kinney Decls., ¶ 7.) 
            Analysis 
            Defendants Bolun Zhang and All Good
Escrow, Inc. (collectively, “Moving Parties”) seek terminating sanctions dismissing
the Second Amended Complaint against them, or issue and evidentiary sanctions
in the alternative. Bolun also seeks $2,160.00 in monetary sanctions for each
motion. Moving Parties contend that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s
May 9, 2024 and June 4, 2024 orders directing Plaintiff to provide responses to
the Moving Parties’ respective discovery requests and to pay monetary sanctions. 
            The Court finds
that terminating sanctions are appropriate here. Plaintiff has had more than
enough time to provide responses to the Moving Parties’ discovery requests. Bolun’s
discovery requests were served on January 16, 2024, (Tanji Decls., ¶ 3, Ex. A),
while All Good’s discovery requests were served on March 28, 2024, (Kinney
Decls., ¶ 3, Exs. 1-2). Plaintiff failed to respond, to which the Court
subsequently granted Moving Parties’ discovery motions, ordering Plaintiff to
provide responses within 20 days of the Court’s orders and to pay monetary
sanctions. (Order re Tentative Ruling (5/9/24); Order re Tentative Ruling
(6/4/24).) Moving Parties gave notice of these rulings. (Notices of Ruling
(5/9/24); Notice of Ruling (6/7/24).) Plaintiff failed to comply with both
orders, and failed to respond to counsels’ inquiries, leading Bolun to file the
instant motions for terminating sanctions and for All Good to join Bolun’s
motions. Given
Plaintiff’s evident pattern of failing to comply with discovery obligations and
the Court’s orders, and the imposition of monetary sanctions, it is clear that
Plaintiff’s actions are willful, (Fairfield, supra, 246 Cal.App.2d at p.
118), and that lesser sanctions will not produce compliance, (see Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 787, 797; Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th
at p. 992.) 
The Court
further notes Plaintiff’s lack of opposition, which the Court construes as a
tacit admission that the Moving Parties’ arguments are meritorious. (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the
Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial
Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.
Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived
when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to
authority. [Citation.]”]) Plaintiff therefore has also necessarily failed to
demonstrate that Plaintiff’s noncompliance was not willful. (See Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788.)
            Accordingly, the Court grants the
motions for terminating sanctions and hereby DISMISSES this action as to Defendants
Bolun Zhang and All Good Escrow, Inc. per Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).) The
Court directs Bolun and All Good to each submit a proposed judgment for entry
of their respective dismissals from this action. The Court further notes that
this leaves only Defendants Jinghan Zhang and Taikoo Supply Chain, Inc. in this
action.
The Court declines to award Bolun’s requests for monetary
sanctions. While the Court understands that Defendant has had to incur fees in
connection with multiple motions due to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with
discovery and the Court’s prior orders, the Court finds the imposition of
terminating sanctions to be sufficient, and exercises its discretion to not
impose monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Bolun Zhang’s motions for terminating
sanctions. The Second Amended Complaint is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice as
to Defendants Bolun Zhang and All Good Escrow Inc. Defendants Bolun Zhang and
All Good Escrow, Inc. must each submit a proposed judgment of dismissal within
five days of this order. 
            Defendants Bolun Zhang and All Good
Escrow, Inc. are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five days
of this order.
