And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Jane Doe's motion to compel compliance with business records subpoena without prejudice. The judge found that Jane Doe has not shown good cause for the production of each document, and that the relevance of the unredacted information has not been demonstrated. The judge also expressed uncertainty about whether the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) completed its own investigation and relied on the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing for a determination regarding the credentialing of William Clyde Allen. The judge noted that Jane Doe has not shown that she has exhausted all options for obtaining criminal records and that the Commission is not the custodian of those records.
