And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Harvey Weinstein's motion to dismiss the case. The motion was filed after the judge granted an anti-SLAPP motion brought by Weinstein, striking all causes of action alleged against him. The plaintiff, Marisa Falero, opposes the motion. The judge has determined that the motion to dismiss is denied without prejudice because the plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal of the judge's ruling in the anti-SLAPP motion, which automatically stays all further trial court proceedings. The judge lacks jurisdiction until the appeal is resolved, and the court will not consider the motion to dismiss until then.
