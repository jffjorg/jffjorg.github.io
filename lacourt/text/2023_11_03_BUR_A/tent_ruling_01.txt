ALLEGATIONS: 
 
This case concerns a 2020
business dispute between Cross-Complainant Kathy Smith (‘Smith”) and Cross-Defendant
Arnold Abramyan. Smith has since settled her claims against all Cross-Defendants
save for the City of Los Angeles Department of
Cannabis Regulation and the City of Los Angeles Finance Department
(collectively “the City”). (See March 20, 2023 Minute Order for Non-Jury trial
and Final Status Conference.) Smith’s claims against the City include causes of
action for Cancellation of Documents, Declaratory
Relief, Equitable Indemnity, Contribution, Implied Indemnification, and Comparative
Indemnity.
 
On May 22, 2023,
the City filed a demurrer to Smith’s Cross-Complaint. The City demurs on the
grounds the entire complaint is uncertain and that each cause of action
asserted against them is factually deficient. The hearing was initially set for
August 4, 2023 but was continued to November 3, 2023 to allow Smith, currently
in pro per, time to secure counsel in the matter. 
 
Smith and the
City thereafter stipulated to continue the matter another four months, stating
Smith has still not retained counsel but soon would. Smith further stated her
proposed counsel would be unavailable on the November 3 hearing date but did
not submit any declarations of proposed counsel attesting to this fact. This
stipulation was rejected for failure to submit attorney declarations as to the
unavailability of counsel.  Plaintiff
thereafter never submitted the declaration requested.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (C.C.P. §
430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 318.) A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Id.)
 
A demurrer assumes the truth of all factual,
material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading. (Blank v.
Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 318.) No matter how unlikely or improbable,
the plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling
on the demurrer. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.  App. 3d 593, 604.) But this does not include contentions;
deductions; conclusions of fact or law alleged in the complaint; facts
impossible in law; or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take
judicial notice.  (Blank, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at 318.)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“C.C.P.”) §§
430.10(e) and (f), the party against whom a complaint has been filed may demur
to the pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or that the pleading is uncertain,
ambiguous and/or unintelligible. It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the
defect can be cured by amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles
(2003) 31 Cal. 4th 1074, 1082.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
The Court construes Smith’s
failure to oppose the Demurrer as an abandonment of the claims or an admission
the Demurrer has merit. (See Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133
Cal. App. 4th 1, 20 [failure to oppose issue raised in demurrer deemed
abandonment of the issue].)
 
Although the Demurrer is
unopposed, the Court finds that Smith should be given an opportunity to cure
the defects in the Cross-Complaint that were raised in the Demurrer. (City
of Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.)
 
Accordingly, the demurrer
is SUSTAINED with 20 days’ leave to amend. 
Parties may stipulate to an extension for filing an amended complaint
beyond the 20 days’ leave as permitted by the Court.
