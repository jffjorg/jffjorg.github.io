Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued to the Burbank Police Department by 10415 Commerce, LLC (Plaintiff) in a case against Hratchia Bardakjian (Defendant). The subpoena seeks video footage of an altercation between the parties on November 2, 2022. The Defendant argues that the subpoena is not relevant to the case and violates his privacy rights. The Plaintiff argues that the video is relevant to their attempts to inspect the property for waste and that Defendant's privacy concerns are overstated.

The Court agrees that the video is relevant to the case and that Defendant's privacy interests are not severe enough to preclude discovery. However, the Court is sensitive to Defendant's concerns and orders the production of the video with redaction of any identifying information relating to Defendant's family. The Court also orders that the video will be lodged with a discovery referee who will assure compliance with the Court's order concerning redaction.
