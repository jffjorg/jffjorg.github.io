And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the County of Los Angeles' motion for reconsideration of the court's previous ruling denying their motion for summary adjudication of the 7th cause of action for whistleblower retaliation. The defendant argues that they can bring a motion for reconsideration without meeting the statutory requirements, citing Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094. However, the court finds that the defendant does not add new facts or law and that the court in Francois specifically acknowledged that a party may not bring a motion for reconsideration without meeting the requirements of C.C.P. §437c and §1008. As such, the defendant's request is impermissible and the motion is denied.
