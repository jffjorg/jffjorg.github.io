Next
Day Appraisals, LLC’s and Brett Varon’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings for the second amended complaint of Plaintiffs Jonathan S. Powers,
individually and as attorney-in-fact for Phyllis A. Powers and Jonathan S.
Powers Roth IRA, and Henry Kreuter is granted as to the 2nd and 4th causes of
action with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Defendants Next Day Appraisals, LLC (“NDA LLC”) and Brett
Varon (“Varon”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”) demur to the to the second
amended complaint (“SAC”) of Plaintiffs Jonathan S. Powers (“Jon”),
individually and as attorney-in-fact for Phyllis A. Powers (“Phyllis”) and
Jonathan S. Powers Roth IRA, and Henry Kreuter (“Kreuter”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
on the basis Plaintiffs’ 2nd and 4th causes of action against them fail to
state causes of action against them due to the holding in Tindell v. Murphy,
which concluded that an appraiser owes no duty to third parties such as the
Plaintiffs.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §430.10(e).) 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
Moving Defendants’ 10/11/23 request for judicial notice of
the Varon Appraisal dated March 21, 2019 (with valuation as of January 11,
2019) is granted.  (D-RJN, Exh. A.)
 
Procedural
Background
          Plaintiffs
filed their complaint on September 15, 2022. 
Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint (“FAC”) on October 6,
2022.  On August 18, 2023, this Court
sustained demurrers to the FAC.  On
September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative SAC against Non-moving Defendants
Hightechlending, Inc. (“Hightechlending”), Equity Wave Lending, Inc. (“EWL”), Jack
J. Suddarth (“Suddarth”), Edith A. Moore (“Edith”), Gregory A. Moore (“Greg”),
Brian Hedger (“Hedger”), AAMC Orange County, Inc. (“AAMC”), Sandra K. Gramlich
(“Gramlich”), and Moving Defendants, alleging five causes of action: (1) breach
of fiduciary duty [against EWL and Suddarth]; (2) negligence [against
all Defendants]; (3) constructive fraud [against EWL and Suddarth];
(4) misrepresentation [against all Defendants]; and (5) fraudulent misrepresentation
and concealment [against Hedger]. 

Moving Defendants filed their Answer to Plaintiff’s initial
complaint on February 16, 2023.  Moving
Defendants filed their demurrer on October 11, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed their opposition on January
16, 2024.  Moving Defendants filed their
reply on January 18, 2024.
Plaintiffs object to Moving Defendants’ demurrer on the
basis that Moving Defendants waived their right to demur by filing their Answer
in February 2023.  (C.C.P. §§430.40(a),
435(b), 472(a); Pierce v. Minturn (1851) 1 Cal. 470; McDougall v.
Eaton (1912) 20 Cal.App. 164.)
C.C.P. §438
provides that a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be filed if the moving
party is a defendant, and the defendant has already filed his or her answer to
the complaint and the time for the defendant to demur to the complaint has
expired.  (C.C.P. §438(f)(2).)  Such a motion is the functional equivalent of
a general demurrer made after the time for demurrer has expired.  Accordingly, the Court will construe Moving
Defendants’ demurrer as a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiffs allege in March 2018, Jon and Phyllis were
presented with a secured loan investment opportunity and loan servicing
arrangement by their broker Suddarth and EWL. 
(SAC ¶17.)  Plaintiffs
allege Suddarth and EWL were broker agents for their principals,
Plaintiffs.  (SAC ¶17.)  Plaintiffs allege the real property in this
dispute are two vacant lots located at 3420 Dorothy Road, City of Calabasas,
County of Los Angeles, California (“Calabasas Property”) with Assessor’s Parcel
Numbers 2080-015-033 and 2080-015-034 and a legal description of: Lots 61 and
62 of Tract. No. 7094, as per map recorded in book 92, pages 64 and 65 of maps,
in the office of the county recorder of Los Angeles County.  (SAC ¶3.) 

Plaintiffs allege the investment opportunity presented by
Suddarth and EWL to Jon and Phyllis provided that Jon and Phyllis would provide
money for a secured loan to Hedger, and act as servicer of the loan secured by
the Calabasas Property.  (SAC ¶19.)  Plaintiffs allege in reliance on the
representations made by Suddarth, EWL, Greg, Edith, Hedger, and Hightechlending,
Jon and Phyllis invested $168,000 for the lending arrangement.  (SAC ¶19.) 
Plaintiffs allege Greg, Edith, and Hightechlending, as agents for
Hedger, falsely misrepresented Hedger’s income and value of the real property
security to Plaintiffs, by and through its agents.  (SAC ¶19.) 
 
          Plaintiffs
allege EWL hired two licensed California real estate appraisers, Gramlich and
AAMC in 2017 and Varon and NDA LLC in 2019, who failed to carefully and
diligently view and investigate the Calabasas Property and provide accurate
reports indicating that Calabasas Property would utilize an above ground septic
system and was not connected to a sewer system. 
(SAC ¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege this
error by Varon, Gramlich, NDA LLC, and AAMC materially impacted the
appraised value of the Calabasas Property causing an erroneous valuation of
$420,000 when in fact the appraised value should have been $100,000 market
value of the lots that provided security for the money loaned by Plaintiffs.  (SAC ¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege but for the failure
of Suddarth, EWL, Varon, Gramlich, Nextday, AAMC, Greg, Edith, and Hightechlending
to utilize due care and diligence regarding the valuation of the Calabasas
Property and proper vetting and investigation of Hedger, an accurate and
non-deceptive investment opportunity would have been presented to Plaintiffs.  (SAC ¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege but for Gramlich’s and
Varon’s failure to perform a careful and diligent investigation and appraisal
of the Calabasas Property, Plaintiffs would have been aware of the actual
market value of the Calabasas Property.  (SAC ¶24.) 
Plaintiffs allege they reasonably relied on the inaccurate
information provided by Suddarth, EWL, Gramlich, AAMC, NDA LLC, and Varon
regarding the valuation of the Calabasas Property.  (SAC ¶24.) 
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Moving Defendants demur to the 2nd and 4th causes of action in the SAC
on the basis the pleading fails to allege facts sufficient to state causes of
action against them due to the holding in Tindell v. Murphy, which dictates that an
appraiser’s representation of value is made only to the party retaining him or
her.  (Demurrer, pg. 3; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a), emphasis added.)  A
declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and
confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
The same meet and confer process required for filing a demurrer
must be followed before filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings under C.C.P.
§438.   (C.C.P. §439.)
Moving Defendants’ counsel’s declaration states that on September
19, 2023, he emailed Plaintiff’s counsel indicating the deficiencies in the
SAC.  (Decl. of Campo ¶2.)  Moving Defendants’ counsel declares the
parties were unable to resolve the issues. 
(Decl. of Campo ¶2.)  Moving
Defendants counsel’s declaration is insufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3)
because he did not meet and confer in person or by telephone, as required by
the statute.  However, failure to
sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4).)  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
In considering a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts consider whether the factual
allegations, assumed true, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  (Fire Insurance Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452-453.)  Since the
standard applicable to this motion is the same as that for a general demurrer (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064), the Court may grant it
if, from the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed,
it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P §438(d); Saltarelli &
Steponovich v. Douglas (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Negligence &
Misrepresentation (2nd & 4th COAs)

A cause of action for negligence
requires the following elements: (1) defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty;
(2) breached the duty; and (3) the breach caused (4) damages.  (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662.)  A complaint which lacks allegations of fact to
show that a legal duty of care was owed is fatally defective.  (See Jones v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950.)  The existence of a legal duty of care is
properly challenged by demurrer and is a question of law for the court.  (Hegyes v. Unjian Enterprises, Inc. (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1103,
1111.)
The essential elements of a misrepresentation
claim are (1) a representation; (2) knowledge of its falsity or disregard for
its truth; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting
damage.  (Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendants NDA
LLC, Varon, Suddarth, AAMC, and Gramlich failed to exercise due care in the
investigation and appraisal of the Calabasas Property and thereafter created
and distributed an erroneous appraisal report. 
(SAC ¶35.)  Plaintiffs allege it
was reasonably foreseeable that the appraisal report would be reviewed and
reasonably relied on by persons and/or entities such as Plaintiffs with
interest in the valuation of the Calabasas Property.  (SAC ¶35.) 

Plaintiffs allege NDA LLC,
Varon, AAMC, and Gramlich owed a duty as licensed real estate appraisers to
Plaintiffs as it was known that they would rely on the erroneous appraisal reports.
 (SAC ¶36.)  Plaintiffs allege NDA LLC, Varon, AAMC, and
Gramlich were required to exercise due care and diligence in performing real
property appraisal services as a similarly situated licensed real property
appraiser would exercise.  (SAC ¶36.)
Plaintiffs allege NDA LLC,
Varon, AAMC, and Gramlich failed to act carefully and with due diligence in the
performance of their appraisal services by failing to investigate and appraise
the Calabasas Property carefully and diligently and to not distribute erroneous
appraisal reports.  (SAC
¶37.)  Plaintiffs allege they were
harmed by the negligence of NDA LLC, Varon, AAMC, and
Gramlich.  (SAC ¶37.)
 Plaintiffs allege the negligence of NDA
LLC, Varon, AAMC, and Gramlich was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’
harm.  (SAC ¶37.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendants
represented to Plaintiffs that facts were true concerning the lending
transactions and/or appraisal value of the secured real property.  (SAC ¶50.)  Plaintiffs allege the representations
of Defendants concerning the lending transactions and/or appraisal value of the
secured real property were false.  (SAC ¶51.)  Plaintiffs
allege Defendants knew or should have known the representations were false.  (SAC ¶52.)  Plaintiffs
allege Defendants made the representations recklessly and
without regard for the truth.  (SAC
¶53.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendants
intended that Plaintiffs rely on the representations or should have known that
Plaintiffs would have relied on the representations.  (SAC ¶54.)  Plaintiffs allege they reasonably relied
on the representations of Defendants.  (SAC ¶55.)  Plaintiffs
allege they were harmed by the misrepresentations of Defendants.  (SAC ¶56.)  Plaintiffs allege their reliance on
Defendants’ representations was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’
harm.  (SAC ¶57.)  
An appraiser designated by a
lender to value its borrower’s collateral for financing purposes generally owes
its duty of care to the lender, not to the borrower.  (Greenwald & Bank, Cal. Practice
Guide: Real Property Transactions, Ch. 6-L, 6:701.)  Indeed, “[w]hether the lender conducts the appraisal in house or hires
an outside appraiser, the considerations are the same. The appraisal ordered by
the lender is for its own protections and the borrower has [their] own means of
ascertaining the desirability of the property.”  (Willemsen v. Mitrosilis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
622, 629 [noting borrower should know lender’s appraisal is intended
for lender’s benefit, not to ensure success of borrower’s investment]; see also Tindell v. Murphy (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1253-1254, [stating lender’s
appraiser had no duty of care to borrowers for inaccurate property description
as appraisal was intended to support lender’s evaluation of collateral, not
borrowers’ decision whether to purchase property].)
Here, Plaintiffs allege it was
reasonably foreseeable that Moving Defendants’ appraisal report would be
reviewed and reasonably relied on by persons and entities such as Plaintiffs
with interest in the valuation of the Calabasas Property.  (SAC ¶35.) 
Moving Defendants’ appraisal report was provided for Lender/Client
Atlantic Union, not for Defendant Hedger, identified as the Borrower, and most
importantly, not for Plaintiffs.  (D-RJN,
Exh. A.)  Here, as in Willemsen, there is no indication that Moving
Defendants were aware that Plaintiffs hoped to use the appraisal report at
issue as an investigational tool upon which to base their decision to approve
or reject the Calabasas Property when it was prepared for Atlantic Union, whose
relationship to EWL is not disclosed in the SAC.  (Willemsen, 230 Cal.App.4th at pg. 631.)  Unlike in Soderberg v. McKinney (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1760, where an appraiser knew
that a particular group or class of persons to which plaintiffs
belonged—potential investors contacted by a broker—would rely on his report in
the course of a specific type of transaction he contemplated—investing in a
deed of trust secured by the appraised property, Moving Defendants’ appraisal
report was prepared for Atlantic Union, not EWL, and certainly not for
Plaintiffs.  (Tindell, 22 Cal.App.5th at pg. 1254.)
Plaintiffs demonstrate
reasonable probability of amending their claim to clarify their complaint by
indicating who distributed the appraisal report to whom and who had knowledge
of the distribution of the appraisal report. 
Further, Plaintiffs can clarify the relationship between Atlantic Union
and EWL in commissioning the appraisal report of the Calabasas Property.
Accordingly, Moving Defendants’
motion for judgment on the pleadings on the 2nd and 4th causes of action is
granted with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendants’ motion for
judgment on the pleadings of the 2nd and 4th causes of action in Plaintiffs’ SAC
is granted with 20
days leave to amend as to the 2nd cause of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
