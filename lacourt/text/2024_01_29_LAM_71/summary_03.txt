Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by the defendants, Equity Wave Lending, Inc. and Brett Varon, against the plaintiffs, Jonathan S. Powers, Phyllis A. Powers, Jonathan S. Powers Roth IRA, and Henry Kreuter. The motion was granted as to the 2nd and 4th causes of action, which alleged negligence and misrepresentation by the defendants.

The judge found that the appraisal report prepared by the defendants was intended for the lender, Atlantic Union, and not for the plaintiffs, and therefore the defendants did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of amending their claim to clarify their complaint.

The judge granted the defendants' motion with 20 days leave to amend the complaint.
