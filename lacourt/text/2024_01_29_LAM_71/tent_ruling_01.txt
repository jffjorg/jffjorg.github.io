TENTATIVE RULING
 



MICHAEL
  BARNETT,  
  
         vs.
 
COUNTY
  OF LOS ANGELES.


 Case No.: 
  21STCV02175
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 29, 2024



 
Defendant
County of Los Angeles’ motion for reconsideration is denied.  
 
Defendant County of Los Angeles (“County”)
(“Defendant”) moves for this Court to sua sponte reconsider its ruling
denying Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the 7th cause of action
for Whistleblower Retaliation pursuant to Labor Code §1102.5.  (Motion, pg. 1; Le Francois v. Goel
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094.)
 
Discussion
C.C.P. §437c(f)(2) and §1008
prohibit a party from making renewed motions, unless those motions are based on
new facts or law. C.C.P. §§437c(f)(2), 1008(b).)  Here, Defendant does not add new facts, nor
does it argue that there is new law. 
Defendant instead argues that per Francois v. Goel (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1094, it can bring a motion for reconsideration without following the
requirements of the C.C.P.  
However, the Court in Francois
specifically acknowledges that a party may not bring a motion for
reconsideration without meeting the requirements of §437c and §1008:
We conclude that sections 437c, subdivision (f)(2), and 1008
prohibit a party from making renewed motions not based on new facts or law, but
do not limit a court's ability to reconsider its previous interim orders on its
own motion, as long as it gives the parties notice that it may do so and a
reasonable opportunity to litigate the question.
 
(Francois, 35 Cal.4th at pgs.
1096-1097.)
Defendant’s
request is impermissible.  Defendant
moves the court for reconsideration without meeting the statutory requirements
for doing so. Accordingly, this motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion for reconsideration is
denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
