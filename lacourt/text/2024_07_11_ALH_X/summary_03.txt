Here is a summary of the tentiative ruling in English:

The Court has denied Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the previous order denying their motion to compel further responses from Defendants Li Liu and Yan Chen. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not submitted new facts warranting reconsideration, and that the previous order was properly made. The Plaintiff had argued that the Court failed to consider an email from Defendant's counsel requesting a 60-day extension starting January 10, 2024, which would have made the motion timely. However, the Court finds that the email was sent on December 5, 2023, and that the Plaintiff's motions were still filed outside the extended deadline.
