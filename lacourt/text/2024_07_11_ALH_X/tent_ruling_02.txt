Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.
             
BACKGROUND
 
This
is a tenant harassment and habitability case. Plaintiff Victoria Lynet sued
defendants Jamie Lynn Raymond a/k/a Jamie Lynn Mills and Paul Raymond on January
3, 2023. Plaintiff filed her operative first amended complaint (FAC) as a
matter of right on July 24, 2023, asserting causes of action for:
 
            1.         Unlawful
Actions to Influence a Tenant to Vacate (Civ. Code, § 1940.2),
            2.         Breach
of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment,
            3.         Unfair
Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200),
            4.         Breach
of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,
            5.         Breach
of the Implied Warranty of Habitability,
            6.         General
Negligence,
            7.         Gross
Negligence,
            8.         Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, and
            9.         Breach
of the Implied Warranty of Habitability [duplicative].
 
(The
Court adopts the causes of action as they are labeled in the body of the FAC,
rather than the caption; for the fourth and ninth causes of action, the two
lists do not match.)
 
On September
14, 2023, Defendants each demurred separately to the FAC. On April 26, 2024,
Plaintiff opposed. On May 7, 2024, Defendants replied.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’
demurrers are sustained in their entirety, with leave to amend granted as to
all except the seventh and ninth causes of action.

LEGAL STANDARD
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10; Young v.
Gannon (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 209, 220.) 
 
When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations
stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5
Cal.3d 584, 591.) Put differently: for purposes of demurrer, the court treats
all facts alleged – but only the facts alleged – in the complaint as
true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 732.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            1.
The FAC Fails to State Any Claim
 
Plaintiff’s FAC does not satisfy fact pleading
standards. “A complaint,
with certain exceptions, need only contain a ‘statement of the facts
constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language’ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(1)) ...’ .” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins.
Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn.3.) Notwithstanding
that forgiving standard, “[t]o survive demurrer, a plaintiff
must set forth the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint a defendant with the nature, source,
and extent of his cause of action. (See Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972)
28 Cal.App.3d 714, 719.) 
 
Here, the only factual allegations in the FAC appear in
paragraphs sixteen (16) and seventeen (17). These paragraphs state the address
of Plaintiff’s unit and the date when Defendants’ tortious conduct allegedly
began. Otherwise they only list several ways in which the unit is uninhabitable
and accuse Defendants of “[m]aking a false report to an animal humane society”
about Defendant’s dog, “[r]epeatedly surveilling and intimidating Plaintiff”,
and “[p]ressuring Plaintiff to vacate and serving notices to vacate that do not
satisfy legal requirements.” (FAC, ¶ 17.)
 
Without further specifics, Defendants cannot prepare a
defense to these allegations. The FAC is fatally uncertain and fails to state any
claim.
 
The FAC is sufficiently specific to persuade the Court that
Plaintiff can supply more details upon amendment. The Court grants leave for
Plaintiff to do so, as to all except her seventh and ninth causes of action,
discussed below.
 
            2. Seventh
Cause of Action for Gross Negligence
 
Although “gross negligence” commonly has relevance in tort
actions where defendants raise assumption of risk as an affirmative defense, it
is not a standalone cause of action under California law. (See id. at
pp. 779-780, citing Continental Ins. Co. v. American Protection Industries
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 322; see also Jimenez v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc. (2015)
237 Cal.App.4th 546, 552, fn.3 [“California does not recognize a distinct
common law cause of action for gross negligence apart from negligence.”].) 
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the seventh cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend.
 
            3. Ninth
Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability
 
Plaintiff’s fifth and ninth causes of action are both described
in the body of the FAC as claims for breach of the implied warranty of
habitability. (The FAC’s caption describes them as claims under the Los Angeles
Municipal Code and a cause of action for punitive damages, but the body of the
complaint makes no reference to the Municipal Code under the relevant heading,
and punitive damages is not a cause of action.) Because the claims are plainly
duplicative, the demurrer to the latter is sustained without leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Defendants’
demurrers are sustained in their entirety, with leave to amend granted as to
all except the seventh and ninth causes of action.
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to file a second amended complaint within thirty (30) days of this
order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
