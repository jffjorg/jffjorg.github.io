And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrers of the defendants, Jamie Lynn Raymond a/k/a Jamie Lynn Mills and Paul Raymond, to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) of the plaintiff, Victoria Lynet. The FAC alleges causes of action for unlawful actions, breach of quiet enjoyment, unfair business practices, breach of good faith, and breach of implied warranty of habitability. However, the judge has found that the FAC does not state any claim due to its lack of factual specificity.

The judge has granted leave to amend the FAC, except for the seventh and ninth causes of action, which allege gross negligence and breach of implied warranty of habitability, respectively. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action without leave to amend, as gross negligence is not a standalone cause of action under California law. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the ninth cause of action, as it is duplicative of the fifth cause of action.

The plaintiff is ordered to file a second amended complaint within thirty days of this order.
