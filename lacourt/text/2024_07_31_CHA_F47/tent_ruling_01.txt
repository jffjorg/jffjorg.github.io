SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a Master Equipment Finance
Agreement (the Agreement) between Plaintiff Crossroads Equipment Lease and
Finance, LLC (Plaintiff) and Defendant Gold Standard Express LLC (Gold
Standard) and a Guaranty of that lease by Defendant Hermine Karapetyan
(Karapetyan).  
 
On or about 12/8/21, Gold Standard entered the Agreement with
Plaintiff to finance the purchase of a 2019 Peterbilt 579 tractor truck (the
Truck).  (Separate Statement (SS)
1).  Plaintiff perfected its interest in
the Truck by obtaining a Certificate of Title from the State of California
Department of Motor Vehicles.  (SS 2).  Also on 12/8/21, Karapetyan executed a
written Guaranty of Gold Standard’s past, present and future obligations to
Plaintiff, including those arising pursuant to the Agreement (the Guaranty).  (SS 8, 9). 
Plaintiff  has performed as
required under the Agreement.  (SS 3) 
 
Plaintiff alleges that on or about 4/30/23, Gold Standard
and Karapetyan (collectively, Defendants) breached the terms of the Agreement
by failing to make the monthly payment then due and owing thereunder.  (SS 4). 
Additionally, Defendants failed and refused and continue to fail and
refuse to make any further payments coming due under the Agreement.  Id. 

 
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, upon Defendants’
default, Plaintiff elected to accelerate the balance due thereunder, the
principal balance of which is $80,938.22 as of 10/27/23.  (SS 5). 
No part of this amount has been paid, despite demand therefore.  Id. 
There is now due, owing and unpaid from Defendants to Plaintiff, the
principal sum of $80,938.22, together with unpaid interest in the amount of
$7,224.57, late fees in the amount of $510.40 and costs and expenses in the
amount of $6,615.91 for a total owing in the amount of $95,289.09 as of 10/27/23,
in addition to interest thereon at the contract default rate of l8% per annum
thereafter, in an amount according to proof. 
Id.  The Agreement and
Guaranty also provide for the payment of reasonable attorney’s fees if legal action
is filed to enforce the terms of the Agreement. 
(SS 7, 10).
 
On 10/31/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Gold
Standard and Karapetyan (collectively, Defendants) for: (1) Breach of Written
Agreement, (2) Breach of Guaranty, (3) Account Stated, (4) Unjust Enrichment
and (5) Open Book Account.  On 12/27/23,
Karapetyan filed an answer to the complaint. 
On 1/4/24, default was entered against Gold Standard.  
 
Plaintiff subsequently recovered the Truck and sold it in
a commercially reasonable manner and recovered net sale proceeds therefrom in
the amount of $17,000.00, which have been applied to the amounts owing in this
action.  (SS 6).  
 
On 2/29/24, Plaintiff filed and served on counsel for
Karapetyan, by USPS mail, the instant motion seeking an order granting summary
adjudication of the 1st cause of action and 2nd cause of
action in the complaint in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants.  (See Proof of Service filed 2/29/24).  The motion was originally set for hearing on Monday,
6/3/24.  The proof of service for the
motion contained an incorrect zip code for Karapetyan’s counsel (91317
(incorrect) v. 91387 (correct)). 
Although no opposition or other response to the motion had been filed, on
Thursday, 5/30/24, a Substitution of Attorney form was filed on behalf of
Karapetyan substituting Karapetyan in as representing herself.  (See Substitution of Attorney filed
5/30/24).  Karapetyan appeared at the
6/3/24 and requested a continuance of the hearing to allow time to hire counsel
and oppose the motion which was granted with the Court continuing the hearing
to 7/31/24.  (See 6/3/24 Minute
Orders).  
 
Despite being granted a continuance to obtain counsel and
oppose the motion, Karapetyan has neither substituted in counsel nor filed an
opposition to the motion.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
the existence of a contract, Plaintiff s performance or excuse for
non-performance, Defendants’ breach, and damages to the Plaintiff.  See Reichert (1968) 68 C2d 822,
830.  Here, as set forth above, Plaintiff
has satisfied each of the required elements and Gold Standard has failed to
refute any of the evidence provided. 
Similarly, Plaintiff has established its claim for breach of guaranty
against Karapetyan as Karapetyan signed the personal guaranty with regard to
the Agreement to induce Plaintiff to enter the Agreement.  
 
Gold Standard has failed to respond to the action and
Karapetyan has failed to respond to the instant motion.  As such, Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication in its favor of the 1st cause of action for breach of
contract against Gold Standard and the 2nd cause of action for
breach of guaranty against Karapetyan.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Judgment will be entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Gold Standard
and Karapetyan, jointly and severally, as follows: Principal: $80,938.22;
Unpaid interest through 10/27/23: $7,224.57; Late fees through 10/27/23:
$510.40; Costs and expenses through 10/27/23: $6,615.91; Additional
repossession fees: $445.00; Reconditioning fees: $ 1,304.00; Credit for sale of
Truck: -$17,000.00; Post-sale interest to 02/20/24: $4,578.62: TOTAL:
$84,616.72.
 
Plaintiff may seek costs via a memorandum of costs.  Plaintiff may also seek an award of
attorneys’ by separate motion.
