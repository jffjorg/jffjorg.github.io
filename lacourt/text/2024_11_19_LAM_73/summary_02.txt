The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' Motion for Case Management Conference. A Case Management Conference is set for December 3, 2024. The judge finds that a Case Management Conference is necessary because there is no trial date set in this matter, and the case requires a conference to handle the setting of a trial date. The judge also notes that Defendant Montebello Town Center Investors, LLC (MTCI) was named as Doe 1 and the First Amended Complaint contains allegations against Doe 1, so MTCI was not dismissed by the filing of the First Amended Complaint.
