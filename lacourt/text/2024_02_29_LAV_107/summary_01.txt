Summary:

The judge, Hon. Eric Harmon, has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, S & K Health Services, Inc. The court has overruled the demurrer and allowed the unlawful detainer complaint filed by the plaintiff, J & J Properties - Corsa, LLC, to proceed. The court found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that the demurrer's arguments regarding uncertainty and ambiguity are without merit. The court also noted that the plaintiff is not required to plead all lease terms because the defendant presumptively possesses a copy of the lease and its terms are therefore presumptively within the defendant's knowledge.
