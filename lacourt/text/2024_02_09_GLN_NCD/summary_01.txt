And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by the defendants, Melanie Marshall, D.D.S., Inc. dba New Smiles Studio and Melanie Marshall, D.D.S. The motion seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's claims for medical negligence and lack of informed consent.

The Judge finds that the plaintiff has presented admissible expert testimony that raises triable issues of fact with respect to whether the defendants' conduct met the standard of care and whether those acts or omissions caused or contributed to the plaintiff's alleged injuries.

The Judge also finds that the plaintiff has presented admissible expert testimony that raises triable issues of material fact with respect to whether the plaintiff will be able to establish his cause of action for lack of informed consent.

Therefore, the Judge denies the motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The case will proceed to trial.

Additionally, the Judge overrules the plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the declaration of Gary R. Harmatz, D.D.S., FACD, FICD, FAGD.

The Judge also notes that the defendants' motion for summary judgment could have been withdrawn and that the plaintiff's opposition was served and filed on the same date, January 26, 2024, which means that the request for sanctions under CCP § 128.5 is denied.
