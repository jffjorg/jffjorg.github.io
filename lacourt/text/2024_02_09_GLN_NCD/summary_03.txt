Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

```
Case Number: 22GDCV00323
Hearing Date: February 9, 2024
Dept: NCD

Motions for Summary Judgment (2):
  - Moving Party: Defendant Stepanyan Surgical Arts Center and Martin Stepanyan, D.D.S.
  - Responding Party: Plaintiff Stepan Tashchyan

Relief Requested:
  - Order granting summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on plaintiff's five causes of action

Causes of Action:
  - Dental Malpractice - Breach of Standard of Care
  - Dental Malpractice - Negligent Misrepresentation
  - Dental Malpractice - Failure to Properly Keep or Provide Medical Records
  - Breach of Oral Contract
  - Specific Performance

Summary of Complaint:
  - Plaintiff alleges that in May 2019, he entered into an oral contract with defendants to provide dental care and procedures with guaranteed outcomes in exchange for payment.
  - Plaintiff alleges that defendants performed surgical procedures, but plaintiff experienced problems with the implants, including loosening and falling out.

Issues:
  - Issue 1: The First Cause of Action (Dental Malpractice - Breach of Standard of Care) is denied as there is no showing of breach of the standard of care.
  - Issue 2: The Second Cause of Action (Negligent Misrepresentation) lacks merit as there was no misrepresentation of material fact made to plaintiff, nor could plaintiff have reasonably relied upon the alleged misrepresentation.
  - Issue 3: The Third Cause of Action (Failure to Properly Keep and/or Provide Medical Records) is denied as defendants complied with Health and Safety Code ยง123110 and the Dental Board of California found Dr. Stepanyan had not violated the Dental Practices Act.
  - Issue 4: The Fourth Cause of Action (Breach of Oral Contract) is denied as plaintiff cannot establish a valid contract existed wherein Dr. Stepanyan made an express guarantee of a specific outcome.

Burden of Proof:
  - The burden of proof shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists with respect to each cause of action.
```

Note: The judge's tentative ruling is recommending denial of the motions for summary judgment/adjudication on all four causes of action, with the exception of the first cause of action (Dental Malpractice - Breach of Standard of Care), which is denied. The ruling notes that triable issues of material fact remain on at least one theory for each of the remaining causes of action.
