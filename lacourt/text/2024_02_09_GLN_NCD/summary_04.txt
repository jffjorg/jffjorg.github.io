```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the joint motion to dismiss or stay the complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens filed by defendants Allen Lund Company, GKJ Trans, Inc., and Tajinder Singh. The court finds that defendants have failed to establish that a suitable alternative forum exists, as they have failed to establish that all defendants are subject to jurisdiction in any alternative forum or are willing to submit to jurisdiction.

The court finds that the choice of forum by the plaintiff, Alphonso Luna, is entitled to deference and that California is a convenient forum for the litigation. The court notes that three of the four defendants reside and have their principal place of business in California, and that significant potential evidence and witnesses are located in California.

The court also finds that the public interest in California in deciding lawsuits against resident corporations whose conduct in this state causes injury to persons in other jurisdictions favors having the matter determined in this forum. The court denies the motion to dismiss or stay the complaint and orders the case to proceed in California state court.
