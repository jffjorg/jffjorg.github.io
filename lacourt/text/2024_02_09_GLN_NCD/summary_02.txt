And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a motion to compel the attendance and testimony of Alen Bejanyan, the defendant, at a deposition. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Armine Harutyunyan and Vadim Harutyunov, who are seeking to compel the defendant to attend a deposition and provide testimony. The court notes that the defendant has indicated a willingness to appear and testify at a deposition on a mutually agreed-upon date. The court orders the defendant to appear for a deposition and to provide testimony via video remote procedure on a mutually convenient date and time no later than March 8, 2024. The court will hear from both sides concerning whether the date should be scheduled within the next thirty days, or if the parties would prefer a longer window to have the opportunity to first complete mediation. The court denies the request for monetary sanctions sought by the moving parties.
