Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has reviewed the motions filed by Defendant Jay Nasser, seeking to compel verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One. The defendant asserts that Plaintiff Durel Lang failed to respond to the discovery requests. The plaintiff, however, claims that he served timely responses on April 15, 2024, after an open extension was granted.

The judge finds that the responses were timely, as the extension was granted and revoked on April 15, 2024. The responses contain only objections, which do not require verification. The court finds the responses to be substantially compliant. As a result, the motions are denied as moot.

The defendant also seeks monetary sanctions, but the court declines to award sanctions due to the ambiguity surrounding the extension dates. The plaintiff also does not request sanctions. The court denies the defendant's motions and orders the defendant to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
