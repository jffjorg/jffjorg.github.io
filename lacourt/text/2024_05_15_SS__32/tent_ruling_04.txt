HEARING DATE:


May
  15, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV17282




MOTIONS:  


(1)
  Motion to Compel Form Interrogatories, Set One
(2)
  Motion to for Order Deeming Facts Admitted 




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Jay Nasser 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Durel Lang  



 
BACKGROUND
 
 Defendant Jay Nasser (“Defendant”) now moves
for an order
to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One and to compel verified
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
propounded on Plaintiff Durel Lang (“Plaintiff”).
Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. Plaintiff opposes. No reply has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Requests
for Admission
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
The Discovery
Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of service of a
proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.220. The
courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual compliance with
all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not to be given the
stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in substantial
compliance. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
Additionally, RFA responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary v.
Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.)  However,
objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.)  
 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Interrogatories
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
905-906.)  
 
If a motion to
compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against
the losing party “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a). 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant asserts that he served Requests for
Admission, Set One and Form Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff on December 6,
2023. (Parsanj Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) The responses were due on January 9, 2024.
(Id. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff did not respond to the discovery. In opposition, Plaintiff
asserts he served timely responses on April 15, 2024 because Defendant granted
an open extension to respond to the discovery pending Plaintiff’s counsel’s
motion to be relieved. (Diamond Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. B.) The open extension was
granted on January 9, 2024 and revoked on April 15, 2024, the day responses
were served. (Diamond Decl. ¶ 2–7, Exh. A.) 
 
There appears to be a dispute of when the extension expired
since Plaintiff requested an open extension while his counsel’s motion to be
relieved was pending. On February 16, 2024, the Court denied the motion to be
relieved without prejudice; Plaintiff then re-filed the motion on April 15,
2024, set to be heard on May 31, 2024.  Defendant
has not filed a reply and sets forth no other evidence that he revoked the open
extension before April 15, 2024 or set a specific due date. Based on the email
exhibit provided by Plaintiff, Defendant granted an extension on January 9,
2024. (See Diamond Decl., Exh. A.) This directly conflicts with Defendant’s
assertion that the discovery was due on January 9, 2024. (See Parsanj Decl. ¶
4.) Therefore, the Court finds the responses were timely. 
 
 The responses
contain only objections, and as a result, do not need to be verified. (See Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.250(a); 2033.240(a).) The Court finds the responses to the
Request for Admissions to be substantially compliant. Therefore, since
responses have been served, the motions are denied as moot. 
 
Defendant
requests monetary sanctions. However, given that it appears the responses were
timely served, or at the very least, the due date was ambiguous, the Court
declines to award sanctions. The Court also declines to award sanctions to
Plaintiff
given the ambiguity around the extension. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motions to deem admitted
Requests for Admissions, Set One and to compel Form Interrogatories, Set One are DENIED. 
  
Defendant shall
provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
