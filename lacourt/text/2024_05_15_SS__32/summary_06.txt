And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling concerns a motion to reopen discovery filed by Defendant Ralphs Grocery Company in a slip and fall case. The Plaintiff, Roberto Espinosa, suffered a fall at one of the Defendant's grocery stores. The Defendant seeks to reopen discovery to obtain Plaintiff's mental health records, alleging that Plaintiff failed to disclose his treatment with the Los Angeles County Health Department for 20 years. The Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the Defendant did not diligently conduct discovery and that the requested records are not relevant to the case. The Court grants the motion in part, allowing the Defendant to obtain limited discovery surrounding the Plaintiff's mental health records with the Los Angeles County Health Department. The discovery cut-off date will run with the August 6, 2024 trial date.
