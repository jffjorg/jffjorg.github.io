And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the judge denies the petition for minors compromise filed by Crystal Spencer on behalf of Claimant Israel Mendez without prejudice. The judge's reasoning is that Petitioner must provide medical records and/or a medical report to verify Claimant's current condition. Additionally, Petitioner must provide attachment 12b(4)(c), a copy of the Medi-Cal letter, and complete item 10a and 10c. The judge also finds that the declaration in attachment 13a does not support the attorney fees sought. Furthermore, the judge notes that the proposed order appears to have errors in the medical reimbursement and seeks clarification. Finally, the judge requires Petitioner to mark box 18b and complete item 9a.
