And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the case, but failed to file proof of service of the moving papers as required by CCP §1014. As a result, the motion is summarily denied. The defendants are advised to submit on the tentative by sending an email to the court, providing the case number and identifying the party submitting. If a party fails to submit on the tentative, they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
