And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, LunaSol Holdings, LLC and Weststar Property Management, Inc. The plaintiff, Clara Castillo, alleges that the defendants are liable for negligence and premises liability due to injuries she sustained when a sliding glass door shattered.

The court has granted the defendant's demurrer, stating that the complaint does not state a cause of action. The court has also granted leave to amend the complaint if the plaintiff can plead specific facts showing that the defendant managed, maintained, or operated the property prior to purchase. The court has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of official records showing that the defendant purchased the property three days after the incident.

The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's allegations are implausible and that she failed to plead specific facts showing that the defendant had some sort of management or operation role in the property prior to purchase. The court has also held that a claim for premises liability can only be asserted against someone who owns, maintains, manages, or operates the property.
