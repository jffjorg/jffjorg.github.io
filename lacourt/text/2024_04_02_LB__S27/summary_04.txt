And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs, but reduces the requested amount of $41,350.59 to $28,026.51. The court agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff's billing for "canned" work is excessive and reduces it by 1/3. The court also finds that the pre-engagement work is compensable and will not reduce it to zero. The court denies the plaintiff's request for costs. The ruling is without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to seek recovery of costs in a manner permitted by the Rules of Court.
