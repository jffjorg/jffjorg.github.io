And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion to consolidate the two cases, 23LBCV00223 and 23LBCV01170, filed by Robert Joshua Rodrigo against Miguel Angel Gonzales, Mission Fleet Services, LLC, and Mike Gonzalez. The court finds that there are insufficient overlapping issues of fact or law to support consolidating the two actions. The court denies the motion to consolidate. The purpose of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary duplication of evidence and procedures, and to avoid inconsistent adjudications. However, in this case, the issues in each case are distinct, and the court does not find that consolidating the cases would promote trial convenience and economy.
