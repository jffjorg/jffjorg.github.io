Censor Commercial Construction v. Ubsoma, Case no.
23SMCV04276
Hearing date January 14, 2025
Third-Party Nazarian’s Motion to Set Aside Bench Warrant and
Quash Orders for Examination
Plaintiff Censor Commercial Construction, LLC sued
defendants Ubsoma, LLC and UB-WP 60622, LLC for breach of contract, quantum
meruit, common counts and open books arising from defendants’ alleged failure
to pay for construction of two restaurant locations. Default judgment was
entered against defendants 3/1/24. Plaintiff applied 9/13/24 for appearance and
examination orders against third-party Sam Nazarian, alleged manager of
defendants. The orders were granted 9/16/24, and Nazarian was ordered to appear
10/25/24. Nazarian did not appear, and the court continued the hearing to
1/15/25 and issued and held a bench warrant until that date. Min. Order
10/25/24.
Nazarian moves to set aside the bench warrant, quash the
orders for examination and appearance, and requests $19,642.50 in sanctions,
arguing Nazarian is not the manager of judgment debtors and the orders for
examination were not properly served.
“A person sought to be examined may not be required to
attend an examination before a court located outside the county in which the
person resides or has a place of business unless the distance from the person’s
place of residence or place of business to the place of examination is less
than 150 miles.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §708.160. Cal. Rules of Court 3.221(f)
holds that if a “person ordered to appear denies service of the order for
appearance, the court shall conduct a hearing solely to determine if proper
service was made.
The court may continue the examination to permit any person
to present evidence in support or in opposition to the claim of non-service. If
the court determines service was not made, it may dismiss the proceeding
without costs awarded to the applicant.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473(b) allows
the Court “upon any terms as may be just, [to] relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” When a person challenges the court’s jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service, “the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.” Dill v. Berquist Constr. Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1441-42.
Nazarian argues he neither resides in nor has a place of
business in California so cannot be ordered to appear before the court under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §708.160. Decl. Nazarian 3. Nazarian offers a
heavily-redacted Florida drivers license. Decl. Nazarian exh. A. The license
demonstrates Nazarian at one point possessed a Florida driver's license; it
does not include an expiration date, issuance date nor current address that
demonstrates Nazarian’s current residency, nor does it defeat allegations that
Nazarian has a place of business in California.
Plaintiff argues Nazarian maintains a place of business in
California, supported by the declaration of counsel Mendez to show Nazarian’s
company SBE Eats, LLC, maintains a business address at 9247 Alden Drive,
Beverly Hills, CA 90210-3703. Decl. Mendez para. 11; exh. F. Plaintiff argues
Nazarian operates 13 other businesses out of the same address, thus availing
himself of jurisdiction in California and rendering him subject to examination
under Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §708.160. Decl. Mendez para. 25; exh. P.; Cal. Code
Civ. Proc., §708.160
merely requires a place of business; plaintiff demonstrated
Nazarian maintains such within Los Angeles County, so he may be compelled to
attend examinations in Los Angeles County.
Nazarian also argues he was not served with the 9/16/24
orders. Nazarian declares lives in Florida and does not own or live at the
address where substituted service occurred in Los Angeles. Decl. Nazarian
paras. 3-4. Nazarian argues the address of substituted service is his mother’s
home, and he has not authorized his mother or her agents to accept service on
his behalf. Decl. Nazarian para. 5. Nazarian’s declaration is sufficient to
shift the burden to plaintiff to demonstrate service was proper.
Plaintiff argues Nazarian demonstrates actual notice by the
filing this motion. Plaintiff argues it initially served a housekeeper 9/16/24
at 157 Delfern Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90077-3542, alleged as Nazarian’s property.
Decl. Mendez para. 13. Plaintiff asserts the housekeeper implied Nazarian
resided at the property and would return to the county. Id. Plaintiff
subsequently served Nazarian’s mother and the housekeeper again 11/1/24. Decl.
Mendez para. 17; exh. I.
Per Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §415.20(b) if service cannot be
personally delivered then service can be effected by “leaving a copy… in the
presence of a competent member of the household.” Nazarian’s argument that he
did not authorize his mother to receive service is unavailing; competent family
members need not be authorized. Further, the instant motion demonstrates
Nazarian and judgment debtors received actual notice. Nazarian’s arguments that
plaintiff did not directly serve judgment debtors are unavailing; neither
Ubsoma nor UB-WP have agents for service. Decl. Mendez para. 12.
Nazarian raises numerous arguments under Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., §708.160 and related case law that he cannot be compelled to attend a
hearing thousands of miles from his alleged residence. Plaintiff offered
evidence that Nazarian is in residence in Los Angeles County at least
occasionally, undercutting such arguments. Decl. Mendez para. 13. Of greater
relevance is court technology allowing for remote attendance. If the burden of
distance is too great, the court can make alternatives available that will allow
for Nazarian and his counsel’s remote virtual attendance.
Nazarian requests $19,642.50 for 29.1 hours for attorney’s
fees under the Civil Discovery Act, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §708.170(b), and Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §473(c). The Civil Discovery Act covers §§2016-2061 of the Cal.
Code Civ. Proc.; the court’s orders regarding Nazarian were made under
§§491.110, 708.110, 708.120, 708.150, and 708.170. The Civil Discovery Act is
inapplicable. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §708.170(b) is not applicable because an
arrest is required under the plain text of the statute. Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§473(c), is also inapplicable because Code Civ. Proc. §473(c)(1), states,
“Whenever the court grants relief from a default, default judgment, or
dismissal based on any of the provisions of this section, the court may do any
of the following”. Even if the court was inclined to grant the instant motion
it would not be granting relief from a default, default judgment nor a
dismissal. No sanctions will be awarded.
Plaintiff demonstrated service was reasonably effected on
Nazarian and Nazarian’s testimony is necessary. Decl. Mendez para. 11; exh. F.
The court can exercise jurisdiction over Nazarian. Nazarian may avail himself
of the court’s technological resources if traveling to attend hearings and
examinations is beyond his means. DENIED.
