Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of Sam Nazarian, third-party defendant, to set aside the bench warrant and quash the orders for examination and appearance. Nazarian argues that he was not served with the orders and that he cannot be compelled to attend a hearing thousands of miles from his alleged residence in Florida. The Judge finds that Nazarian was served with the orders and that he has a place of business in California, thus subjecting him to jurisdiction in California. The Judge also finds that Nazarian's failure to appear on October 25, 2024 was not excusable. The motion is denied, and Nazarian is required to attend the hearing and examination.
