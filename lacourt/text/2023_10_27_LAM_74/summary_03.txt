And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and has overruled it. The Judge finds that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse, specifically neglect, defined as the failure to provide proper nutrition and balanced fluid intake to maintain weight and hydration. The Judge also denies the Defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint, including allegations of punitive damages and attorney fees. The Judge finds that the procedural prerequisites for punitive damages in an action for professional negligence do not apply to elder abuse claims, and that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support an award of punitive damages and attorney fees.
