And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Daniel Veloz v. Sears, Roebuck and Co. (BC620880). The case arises from an employment dispute and has been ongoing since 2016. The Plaintiff, Daniel Veloz, filed a complaint against the Defendant, Sears, Roebuck and Co. The case was removed to federal court, where a jury verdict was entered in favor of the Defendant. The Defendant then filed a notice of bankruptcy and the federal court granted judgment as a matter of law in its favor. The Plaintiff appealed, but the federal court closed the case due to the bankruptcy filing. The Defendant has now filed a motion to dismiss the action, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction. The Judge agrees, stating that once the case was removed to federal court, the court's jurisdiction was suspended and cannot be resumed. The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to dismiss and orders the Defendant to give notice.
