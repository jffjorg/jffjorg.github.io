Daniel Veloz v. Sears, Roebuck and
Co., et al.
Motion to Dismiss
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
May 17, 2016, Plaintiff Daniel Veloz (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Defendant).
            On
August 10, 2016, Defendant removed this action to federal court on the basis of
diversity jurisdiction.
            On
June 29, 2017, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Defendant on the first
six questions related to Plaintiff’s FEHA and CFRA claims. On July 13, 2017,
the federal court granted judgment as a matter of law for Defendant on
Plaintiff’s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
            On
February 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed an appeal.
            On
October 16, 2018, Defendant filed with the Ninth Circuit a notice of bankruptcy
filing and imposition of automatic stay.
            On
October 7, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved confirmation of Defendant’s
Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan.
            On
August 30, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to dismiss.
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant
argues the court should dismiss this action because it lacks jurisdiction. Once
this action was removed to federal court, this court’s jurisdiction was suspended.
(Allstate Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 670, 675.)
For this court to resume jurisdiction, the federal court must remand the
action. (Ibid.) As Defendant notes, the federal court closed this action
in light of Defendant’s Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan. (Brophy Decl., ¶
17; Ex. C.) The federal court based its decision on section 15.8 of the plan,
which permanently enjoins Plaintiff, as an unsecured creditor, from pursuing
his claims outside the remedies provided under the plan. (Brophy Decl., ¶ 17;
Ex. C.) Consequently, the federal court cannot remand this action so that
Plaintiff can pursue his claims. As a further consequence, this court cannot
resume jurisdiction. Plaintiff in turn argues the case is ripe to proceed in
this court because Defendant voluntarily divested the federal court of
jurisdiction when it obtained the closure. But Plaintiff does not provide any
authority in support. By contrast, courts have held that a state court may
resume its jurisdiction in this context “if—but only if—there is a remand of
the action to it from the federal court.” (Allstate Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court, supra, 132 Cal.App.3d at p. 675.) 
CONCLUSION
            Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendant’s motion to dismiss.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
