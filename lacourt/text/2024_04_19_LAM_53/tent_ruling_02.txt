[1] On June
13, 2023, Plaintiff filed two “Amendment to Complaint” forms which (1)
identified the true name of defendant Doe 1 to be defendant Duan, and (2)
identified the true name of defendant Doe 2 to be defendant Huang.


[2] The
court notes that Lu also stated, in her declaration, that she did not “know of
any conspiracy” to harm Plaintiff and that she did not partake “in anything
resembling one.”  (Lu Decl., ¶ 17.)  That evidence, however, does not show that
Joining Defendants were not involved in a conspiracy as alleged.
