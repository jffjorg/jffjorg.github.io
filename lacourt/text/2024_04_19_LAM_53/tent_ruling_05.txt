MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Rebecca Marshall     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Defendant College Hospital Inc.
Motion for Mandatory Sanctions for Material Breach of Arbitration Agreement
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Rebecca Marshall (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against defendant College
Hospital Inc. (“Defendant”) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
1281.98 and 1281.99 on the ground that Defendant materially breached the
parties’ arbitration agreement by failing to timely pay the arbitration case
management fees. 
“Perceiving that a ‘company’s failure to pay the fees of an
arbitration provider’ as required by an arbitration agreement or applicable law
‘hinders the efficient resolution of disputes and contravenes public policy,’
in 2019 the California Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 707 and added
sections 1281.97 and 1281.98 to the California Arbitration Act (CAA) (§ 1280 et
seq.).”  (De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022)
85 Cal.App.5th 740, 750 [internal citations and internal footnote
omitted].)  Under section 1281.98, in an
employment or consumer arbitration that requires the drafting party to pay
certain fees and costs during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, “if
the fees or costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid
within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of
the arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its
right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a
result of the material breach.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (a)(1).) 

“If the drafting party materially breaches the arbitration agreement
and is in default under subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may
unilaterally elect to[,]” inter alia, withdraw the claim from
arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd.
(b)(1).)  If the employee withdraws the
claim from arbitration and proceeds in court, the employee may bring a motion
to recover all attorney’s fees and costs associated with the abandoned
arbitration proceeding, and the court shall impose sanctions on the drafting
party.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98,
subds. (c)(1), (c)(2).)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met her burden to show that she
may recover attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1281.98 and 1281.99, and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
“‘[T]he
[Federal Arbitration Act’s] procedural provisions (9 U.S.C. §§ 3, 4, 10,
11) do not apply unless the contract contains a choice-of-law clause expressly
incorporating them.’  [Citation.]  ‘[T]he question is not whether the parties
adopted the [California Arbitration Act’s] procedural provisions: The
state’s procedural statutes ([Code Civ. Proc.,] §§ 1281.2, 1290.2) apply by
default because Congress intended the comparable [Federal Arbitration Act]
sections (9 U.S.C. §§ 3, 4, 10, 11) to apply in federal court.’”  (Victrola
89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 345 [emphasis
in original] [internal citation omitted].) 
Thus, parties are permitted to expressly designate that the procedural
provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act apply in place of state law.  (Cronus Investments, Inc. v. Concierge
Services (2005) 35 Cal.4th 376, 394 [“Our opinion does not preclude parties
to an arbitration agreement to expressly designate that any arbitration
proceeding should move forward under the [Federal Arbitration Act’s] procedural
provisions rather than under state procedural law”] [emphasis in
original].)  
The parties’
Mutual Arbitration Agreement expressly states that (1) it “shall be governed
solely by the Federal Arbitration Act (‘FAA’), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.[,]”
and (2) “[p]rocedural issues shall be governed by the FAA.”  (Hane Decl., Ex. 1, p. 18.)  The court finds that this language “is broad
and unconditional,” and shows that the parties “adopted the [Federal
Arbitration Act]—all of it—to govern their arbitration.”  (Ibid.; Rodriguez v. American
Technologies, Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1122.) 
Thus,
because the parties’ arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act in its entirety, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown
that the procedural provisions of the California Arbitration Act—including Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99—apply to the parties and any
arbitration proceedings between them.  (Rodriguez,
supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p. 1122; De Leon, supra, 85
Cal.App.5th at p. 750 [section 1281.98 was added to the California Arbitration
Act in 2019].)  The court therefore finds
that Plaintiff has not shown that she is entitled to recover attorney’s fees
and costs under sections 1281.98 and 1281.99. 
The court
notes that the parties do not dispute that the Federal Arbitration Act does not
preempt section 1281.98.  (Gallo
v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 641 [“the FAA does not
preempt sections 1281.97 and 1281.99”].) 
However, the principal issue presented by this motion is the
applicability of the California Arbitration Act, and not whether the Federal
Arbitration Act preempts certain of its provisions.  As set forth above, the court has concluded
that the arbitration agreement between the parties here expressly incorporated
the procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, thereby rendering the
procedural provisions of the California Arbitration Act inapplicable to this
motion and arbitration proceedings between Plaintiff and Defendant. 
 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Rebecca
Marshall’s motion for mandatory sanctions for material breach of arbitration
agreement. 
            The court orders defendant College
Hospital Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
