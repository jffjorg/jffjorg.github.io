And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denied the plaintiff's motion for mandatory sanctions for material breach of arbitration agreement. The plaintiff, Rebecca Marshall, sought to recover attorney's fees and costs from the defendant, College Hospital Inc., due to the defendant's failure to pay arbitration case management fees. The court found that the parties' mutual arbitration agreement incorporated the procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, rendering the procedural provisions of the California Arbitration Act inapplicable. The court concluded that the plaintiff had not shown that she was entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99.
