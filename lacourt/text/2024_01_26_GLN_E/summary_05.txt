And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Montrose Gardens Apartments, to the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiff, Onik Khodaverdian. The demurrer was filed on October 17, 2023, and the meet and confer requirement was met. The judge finds that the FAC fails to state a cause of action and fails to provide jurisdiction. However, the judge grants the plaintiff 10 days' leave to amend the FAC to cure these defects. The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the FAC as it stands is dismissed, but the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise and refile the complaint.
