Summary in English:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiffs Shin Ho Kim and Gena Soon Yoon against Defendant Robert Yepremian. The Plaintiffs are seeking an order granting summary judgment on their unlawful detainer action, alleging that the Defendant failed to comply with the terms of the commercial Lease Agreement and that the lease expired on July 16, 2022. The Defendant has raised six affirmative defenses, which the Court will hear argument on at the hearing. The Court finds the parties' discussion of the affirmative defenses difficult to follow and will not make a decision without hearing argument.
