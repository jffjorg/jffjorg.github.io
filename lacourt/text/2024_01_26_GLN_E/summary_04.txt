And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendant, Southern California Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, dba Glendale Adventist Academy, against the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The demurrer alleges that the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

The judge finds that the first and second causes of action, alleging negligent supervision by Glendale Adventist Academy, are sufficient and overrules the demurrer. The judge finds that the risk of harm was foreseeable to Glendale Adventist Academy, and their hiring and retention of Mohr was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' harm.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress by Mohr. The judge finds that the allegations do not sufficiently plead a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as the discussions by Mohr during class time were not extreme or outrageous.

The judge's tentative ruling will be heard in court.
