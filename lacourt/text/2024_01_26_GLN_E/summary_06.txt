Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendant, Gor Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Paradise Pastry & Cafe, against the complaint filed by plaintiff Anna Markosyan. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is barred under the Workers' Compensation exclusivity provisions. The judge has reviewed the complaint and finds that the plaintiff's claims for premises liability and general negligence are subject to the Workers' Compensation Act because the injuries were incurred within the scope of employment. The judge sustains the demurrer but gives the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint.
