And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital with 20 days' leave to amend. The demurrer was filed against the first and second causes of action in the complaint, which alleged health care provider negligence leading to injury or death and survivorship. The complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support these causes of action, as it only contains conclusory, factually devoid theories of liability against Henry Mayo. The judge has given the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their pleading to address the deficiencies in the complaint.
