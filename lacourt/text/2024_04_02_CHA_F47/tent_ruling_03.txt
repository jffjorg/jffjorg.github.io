 Default Judgment
was entered on 4/7/10 against Defendant Automated Teller Accessories
Corporation. 
 
On 2/15/24, Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Robert Johnson
(Plaintiff), representing himself, filed a motion for an order adding all of
Automated Teller Accessories, Corp. new names created as of and thereafter
4/8/10 and for an assignment order restraining judgment debtor(s) from
encumbering, assigning or disposing of the rights to payments due to or become
due to judgment debtor(s) from Sterling entities (Motion No. 1).  On 2/15/24, Plaintiff also filed a proof of
service regarding Motion No. 1.  
 
On 2/20/24, Plaintiff filed a motion seeking an order to
reinstate punitive damages (Motion No.2). 
There is no proof of service for Motion No.2.
 
On 3/22/24, ATA Services, Inc. (ATA) filed and served a late
declaration of attorney David A. Garcia in support of ATA’s opposition to
Motion No.1.  See CCP 1005(b).  No separate opposition document was
filed.  
 
Even without considering the late filed and served
opposition document, the motions fail. 
 
As noted above, there is no proof of service for Motion
No.2 and the late opposition does not address that motion to cure the defect.  
 
Additionally, the motions are defective in that they fail
to provide clear notice of the relief requested as required by California Rules
of Court, Rule (CRC) 3.1110(a).  The
motions also do not include memorandums of points and authorities as required.  See CRC 3.1112(a)(3); CRC 3.1113(a),
(b).
 
Plaintiff has failed to establish that any other entity
should be added to the judgment as a judgment debtor.  Plaintiff has also failed to adequately
support his request for an assignment order. 
Further, Plaintiff  has failed to provide
any authority which would allow amending the judgment to include punitive
damages.
