Case #23CHCV00709
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 3/1/24.  
 
MINOR: Diego Won
GAL: Yolanda Won (parent)
Defendant: Elida Ortiz
 
RULING: The petition is denied without
prejudice.  
 
This action arises out of dog bite incident that occurred
on 3/28/21 at Golden Valley Dog Park in Santa Clarita.  On that date, Defendant Elida Ortiz’s
(Defendant) dog bit minor Diego Won in the presence of his family members and
co-plaintiffs, Hanson Won (father, Hanson), Yolanda Won (mother, Yolanda) and
Nicolas Won (Nicolas, brother).  On
3/10/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant for: (1) strict
liability in tort, (2) negligence and (3) negligent infliction of emotional
distress.  No proof of service for the
complaint has been filed and Defendant has not appeared in the action.  
 
On 1/31/24, Yolanda, on behalf of Diego, filed the
instant petition for approval of compromise of the claim of Diego.    
 
The petition indicates that Defendant will pay a total of
$71,500.00 to settle all of the Plaintiffs’ claims in this action with
$56,500.00 being allocated to Diego and each of the other Plaintiffs receiving
$5,000.00.
 
The petition indicates medical expenses in the total
amount of $2,817.00 have been incurred with $342.00 having been paid.  Medical expenses in the amount of $2,475.00
are to be paid from the settlement. 
Additionally, attorney fees in the amount of $14,125.00 and expenses in
the amount of $1,965.95 are to be deducted from Diego’s settlement funds
leaving $37,934.05 to be paid to Diego who still has faint scars from the
incident.  
 
As noted above, Defendant has not appeared in this action
and there is no proof of service for the complaint.  The declaration of attorney Barry L. Edzant
indicates that Defendant is insured by State Farm and an unnamed State Farm
adjuster offered the $71,500.00 global settlement.  (Attachment 13a - Edzant Decl. ¶3).  The proof of service attached to the petition
indicates that that on 3/1/24, the petition was electronically served on: “Jami
L. Kuzara, Claim Specialist – Fire Casualty/State Farm Insurance/PO Box
106169/Atlanta, GA 30348-6169/
statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com.” There are no documents in the petition
or in the court file by which the Court can confirm the foregoing.
 
Additionally, Item 18.b.(7) in the petition indicates
that Diego’s settlement funds are to be transferred to the trustee of a trust
that is either created by or approved in the order approving the
settlement.  However, Item 10.c. and
Attachment 18b(7) of the petition, Item 9.c.(2) of the proposed Order to
Approve the Compromise and the proposed Order to Deposit Money Into Blocked
Account indicate that Diego’s settlement funds are to be placed in a blocked
account which would fall under Item 18.b.(2). 
As previously noted in the Court’s 2/23/24 Minute Order, if a trust is
to be created/approved, it would have to be submitted to the Probate Division
for approval.  See Los Angeles
Superior Court, Local Rule 4.115(c); 2/23/24 Minute Order, p.2).  There is no evidence that a trust has been
prepared or submitted to the Probate Division for approval.  That Plaintiff’s counsel believes it is
appropriate to mark Item 18.b.(7) because the funds are to be deposited in a
blocked account does not change this requirement.  (See 2/23/24 Minute Order, p.2).
 
The Court previously noted that a petition for approval
of the compromise of the claim of minor plaintiff Nicolas Won had not been
filed.  In the attorney declaration filed
in support of the current petition, attorney Edzant states that “(Nicolas did
not require a minor’s compromise, as State Farm authorized a parent-guardian
release.)”  (See Attachment 13a –
Edzant Decl. ¶4).  It is not clear
whether the $5,000.00 settlement on behalf of Nicolas has already been paid. 
 
According to LASC Local Rule 4.115(a)(2) and the
California Probate Code, “[i]f a settlement for a minor or a person with a
disability is reached in a pending civil action, the settlement must be
approved in the court in which the action is pending (Prob. Code §2505(a)).”  (See also Petition, No.3.b.).  Additionally, if the value of the minor’s
estate, including the money from the settlement does not exceed $5,000.00, it
can be delivered to the parent without a bond. 
See LASC Local Rule 4.115(b)(1); Probate Code 3611(e), 3400, et
seq.; (Petition No.18.b.(5)).  
Since Nicolas’ claim was the subject of this pending
court action, court approval of the compromise is required.
