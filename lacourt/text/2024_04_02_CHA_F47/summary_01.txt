And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for approval of compromise without prejudice. The petition was filed on behalf of minor Diego Won and his family members, who were bitten by Defendant Elida Ortiz's dog at a dog park in 2021. The settlement proposes that Defendant pay $71,500.00 to settle all claims, with $56,500.00 allocated to Diego and $5,000.00 each to the other family members. The petition also proposes that a trust be created to hold Diego's settlement funds. However, the Court notes that the petition does not provide sufficient information about the trust and that court approval is required for the compromise. Additionally, the Court notes that a petition for approval of the compromise of the claim of minor plaintiff Nicolas Won has not been filed, and that court approval is required for the compromise. The Judge has scheduled a hearing on April 2, 2024, to consider the petition.
