And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case was dismissed on September 4, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to file a default judgment or declaration as ordered by the court on July 25, 2024. However, the plaintiff argues that they did comply with the order by filing a written request for a continuance on August 31, 2024, which was 5 days prior to the hearing. The court finds that the dismissal was due to a technical mislabeling of the document rather than willful or negligent disobedience of the court's order, and that the plaintiff acted within the 60-day period allowed for filing a motion to vacate. Therefore, the court grants the motion and sets aside the dismissal.
