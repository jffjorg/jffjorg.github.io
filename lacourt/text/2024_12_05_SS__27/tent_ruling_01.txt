vs CYNTHIA OLMOS

Notice: Sufficient¿ 
 
Ruling: Granted In Part
 
Background
 
On November 26,
2018, pro per Plaintiff Sherman Vickers ("Plaintiff") filed this
action against Defendant Cynthia Olmos and Defendant Lyft, Inc., alleging
injuries arising from a motor vehicle versus pedestrian accident that occurred
on November 25, 2016. On October 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed an appeal of this
Court's October 5, 2022, ruling. Consequently, this matter was on appeal and
stayed for approximately two years. The appeal was remitted, and the stay on
this case was lifted in July 2024.
 
Defendant Olmos
served numerous discovery requests on Plaintiff before and after the stay and
now moves the Court to compel Plaintiff's initial responses. The discovery
requests at issue are as follows:
 
1.  Requests for Production
of Documents (Set One):
On March 25, 2019, Defendant Olmos served Plaintiff with Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One). Plaintiff's responses were due on April 29,
2019. To date, Plaintiff has failed to respond.
2.  Requests for Production
of Documents (Set Two):
On July 31, 2020, Defendant Olmos served Plaintiff with Requests for Production
of Documents (Set Two). Plaintiff's responses were due on September 2, 2020. To
date, Plaintiff has failed to respond.
3.  On August 23,
2024, Defendant Olmos served Plaintiff with Supplemental Interrogatories (Set
One). Plaintiff's responses were due on September 24, 2024. To date, Plaintiff
has failed to provide any responses.
4.  Supplemental Demand for
Production of Documents (Set One):
On August
23, 2024, Defendant Olmos served Plaintiff with a Supplemental Demand for
Production of Documents (Set One). Plaintiff's responses were due on September
24, 2024. To date, Plaintiff has failed to provide any responses.
 
Legal Standard 
 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.) 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff, in pro per,
filed an opposition arguing that the motion should be denied because there was
no meet and confer, no IDC, no separate statement, and the 45-day deadline to
file a motion to compel has passed.
There is no time limit
to file a motion to compel discovery responses when no written responses have
been served. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (c).) The 45-day deadline referenced by Plaintiff applies to motions to
compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) The present
motions are motions to compel initial responses.
Furthermore, the
requirement for an IDC and a separate statement applies to motions to compel
further responses, not to motions to compel initial responses. (Eighth Amended
Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Court at pg. 7; Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
Plaintiff states that
“Plaintiff timely responded to Defendant’s Discovery Set 2; Demand for
Production of Documents Nov. 10, 2024”; however, no such responses were
attached to the motion. It is also unclear from the phrasing what responses, if
any, have been provided. One of the subject motions concerns Defendant’s
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, which was served on July 31,
2020. It is possible that Plaintiff is referring to this discovery request.
Defendant, in its reply, asserts that Plaintiff’s responses do not pertain to
any of the subject motions. However, Defendant also failed to attach the
referenced discovery responses for the Court to assess. Therefore, as to
Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, the Court will hear
from the parties.
As to the other
discovery responses, Plaintiff provided no indication that the responses were
served prior to the hearing. Therefore, the Court grants the motions and orders
Plaintiff to serve complete and verified responses, without objections, to
Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents (Set One), Supplemental
Interrogatories (Set One), and Supplemental Demand for Production of Documents
(Set One) within 20 days of today.
Defendant requests
sanctions in the amount of $1,860 per motion. Sanctions are mandatory in this
instance.   However, the issue is straightforward
and repetitive; accordingly, the Court reduces the sanctions to $1,000 for all
four motions, payable to Defendant within 20 days of today.
