And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant, Lyft, Inc., seeks to compel arbitration and stay the court proceedings pending the completion of arbitration. The plaintiff, Marguerite Repola, alleges that the defendant carelessly slammed a vehicle's trunk on her head, which occurred on December 13, 2019. The defendant contends that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the parties' arbitration agreement and that the court must compel the plaintiff's claims against the defendant to arbitration.

The judge finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties and that it covers the dispute at issue. The agreement provides that any claims arising from the use of the defendant's platform are subject to binding arbitration. The plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, which the court deems as a consent to the granting of the motion.

Accordingly, the court grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The court stays the action pending the completion of arbitration and sets a post-arbitration status conference for October 27, 2025. The defendant is ordered to give notice.
