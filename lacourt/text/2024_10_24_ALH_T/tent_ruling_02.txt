 Case Number:  20STCV47672    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Deem Request for Admissions AdmittedMoving Party: Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation AuthorityResponding Party: NoneTentative Ruling: DenyBACKGROUNDOn December 14, 2020, Plaintiff David Bailey (“Plaintiff” or “Bailey”) filed an action against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1 through 50 for premises liability.  Plaintiff alleges that, while attempting to board the Gold Line Train from the platform, he stepped on an unknown substance and sustained injuries, implying that he tripped and fell on the unknown substance.On April 6, 2022, Defendant MTA filed an Answer and on April 11, 2022, Defendant County filed an Answer.Pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court dismissed Defendant City on April 8, 2022, and Defendant County on May 31, 2022.On July 5, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel Elina Shakhbazyan’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.On September 30, 2024, Defendant MTA filed the instant Motion for Order Deeming Requests for Admission (Set Two) Admitted and Request for Monetary Sanctions.  On October 17, 2024, Defendant filed Notice of Non-Opposition to the Motion.  No opposition has been filed.MOVING PARTY POSITIONOn August 5, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Request for Admissions (Set 2).  Plaintiff has not responded to the discovery request.  Defendant moves for a court order deeming the Requests for Admission admitted.  Defendant also requests monetary sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to serve responses in the amount of $1,225.OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed.REPLYNo reply has been filed.ANALYSISI. Legal StandardUnder Code of Civil Procedure, section 2033.280, subdivision (b), failure to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner allows the requesting party to “move for an order that…the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted” by the party that failed to respond. The requesting party’s motion must be granted by the court, “unless [the court] finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Since such motion is in response to failure to respond, there is no requirement to meet and confer prior to moving to deem the requests for admission admitted.  (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007), 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)  By failing to timely respond, the party to whom the requests are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or work product.  (Code Civ. Pro. § 2033.280, subd. (a).)Courts are obligated to impose monetary sanctions in cases where a “failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c)).)  Sanctions are calculated based on “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a)).II. MotionAccording to defense counsel, on August 5, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Request for Admissions (Set 2) (“RFAs”).  (Nervez Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded to the discovery request.  (Id. at ¶ 5.)  Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,225, as follows: attorney’s fees at an hourly rate of $350 per hour for 0.5 hours to review the file, 1 hour to prepare the moving papers, 1 hour to review the opposition and prepare a reply, and 1 hour to attend the hearing on the Motion.  (Id. at ¶¶ 6-7.)The Court finds that Plaintiff has not been properly served with the RFAs or moving papers.  Plaintiff was served with the RFAs by electronic service on August 5, 2024, and with the moving papers by electronic service on September 30, 2024.  (Nervez Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. A; Motion, p. 14.)Electronic service is authorized with conditions, such as express consent or court order.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(a).)  According to Rules of Court, rule 2.251, documents may be served by electronic service by express consent or, if electronic service is required by local rules or court order, then self-represented parties are to be served by non-electronic methods, unless they affirmatively consent to electronic service.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(b), 2.251(c)(3)(B)).  A self-represented party may expressly consent to be served by electronic service by:(i) Serving a notice on all parties and filing the notice with the court.(ii) Manifesting affirmative consent through electronic means with the court or the court’s electronic filing service provider, and concurrently providing the party’s electronic address with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic service. The act of electronic filing shall not be construed as express consent.(Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (c).)  Here, there is no evidence that self-represented Plaintiff has consented to electronic service.For this reason, Defendant’s Motion is denied.RULINGDefendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Motion for Order Deeming Requests for Admission (Set Two) Admitted and Request for Monetary Sanctions as to Plaintiff David Bailey is DENIED.
