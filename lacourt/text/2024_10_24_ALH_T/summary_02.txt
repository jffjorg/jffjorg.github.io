And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority) motion to deem the requests for admission admitted and to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff (David Bailey). The basis for the denial is that the plaintiff was not properly served with the requests for admission, as electronic service was used without the plaintiff's consent. The judge notes that self-represented parties must consent to electronic service in a specific manner, and there is no evidence that the plaintiff has done so. As a result, the motion is denied.
