BACKGROUND
            On October 8, 2020, Plaintiff Juan
Andres Espinosa Torres (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Edmond Trapp (“Trapp”), Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“LACMTA”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and DOES 1 to 100,
inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) motor vehicle; and (2) general
negligence. Plaintiff alleges that he was injured on February 14, 2020, while on
Figueroa Street due to the actions of Defendant Trapp, whom Plaintiff alleges
is employed by Defendant LACMTA.  
            On November 13, 2020, Defendant
LACMTA filed an answer to the complaint. 
            On May 14, 2021, Defendant Trapp
filed an answer to the complaint.  
            On July 15, 2024, jury trial in this
action commenced in Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse before the
Honorable Ian C. Fusselman. (07/15/24 Minute Order.) 
            On July 23, 2024, outside of the
presence of the jury, Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that Plaintiff
would waive special damages and proceed only as to general damages, which
obviated “the need for some witnesses to testify.” (07/23/24 Minute Order.) 
            On July 24, 2024, the jury returned
a special verdict finding that Defendant Trapp was negligent, and that the
negligence of Defendant Trapp was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s
harm. (07/24/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The jury found that Plaintiff’s past
economic loss was $375,000.00 and Plaintiff’s future economic loss was
$375,000.00, for a total of $750,000.00. (07/24/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) Thus,
the Court’s minute order indicated that judgment was to be entered in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendants Trapp and LACMTA in the total of $750,000.00.
(07/24/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) 
            On August 21, 2024, the Court
entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants for $750,000.00.
(08/21/24 Judgment at p. 4:3-7.) Plaintiff was deemed the prevailing party.
(08/21/24 Judgment at p. 4:3-4.) The judgment also provides that Plaintiff is
entitled to his recoverable costs pursuant to the filing of a memorandum of
costs. (08/21/24 Judgment at p. 4:8-9.) 
            On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Memorandum of Costs (Summary) and Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet), in
which Plaintiff seeks total costs of $260,257.27. Plaintiff seeks the following
costs: (1) filing and motion fees totaling $2,269.07 (Item 1); (2) jury fees of
$793.90 (Item 2); (3) deposition costs of $15,408.44 (Item 4); (4) service of
process costs totaling $3,103.58 (Item 5); (5) witness fees of $53,000.00 (Item
8); (6) costs for court-ordered transcripts in the amount of $3,218.35 (Item
9); and (7) “other” costs in the sum of $181,963.93 (Item 16). 
            On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Motion for Order Entering Judgment Which Includes Prejudgment Interest
Pursuant to Plaintiff’s CCP § 998 Offer to Compromise and Civil Code § 3291 Which
was Rejected by Defendant.
            On September 16, 2024, Defendants
filed a Motion for New Trial.  
            On September 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a notice taking the motion for prejudgment interest off calendar. 
            On September 24, 2024, Defendants
filed and served the instant Motion to Strike and/or Tax Costs. Defendants seek
to tax and/or strike $207,331.95 from Plaintiff’s claimed costs as follows:
$133.64 from Item 1(c) for filing and motion fees; $4,248.57 from Item 4(b) for
deposition costs; $593.84 from Items 5(a) through 5(c) for service of process;
$14,570.00 for the work of Plaintiff’s billing expert, Jan Roughan, and
striking $3,000.00 each for the work done by Dr. Kashani and Dr. Samimi from
Item 8(b) for expert witness fees; $3,218.35 from Item 9 for court-ordered
transcripts; $177,937.02 from Item 16(39) for prejudgment interest; $496.69
from Item 16 for travel and parking expenses; $8.63 from Item 16 for
photocopying expenses; and, $125.00 from Item 16 for investigation expenses.
(See Not. of Mot. at p. 2:4-4:7.) 
            On October 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an opposition to the motion, to which Defendants replied on October 17, 2024. 
            On October 18, 2024, after hearing
oral argument, the Court denied Defendants’ motion for a new trial. (10/18/24
Minute Order.)  
            In his opposition brief, Plaintiff
indicates that he is no longer seeking prejudgment interest in the amount of
$177,837.02 but is still seeking “to recoup all other expenses as set forth in
his Memorandum of Costs.” (Opp’n at p. 11:12-14.) The Court therefore GRANTS
Defendants’ request to strike prejudgment interest from Item 16(39) in the
amount of $177,937.02 from Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. 
MOVING
PARTY POSITION
            Defendants contend that Plaintiff
cannot recover certain categories of costs that are not included under CCP §
1033.5(a) and are specifically precluded under CCP § 1033.5(b). 
 
 
OPPOSITION
            Plaintiff argues that he is entitled
to his costs as the prevailing party. Plaintiff further argues that the items
on his memorandum of costs are proper, reasonable, and were necessarily
incurred.    
REPLY

            On reply, Defendants assert that
they have shown that the challenged costs were not reasonable and necessary.   
ANALYSIS 
      I.         
Legal Standard/Applicable Law 

            “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) “The right to
recover . . . costs is determined entirely by statute.” (Gorman v. Tassajara
Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 71.) “In ruling upon a motion
to tax costs, the trial court’s first determination is whether the statute
expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its
face.” (Ibid.) “If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show the
costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Ibid.) “Where costs are not
expressly allowed by the statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs
to show that the charges were reasonable and necessary.”  (Ibid.) “Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) California Code of
Civil Procedure, Section 1033.5(c)(4) gives a court discretion to allow or deny
a claimed cost where it is not explicitly allowed or prohibited by Section
1033.5.
            “[T]he items on a verified cost bill
are prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were
necessarily incurred.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “There is no
requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any other such
documents be attached to the memorandum.” (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) “Only if the costs have been put at issue must
supporting documentation be submitted.” (Ibid.) “If the items appearing on a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) “On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) “[T]he mere filing of a
motion to tax costs may be a proper objection to an item, the necessity of
which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on its face.” (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal quotations omitted.)


    II.         
Declaration of Defendants’ Counsel 
In support of the motion, Defendants’
counsel, Allen L. Thomas (“Thomas”), provides a 
declaration. Mr.
Thomas relevantly states the following: Plaintiff served his CCP § 998 offers
to settle this case on Defendants on April 8, 2022. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.)
Each offer was in the amount of $250,000.00 for a total of $500,000.00. (Thomas
Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.) Defendants designated retained experts were Edward P.
Milich, P.E.; Kevin M. Ehrhart, M.D.; and Vicki J. Schweitzer, R.N., BSN.
(Thomas Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 2.) Jan Roughan of Roughan & Associates was listed
as Plaintiff’s billing expert. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 5; Exs. 3, 4.) 
            At trial, Plaintiff introduced
evidence of his medical bills during his case in chief and Plaintiff’s
designated billing expert, Jan Roughan, did not testify at trial. (Thomas
Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s cost bill claims $14,570.00 for Ms. Roughan’s
preparation and testimony at trial. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 7.) When Plaintiff rested
his case in chief, he withdrew his claim for economic damages including his
medical bills. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 7.) Mr. Thomas was then unable to introduce his
clients’ experts to challenge the reasonableness and necessity of Plaintiff’s
claimed medical bills during Defendants’ case in chief. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 7.) The
jury was instructed to not consider Plaintiff’s medical bills during their
deliberations and in their verdict. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 7.)
            Mr. Thomas
states that, on July 16, 2024, Houman M. Kashani, M.D., testified remotely at
the trial for less than one and one half hours. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 10; Ex. 5.)
Dr. Kashani’s fee schedule indicates that his charge is $7,500.00 per half day
for trial testimony. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 10; Ex. 5.) Mr. Thomas states that, on
July 17, 2024, Babak Samimi, M.D., testified remotely at the trial for barely
over two hours at most. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. 6.) Dr. Samimi’s fee schedule
indicates that his charge is $7,500.00 per half day for trial testimony.
(Thomas Decl., ¶ 10; Ex. 6.) A reasonable fee for both Dr. Samimi and Dr.
Kashani testifying would be $4,500.00. (Thomas Decl., ¶¶ 10, 11.) 
            Mr. Thomas further declares that
Plaintiff’s dismissal of his economic damages claims and his medical bills
caused the testimony of Defendant LACMTA’s billing expert, Vicki Schweitzer,
RN, to be rendered moot, and there was no longer any reason for Ms. Schweitzer
to be called to testify at trial. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 12.) Ms. Schweitzer was not
called as a witness to testify during trial and Plaintiff did not attempt to use
the video of Ms. Schweitzer’s deposition transcript at the trial, and the video
was not used in any manner at the trial. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 12.) As for the
deposition of defense expert, Edward P. Milich, P.E., Mr. Thomas states that
Plaintiff’s attorney took the deposition of such expert. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 14;
Ex. 8.) 
 III.         
 Appropriateness of Striking
the Claimed Costs at Issue 
Defendants seek to strike various cost items from Plaintiff’s
memorandum of 
costs on the grounds that such costs were
unnecessary or unreasonable. Plaintiff asserts that all costs asserted in the
memorandum of costs are proper. As indicated above, Plaintiff has withdrawn his
request for prejudgment interest. 
A.    Filing and Motion Fees (Item 1)
            Defendants
contend that Item 1(c) of Plaintiff’s cost bill improperly claims $133.84 to
file the complaint and that such cost item is duplicative. Defendants argue
that Item 1(d) therein properly accounts for the filing of the summons and
complaint. Plaintiff’s opposition does not address this contention raised by
Defendants. 
            Filing,
motion, and jury fees are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(1).) 
            The
Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet). Item 1(c)
therein appears to be a duplicative entry as Item 1(d) therein already accounts
for the filing fee for the complaint, summons, and civil case cover sheet.
(Memorandum of Costs at p. 2.) 
            The
Court therefore finds it appropriate to strike Item 1(c) from the memorandum of
costs as it appears that Plaintiff is seeking to recover twice for the filing
of the summons and complaint. 
            The
Court therefore GRANTS Defendants’ request to strike Item 1(c) from the
memorandum of costs in the sum of $133.64. 
B.    Deposition Costs (Item 4)
            Defendants
seek to strike deposition costs in the sum of $4,248.57 from Item 4 in
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. (Mot. at p. 11:16-12:15.) 
            CCP
§ 1033.5 provides that “[t]aking, video recording, and transcribing necessary
depositions, including an original and one copy of those taken by the claimant
and one copy of depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed”
are recoverable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(A).) 
            Defendants
assert that they do not challenge Plaintiff deposing their expert, Edward P.
Milich, P.E., whom Defendant LACMTA retained at its liability expert. (Mot. at
p. 11:18-20.) Defendants take issue with Plaintiff claiming a cost of $3,924.82
for a “1 Day Expedite” for Mr. Milich’s deposition. (Mot. at p. 11:20-21;
Thomas Decl., ¶ 15; Ex. 9.) 
            Plaintiff presents evidence that such costs
was incurred due to Defendants producing Mr. Milich’s expert file the afternoon
before his February 20, 2024 scheduled deposition, of which was not accessible
and was untimely. (Tamazyan Decl., ¶¶ 3-4; Ex. B, C, D.) Plaintiff presents
evidence that Mr. Milich’s February 20, 2024 deposition was cancelled due to
the untimely production of records by Defendants. (Tamazyan Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. E.)

            Here,
Plaintiff has presented a proper costs memorandum, which is prima facie
evidence that the costs were necessarily incurred. Defendants have presented no
evidence that the expedited deposition of Mr. Milich was not reasonable or
necessary. The declaration of Mr. Thomas does not attest to the
unreasonableness or lack of necessity of an expedited deposition. Defendants
have therefore not met their burden in challenging such cost item. Defendants
have not met their burden in showing that “the deposition was unnecessary or
that the costs of taking the deposition were unreasonable . . . .” (County
of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113.) 
            Defendants
also take issue with the $323.75 to video the deposition of Ms. Schweitzer. (Mot.
at p. 11:25-28.) The fact that Plaintiff dismissed his economic damage claim
after resting his case, and that the video was not seen or that Ms. Schweitzer
testify at trial, does not render such cost item unreasonable or unnecessary.
Defendants’ citation to Great Western Bank v. Converse Consultants, Inc. (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 609, 615 is inapposite as such case involved the recovery of
costs where an action never went to trial. Here, a trial did occur and
therefore Great Western Bank v. Converse Consultants, Inc., supra,
58 Cal.App.4th 609, 615 is factually distinct. Further, Mr. Thomas does not
attest that such cost was unnecessary or unreasonable. Defendants have
therefore not met their burden in challenging such cost item. 
            The
Court therefore DENIES Defendants’ request to strike $4,248.57 from Item 4 in
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. 
C.    Service of Process Costs
(Item 5)
            Defendants seek to strike $593.84 from Items 5(a) through
5(c) in Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs as Defendants contend that Plaintiff
unnecessarily attempted service on Defendant Trapp five weeks after he appeared
in this action and conducted an expensive stakeout. (Not. of Mot. at p.
2:19-23.) 
            “If service is by a process server registered pursuant to
Chapter 16 . . . of Division 18 of the Business and Professions Code, the
recoverable cost is the amount actually incurred in effecting service,
including, but not limited to, a stakeout or other means employed in locating
the person to be served, unless those charges are successfully challenged by a
party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(4)(B).) 
            The Court has reviewed the cost memorandum. Item 5(a) is
a $164.98 charge to serve Defendant Trapp; however, Item 5(b) is to serve
“Officer Smith-Chickering” in the amount of $82.36 and Item 5(c) is a cost item
in the sum of $82.36 to serve “Officer Matthew Charles Ryan.” (Memorandum of
Costs (Worksheet) at p. 2.) Such items only add up to a total of $329.70 and
not $593.84 as Defendants contend. Further, not all of those challenged items
relate to service on Defendant Trapp.  
            Defendant Trapp was served via substituted service on
April 29, 2021. (See 04/29/21 Proof of Service of Summons.) Here, Plaintiff
provides an April 16, 2024 invoice indicating that there were additional
service attempts on Defendant Trapp and, relevantly, a stakeout/waiting time
charge of $400.00. (Thomas Decl., Ex. 10.) Plaintiff also provides a May 3,
2021 invoice showing substitute service on Defendant Trapp. (Thomas Decl., Ex.
10.) 
            Plaintiff presents a June 24, 2021 invoice indicating
non-service on Defendant Trapp for a charge of $133.84. (Thomas Decl., Ex. 10.)
The Court opines as to why Plaintiff attempted service on Defendant Trapp after
he had already been served in this action and filed an answer to the complaint
on May 14, 2021. The Court therefore will strike the costs claimed in the June
24, 2021 invoice. The Court fails to see how such cost was reasonable or
necessary since it was incurred after Defendant Trapp had already
appeared in this action. 
            The Court therefore GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request to
strike Item 5 from Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. The Court taxes $133.84
from such cost item. The Court reduces Plaintiff’s service of process costs
from the claimed amount of $3,103.58 to $2,969.74. 
D.    Expert Witness Fees (Item
8(b)) 
             Defendants seek to tax $3,000.00 in costs from
the fees charged by Dr. Kashani and Dr. Samimi from Item 8(b) of Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs on grounds that such experts each charge $7,500.00 for a
half day’s testimony “despite Dr. Kashani testifying remotely for one and one
half hours, and Dr. Samimi testifying for two hours.” (Not. of Mot. at p.
3:1-4.) Defendants also seek to strike costs for the work done by Jan Roughan.
(Mot. at p. 13:10-14:11.) 
            “Fees
of expert witnesses ordered by the court” are recoverable as costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(8).)
            Here,
both Dr. Kashani and Dr. Samimi each charge $7,500.00 per half day of trial.
(Thomas Decl., Ex. 5, 6.) The Court, however, fails to see the substantiation
for Defendants’ argument that the cost item for each doctor should be reduced
by $3,000.00. (Mot. at p.14:12-15:4.) Defendants present no empirical
calculation as to how they arrived at their requested reduction of $3,000.00 in
fees for each doctor. Moreover, Mr. Thomas does not attest in his declaration
that such fees were unnecessary or unreasonable. Defendants’ argument that the
minimum charge of such doctors is unreasonable has not been substantiated as
Defendants have failed to meet their burden on such point of argument. 
            As
to Defendants’ argument to strike the entirety of Ms. Roughan’s fees in the
amount of $14,570.00, the Court DENIES Defendants’ request. Defendants have not
presented any evidence that such costs were unnecessary or unreasonable.
Further, as stated above, this case is distinguishable from Great Western
Bank v. Converse Consultants, Inc., supra, 58 Cal.App.4th 609, upon
which Defendants rely to strike the costs for Ms. Roughan’s work. Plaintiff has
presented a memorandum of costs, which is a prima facie showing that such costs
were necessary and reasonable. 
            As
such, the Court DENIES Defendants’ request to strike and/or tax Item 8(b) for
expert witness fees from Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. 
E.    Court Ordered Transcripts (Item 9)
            Defendants contend that Item 9 of
Plaintiff’s cost bill, which claims $3,218.35 for court-ordered transcripts,
should be stricken. (Mot. at p. 15:5-20.) Plaintiff contends that the cost bill
contains an error as such amount is not for court-ordered transcripts.
Plaintiff indicates that such cost is for trial transcripts that were
“necessary for Plaintiff’s preparation and filing of the proposed judgment in
this matter, as well as Plaintiff’s oppositions to motions brought by and
necessitated by Defendants.” (Opp’n at p. 10:18-21.) 
            “Transcripts
of court proceedings order by the court” are allowable as costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(9).) “Court report fees as established by statute”
are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).) 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff has not substantiated the necessity of any trial
transcripts via the declaration of his counsel. Transcripts of court
proceedings that are not ordered by the Court cannot be recovered as an item of
costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(5).)
            The
Court finds that striking Item 9 from Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs is
appropriate. The Court therefore GRANTS Defendants’ request to strike Item 9
for Court-ordered transcripts from Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs in the sum
of $3,218.35.
F.     Other Costs (Item 16)
            Defendants seek to strike travel expenses
from Item 16(5)-(9), 16(13), 16(24)-(35), as well as parking expenses from Item
16(36)-(37), which total $496.69. (Mot. at p. 17:3-10.) Only “[t]ravel expenses
to attend depositions” are recoverable as a cost item. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(C).) None of the challenged parking or travel expenses
reference a deposition. Instead, such expenses involve counsel traveling to and
from the courthouse and Plaintiff traveling to and from doctor’s appointments.
While CCP § 1033.5 does not explicitly allow or prohibit other parking or
travel costs, the Court exercises its discretion and STRIKES such costs from
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. 
            Defendants
also seek to strike Item 16(10) for the “Glucroft Investigation” in the amount
of $125.00 from Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs. (Not. of Mot. at p. 4:5-7.) Investigation
expenses are not allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(2).)
Thus, the Court STRIKES Item 16(10) in the amount of $125.00 from Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs. 
            Defendants also move to strike Item 16(38)
from the memorandum of costs, which is a cost of $8.63 for UPS Printing. While
“[m]odels, the enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits . . . may
be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5(a)(13)), the vague description in the memorandum of costs does
not allow the Court to ascertain what document or documents were printed.
“Postage, telephone, and photocopying charges, except for exhibits” are not
allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(3).) The Court
therefore STRIKES Item 16(38) from the memorandum of costs. 
            As
to Item 16, which includes the prejudgment interest stricken pursuant to the
Court’s discussion above, the Court taxes $178,567.34 therefrom. 
RULING

Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN
PART Defendants’ Motion to Strike and/or Tax Costs. The Court taxes Plaintiff’s
costs in the sum of $182,053.17. Thus, the Court reduces Plaintiff’s costs
articulated in the memorandum of costs from $260,257.27 to $78,204.10. 
Defendants are ordered to give notice.
