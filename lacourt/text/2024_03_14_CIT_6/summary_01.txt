And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to continue trial. The current trial date of April 16, 2024, and the Final Status Conference date of March 25, 2024, are advanced and continued. The new trial date and Final Status Conference date will be determined at the hearing on the motion. The plaintiff seeks a continuance due to the unavailability of Cross-Defendant Alex Acuna, who will be out of the country at the time of trial. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for a brief trial continuance and that the length of the continuance requested is reasonable. However, the judge warns that this is the last continuance that will be granted in this action, which has already had multiple continuances.
