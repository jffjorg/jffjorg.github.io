And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC, filed this collection case against defendant Jessi P Changala and others, alleging breach of contract. The plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment and a default judgment package, seeking a total of $38,229.38 in damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's request contained several problems. First, the plaintiff's declaration indicated that demand for payment was made more than 30 days before the declaration was executed, but the notice to the defendant was also dated the same day. Second, the declarations did not provide an explanation for submitting a copy of the original loan agreement instead of the original. Third, the amount of attorney fees requested exceeded the amount permitted by local rules. Based on these issues, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment, giving the plaintiff an opportunity to correct its mistakes and refile its request.
