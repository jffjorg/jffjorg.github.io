 Case Number:  23PSCV03267    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Jessi P Changala 
COURT RULING
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND
            This
is a collection case. On October 23, 2023, plaintiff Bankers Healthcare Group,
LLC (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Jessi P Changala
(Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging one cause of action for breach of
contract. On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default and
a default judgment package.           
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $38,229.38,
including $35,750.63 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $1,787.53 in attorney fees,
and $581.22 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment contains some problems. First, the declaration of Daniel Johnston
indicates that demand for payment of the balance owed was made more than 30
days before making the declaration, which was executed on June 7, 2023. (See
generally, Johnston Decl.) However, the notice to Defendant is also dated June
7, 2023. (Salim Decl., Ex. A.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s contention that it made
the demand more than 30 days before making the declaration is contradicted by
the evidence. It is also frankly disconcerting that Plaintiff’s declaration in
support of the request for entry of default judgment was executed before Plaintiff
even filed this lawsuit. 
Second,
neither of the declarations submitted in support of the default judgment
package provide any explanation regarding the basis for submitting a copy of
the original loan agreement in lieu of the original. (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda’s Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118,
1122.) 
Third,
the amount requested in attorney’s fees exceeds the amount permitted under
Local Rule 3.214. (Local Rule 3.214.) 
CONCLUSION
             Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
