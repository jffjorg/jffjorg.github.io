And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted some of the plaintiff's motions to quash the defendant's deposition subpoenas for medical records, but has also denied some of the motions. The judge has limited the scope of the subpoenas to records since January 2012 for Dr. Hsu, Dr. Hillier, and Huntington Memorial Hospital, and to records since January 2019 for Dr. Ahuja. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions and the defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The judge has determined that the parties' competing interests must be balanced, and that the records limited to 10 years prior to the alleged incident (or from January 2012 to present) help achieve this balance. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's concerns regarding the overbreadth of the subpoenas and the potential for invasion of privacy are valid, and has ordered that any disclosure must be narrowly circumscribed and proceed in the least intrusive manner possible.
