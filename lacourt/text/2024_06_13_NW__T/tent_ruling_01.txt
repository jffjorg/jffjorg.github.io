  Case Number:  22VECV00789    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV00789 Delane Engineering v W&A
Tentative ruling: Plaintiff's motion for fees. No opposition was filed. The court finds the fees requested to be reasonable and necessary. 
Full compensation effectuates the aim of the fee-shifting statutes: “to enable private parties to obtain legal help in seeking redress for injuries resulting from the actual . . . violation of specific . . . laws” by providing attorneys with “statutory assurance that, if they obtain a favorable result for their client, they will actually receive the reasonable attorney fees provided for by the Legislature . . . .” (Flannery v. Prentice (2001) 26 Cal.4th 572, 583 [citing Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizens’ Council (1986) 478 U.S. 546, 565].) Thus, “an award of attorneys’ fees is not a gift. It is just compensation for expenses actually incurred in vindicating a public right.” (Sundance v. Mun. Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 268, 273.) 
Determining the fee award begins with calculating the lodestar. The lodestar method calculates the baseline fees by multiplying the hours reasonably spent “by the hourly prevailing rate for private attorneys in the community conducting noncontingent litigation of the same type.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1133 [original italics].)
“Under the lodestar method, a party who qualifies for a fee should recover for all hours reasonably spent unless special circumstances would render an award unjust.” (Vo v. Las Virgenes Mun. Water Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 440, 446 [citing Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 632-633].) In assessing the reasonableness of the hours spent, “[t]he court can look to how many lawyers the other side utilized in similar situations as an indication of the effort required.” (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 272 [citation omitted].)
Using the lodestar method of calculating fees, the court considers the underlying policy for the fee recovery; “fee awards should be fully compensatory.” (Ketchum, Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1133-1134.
Having performed this calculation, the court finds that fees requested to be appropriate and grants the motion for fees.  The court will sign the proposed order.
