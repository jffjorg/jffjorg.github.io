 Case Number:  23VECV02577    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02577
Gharachedagy v Grinblat


Tentative ruling: Motion for reconsideration – The motion for reconsideration
is granted.  Upon reconsideration, reviewing
the new document, the court does not change its prior ruling.  The issue of whether plaintiff can proceed
with her plan dependent on getting defendant to agree to a community driveway
was always in issue and was already considered by the court.  This is nothing more than a document that
confirms that.  The court’s order of
5/3/2024 will stand.
