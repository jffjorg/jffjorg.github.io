And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition filed by the Plaintiff, Arseven, against the Defendant, GM. The Judge grants the deposition, but only on specific issues, and only before June 28, 2024, the scheduled trial date. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff waited until the last day to file the motion, and therefore, the trial date will not be continued. The Judge also rejects several categories of questions asked in the deposition, citing that they are too broad and should be sought through interrogatories instead. The Judge modifies the deposition to focus on specific issues related to the sale of Cadillac Escalades in Southern California. The case has been set for a Further Settlement Conference on June 21, 2024.
