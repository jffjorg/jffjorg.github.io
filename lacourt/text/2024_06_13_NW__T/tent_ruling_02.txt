 Case Number:  23VECV01984    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01984
Arseven v GM
 
Tentative ruling:
Motion to compel deposition: Grant deposition only on the issues listed below –
as modified -- prior to 6/28/2024.  The
trial of this matter is set 6/28/2024. 
Despite having served the notice of deposition in October 2023, the
plaintiff waited until the very last day that a discovery motion can be heard
to set this motion to compel.  Plaintiff’s
delay in filing the motion cannot be rewarded by delay of the trial.  The court will not continue the trial. Furthermore,
most of the categories requested for a PMQ deposition are inappropriate.  The categories ask someone to be produced to “all
evidence...” which is not enforceable. 
Evidence is what is presented at trial. 
Attorneys decide what evidence will be submitted.  The court will not enforce those categories.  Most of this information could have, and may
have already, been sought by interrogatories.
