And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a right to attach order and writ of attachment against the defendants. The plaintiff sought to attach the defendants' properties to secure a recovery on its contract claims. The judge found that the plaintiff had established the probable validity of its contract claims, but failed to meet the increased standards that apply to attachments of arbitrable claims.

The judge noted that the contracts at issue contain an unambiguous arbitration clause, and that the plaintiff had not disclaimed the existence of these arbitration obligations. The plaintiff argued that it had met the section 1281.8 standard to show ineffectual relief, but the judge found that the plaintiff's bare conclusion and speculation, on information and belief, did not meet its burden of proof.

The judge also found that the plaintiff had not provided competent evidence showing that the defendants were insolvent, at risk of becoming insolvent, or were otherwise experiencing severe financial difficulties. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's failure to demonstrate ineffectual relief without the requested attachments meant that the application was denied.
