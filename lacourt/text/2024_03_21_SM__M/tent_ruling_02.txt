Legal
Standard
 
            “Upon the filing of the complaint or
at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a
right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the
order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (CCP § 484.010.) The application shall be
executed under oath and must include: (1) a statement showing that the
attachment is sought to secure the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment
may be issued; (2) a statement of the amount to be secured by the attachment;
(3) a statement that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based; (4) a statement that
the applicant has no information or belief that the claim is discharged or that
the prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et seq.); and (5) a description of the property to
be attached under the writ of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is
informed and believes that such property is subject to attachment.  (CCP § 484.020.) “The application [for a writ
of attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on
the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”  (CCP §
484.030.)   
 
            The Court shall issue a right to
attach order if it finds all the following: 
 
      (1) The claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. 
      (2) The plaintiff has established the
probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based. 
      (3) The attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based. 
      (4) The amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero. 
 
(CCP
§ 484.090.)
 
            “A claim has ‘probable validity’
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment
against the defendant on that claim.” 
(CCP § 481.190.) In determining the probable validity of a claim where
the defendant makes an appearance, the court must consider the relative merits
of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the
probable outcome of the litigation.” (Loeb & Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music,
Inc. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1120.) “The Attachment Law statutes are
subject to strict construction.”
(Epstein
v. Abrams¿(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)¿
 
Analysis
                                                 
Plaintiff Local Development LLC
moves for a right to attach order and writ of attachment against property owned
by Defendants 801 Alvardo LLC and 900 Alvarado LLC. By the proposed
attachments, Plaintiff seeks to secure $142,417.45 against 900 Alvarado and $95,419.01
against 801 Alvarado.
 
Plaintiff sufficiently describes
the properties at issue. (See Grant Decl., Exs. D.) 900 Alvarado LLC owns the
property commonly known as 900 N Alvarado St., Los Angeles, CA 90026 APN:
5404-004-026. 801 Alvarado LLC owns the property commonly known as 801 N
Alvarado St., Los Angeles, CA 90026 APN: 5402-037-004. 
 
Probable Validity of Proper Claim
 
“[A]n attachment may be issued only
in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.”  (CCP § 483.010(a).)  “An attachment may not be issued on a claim
which is secured by any interest in real property arising from agreement
….”  (CCP § 483.010(b).)   
 
Plaintiff bases its proposed
attachments on the contract claims asserted against the LLCs. “It is a
well-recognized rule of law in this state that an attachment will lie upon a
cause of action for damages for a breach of contract where the damages are
readily ascertainable by reference to the contract and the basis of the
computation of damages appears to be reasonable and definite. [Citations.] The
fact that the damages are unliquidated is not determinative. [Citations.] But
the contract sued on must furnish a standard by which the amount due may be
clearly ascertained and there must exist a basis upon which the damages can be
determined by proof.’¿” (CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD,
Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App. 4th 537, 541.)   

 
Here, Plaintiff meets its prima
facie burden to show the existence of a contract claim against both LLCs. On
November 29, 2021, Plaintiff and 801 Alvarado LLC entered into a contract for
Plaintiff to provide consulting services to 801 Alvarado LLC for its
construction project. (Grant Decl., ¶ 3.) Similarly, on July 15, 2022,
Plaintiff and 900 Alvarado LLC entered into a contract for Plaintiff to provide
consulting services to 900 Alvarado LLC for its construction project. (Grant
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. A.) Defendant presents no evidence disputing the existence
or the terms of these contracts (even if the signature is missing from the
contract pertaining to 801 Alvarado). Both contracts require the respective LLC
to pay Plaintiff $130,000 at $5,000 per month and also contain certain termination
provisions, which state that in the event the Contract is terminated prior to
its completion, Plaintiff shall be paid “sixty-seven percent (67%) of the
difference between one hundred thirty thousand dollars ($130,000) less the
Consulting Fees paid up to and including the date of such termination”. (Grant
Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Plaintiff proves breach of the
respective contracts. On July 7, 2023, the owners of the LLCs, Manhattan West, informed
Plaintiff that they were putting the consulting services and payments “on pause.”
(Grant Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff sent Manhattan West an email explaining that it
was willing and able to continue providing its services to the LLCs, and that
either they would allow Plaintiff to do so, or otherwise would have to pay
Plaintiff pursuant to the Termination Clause. (Id. ¶ 7.) Defendant Lorenzo
Esparza called Plaintiff, indicating that he was figuring out what to do with
the projects and reassured that plaintiff would be paid. (¶ 8.) Despite
promising Plaintiff would be paid, Plaintiff was not allowed to continue with
the consulting services and has been paid neither the monthly $5,000 fees nor
the amounts due under the Termination Clause. (¶ 9.) Thus, it is more likely
than not that Plaintiff will succeed on the merits.
 
Plaintiff demonstrates that 801
Alvarado LLC owes Plaintiff a principal of $23,450.00 pursuant to the
termination clauses. (Grant Decl., ¶¶ 10, 17-20, Ex. B.) Plaintiff requests 10%
interest on the principal starting from August 1, 2023, accruing at $6.42 per
day. Plaintiff also requests treble damages against 801 Alvardo for violations
of Penal Code section 496(c), or $93,800.00. Plaintiff also demonstrates that 900
Alvarado LLC owes Plaintiff a principal of $46,667.00 based on the termination
clause. Plaintiff likewise claims 10% interest starting from August 1, 2023,
accruing at $12.78 per day. Plaintiff again requests treble damages, amounting
to $140,001.00. Thus, Plaintiff has demonstrated the probable validity of the
breach of contract claims, for at least $23,450.00 and $46,667.00, against the
defendant LLCs. 
 
CCP section 1281.8
 
Plaintiff fails to meet the
increased standards which apply to attachments of arbitrable claims. Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.8(b) provides that “[a] party to an arbitration
agreement may file in the court in the county in which an arbitration
proceeding is pending, or if an arbitration proceeding has not commenced, in
any proper court, an application for a provisional
remedy in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground
that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered
ineffectual without provisional relief. The application shall be
accompanied by a complaint or by copies of the demand for arbitration and any
response thereto. If accompanied by a complaint, the application shall also be
accompanied by a statement stating whether the party is or is not reserving the
party's right to arbitration.” (Emphasis added.) Therefore, under section
1281.8, a writ of attachment may only issue in connection with an arbitrable
controversy “only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be
entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.”  
 
“ ‘The logical reason for the
requirement that an applicant be required to show that an arbitration award may
be rendered ineffectual is to ensure that the court does not invade the
province of the arbitrator—i.e., the court should be empowered to grant provisional
relief in an arbitrable controversy only where the arbitrator's award may not
be adequate to make the aggrieved party whole.’ ” (California Retail
Portfolio Fund GMBH & Co. KG v. Hopkins Real Est. Grp. (2011) 193 Cal.
App. 4th 849, 856.) The apparent insolvency of a party to an arbitration
agreement, or other evidence showing that the party was experiencing severe
financial difficulties, is sufficient to satisfy the ineffectual relief
requirement. (Id., at 857.) 
 
There is no dispute that the
instant claims are subject to an arbitration clause. Plaintiff’s cited
agreements contain an unambiguous arbitration clause. Plaintiff also does not
disclaim the existence of these arbitration obligations, but rather argues that
Plaintiff has met the section 1281.8 standard to show ineffectual relief. Thus,
the claims here are an “arbitrable controversy” within the meaning section
1281.8. Plaintiff must therefore demonstrate that any arbitration award would
be rendered ineffectual without the requested attachments. 
 
Plaintiff states that, based on
representations by the owners of the LLCs, the LLCs are “winding down their
business” and selling their respective real properties noted above. (Grant
Decl., ¶ 14.) Grant further provides that each LLC’s sole purpose was the
development of the properties, and they are now selling these sole assets. (¶¶
12-15.) Grant declares, on information and belief, that should an attachment
not be granted, then once the properties are sold, the LLCs will become
insolvent and judgment proof as they will have no other assets. (¶ 16.) 
 
Plaintiff does not provide a
competent affidavit showing that either LLC is insolvent, at risk of becoming
insolvent, or is otherwise experiencing severe financial difficulties.
Plaintiff’s bare conclusion and speculation, on information and belief, does
not meet Plaintiff’s burden of proof. (See Shearer v. Superior Court,
70 Cal. App. 3d 424, 430.)  There is also
no competent evidence suggesting that the properties are, in fact, the sole
assets of the LLCs. Further, even assuming that the LLCs would be insolvent
but-for their properties, Defendants would earn millions of dollars on any
sales based on the presented listing prices. As such, any sale should generate more
than enough money for Plaintiff to recover the full amounts claimed. Plaintiff thus
cannot claim that preventing the sales would protect the potential judgment or
arbitration award. Plaintiff therefore fails to demonstrate that the award
would be ineffectual without the requested attachments.
 
Accordingly, the
application is DENIED.
