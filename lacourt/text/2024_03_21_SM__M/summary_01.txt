And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Campagna v. Leff, in which Plaintiff Thomas Compagna moves to compel Defendants Robert Leff and J. Peter Wakeman to provide responses to their respective discovery requests. The judge notes that if a party fails to respond to an inspection demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. The judge also notes that if a party fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.

The judge finds that the motion to compel discovery responses is moot as to the Special Interrogatories served on Leff, as Leff has already served a response. However, the judge finds that the motions are still pending as to the remaining discovery requests.

The judge also considers the issue of sanctions. The judge notes that monetary sanctions are mandatory unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or the party subject to the sanctions acted with substantial justification. The judge finds that the failure to respond to discovery requests was not intentional, but rather inadvertent, and that Plaintiff's counsel did not make any effort to contact defendants' counsel regarding the outstanding discovery until filing the motion. The judge grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the reduced total amount of $1,122.00, inclusive of costs, against defendants' counsel of record.
