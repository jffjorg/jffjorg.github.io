This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to dismiss a case brought by Vivienne Halston against Victor Ortiz, Ashish Lal, and Esa Management, LLC. The case alleges causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and general negligence. The defendant, Victor Ortiz, filed a demurrer, which was sustained on January 2, 2024. The plaintiff was granted leave to amend, but failed to file an amended complaint. The defendant then filed a motion to dismiss on February 26, 2024. The court notes that the plaintiff did attempt to file a First Amended Complaint on January 22, 2024, but it was not properly filed and served. The court is tentatively inclined to deny the motion to dismiss, but wants to hear further oral argument from the parties to determine whether the plaintiff can file a code-compliant amended complaint in lieu of the original attempt. The court also wants to discuss the possibility of having defense counsel provide updated address information for the plaintiff.
