  - "The Court refuses nor is permitted to weigh the strength of the evidence of these parties' testimonies." (Trial Judge)
  - "The trier of fact may well believe Dr. Rispler's testimony as to the need to lubricate the labia and to reposition the wand to gain a view of each ovary, but they may believe Plaintiff's testimony instead." (Trial Judge)
  - "The fact that Plaintiff's counsel elected to refrain from asking her client questions at the deposition noticed by defense counsel is not sufficient to raise the Benavides v. San Jose Police Department issue because the declaration does not CONTRADICT the deposition testimony." (Trial Judge)
  - "The Motion for Summary Adjudication as to the First, Second, and Fourth causes of action are DENIED." (Trial Judge)

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is in response to the defendants' motion for summary adjudication, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of battery, sexual assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's allegations lack merit and that there is no triable issue of material fact. However, the court found that the plaintiff's opposition evidence, including her declaration and deposition testimony, raised triable issues of material fact, including the movements of the wand during the examination, the location of the wand during the examination, and the alleged intentional use of the wand by Dr. Rispler. The court also noted that the plaintiff's conditional consent to receive a transvaginal ultrasound examination did not necessarily mean that a battery or assault may not have occurred if Dr. Rispler's actions exceeded the scope of that consent. As such, the motion for summary adjudication was denied as to the first, second, and fourth causes of action.
