And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the plaintiff's claims for premises liability and general negligence. The court finds that the defendant's requests for admission, which were deemed as admitted by the court, render the plaintiff's claims completely meritless. The court notes that the plaintiff's response to the requests for admission does not provide any facts, documents, or witnesses to support their claims against the defendant, and therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings must be granted. The court orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service of the notice.
