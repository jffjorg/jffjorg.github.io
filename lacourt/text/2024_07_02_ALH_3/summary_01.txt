Summary:
The tentative ruling states that the complaint filed by Plaintiff Hrayr Brian Der Vartanian against Defendant Jaydon Douglas Paull is frivolous and lacks a legal or factual basis. The Court concludes that sanctions are warranted against Plaintiff, but the amount of sanctions is unclear. The Court strikes the complaint and continues the hearing on sanctions to allow Defendant to submit a supplemental declaration explaining the reasonableness of the requested attorneys' fees. The Court also declines to impose sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Block.
