  Case Number:  21STCV13726    Hearing Date:   February 1, 2024    Dept:  1 21STCV13726           SKY WATER FIRE PROTECTION vs ZENON KESIK            
Defendant’s Motion for an Order to Relate Cases
TENTATIVE RULING:
       Defendant Zenon Kesik’s Motion for an Order to
Relate Cases is DENIED. The Court finds good cause not to relate to the two
actions.  Counsel for Sky Water to give
notice.
 
Background of 21STCV13726 Sky Water Fire
Protection v. Zenon Kesik
On April 12, 2021, Plaintiff Sky Water Fire Protection
filed this action against Zenon Kesik arising out of Defendant’s alleged
failure to pay for construction services rendered by Plaintiff at 1704 W.
Manchester Ave., Los Angeles, California, 90047. The complaint asserts causes
of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) common count complaint for work,
labor, services and materials; (3) open book account; and (4) accounts stated.
Plaintiff alleges the parties entered into a contract on October 15, 2019 “under
which, Plaintiff was to takeover the project from previous contractor, pre work
inspection, testing for hydro of fire sprinklers.” (Compl. ¶ 8.)
 
On August 20, 2021, the court granted Defendant’s
motion to reclassify this action as a limited civil case. The court overruled
Defendant’s demurrer on November 2, 2021.
 
On June 26, 2023, the court dismissed the complaint
after Plaintiff failed to appear at trial. The court vacated the dismissal on
October 17, 2023.
 
This case is currently pending in Department 25 of the
Spring Street Courthouse with trial set for February 26, 2024.
 
Background of 23STCV14637 W1Y7A0T4T vs Sky
Water Fire Protection
 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff W1Y7A0T4T, Inc. filed
23STCV14637 against Sky Water Fire Protection, Inc. The complaint alleges
Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a contract on October 15, 2019 whereby
Defendant “was to take over a fire sprinkler project from a prior contractor
and complete the following work: relocate the main riser, complete the base
system with fire sprinkler heads, install underground piping, test the system,
and obtain approval by the City.” (Comp. ¶ BC-1.) Plaintiff alleges Defendant
failed to abide by the applicable laws, failed to perform the work in a
workmanlike manner, damaged other parts of the property, failed to complete the
work, and failed to obtain approval from the City. Plaintiff further alleges it
had to spend substantial sums to redo the work performed. 
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Related Case involving 21STCV13726 and 23STCV14637. 
 
On August 31, 2023, Sky Water Fire Protection filed a
cross-complaint against Zenon Kesik and W1Y7A0T4T asserting causes of action
for: (1) breach of written construction contract; (2) complaint for work,
labor, services, and materials; (3) open book account; and (4) accounts stated.
The cross-complaint asserts the same causes of action and is substantively
identical to the complaint filed in 21STCV13726.
 
This case is currently pending in Department 76 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse with the case management conference set for March 14,
2024. 
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Court Declines to Relate the Two
Cases  
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff W1Y7A0T4T filed a Notice
of Related Case involving 21STCV13726 and 23STCV14637 in 23STCV14637. Plaintiff
did not file the Notice in 21STCV13726 as required. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(d)
(“The Notice of Related Case must be filed in all pending cases listed in the
notice . . .”).) However, the cases involve the same parties and Sky Water Fire
Protection was properly served with the Notice. The judicial officer in
23STCV14637 has not issued a ruling on the Notice. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(h)(1)(B) (“Where the cases listed in the notice include both unlimited
and limited civil cases, the judge who has the earliest filed unlimited civil
case must determine whether the cases should be ordered related and assigned to
his or her department.”).) Accordingly, the motion is properly brought in
Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule
3.3(f)(3).)
 
Cases are related when they (1) involve the same
parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact,
(3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same
property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).)
 
As noted above, the cross-complaint filed in
23STCV14637 is substantively identical to the complaint 21STCV13726. However,
W1Y7A0T4T, Inc. is not a party to 
21STCV13726. Accordingly, the cases do not involve the same parties
within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)(1). The cases do
arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or
events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical
questions of law or fact. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) The cases involve
the same contract and the same services rendered. Sky Water filed a
substantively identical pleading in both cases. 
Accordingly, the cases would satisfy the requirements for relation
within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)(2).
 
In opposition, Sky Water argues 23STCV14637 is a sham
because W1Y7A0T4T is not a party to the contract. (Opp. at 4:4-8, 4:23-5:2.)
This merits-based argument is not properly before the Court on a motion to
relate. Similarly, Sky Water’s argument that the parties’ dispute is a limited
civil case that should not have been filed as an unlimited action in
23STCV14637, (Opp. at 4:10-21), is also not procedurally proper here.
                                                             
However, the Court agrees with Sky Water that, despite
the cases qualifying for relation under Rule 3.300, there is good cause not to
relate the cases. (See Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(g) (permitting the consideration
of whether there is good cause not to relate cases).) Relating the cases would
result in transferring 21STCV13726 back to an unlimited civil courtroom
contrary to the previously granted Walker motion. Relation would also
substantially delay trial scheduled for February 26, 2024 for a case filed on
April 12, 2021. There will not be a substantial duplication of judicial
resources if the cases remain before different judges as the trial in
21STCV13726 should be completed well before any factual or legal determinations
are made in 23STCV14637. The outcome of that trial is likely to significantly
narrow, if not entirely resolve, the issues in 23STCV14637.
 
Based upon the procedural posture of both cases, the
Court finds good cause not to relate the actions. The motion is DENIED.
