Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Zenon Kesik, has moved to relate two cases: 21STCV13726 and 23STCV14637. The court has reviewed the facts and finds that the cases do not involve the same parties and that there is good cause not to relate the cases. The court notes that relating the cases would result in transferring 21STCV13726 back to an unlimited civil courtroom, contrary to the previously granted Walker motion, and would substantially delay trial scheduled for February 26, 2024. Therefore, the court denies the motion to relate the cases.
