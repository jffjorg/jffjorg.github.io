  Case Number:  21STCV27304    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  45 Superior Court of  California County  of Los Angeles        BLANCA    CALDERON;                                Plaintiff,                                 vs.   REGENTS    OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, et al.;                                 Defendants.     Case No.:  21STCV27304 DEPARTMENT    45       [TENTATIVE] RULING       Action    Filed:  07/26/2021 Trial    Date:  06/02/2025          Hearing Date:             November  13, 2024 Moving Party:             Plaintiff  Blanca Calderon Responding Party:       Defendant Regents of  the University of California   (1) Motion to Compel Further Responses  to Special Interrogatories, Set Three (2) Motion to Compel Further  Responses to Requests For Admission, Set Two (3) Motion to Compel Further  Responses to Requests for Production of Documents and Things, Set Two               The court has considered the moving,  opposing, and reply papers.               The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel  further responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set Three. The court orders  defendant Regents of the University of California to serve further verified  responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three within 30 days of the date of  this ruling. The court DENIES AS MOOT  Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions for her motion to compel further  responses to special interrogatories, set three.    The  court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to requests  for admission, set two. Request for Admissions Nos. 60,62,64, 66, 68 are deemed  admitted.  The  court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to requests  for production of documents and things, set two. The court  orders defendant Regents of the University of California to serve further  verified responses to Requests for Production Nos. 129-133, 139-141 within 30  days of the date of this ruling.                          The court GRANTS IN PART sanctions against  Defendant Regents and in favor of Plaintiff in the total reduced amount of $2,495.00  for both motions. The court orders Defendant Regents of California and its  counsel of record, jointly or severally, to pay $2,495.00 to Plaintiff, through  her counsel of record, within 30 days of the date of this ruling.   Background Plaintiff Blanca  Calderon filed this action on July 26, 2021 against defendants Regents of the  University of California dba UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center and UCLA Health  and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for (1)  Disability Discrimination in Violation of Government Code § 12940 (a); (2) Failure  to Reasonably Accommodate in Violation of Government Code § 12940 (m); (3) Failure  to Provide Medical Leave in Violation of Government Code §12945.2 (4); Failure  to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation of Government Code § 12940  (n); (5) Failure to Maintain a Workplace Free From Discrimination and  Retaliation in Violation of Government Code § 12940 (k); (6) Retaliation in  Violation of FEHA; and (7) Wrongful Termination in Violation of FEHA. Plaintiff’s  seventh (7th ) cause of action for wrongful termination has since been  dismissed. (Kahn Decl. ¶ 2.) The Complaint  alleges the following: While working as a housekeeper at Defendant, Regents of  the University of California’s (“Defendant”), UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center  from 2009 through May 2019, Plaintiff, Blanca Calderon, suffered injury after  injury after injury. (Complaint ¶¶ 14-42.) On May 13, 2019, Plaintiff was  terminated. (Complaint ¶ 43.) On December 8,  2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel defendant’s supplemental responses to  plaintiff’s special interrogatories, set no. three nos. 84-89, 91 and 92.    Legal  Standard Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories Where responses to interrogatories have  been served but the requesting party believes that they are deficient because  the answers are evasive or incomplete, or, because an objection is without  merit, that party may move for an order compelling a further response. (CCP §  2030.300(a).) The motion must be made within 45 days after service of verified  responses in question, or any verified supplemental responses. (CCP §  2030.300(c).) The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration  in compliance with CCP § 2016.040. (CCP § 2030.300(b).) The  motion must be made within 45 days after service of the verified response or  any supplemental verified response. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2033.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c).) Finally, California  Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving  further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request,  the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling  further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)).¿               Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions Code of Civil  Procedure § 2033.290 permits a party to move the court to compel further  responses to a request for admission where “an answer is evasive or incomplete”  or "an objection to a particular request is without merit or too  general." In determining whether a motion is necessary, California Code of  Civil Procedure § 2033.220 requires that "[e]ach answer in [response to an  request for admission] shall be as complete and straight forward as the  information reasonably available to the responding party permits." (Scheiding  v. Dinwiddie Construction Co. (1999) 69 Cal. App. 4th 64, 75.)   Motion to Compel  Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents  Code of Civil  Procedure § 2031.310(a) permits a party to move the court to compel further  responses where the party requesting responses deems that “a statement of  compliance with a demand is incomplete.” Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure §  2031.310(b) permits a party to move the court to compel further responses where  the responding parties’ representation of “inability to comply is inadequate,  incomplete or evasive.”   Discussion             Plaintiff  moves to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Special  Interrogatories, Set Three, Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set Two, and  Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. Plaintiff establishes the  following:              On  August 20, 2023, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set Three (“SROG”), Requests  for Admission (“RFA”), Set Two, and Requests for Production of Documents and  Things (“RFP”), Set Two. (Kahn Decl. ¶¶ 6 & 7, Exs. C-H.) On October 10,  2023, Defendant served its responses and objections to Plaintiff’s SROG, Set  Three, RFA, Set Two, and RFP, Set Two. (Kahn Decl. ¶ 7, Exs. F.)    Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories Timeliness              On  November 20, 2023, Defendant then confirmed an extension for Plaintiff to file  her motions to compel its further responses, setting the new deadline to file  such motions on December 8, 2023. (Kahn Decl. ¶ 9.) On December 8, 2023,  Plaintiff filed the instant motion. Thus, the motion is timely.  Meet and Confer              Here,  both parties’ counsel attest that they engaged in meet and confer efforts.  (Kupetz Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Kahn Decl. ¶¶ 8-13.) Thus, they complied with the meet  and confer requirements.              Merit of the  Motion             Plaintiff  moves to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories, set  three.             Plaintiff  establishes the following:              On  August 20, 2023, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set Three (“SROG”), Requests  for Admission (“RFA”), Set Two, and Requests for Production of Documents and  Things (“RFP”), Set Two. (Kahn Decl. ¶¶ 6 & 7, Exs. C-H.) On October 10,  2023, Defendant served its responses and objections to Plaintiff’s SROG, Set  Three, RFA, Set Two, and RFP, Set Two. (Kahn Decl. ¶ 7, Exs. F.) At issue in  this Motion are Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91,  and 92, which seek the names and contact information for specific individuals  who worked under the supervision of various supervisors during an identified  period. Plaintiff has established good cause for the requests because as  Plaintiff’s co-workers, these individuals, possess directly relevant  information as Plaintiff’s theories of liability in this case, particularly  regarding Defendant’s failure to reasonably accommodate her, its conduct in  forcing her to perform work in violation of her restrictions and, ultimately,  the additional harms she suffered.             In  opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff prematurely filed her motion  because it was in the process of producing the information. Moreover, nine  months prior to the instant hearing on January 17, 2024, it provided the  contact information for the requested individuals contemplated in Special  Interrogatories Nos. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, and 92 via email. (Kupetz  Decl. at ¶ 7; Exhibit F.) Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of the information. (Id.)  Thus, Defendant contends that the motion is moot.              In  reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant only informally provided some of the  information for these witnesses, but not all such information. (Reply at p. 2.)  Moreover, any representation by Defendant and/or its counsel that such  witnesses can be contacted through them is insufficient because of the  possibility of different legal representation or inability to serve a subpoena.  (Id.) Plaintiff states that a court order is necessary to compel  Defendant to provide to Plaintiff the contact information of all such witnesses.  Alternatively, Plaintiff requests that Defendant both (a) agree to accept trial  subpoenas on behalf of all such represented witnesses and (b) provide the  contact information of all such witnesses if they are no longer represented at  any future point in this litigation regardless of whether that witnesses  authorizes Defendant to provide such information at that time or not. However,  Plaintiff fails to provide any legal authority supporting her alternative request.               Nevertheless,  the Court notes that Defendant did not serve any code compliant, verified,  supplemental responses to the motion to compel further to special  interrogatories, set three. Rather Defendant submits Exhibit F which is an  email thread providing the requested contact information.              Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set Three. The court orders defendant Regents of the  University of California to serve code-compliant, verified responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set Three within 30 days of the date of this ruling.               Request for Monetary Sanctions             Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff and  her counsel of record in the amount of $1,812.00. However, the Court notes that  Defendant failed to properly notice Plaintiff by not including the request in  the caption or notice. Thus, sanctions are not warranted against Plaintiff.  (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule 2.30 (C).)             Plaintiff  withdrew her request for sanctions. (Reply at p. 3.)              The  court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions for her motion  to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three.    Requests for Production Nos. 129-133,  139-141             At  issue in this motion includes the following, RFP Nos. 130-133, collectively  seek any documents which may support Defendant's defenses to Plaintiff 's  alleged claims and damages, including Defendant's assertions that Plaintiff is  not as injured as she proclaims and/or that Defendant is not the cause of such  injuries. Plaintiff’s RFP No. 129 asks for any  documents Defendant possesses which may in any way support any defense by  Defendant claiming that contrary to Plaintiff 's own allegations, her physical  health did not deteriorate at any time from 2015 to 2019. Plaintiff’s  RFP Nos. 139-141 seeks all non-privileged e-mail communications between  Defendant's management, HR and/or claims coordinators and Sedgwick from  December 14, 2021, to the present regarding Plaintiff 's medical status,  accommodations, restrictions, worker's compensation claims, the settlement of  such claims, her termination and/or any costs associated with keeping her  working.              Plaintiff  argues that Defendant’s responses are inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. In  opposition, Defendant argues that it properly objected to Plaintiff’s request  for Production Nos. 129, 130, 131, 132, and 133 because the requests are not  reasonably particularized. (Opp. at p.7.) Moreover, Defendant argues that  Plaintiff attempted to shift the burden to Defendant through her discovery  questions and are therefore improper. (Opp. at p.7.) Also, the requests are  extremely vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and not reasonably particularized. (Opp.  at p. 8.) Defendant further argues that Plaintiff’s Motion should be denied  because it is premature, and Regents is still in the process of reviewing and  identifying responsive records for production.              The  court finds Defendant’s objections based on the attorney-client privilege are meritless  because a privilege log was not filed. Defendant must file a privilege log and to the extent that any  request would require Defendant to produce privileged material, Defendant is  not required to produce the material. Moreover, Plaintiff established good  cause for the documents sought because they are relevant to establish the  causation of Plaintiff’s alleged physical injuries and whether Defendant was  aware of Plaintiff’s restrictions and conditions. Thus, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s  motion compelling Defendant’s responses to Requests for  Production Nos. 129-133, 139-141.   Request for Admissions Nos. 60,62,64, 66,  68             At  issue in this motion includes the following, RFA’s Nos. 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68.  Plaintiff's RFA No. 60 asks Defendant to admit that the Xenex machine it  required Plaintiff to utilize between 2016 and 2019 weighed more than 100  pounds. Plaintiff’s RFA Nos. 62, 64, 66 & 68 collectively ask Defendant to  admit that, within the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, Plaintiff violated her  physical restrictions known to Defendant while performing work for its benefit  using the Xenex machine.              Plaintiff  argues that Defendant’s responses are that they are evasive and fail to  actually address the prompts of each request in violation of California law. In  opposition, as to Request No. 60, Defendant argues that the Regents produced  the Xenex manual, which identifies the Xenex machine’s weight. (See Plaintiff’s  Motion 4:22-23, 8:26; Kahn Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Thus, Plaintiff has the  information sought. Request Nos. 62, 64, 66, and 68 ask the Regents to admit  that within the years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, Plaintiff violated her  physical work restrictions known to the Regents by using the Xenex machine or  performing other work for the Regents. (Kupetz Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. “D.”) Moreover,  as to Request Nos. 62, 64, 66, and 68 seek information that requires a legal  conclusion and expert opinion. Defendant further argues that Request Nos. 62,  64, 66, 68 are protected pursuant to the attorney-client privilege. Defendant  further argues that Plaintiff’s motion is moot because Regents responded to  every single request for admission at issue and served timely, verified, and  code-compliant responses to the discovery in question on October 10, 2023.  (Response to Separate Statement at p. 5.)              However,  the Court notes Defendant failed to provide a privilege log. To the extent that any  request would require Defendant to produce privileged material, Defendant is  not required to produce the material. Plaintiff showed good cause in requesting  the information because she is asking the weight of the Xenex machine and  whether Plaintiff worked with this machine during her employment to establish  whether restrictions were ignored. Thus, the Court deems admitted Request  for Admissions Nos. 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68.    Request  for Monetary Sanctions             Defendant requests sanctions against  Plaintiff and her counsel of record in the amount of $3,382.40 for each motion.  However, the Court notes that Defendant failed to properly notice Plaintiff by  not including the request in the caption. Thus, sanctions are not warranted  against Plaintiff. (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule 2.30 (C).) Plaintiff  requests $7,403.34 in attorney’s fees and costs for monetary sanctions against  Defendants and their counsel of record for two motions for misuse of discovery.  (Reply Kahn at p.5.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is $950 per hour and  Plaintiff requests a total of approximately 7.67 hours for these motions and  costs of $60 for filing fees. (Kahn Decl. at ¶ 12.)              While Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, the number  of hours Plaintiff seeks to recover is unreasonable. These are fairly basic  motions and nearly identical. Additionally, Defendant attempted to engage in an Informal  Discovery Conference, but Plaintiff declined. Thus, the issues raised in the  motion do not justify $7,403.34 in attorney’s fees and costs. The court finds  that reducing the recoverable hours to 2.5 hours for these motions is  reasonable. As for the costs, the court finds Plaintiff’s request for the $60  filing fees is reasonable. Thus, Plaintiff’s total reduced recoverable amount  in attorney’s fees and costs for these motions is $2,495.00 ([$950/hour x 2.5  hours] + $120 filing fees), total, not each.             The court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for  monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,495.00. The court orders  defendant Regents of California and its counsel of record, jointly or  severally, to pay $2,495.00 to Plaintiff, through her counsel of record, within  30 days of the date of this ruling.               The Court reminds parties that civil discovery is  intended to be a self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention. (See  Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Superior Ct. (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d  326, 331; Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1291-1292.)     It is so  ordered.   Dated:  November 13, 2024   _______________________ MEL RED RECANA Judge of the  Superior Court
