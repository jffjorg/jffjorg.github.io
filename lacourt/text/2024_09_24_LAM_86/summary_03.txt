And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied plaintiff Alex Nerush's applications for right to attach orders against defendants Naum Neil Shekhter, Margarita V. Shekhter, 2156 Stratford, LLC, and Naum Neil Shekhter and Margarita Shekhter Trustees of the NMS Family Living Trust in the amount of $59,000,000. The plaintiff's applications were previously denied on January 11, 2024, and the plaintiff failed to file a supporting memorandum of points and authorities and did not serve and file notices for each defendant. The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was untimely filed on May 28, 2024, and the court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. The court also declines to exercise its discretion to consider the plaintiff's renewed applications for writs of attachment because the plaintiff failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new information earlier.
