Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by the Court in the case of Laurent Ruben v. Ikspan, Inc. (24STCP00454). Ikspan, Inc. has moved to quash service of summons and complaint, or in the alternative, to set aside the entry of default. The Court has denied both motions. Ikspan, Inc. is a dissolved corporation, and the Court has found that service of summons on its registered agent, Flore K. Farrace, was proper. Although Ikspan, Inc. argues that it did not receive actual notice of the action, the Court has found that it did receive notice through service on Farrace. The Court has also found that Ikspan, Inc.'s defense counsel received the summons and complaint and failed to file a timely answer, which waived any potential defenses. As a result, the Court has denied both motions and will proceed with the case.
