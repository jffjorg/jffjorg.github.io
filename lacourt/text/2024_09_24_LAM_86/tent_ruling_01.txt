[TENTATIVE] RULING ON FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR
  WRIT OF TRADITIONAL MANDATE (CCP § 1085) OR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE (CCP §
  1094.5)
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Robert Hirsh, an attorney at law with his own Beverly Hills law firm, Robert W.
Hirsh & Associates (AR 825), petitions for a writ of mandate directing
respondent State of California Department of Housing and Community Development
to pay benefits purportedly owed under the state rental assistance program.  The goal of the state rental assistance
program at issue was to prevent evictions and housing instability due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. (AR 6.) Guidelines for the program were enacted to ensure that
“those most in need of pandemic-related rental assistance” received it. (AR 2.)  
 
Against
the backdrop of this program and its goal to assist those in need and hoping to
avoid eviction and housing instability, petitioner and his family members,
including two of his daughters—one, a 19-year-old freshman attending Washington
University in St. Louis (AR 404) and the other, a Juris Doctor candidate
attending the University of Chicago Law School (AR 187) at the time—applied for
(and, in some instances, received) tens of thousands of dollars in rental
assistance. (AR 748-55.)  The family
members claimed to be petitioner’s tenants renting rooms in petitioner’s 5-bedroom,
7-bathroom, 7,869 square foot home valued at approximately $7,645,800 (AR 181),
but purportedly could not pay the thousands of dollars in monthly rent they claim
he charged them.  Ultimately, respondent
State of California Department of Housing and Community Development denied
petitioner and his family members’ requests for rental assistance on the ground
that “[i]nconsistent or unverifiable information has been provided by the
applicant.” (See, e.g., AR 652.)
 
For
the reasons that follow, the petition is DENIED. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
            Petitioner Robert Hirsh is the
landlord of a single-family residence located at 160 South June Street in Los
Angeles (“House”). (AR 621.) Petitioner purportedly leased rooms in his
residence to family members William Hirsh (William), Rina Hartman (Rina),
Victoria Hirsh (Victoria), Lauren Hirsh (Lauren), and Clare Hartman (Clare)
(collectively, “Family Members”). The nature of the familial relationships is
described further below.
 
            Starting in September 2021, petitioner,
as landlord, and Family Members, as tenants, applied for rental assistance
pursuant to the COVID-19 Emergency Rental Assistance Program, administered by
the Department of Housing and Community Development (“HCD”). (AR 101-23
(Lauren’s application]; 188-210 [Victoria’s application]; 280-302 [Clare’s
application]; 420-42 [Rina’s application]; 615-25 [petitioner’s application];
669-91 [William’s application].) On January 31, 2022, petitioner’s application,
which purportedly incorporated all of the Family Members’ applications (Opening
Br. at 3:19-22), was deemed complete. (AR 908.) Some level of rental assistance
was awarded and dispersed to petitioner on behalf of certain alleged tenants.
(AR 748-55 [payment logs to petitioner], 893 [approval of Lauren’s application
on 10/27/21].) 
 
For
several months, starting in January 2022, HCD assessed whether petitioner and
his Family Members were entitled to benefits. On January 14, 2022, petitioner
sent HCD a letter to challenge the amount of benefits awarded to Lauren. (AR 825.)
Lauren and Clare applied for additional benefits on January 7, 2022. (AR 769-71
[Lauren’s application log], 778-79 [Clare’s application log].) Petitioner also
called HCD, on January 24, 2022, to check the status of Rina’s application,
which was under review at that time. (AR 786 [Rina’s application log].) On
March 30, 2022, William submitted his application for benefits. (AR 691.) HCD’s
review during this period of time led it to identify information it found questionable,
inconsistent, and unverified in the applications. (AR 485 [irregularity in
applications first noted on February 23, 2022]; see also 759-810 [case logs
for Victoria, Lauren, Clare, Rina, petitioner, and William’s applications].)
Ultimately, HCD denied the applications. (AR 652, 654, 759, 768, 778, 784, 808,
813, 815-16.) The Family Members assigned all of their rights and causes of
action to petitioner. (AR 887 [Rina], 891 [Clare], 890 [Victoria], 888 [Lauren],
889 [William].) 
 
As
part of the submission of an application to the Program, applicants certify
their understanding that they have 30 days to appeal a decision denying
benefits through the provided website link. (AR 122 [Lauren - Certifications
section 7, subdivision (f)], 163 [same], 209 [Victoria], 250 [same], 301
[Clare], 342 [same], 441 [Rina], 690 [William], 731 [same].) The application
instructions also direct applicants to watch for and respond to Program emails
and calls. (See, e.g., AR 189 [Victoria].) Additionally, denial notices
inform applicants of their appeal rights and provide guidance on how to
initiate the appeal. (AR 652 [denial notice sent to petitioner].) The denial
notices also supersede any prior communications to the contrary. (AR 652.)
 
            Family Members were first notified
that benefits were denied through a batch email that was sent on May 4, 2022.
(AR 759 [Victoria], 768 [Lauren], 778 [Clare], 784 [Rina], 808 [William],
815-16 [HCD internal emails re: verification of receipt of denials], 851 [same].)
HCD verified that the denials were emailed to the Family Members on May 4 at
21:23:23. (AR 826.) The computer program used to send the batch emails also has
the ability to identify if the denial letter was opened. The computer program
indicates that a denial letter was opened by Rina. (AR 814, 826.)
 
Responding
to an email from petitioner, HCD notified him, on May 25, 2022, that the applications
were denied and that his Family Members have 30 days to initiate an appeal of
the denial. (AR 813.) Petitioner responded to HCD’s May 25 email. (AR 812.)
This communication triggered additional efforts by HCD to provide further
notice—e.g., resending the denial notices to the Family Members (AR
654), follow-up emails with petitioner (AR 654 [email dated May 26, 2022,
discussing resent denial notices and appeal rights]), and a formal denial
notice electronically sent to petitioner (AR 652 [formal denial notice sent to petitioner
on May 31, 2022]).
 
The
inconsistent information found by HCD, which became the basis for the denial of
benefits, includes, but is not limited to:
 
Separate
Households. The
Family Members, and one more applicant,[1]
applied as six separate households, purporting to lease separate, single
bedrooms in the single-family residence owned by petitioner. (AR 639, 641, 643,
645 [leases for Clare, Lauren, Victoria, and Rina], 746 [William’s lease].) HCD
also determined that petitioner and his wife live at the House. (AR 180
[property description identifies the House as owner occupied], 486, 656 [property
report from DataTree].) This evidence suggested to HCD that the Family Members
and petitioner were not separate households and that they should have been a single
household when applying. (AR 485; see also AR 9 [household income is the
total income of all household members above the age of 18], 16 [describing when
to treat co-tenancy applicants as a single or separate households].)
 
Number
of Purported Rooms Rented.
The number of claimed tenants is inconsistent with the number of rooms in the
House. (AR 348, 485.) The House has five bedrooms (AR 181 [Zillow.com
description of the house], 656 [report from DataTree]), but six purported
tenants renting separate rooms (AR 513, 621). HCD also determined that petitioner
and his wife also live at the house (AR 820), which would further reduce the
number of available rooms to rent in the House to four.  Thus, the House could not support the occupancy
of six tenants purportedly living as separate households each in a single room.

 
Familial
Relationships.
The purported tenants all have familial relationships with petitioner. (AR 178
[summary of findings describing relationships], 348, 485.) HCD determined: that
William is petitioner’s uncle (AR 665); that Rina is petitioner’s sister-in-law
(AR 412-13, 415-17, 884); that Victoria is petitioner’s daughter (AR 403, 665),
who was in high school at the time the purported lease began and started
attending Washington University in St. Louis after high school (AR 400-04, 643);
that Lauren is petitioner’s daughter (AR 183, 665) and was enrolled in an out-of-state
college during the time of the lease (AR 186-87, 641); and that Clare is petitioner’s
niece (AR 665; Reply at 1:18).
 
Unreasonable
Rent. The
claimed rents for a single bedroom in the House is inconsistent with the Family
Members’ claimed incomes. William’s application indicates an adjusted annual income
of $18,000 (AR 685), but he purportedly entered a lease to pay his nephew
$3,600 per month (AR 663, 746). Rina’s application indicates an adjusted annual
income of approximately $18,380 per year while unemployed (AR 437, 501-02), but
she purportedly entered a lease to pay her brother-in-law $1,500 per month (AR
413, 645). Victoria’s application indicates that she did not earn any income
(AR 204) but purportedly entered into a lease to pay her father $2,200 per
month (AR 401, 643), including for time when she was still in high school or
attending college (AR 400-04). Lauren’s application indicates an adjusted
annual income of $25,000 (AR 117), but she purportedly entered a lease to pay
her father $2,200 per month (AR 109, 641), including time when she was enrolled
in out-of-state colleges (AR 186-87). Clare’s application indicates an adjusted
annual income of $19,382 (AR 296), but she purportedly entered a lease to pay
her uncle $1,500 per month. (AR 273, 639).
 
Residency
at the House.
The applications contained inconsistent or unverified information relating to
whether all of the Family Members lived at the House for the entirety of the
claimed time. It was a five-bedroom house with six purported tenants, not
including petitioner (the purported landlord) and his wife, claiming to rent
out single, separate bedrooms. (AR 621.) Additionally, Lauren and Victoria were
each enrolled in out-of-state colleges during some of the time of the claimed
leases. (AR 178, 186-87 [Lauren’s LinkedIn profile indicating attendance at the
University of Michigan from 2016 to 2020 and at the University of Chicago Law
School from 2021 to 2024], 403-04 [Victoria’s LinkedIn profile indicating
attendance at Washington University in St. Louis from 2021 to 2025].)
 
Questionable Documentation. HCD had concerns that
the leases were only entered into to support the applications for rental
assistance, rather than for the purpose of establishing actual landlord-tenant
relationships, and that the Family Members were not under a true threat of eviction,
as required for assistance eligibility. (AR 21-22, 345, 348-49.) The period
covered by rental assistance began on April 1, 2020. (Health & Safety Code
§ 50897.1(d)(1); AR 6 [Program Guidelines], 42 [copy of statute].) Most of the
leases were entered into near the start of the eligibility period, and the
Family Members were immediately unable to pay rent once the eligibility period
began, and sometimes immediately after the lease was entered into. Indeed, there
is no evidence in the record that any of the Family Members ever paid rent
consistent with the leases. William’s lease purportedly started on January 1,
2020. (AR 663, 746.) As discussed above, his income did not support the
purported rent due, and so by April 2020, he purportedly was unable to pay his
rent. (AR 691.) Similarly, Victoria’s lease started on January 1, 2020 (AR 643),
while she was still a  senior at Beverly
Hills high school (AR 403-04). She purportedly had no income (AR 204), and
so by April 2020, she was unable to pay her rent (AR 210 [Victoria’s
application showing in rental arrears from April 2020]). Lauren and Clare’s
leases started May 1, 2020. (AR 181, 273, 639, 641.) However, they were
immediately unable to pay, and even claimed they were in arrears for April
2020. (AR 123 [Lauren’s application showing in rental arrears from April 2020],
302 [Clare’s application showing in rental arrears from April 2020].) For Rina,
her lease was also inconsistent with her income, and she was immediately unable
to pay her rent starting April 2020. (AR 413, 501-02, 507, 509.) Also, the
Family Members include two daughters and one niece, at least two of which were
either still in high school or attending college. (Reply at 1:18; AR 178, 186-87 [Lauren’s LinkedIn profile], 403-04
[Victoria’s LinkedIn profile].), which is often an age when children receive significant
support from their parents, such as housing in the parents’ home. Accordingly, petitioner’s
direct threat to commence eviction proceedings against his daughter, Lauren,
rang hollow to HCD. (See AR 177.) Similarly, the prospect that petitioner
would evict any of the Family Members from his home and then offer the room to
“rent” to a third-party stranger, as would occur in an actual rental property
situation, was not credible.
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
November 9, 2022, petitioner filed a verified petition for writ of mandate. On December
20, 2022, petitioner filed a First Amended Petition for writ of mandate. On
January 19, 2023, respondent filed an Answer to the First Amended Petition. 
 
            On
June 28, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On August 6, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On August 26, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court
has received an electronic copy of the administrative record and a hard copy of
the joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
CCP
§ 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency's action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law. And,
where the case involves the interpretation of a statute or ordinance, our
review of the trial court's decision is de novo.” (Ideal Boat & Camper
Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301, 311, citing Pomona
Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584.)
In independently reviewing legal questions, “An administrative agency's
interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is entitled to
consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State
Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Whether
Petitioner Exhausted Administrative Remedies
 
“In
general, a party must exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the
courts.” (Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. v. California
Public Employment Relations Bd. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1080.) The
exhaustion doctrine “requires that a party must not only initially raise the
issue in the administrative forum, but he must proceed through the entire
proceeding to a final decision on the merits of the entire controversy.” (McHugh
v. County of Santa Cruz (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 533, 539.) “[E]xhaustion of
the administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the
courts.” (Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal, Third Dist. (1941) 17
Cal.2d 280, 293.) “The exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns
favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an
agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and
judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary).” (Farmers Ins. Exchange
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.) Petitioner bears the burden
to establish that it exhausted administrative remedies. (Westinghouse Elec.
Corp. v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 32, 37.) 
 
            Respondent argues that petitioner
and the Family Members did not appeal the denial of their applications for rent
assistance. The Court agrees. 
 
            The Family Members were notified of
the denial of their applications on May 4, 2022, at 21:23:23, by email. (AR 759
[Victoria], 768 [Lauren], 778 [Clare], 784 [Rina], 808 [William], 815-16 [HCD
internal emails re: verification of receipt of denials], 851 [same], 826
[spreadsheet re: sending of denial emails to Family Members].) Only Rina opened
the denial email. (AR 814, 826.) Nevertheless, when the Family Members applied,
they acknowledged their understanding that they had 30 days from notice of
ineligibility to appeal the decision by following the instructions at the
specified website link. (AR 122 [Lauren - Certifications section 7, subdivision
(f)], 163 [same], 209 [Victoria], 250 [same], 301 [Clare], 342 [same], 441
[Rina], 690 [William], 731 [same].) 
 
            On May 25, 2022, HCD notified petitioner
that his application and the Family Members’ applications were all denied. (AR
813 [“We have reviewed your application and associated tenant applications and
see that they were denied. Your tenants
received
instructions for how to appeal this determination in their denial letter within
30 days of the notice”].) Petitioner responded to HCD’s notification on the
same day, stating that “[a]ppeal letters were sent by [him] months ago” but
that he never received any response. (AR 812.) HCD then resent the denial notifications
the same day, to which petitioner was notified. (AR 654.) On May 31, 2022, HCD
also sent an email to petitioner stating that his application was denied and
that he had 30 days from the notification to request an appeal. (AR 652.)
 
            Petitioner does not demonstrate any
appeal was filed in response to the denial notifications sent in May 2022 to
either him or the Family Members. Instead, petitioner argues that the Case
Audit Logs for each of the Family Members indicates that no denial letters have
been sent to them as of June 2022. (AR 489 [Rina], 740 [William], 759
[Victoria], 768 [Lauren], 777 [Clare].) While the Case Audit Logs state in
entries dated June 2, 2022 that “[t]he denial letter has not been sent,” they
also state that, on May 4, 2022, the applications were denied via bulk
processing. (AR 759 [Victoria], 768 [Lauren], 778 [Clare], 784 [Rina], 808
[William].) On June 13, 2022, HCD’s Section Chief of the Emergency Rental
Assistance Program asked a Supervisor to confirm that denials were sent to the
Family Members because the Section Chief did not see the denial letters in the
tenant files. (AR 859.) On June 17, 2022, the Supervisor confirmed that six
tenant denials (i.e., the five Family Members and Betty Louza, whose
application is not at issue here) were sent in the batch on May 4, 2022, “as
all stamped in the audit log,” and that the denials would be uploaded to the
respective files. (AR 859.) The denials were memorialized in a spreadsheet
prepared by HCD. (AR 826.)
 
Therefore,
it appears that, on June 2, 2022, when the Case Audit Logs were updated to
reflect that no denial letters had been sent, the letters had not yet been
uploaded to the respective Family Member files, even though denials had been
sent on May 4, 2022. Therefore, the June 2, 2022 entries do not mean that the
May 4, 2022 entries in the same Case Audit Logs regarding the sending of denial
notices in batch processing are inaccurate. 
 
In
any event, assuming arguendo that the Family Members did not receive the
denial letters, petitioner does not deny that he received a denial letter by
email on May 31, 2022. (AR 652.) The letter stated that he had 30 calendar days
from the notification to request an appeal and contained instructions on how to
submit an appeal. (AR 652.) The denial letter also stated: “If an appeal to
this denial is not received within 30 days THIS NOTICE SHALL BE CONSIDERED A
“FINAL DECISION” OF THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE COVID-19 RENTAL HOUSING RECOVERY
ACT (Chapter 6 of Title 3 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure).” (AR 652;
see also CCP § 1179.09(d)(1) [“final decision” includes application that
is denied because tenant is not eligible for government services].)
Accordingly, petitioner had 30 days from May 31, 2022 to submit an appeal for
himself and the Family Members, as petitioner admitted that his application
incorporated all of his Family Members’ applications. (See Opening Br.
at 3:19-22.) As stated above, petitioner does not establish that he sent any
appeals in response to any of the May 2022 denial letters sent to him or the
Family Members. 
 
Petitioner
argues that Lauren, Rina, Victoria, and Clare sent appeals on January 14, 2022.
(See AR 825 and attachments to reply.) The submissions that petitioner characterizes
as appeals were submitted before the May 2022 denials. It was incumbent upon
petitioner and the Family Members to request an appeal after the May 2022
denials and exhaust the available administrative proceedings after the denial
letter was sent. (McHugh, 33 Cal.App.3d at 539.) No requests for appeals
were submitted in response to the May 2022 denials. Because petitioner and the
Family Members failed to appeal, the denial of petitioner and the Family
Members’ applications are final and unreviewable. 
 
B.          
Whether
Petitioner Established Entitlement to Traditional Writ of Mandate
 
Even
if petitioner exhausted administrative remedies, petitioner does not establish
that respondent abused its discretion in denying the applications of petitioner
and the Family Members. Petitioner states in a conclusory fashion that he and
the Family Members “duly applied and properly qualified” for the benefits
offered under the Program. (Opening Br. at 6:13-14; see also Reply at 3:25-26
[“the Program is an entitlement to those who apply to it and qualify under its guidelines”],
4:20-21 [“[E]ach of the Tenants qualified for the Program by submitting a full,
complete and accurate application”].) However, petitioner does not establish
how the Family Members are qualified for rental assistance under the guidelines
of the Program. Petitioner only asserts that he was told that the applications
were complete. (AR 908.) Petitioner cites no authority for the proposition that
completed applications automatically entitled him and the Family Members to
benefits. Even if Lauren and Rina’s applications were previously approved (AR
772, 785), this does not mean they were entitled to benefits in perpetuity or
that their entitlement to benefits could not audited, reevaluated, or rescinded.

 
Moreover,
petitioner does not establish that HCD’s determination of the applications as
inconsistent or unverifiable was an abuse of discretion. Indeed, the legitimacy
of the leases is doubtful on their face. William’s annual income was $18,000,
or an average of $1,500 per month. (AR 685.) However, William’s purported lease
was for $3,600 per month, in excess of his monthly income. (AR 663, 746.)
Rina’s annual income was $18,380, an average of $1,531.67 per month. (AR 437,
501-02). However, her purported lease was for $1,500 per month, leaving Rina
$31.67 per month for other expenses. (AR 413, 645.) Victoria had no income, but
she entered into a purported lease for $2,200 per month. (AR 204, 401, 643.) Lauren’s
annual income was $25,000, or $2,083.33 per month. (AR 117.) However, Lauren’s purported
lease was for $2,200 per month, leaving her $116.67 for other expenses per
month. (AR 109, 641.) Clare’s income was $19,832, or an average of $1,615.17.
(AR 296.) Her purported lease was for $1,500 per month, leaving her $115.17 for
other expenses per month. (AR 273, 639.) While it may be true that “a large
portion of the Los Angeles population have rent or mortgage obligations that
are disproportionate to their income” (Reply at 3:21-22), HCD was entitled to
question whether purported leases that are either in excess of the applicants’
stated income or in an amount that left the applicants approximately $30 to $100
per month to cover other expenses, such as food, transportation, and phone,
were legitimate. 
 
In a petition for writ of traditional
mandate, the petitioner has the burden to establish that HCD’s denials were arbitrary, capricious, or
lacking entirely in evidentiary support. (Ideal Boat, 208 Cal.App.4th at
311; California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., 10 Cal.4th at 1154.)
For the foregoing reasons, petitioner fails to demonstrate why the applications
should not have been denied. 
 
C.          
Request
for Hearing
 
Invoking
CCP § 1094.5, petitioner seeks a hearing at which he can present entitlement to
the benefits and any opposition can be heard. CCP § 1094.5 is applicable to “any final administrative order or decision
made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be
given, evidence is required to
be taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the
inferior tribunal….” (CCP § 1094.5(a).) Accordingly, to obtain a writ of
administrative mandate, petitioner must establish that the May 2022 denials
were the result of an evidentiary hearing required under law. However,
petitioner has not cited any authority indicating that such an evidentiary
hearing was required in response to the applications for rental assistance. 
 
Petitioner argues that “purely documentary
proceedings can satisfy the hearing requirement of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1094.5, so long as the agency is required by law to accept and consider
evidence from interested parties before making its decision.” (Friends of
the Old Trees v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391.) That may be true, but it has no bearing on the issue
of whether HCD was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing with respect to the
subject rental assistance applications.  
 
In any event, regardless of whether HCD was required
to conduct an evidentiary hearing with respect to petitioner and the Family
Members’ applications, on paper or otherwise, petitioner did not establish that
he or his Family Members filed an appeal after the denials were sent in May
2022. For the reasons stated above with respect to exhaustion of administrative
remedies, petitioner and his Family Members have thus forfeited any entitlement
to any further proceedings. 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
