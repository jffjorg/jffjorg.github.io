And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to sever the claims against them. The defendant, The Regents of the University of California, argues that the claims against them and another defendant, Martin Hair Salon LLC, should be severed because the two falls that caused the plaintiff's injuries are unrelated and the plaintiff is not unsure as to whom she is entitled to redress. The defendant argues that joinder under Code of Civil Procedure section 379(c) is unavailable because the plaintiff is not uncertain as to whom she is entitled to redress. The defendant also argues that absent severance, they will be prejudiced because the two falls may engender sympathy for the plaintiff and the jury may unfairly allocate more of the damages to them.

The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, and the judge has granted the motion to sever. The judge has found that the defendant's arguments are persuasive and that the interests of justice will be served by severing the claims. The judge has ordered that the trials of the properly joined parties will be severed as the interests of justice may require.
