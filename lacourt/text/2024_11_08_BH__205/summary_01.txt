And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant Lionel Simon's motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates from January 27, 2025 to June 27, 2025. The judge finds that the Defendant's request for a continuance is not justified, as the case involves a simple car accident and the Defendant's new counsel has had sufficient time to get up to speed on the case. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff has already produced extensive discovery, including medical records and deposition testimony, and that both parties will complete all expert discovery and trial preparation before the trial date. The judge further finds that the Defendant's claims of needing additional time for discovery and mediation are not credible, and that the case is ready for trial. The judge's ruling is based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, which sets forth the standard for granting continuances and requires a showing of good cause.
