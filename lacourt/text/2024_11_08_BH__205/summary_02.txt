Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Plaintiff NETWORK EXPERTS, INC. against Defendant BEVERLY HILLS IT SERVICES, et al. The motion is related to a previous ruling by the court denying Defendant Baboli's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff.

The judge finds that Defendant Baboli's motion for relief from mistake is frivolous and does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which governs motions for reconsideration. The judge also finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 10 days after the court's ruling.

The judge concludes that Defendant Baboli's counsel's mistake of law is not a ground for relief and that the motion is simply a repetitive filing that wastes the court's time and resources.

The judge awards sanctions in the amount of $3,450 against Defendant Baboli and his counsel, which represents the time spent by Plaintiff's counsel in defending and enforcing the court's default judgment. The judge denies Plaintiff's request for fees and costs in excess of $3,450.
