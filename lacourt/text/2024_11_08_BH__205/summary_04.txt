And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the request for entry of default judgment filed by Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC against Defendant Bryan Demosthenous. The Court has denied the request due to discrepancies between the CIV 100 form and supporting declarations. Specifically, the CIV 100 form seeks $50,000 in damages, but the supporting declaration of Nicole Browne states that only $35,137.77 in unpaid rent is due. The request also seeks $50,000 in attorneys' fees, but the supporting declaration of Daniel Ishu states that the attorneys' fees for the handling of the matter total $19,007.50 plus $562.50 in additional unbilled fees.

Additionally, the request seeks $5,000 in costs, but the declaration of Mr. Ishu states that Plaintiff has incurred $2,185.29 in costs with an additional $39.58 in unbilled costs. The Court also notes that the request seeks damages in excess of that sought in the Complaint.

The Court finds that the relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the Complaint. Therefore, the Court denies the request for entry of default judgment and continues the Order to Show Cause re: Default Judgment to January 9, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
