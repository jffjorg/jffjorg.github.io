The Court finds that the subpoena is invalid on its face because it does not comply with North Carolina's Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act, and also because it does not provide consent from the account holder whose records are sought. The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,000 against Moving Defendant and his counsel, jointly and severally, for their failure to comply with the requirements of the subpoena and for their refusal to withdraw the subpoena despite being given the opportunity to do so.
