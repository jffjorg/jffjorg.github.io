And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on the demurrer to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, B.Z., against the defendants, ASHKAN GHAVAMI, et al. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to obtain informed consent and performed a rhinoplasty and fat transfer procedure that resulted in a deformed nose, inability to breathe, and other complications. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are duplicative and fail to state a cause of action.

The judge disagrees and finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a breach of fiduciary duty and medical malpractice. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, but notes that the conduct alleged is extreme and outrageous.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, finding it duplicative of the medical malpractice claim. The judge also notes that the plaintiff may recover emotional distress damages as part of her negligence claim.

The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to respond.
