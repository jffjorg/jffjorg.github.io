 Case Number:  23SMCV01996    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   MATTHEW WINTER,   Plaintiff, v.  ASAF GLAZER, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV01996     Hearing Date:  November 8, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO QUASH    DEFENDANT’S SUBPOENA TO AT&T C/O    CT CORPORATION SYSTEM PURSUANT    TO CODE CIV. PROC. § 1987.1 AND    REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES      BACKGROUND  This action arises out of a car accident.  Plaintiff Matthew Winter’s car was struck by a car driven by Defendant Asaf Glazer (“Moving Defendant”), who was attempting to make a left turn from a private driveway.  Plaintiff alleges Glazer carelessly and negligent struck his car which was proceeding straight and had the right of way.   At the time of the accident, Plaintiff claims Glazer was performing job duties for the joint business venture between Defendants David Asulin, JRG Realtors, Inc. and Mr. Build Home Improvement Company.  Plaintiff alleges these Defendants are vicariously liable for the actions of Glazer.   On December 26, 2023, Moving Defendant served Requests for Production of Documents (“RFPs”), Set Two, seeking “all text messages you sent or received on YOUR cellular telephone on the day of the INCIDENT” (RFP No. 21) and “all phone calls you made or received on YOUR cellular telephone on the day of the INCIDENT” (RFP No. 22). (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 4.)  On April 24, 2024, the Parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) before this Court. (Mihalic Decl. at ¶ 5.)  During the IDC, Plaintiff agreed to search for and produce evidence of phone calls and/or text messages within the thirty (30) minutes preceding the subject accident. (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 8.)  On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff provided further verified responses to RFP Nos. 21 and 22, indicating that Plaintiff does not possess any responsive documentation within his custody and care, and accordingly, no documents will be produced.  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 10.)  Moving Defendant filed three (3) motions to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to RFP Nos. 21 and 22.  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 11.) On September 24, 2024, this Court heard Moving Defendant’s Motion to Compel on its merits, concluding that: “Moving Defendant’s declaration does not state specific facts supporting a good cause showing.  In any event, even assuming good cause was shown, Moving Defendant does not explain why Plaintiff’s responses that he has no documents to produce is evasive and not code-compliant.”  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 13.)  The very next day, Moving Defendant served a deposition subpoena to AT&T Raleigh, North Carolina (the “Subpoena”), seeking the following documentation: “All cell phone records (including calls, text messages, and internet usages) on October 21, 2022, between 8:16 AM to 9:16 AM. Cell phone number: 310-869-3206.  Redact all other information.”  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 14; Exhibit 1.)   On September 26, 2024, Moving Defendant served Plaintiff with RFPs, Set Three, consisting of the following RFP: “Produce [your] cell phone records on October 21, 2022, between 8:18 AM to 9:16 AM.”  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 15.)  On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff sent Moving Defendant’s counsel meet-and-confer correspondence and formal objections to the Subpoena.  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 16; Exhibits 2, 3.)  Following meet and confer efforts, Moving Defendant refused to withdraw his Subpoena.  (Mihalic Decl. ¶ 17.) This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to quash the Subpoena.  Plaintiff argues (1) the Subpoena was issued to a North Carolina entity but does not comply with the requirements of  North Carolina’s Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act; (2) the Subpoena ignores Code Civ. Proc. §1985.3(f) and California Public Utilities Code §2891 because Moving Defendant did not secure Plaintiff’s consent for the release of his cell records; (3) the Subpoena is unreasonably duplicative because Moving Defendant has already sought the documents from Plaintiff and Plaintiff has indicated no such documents exist; and (4) the Subpoena seeks irrelevant documents to the extent Moving Defendant seeks records of calls happening after the accident.  Plaintiff also requests attorneys’ fees in the amount of $4,200 because defense counsel refused to withdraw its subpoena after receiving Plaintiff’s objections, without adequate justification, and to delay production on the subpoena so that the parties could attend an informal discovery conference, scheduled for October 31, 2024.    MEET AND CONFER A¿motion¿to¿quash¿under¿Section¿1987.1¿does not require a party to make reasonable or good faith efforts to¿meet¿and¿confer.  Notwithstanding, Plaintiff met and conferred with Moving Defendant, but Moving Defendant refused to withdraw the Subpoena.  Plaintiff also asked Moving Defendant to suspend the date of production on the subpoena until the parties attended an IDC.  Moving Defendant refused.   LEGAL STANDARD If a subpoena requires the production of documents, the court may¿quash¿the subpoena entirely or modify it. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1987.1, subd. (a).)  Additionally, courts “may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).) For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.¿(Gonzalez v. Superior Court¿(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)  Generally, all unprivileged information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010;¿Schnabel v. Superior Court¿(1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 711.) “To meet this [test], a party seeking to compel [the] production of records . . . must articulate specific facts justifying the discovery sought; it may not rely on mere generalities.” (Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior Court¿(2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1039; see¿Johnson v. Superior Court¿(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 829, 837¿(finding that a subpoena was insufficient” to compel production because it was “based wholly on the [party’s] alleged information and belief without any statement of supporting facts”).) In ruling on a¿motion¿to quash, “the court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2, subd. (a).) DISCUSSION Plaintiff’s motion to quash is procedurally defective.  A motion to quash production of documents pursuant to a deposition subpoena must be accompanied by a separate statement setting forth the inspection demand at issue and the factual and legal reasons why production should not be compelled. (See¿Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1345(a)(5).)  Notwithstanding, in lieu of a separate statement, the Court may allow the party to provide a concise outline of the request.  Here, there is only one request at issue which Plaintiff has quoted verbatim in its motion.  The Court next considers Plaintiff’s argument that Moving Defendant’s opposition is untimely and should not be considered.  Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b) states that oppositions must be filed at least nine court days before the hearing.  The hearing on this motion is November 8, 2024.  Moving Defendant filed his opposition on November 1, 2024, just five (5) days court days before the hearing.  As such, Defendant’s opposition is untimely.  Notwithstanding, as Plaintiff was able to file a reply, this Court will consider the opposition.   The Court turns now to the merits of the motion.  Plaintiff argues that Moving Defendant ignored the procedural requirements for serving a subpoena on a North Carolina entity.  The Court agrees.   Moving Defendant seeks the production of business records from AT&T at 150 Fayetteville Street, Box 1011, Raleigh, North Carolina 27601.  North Carolina follows the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act. N.C.  (Gen. Stat. Ann. §§ 1F-1 to 1F-7.)  To submit a foreign subpoena to a North Carolina entity, the party must submit a foreign subpoena to a clerk of court in the county in which discovery is sought to be conducted in North Carolina.  (N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1F.)  The clerk then opens an appropriate court file, assigns a file number, collects the applicable filing fee pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 7A-305(a)(2), and issues a subpoena for service upon the entity to which the foreign subpoena is directed.  Here, Moving Defendant has issued a California subpoena without complying with the requirements of North Carolina’s Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act.  There is no indication that Moving Defendant has submitted this Subpoena to a clerk of court in Wake County; that a Wake County clerk of court has opened a file or assigned a file number; and that Moving Defendant has paid the applicable filing fee.  As such, Moving Defendant’s subpoena to AT&T does not comply with North Carolina’s Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act.  Moving Defendant’s subpoena is thus invalid on its face.  Defendant does not address this argument in his Opposition.  By failing to address it, Defendant effectively concedes the argument.  (Glendale Redevelopment Agency v. Parks¿(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1424¿(issue is impliedly conceded by failing to address it).) Additionally, pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1985.3(f) and California Public Utilities Code § 2891, a subpoenaing party must provide a public utility cell phone provider with consent from the account holder whose records are sought.  Without such consent, the subpoena is invalid, and the records sought must not be released absent a court order requiring the public utility to produce the records notwithstanding § 2891.  Here, Plaintiff has not provided Moving Defendant with the required authorization for AT&T to release his cell phone records.  For this additional reason, the Subpoena is invalid and must be quashed.  Again, the Opposition fails to address this argument, and Defendant therefore concedes the argument.  (Glendale Redevelopment Agency, 18 Cal.App.4th at 1424.) Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees because Moving Defendant refused to withdraw a subpoena that was invalid on its face, unreasonably refused to suspend the date of production, and demonstrated a conscious disregard for the Court’s prior orders.  The Court concludes sanctions are warranted because the Subpoena was invalid on its face, and Moving Defendant was given an opportunity to withdraw it during the parties’ meet and confer, but refused.  Moving Defendant was also asked to defer the production date until the parties could participate in an IDC, which Moving Defendant also refused.   In determining the appropriate¿amount¿of¿sanctions, the Court starts with the¿lodestar¿which is the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable hours spent.¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096; see also¿Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  It is unclear how long counsel has been practicing.  Counsel attests conclusorily that his rate is reasonable for someone of his knowledge, skills and experience.  The Court has no basis to assess this claim.  Counsel has not even declared that his rates are what he customarily charges to clients.  For this reason, the Court will use an hourly rate of $250. Next, counsel attests he has spent and will expect to spend 14 hours: 1.5 hours on meeting and conferring, 1.5 hours for preparing objections to the subpoena, 6 hours for preparing the motion to quash, 1 hour for reviewing Defendant’s opposition, 3 hours for preparing a reply, and 1 hour for appearing at the hearing.  The Court concludes these hours are excessive for a simple motion to quash.  The Court will award 8 hours, for a total of $2,000.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to quash and awards sanctions in the amount of $2,000 against Moving Defendant and his counsel, jointly and severally.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: November 8, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
