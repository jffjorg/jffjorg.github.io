And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The defendant, Lisa Ann Willey, had moved the court for a short continuance of the trial date so that her motion for summary judgment could be heard before trial. However, the parties had previously entered into a stipulation to continue the trial date to July 5, 2024, which the court had granted. As a result, the present motion is moot and has been denied. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
