DANIEL BANDERAS-NAVA
Motion:                    MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL DATE
Moving Party:           DEFENDANT Lisa Ann Willey
Responding Party:    Unopposed
Notice:                      Sufficient
 
Ruling:                    MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL DATE IS DENIED
 
On October 27, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the present auto accident case. On April 2, 2024, Defendant
Lisa Ann Willey moved the court for a short continuance of the trial date so
that her motion for summary judgment, scheduled for a hearing on May 29, 2024,
could be heard before trial. On April 4, 2024, the Parties entered into a
stipulation to continue the trial date to July 5, 2024, which the Court
granted. Consequently, the present motion is moot and is therefore denied.
