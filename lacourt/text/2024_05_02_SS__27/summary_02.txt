Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Sandy Brown's motion to reconsider the court's order deeming requests for admission (RFAs) admitted. The court found that Defendant's responses to RFAs were unverified and that she was aware of the court's order as early as September 13, 2023. The court also found that Defendant failed to diligently present new facts to the court's attention and that her motion to reconsider is therefore denied. The court notes that motions to reconsider impose a strict requirement of diligence and that Defendant's lack of diligence in bringing this motion is evident in her failure to file a motion for relief or any other motion for over seven months after learning of the court's order.
