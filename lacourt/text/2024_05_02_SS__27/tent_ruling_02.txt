section 1008(a) states
 
When an application for
an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in
part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by
the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of
entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The
party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.
 
A
court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion to reconsider that
is not based upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law.” (Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499.) Motions for
reconsideration are restricted to circumstances where a party offers the Court
some fact or circumstance not previously considered, and some valid reason for
not offering it earlier. (Id.)
 
Moreover,
there is a strict requirement of diligence, which means the moving party must
present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence or
different facts earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
674, 690.) The burden under Section 1008 is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at trial. (New York Times Co. v. Superior
Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)
 
Background
On January 19, 2022,
Plaintiff Steadfast Insurance Company filed the present UIM claim against
Defendant Sandy Brown. On January 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem
requests for admission (RFA), set one, admitted. On August 30, 2023, the Court
issued an order deeming the RFAs admitted. On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff
notified Defendant by email that the Court had deemed the requests
admitted.  E-mail correspondence between
the parties reflects that Defendant received that September 13 email.  On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff served a “notice
of ruling” of the Court’s 8/30/23 decision on Defendant. On March 25, 2024,
Defendant moved the Court to reconsider its 8/30/23 order to deem RFA, set one,
admitted, arguing that (1) she provided responses to the RFAs, which the Court
did not consider; (2) she did not receive notice of the motion to deem the RFAs
admitted; and (3) she was not aware of the Court's order until she received the
notice of ruling on March 14, 2024, as a result of which she was sufficiently
diligent in bringing the present motion.
Analysis
Defendant first argues
that the Court considered the fact that Plaintiff did not receive any discovery
responses in rendering its decision on August 30, 2023, to deem RFA, set one,
admitted. Defendant attached her responses to RFA showing that responses were actually
served by the statutory deadline. The Court reviewed Defendant's evidence,
which shows that Defendant did serve responses to RFA, Set One, on July 30,
2021, to Plaintiff’s prior counsel. However, these discovery responses were not
accompanied by the necessary verification. Non-verified discovery responses are
the equivalent of no discovery responses. 
(See Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636).  In fact, Defendant only recently provided her
verification, on March 30, 2024, nearly three years after the non-verified
responses. Defendant argues that the associate responsible for the
verifications abruptly departed from the firm and failed to notify Defendant
that the verifications had not been included with the RFA responses.
Nonetheless, no verification was served when the Court rendered its decision.  Thus, although these are new facts not
considered by the Court in rendering its August 30, 2023 ruling, they would not
affect the outcome of the Court's decision to deem the RFAs admitted, as the
responses served were unverified.
 
Defendant's second
argument that she did not receive notice of the 1/13/23 motion to deem RFAs
admitted because it was served on the wrong email address is not supported by
evidence. The motion was served on hespanah@yahoo.com;
the parties had been corresponding and using hespanah@yahoo.com up until
January 13, 2023, just 12 days before the motion to deem RFAs admitted was
filed. (Plf’s Ex. C.)  Plaintiff did not
produce any evidence to show that she proactively provided any notification to
Defendant that notice to hespanah@yahoo.com
was no longer appropriate as of the filing of the motion to deem RFAs
admitted.  
Defendant’s third argument
that she did not receive the Court’s ruling to deem RFAs admitted until March
24, 2024, is also not supported by the evidence. Email communication shows that
on September 13, 2023, defense counsel Vania Nemanpour, inquired if RFA had
been deemed admitted.  Plaintiff’s
counsel responded in the same e-mail chain, a mere 12 minutes later, that “[t]he
court deemed all RFAs admitted.  (Oppositon,
Ex. D).  On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff
sent a formal letter notifying Defendant of the Court’s September 19, 2023
order to deem RFA admitted. (Ex. G.)  Thus, Defendant was aware of the Court’s order
to deem RFA admitted as early as September 13, 2023.
Motions to reconsider
impose on the moving party a strict requirement of diligence, meaning the
moving party must present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the
evidence or different facts earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) Defendant was aware of the Court's order as early as
September 13, 2023, and learned that discovery had previously been served on
September 14, 2023 (Ex. A). Despite this knowledge, Defendant did not file a
motion for relief or any other motion for over seven months. This lack of
action demonstrates a lack of diligence on the part of the Defendant.
Defendant has failed to
diligently present the discovery of new facts to the Court's attention.
Therefore, her motion to reconsider is DENIED.
