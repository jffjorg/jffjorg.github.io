And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff James Davidson's motion to set aside the dismissal of his case and set the case for a case management conference. The case was originally filed on August 25, 2023, against Defendant Pablo Lopez for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on September 22, 2022. However, the Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the first Case Management Conference scheduled for December 29, 2023, and again failed to appear at the subsequent Order to Show Cause hearing on March 28, 2024. As a result, the case was dismissed without prejudice. The Plaintiff has since retained new counsel, Noah Green, and is seeking to set aside the dismissal. The judge has granted the motion, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง473, which allows the court to relieve a party from a judgment or dismissal due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
