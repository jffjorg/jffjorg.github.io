  Case Number:  19STCV28377    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  T MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
Moving Party:                         Defendant Estate of Lillian
Horwitz
Responding Party:                   Plaintiff
Clive
Duvall
Tentative Ruling:                    Denied
I.          INTRODUCTION
This is an action
for negligence arising from a vehicle collision which took place in August
2017. Plaintiff Clive Duvall filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) against the Estate of Lillian Horwitz, the Estate of Nathan Horwitz,
and Does 1 through 50 on December 19, 2023. 
On February 21,
2024, specially appearing defendant Estate of Lillian Horwitz (“The Estate” or
“Defendant”) filed the instant motion to quash service of summons due to
untimely service. Plaintiff filed his opposition on April 16, 2024, and
Defendant replied on May 22, 2024.
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
Pursuant to CCP
section 418.10(a)(1), a defendant may move to quash service of summons on or
before the last day to plead in response to the complaint or within such
further time as the Court may allow for good cause.  
“When a motion to
quash is properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to
establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.) A summons is the
means by which a court acquires personal jurisdiction over a civil defendant,
and compels them to appear in court. (Mannesmann DeMag, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1118, 1122.) A defendant is under no duty to
respond in any way to a defectively served summons. (Kappel v. Barlett
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466; Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) It makes no difference that defendant had actual
knowledge of the action, as such knowledge does not dispense with the statutory
requirements for service of summons. (Ibid.)  
III.       REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Defendant
requests judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code §§ 450, 451, 452 and 454, of
the following documents:
1.     
Lillian
Horwitz’s certificate of death issued by the Registrar-recorder/county clerk of
the County of Los Angeles on March 8, 2023 (Slack Decl., Exhibit A); 
2.     
This
Court’s docket for this matter reflecting that no proof of service has been
filed showing service on Lillian Horwitz or her Estate before August 12, 2022;
3.     
This
Court’s March 28, 2023 minute order as amended nunc pro tunc on April 14, 2023
dismissing Specially Appearing Defendant Estate of Lillian Horwitz, Deceased
(Slack Decl., Exhibit B);
4.     
This
Court’s December 15, 2023 minute order (Slack Decl., Exhibit C);
The court may take judicial notice of
“official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the
United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h); see also People v. Terry (1974) 38
Cal.App.3d 432, 439, holding that judicial notice may be taken of a death
certificate.) 
The Court may take judicial notice of the
existence of the records, but not the truth of matters asserted in such
records. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565).  Defendant’s request for judicial notice is
GRANTED as to the existence of the records, but not the truth of the matters
contained in the records.
IV.       DISCUSSION
Deadline to Serve
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff is not entitled to maintain an action against The Estate under
Probate Code §§ 550 et seq. as Plaintiff failed to serve the summons on The
Estate through Decedent Lillian Horwitz’s (“Decedent”) insurer under Probate
Code § 552(a) on or before August 14, 2022, which is three years from the start
of this action as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210(a). 
Plaintiff contends that this
Court already heard and rejected this argument on December 15, 2023, when it granted
Plaintiff’s motion to substitute and ruled that the three-year deadline to
serve Plaintiff’s Complaint on the Estate was tolled due to Decedent’s death on
September 10, 2018. Indeed, the Court’s December 15, 2023 Minute Order found:
“Under CCP § 583.240(a),
“In computing the time within which service must be made” pursuant to CCP §
583.210(a), the time when the “defendant was not amenable to the process of the
court” is excluded. When a defendant has died and there is no personal
representative, the defendant is not amenable to the service of process. (Polony
v. White (1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 44, 48 [“If a defendant is
dead and no estate has been probated, no one is in existence on whom process
can be served”].)
As such, under Polony,
supra, 43 Cal.App.3d at 48, the time when Defendant was not amenable to
service of process is excluded. . . .
Further, the heirs or
executor of the estate could have probated the estate of the decedent, thereby giving
notice of the ability to file claims against the estate. See Wills v. Williams,
47 Cal.App.3d 941, 945 (1975).”
(12/15/23 Minute Order, pp. 5-6.) Decedent’s estate
was not probated and to date no personal representative has been appointed.
(Khoshnou Decl. ISO Plaintiff’s Opposition, ¶ 2.)
Statute of limitations
Defendant argues that the
statute of limitations for an action under Probate Code §§ 550 et seq. expired
on February 8, 2021. Therefore, even if the three-year deadline to serve the
summons on Decedent was tolled, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is
time-barred by the statute of limitations. The Court disagrees. On December 15,
2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to substitute the Estate in place
of decedent. As a matter of law, such substitution related back to the date of
original filing of a Complaint – i.e. August 12, 2019. (See 12/15/23 Minute
Order, at p. 4.)
IV.       CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s
motion to quash service of summons is DENIED.   Moving party to give notice.
