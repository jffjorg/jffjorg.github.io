```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to serve the summons on the estate of Lillian Horwitz through her insurer, as required by Probate Code sections 550 et seq. The plaintiff countered that the court had already rejected this argument on December 15, 2023, when it granted the plaintiff's motion to substitute the estate in place of the decedent. The court held that the defendant was not amenable to service of process when the original complaint was filed, and that the three-year deadline to serve the summons was tolled due to the decedent's death. The court also found that the statute of limitations for an action under Probate Code sections 550 et seq. had not expired, and that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint was still timely.
