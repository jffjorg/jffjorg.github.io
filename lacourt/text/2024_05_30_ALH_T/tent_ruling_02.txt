Tentative Ruling:                    Denied.
The court considered the moving papers. No opposition has been filed as

BACKGROUND
On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff Debra Hoyte commenced this premises liability
action against Defendants Douglas Emmett Realty Fund 2002, LLC, Douglas Emmett
Management, LLC, Douglas Emmett Builders, and JS Glass & Mirror, Inc. 
On February 6, 2024, a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case was filed.
On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to enforce
settlement pursuant to CCP § 664.6. The motion is unopposed.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 provides: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) 
            Strict compliance with the statutory
requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement
under this statute. (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) The settlement must include the signatures of the parties
seeking to enforce the agreement, and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) 
DISCUSSION
            No
agreement is attached to the motion and Plaintiff even states that one
Defendant has not executed the agreement. Plaintiff only attaches emails
between counsels but does not represent that an agreement is contained therein.
Strict compliance is required to enforce a settlement under CCP § 664.6.
Without proof of a fully executed settlement agreement between the parties
seeking enforcement, and the parties in which enforcement is sought against,
the Court cannot grant the motion. 
            Based
on the foregoing, the motion is DENIED.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
