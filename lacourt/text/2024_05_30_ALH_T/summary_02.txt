```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to enforce settlement brought by Plaintiff Debra Hoyte, but has denied the motion because there is no fully executed settlement agreement between the parties. The court requires strict compliance with the statutory requirements before it can enforce a settlement agreement under CCP ยง 664.6. Without proof of a fully executed settlement agreement, the court cannot grant the motion. The court has ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
