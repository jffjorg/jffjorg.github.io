And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for attorney fees in the case of Joshua M. Robers vs. Hyundai. The court has reviewed the billing submitted by the attorneys and finds that certain rates are excessive. Specifically, the court reduces the hourly rate of Mr. Wirtz to $650 per hour, and the rates of relatively inexperienced attorneys Ommar Chavez and Alana Mellgren to $350 per hour. The court also reduces the rates of paralegals to $200 per hour, except for Rebecca Evans and Florence Goldson, who will be paid $250 per hour. Additionally, the court disallows clerical work and declines to award fees for certain tasks marked as "c" or "clerical". The court orders the clerk to give notice of this tentative ruling and requests that the amount of fees be recalculated with the above adjustments.
