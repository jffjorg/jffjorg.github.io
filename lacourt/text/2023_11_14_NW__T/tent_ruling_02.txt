ROBERS vs HYUNDAI Tentative ruling:  Motion  for Attorney Fees The court has closely reviewed  the billing which was submitted to the court and issues the following tentative  ruling: The court does not approve a fee  of $750 per hour which it finds to be in excess of the community rate for like  services and for an attorney of like experience.  The court reduces Mr.  Wirtz’ rate to $650 per hour.  Also, the court finds that the hourly rate  for relatively inexperienced attorneys Ommar Chavez and Alana Mellgren is also  not approved for the same reason and the rate is reduced to $350 per  hour.  The court finds that much of the paralegal work was clerical, which  should be included into the overhead, and not work usually done by  paralegals.  Those charges are disallowed.  All of the paralegal’s  rates are reduced to $200 per hour except as to Rebecca Evans and Florence  Goldson which are reduced to $250 per hour.  The court declines to award  as fees those matters marked “c” or “clerical” in the attached billing***, and  one of the entries is cut in half as indicated. ***The tentative ruling with  attachment was emailed to counsel on 10/24/2023.The amount should be recalculated with the above adjustments.  IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK OF THE  COURT TO GIVE NOTICE.
