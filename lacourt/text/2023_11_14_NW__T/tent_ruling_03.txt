 Case Number:  22VECV01113    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2023    Dept:  T 22VECV01113 CHRISTINE ROCHA vs DON CHAVA FOODS
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Plaintiff Christine Rocha’s Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended
Complaint is GRANTED.  Plaintiff
Christine Rocha is ORDERED to file and serve the Proposed Second Amended
Complaint WITHIN 15 DAYS.
Introduction 
Plaintiff Christine Rocha (Plaintiff) moved to file a
Proposed Second Amended Complaint (PSAC). 
Defendants Don Chava Foods, Inc., Daniel Reynoso; Christian Reynoso; and
Humberto Reynoso filed a “Response” to the motion rather than an Opposition.
Discussion  
Plaintiff moved to file the PSAC in order to clarify certain
facts and to add additional claims for compensatory money damages.  With these facts, Plaintiff sufficiently
provided the effect and reason for the amendments.  Further Plaintiff provided that the
clarifying facts were discovered when responses to Defendants’ special
interrogatories were being prepared. 
(Berke Decl. par. 3.)  The Court
does not find that Defendants are prejudiced, especially in light of the fact
that Defendants’ “Response” effectively submitted to the motion and did not
oppose the motion.  
The motion for leave to amend is GRANTED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, MOVING PARTY TO GIVE NOTICE.
