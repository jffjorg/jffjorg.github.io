And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims, but denies the motion to dismiss the non-individual PAGA claims. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and defendants is enforceable and that the plaintiff's claims for Labor Code violations/PAGA claims are covered under the agreement. The judge also finds that the pre-dispute non-individual PAGA waiver is unenforceable and severs the provision in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement. The judge denies the request to stay the non-individual PAGA claims, finding that a stay would be unwarranted and would go against the policy reasons for the enactment of PAGA.
