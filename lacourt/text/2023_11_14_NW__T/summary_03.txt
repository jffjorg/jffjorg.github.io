And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Plaintiff Christine Rocha's motion to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff sought to file the Proposed Second Amended Complaint (PSAC) to clarify certain facts and add additional claims for compensatory money damages. The Court found that the Plaintiff had sufficiently provided the effect and reason for the amendments, and that the clarifying facts were discovered while preparing responses to special interrogatories. The Defendants, Don Chava Foods, Inc., Daniel Reynoso, Christian Reynoso, and Humberto Reynoso, filed a "Response" rather than an opposition to the motion, which the Court considers as effectively submitting to the motion. As a result, the Court grants the motion for leave to amend and orders the Plaintiff to file and serve the PSAC within 15 days.
