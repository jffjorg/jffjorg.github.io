(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390)
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Armani Marsalis Gates, I. The plaintiff failed to comply with the court's orders to respond to discovery requests and pay monetary sanctions, despite repeated warnings and extensions. The defendant, Lemonade Insurance Agency, LLC, had filed motions to compel responses to discovery requests, which were granted by the court. The plaintiff failed to pay the monetary sanctions, which were imposed as a result of the court's orders. The judge found that the plaintiff's conduct demonstrates a willful abuse of the discovery process and that terminating sanctions are proper. As a result, the plaintiff's action against the defendant is dismissed.
