The Judge has reviewed the petition filed on October 9, 2024, and has identified several issues that must be addressed before the petition can be approved.

The Judge also notes that no proposed order or order to deposit funds into account has been filed. As a result, the Judge continues the hearing to a later date at 1:30 PM in Department 29 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
