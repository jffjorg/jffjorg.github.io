As for the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on defendants' motion for terminating sanctions. The defendants, Ramon Baguio and Bianca Baguio, are seeking to have the case terminated due to the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's order to appear for deposition. The Judge has denied the motion, citing that while the plaintiffs' actions are a serious misuse of the discovery process, they do not justify terminating the case. The Judge has not imposed any lesser sanctions, as no evidence has been presented to show a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations. The Judge has emphasized that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's orders, and that a discovery sanction should not create a "windfall" for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations.
