 Case Number:  21STCV31342    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Castro v. Cousseau
21STCV31342
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Albert Abkarian & Associates
Tentative
The Court will call this matter.  
Background
On August 24, 2021, Krystal Renee Castro,
Victor Andres Avila, Jasmarie Avila, Brisstelle Avila, and Viktor Amias Avila
filed a complaint against Thomaz Phillip Cousseau, Nissan North America Inc., Rebecca
Diane Mullin (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50, asserting a
negligence cause of action arising out of an alleged automobile collision on
July 18, 2020.
On August 27, 2021, the Court appointed Plaintiff
Krystal Renee Castro as guardian ad litem for Jasmarie Avila, Bristelle Avila,
and Viktor Amias Avila, all of whom are minors. 
(Jasmarie has reached the age of majority on May 5, 2024; Bristelle and Viktor
are still minors.)
On October 26, 2021, Defendants filed an
answer.
On June 7, 2023, the Court granted the petitions
to approve minors’ compromises for Jasmarie, Bristelle, and Viktor and issued
orders to deposit settlement funds into blocked accounts.  The amounts at issue are $4,500 for Jasmarie,
$4,500 for Bristelle, and $2,250 for Viktor.
No proof of deposit of funds into the blocked
accounts has been filed.  Plaintiffs’
counsel advised the Court at several OSCs that counsel has been unable to communicate
with the clients.
On October 9, 2024, Albert Abkarian & Associates (“Counsel”) filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Krystal Renee Castro
(“Plaintiff”). No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel
attest Plaintiff has been unresponsive 
for eight months, making it difficult for Counsel to represent her.
(Decl., Nos. 2 & 7.) 
Although there
appears to be good cause to grant the motion, at least in part, the Court must
call this matter, as the following is unclear: (1) whether Counsel seeks relief
as to Plaintiff Krystal Renee Castro only, or also as guardian ad litem as to
the minor plaintiffs; (2) if the latter, what will happen to the claims of the
minor plaintiffs (Plaintiff Castro cannot as guardian ad litem, represent the
minors in pro per); (3) whether Counsel seeks any relief as to Plaintiff Victor
Andres Avila; and (4) whether Counsel seeks any relief as to Plaintiff Jasmarie
Avila, who is now an adult and is therefore no longer covered by the guardian
ad litem order.  
The Court will
also inquire as to the status of the settlement, release, and settlement
payment.
Conclusion
The Court will
call this matter.
