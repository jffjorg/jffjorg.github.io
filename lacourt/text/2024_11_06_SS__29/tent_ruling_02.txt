21STCV28303
Defendant’s Motion for Leave to Conduct Three Physical Examinations and One
Mental Examination of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is denied.
BACKGROUND
 
On August 2, 2021, Diane Schrader-Vannewkirk
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Jacqueline Becker (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 25, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence arising out of an alleged automobile accident occurring on
November 19, 2020.
 
On September 15, 2021, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On October 3,
2024, Defendant filed this motion seeking leave to conduct three physical
examinations of Plaintiff (by a neurologist, a pain specialist, and a rheumatology
expert) and one mental examination of Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff filed
an opposition on October 21, and Defendant filed a reply on October 25. 
 
The hearing was
initially noticed for November 1, 2024.  For
scheduling reasons, the Court continued the hearing to November 6.
 
When the motion
was filed, the trial date was November 6, 2024. 
On November 4, 2024, the Court granted in part Defendant’s opposed ex
parte application and continued the trial to December 3, 2024.  No discovery deadlines were extended by that
order.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by means of a
physical or mental examination of (1) a party to the action, (2) an agent of
any party, or (3) a natural person in the custody or under the legal control of
a party, in any action in which the mental or physical condition (including the
blood group) of that party or other person is in controversy in the action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)
In a personal injury action, the defendant may
demand one physical examination of plaintiff as of right, without advance leave
of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220.)  
If a defendant seeks a further physical examination
of plaintiff, or a mental examination, the defendant must first file a motion
and “obtain leave of court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (a).)
Such a motion must “specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the person or persons who will perform the examination.” (Id., subd.
(b).) 
The moving party¿must support the motion with a meet
and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).) A
meet and confer declaration must state facts “showing a reasonable and good
faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.”¿ (Id., § 2016.040.)¿¿¿¿ 
The court may grant such a motion “only for good
cause shown.” (Id., § 2032.320, subd. (a).) A showing of good cause
generally requires “that the party produce specific facts justifying discovery
and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action or
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson
v. Super. Ct. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) 

The examination will be limited to whatever
condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020,
subd. (a).) A mental examination is appropriate only if the plaintiff
alleges continuing emotional distress. (Doyle v. Super. Ct. ¿(1996)
50 Cal.App.4th¿1878, 1886-1887.) “While a plaintiff may place his mental
state in controversy by a general allegation of severe emotional distress, the
opposing party may not require him to undergo psychiatric testing solely on the
basis of speculation that something of interest may surface.”  (Vinson, supra, 43 Cal.3d at
840.) By alleging a causal link between the emotional distress and the
defendant's conduct, however, a plaintiff “implicitly claims it was not caused
by a preexisting mental condition, thereby raising the question of alternative
sources for the distress.” (Ibid.)  
“An order granting a physical or mental examination
shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as
the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd.
(d).) “The court is to describe¿in detail¿who will conduct the
examination, where and when it will be conducted, the conditions, scope and
nature of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be
employed.  The way to describe these ‘diagnostic tests and procedures’—fully¿and¿in
detail—is to list them by name.” (Carpenter v. Super. Ct.¿(2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)¿¿ 
A court shall not (except under “exceptional
circumstances”) order a mental examination if the plaintiff stipulates (1)
“that no claim is being made for mental and emotional distress over and above
that usually associated with the physical injuries claimed” and (2) “that no
expert testimony regarding this usual mental and emotional distress will be
presented at trial in support of the claim for damages.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.320, subds. (b) & (c).)
DISCUSSION
Defendant seeks a court order requiring
Plaintiff to appear for four medical examinations: (1) neurological exam with
Barry I. Ludwig, M.D.; (2) neuropsychological and psychiatric exam with Manuel
Saint Martin, M.D.; (3) neurological exam with Joshua O. Prager, M.D.; and (4) a
rheumatoid exam with Jeff Sarkozi, M.D.  
For at least two threshold reasons, the
Court must deny Defendant’s motion.
First, the motion is untimely.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020,
discovery motions must be heard on or before the 15th day before trial.  The relevant trial date is November 6; the last
day to hear the motion was October 22.  But
Defendant did not file the motion until October 3 (nine court days before the
hearing cutoff).
Second, the motion does not “specify the
time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination,” as
required by the governing statute.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).)
Accordingly, the motion is denied.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
also denied.  Sanctions are requested
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250, subdivision (b), but that
statute governs motions to compel compliance with a demand for a first physical
examination.  It does not apply here,
where Defendant sought leave for additional examinations under section
2032.310-.320.
Plaintiff offers no other authority for
sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for leave
to conduct four additional medical examinations of Plaintiff.
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
