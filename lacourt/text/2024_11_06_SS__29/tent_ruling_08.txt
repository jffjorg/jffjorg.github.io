 Case Number:  23STCV13913    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Garcia v. Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority
23STCV13913
Defendant’s Motion to Consolidate 
 
Tentative
 
Motion is granted. 
 
Background
 
Three related cases arise out of a
bus colliding with another vehicle on September 7, 2022.  The cases were determined to be related by a
Minute Order filed on August 19, 2024.
 
In the first filed matter (Case No.
23STCV09010) Plaintiff Jack Axelrod (“Axelrod”) filed a complaint on April 24,
2023, against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Metro”) and Does 1 through 25 (the “Axelrod Action”).
 
On August 16, 2023, Metro filed an
answer.
 
On July 25, 2024, Axelrod amended the
complaint to name Susana Covian (“Covian”) as Doe 1.
 
On September 4, 2024, Covian filed an
answer and a cross-complaint against Metro and Roes 1 through 10.
 
In the second filed action (Case No.
23STCV12815) Azucena Rojas and Efrain Mercado (collectively, the “Rojas
Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint on June 6, 2023, against Covian, Metro, and Does
1 through 50 (the “Rojas Action”).
 
On October 26, 2023, Covian filed an
answer and a cross-complaint against Metro and Roes 1 through 10. 
 
On November 7, 2023, Metro filed an
answer to the complaint.  On January 16, 2024, filed an answer to Covian’s
cross-complaint.
 
In this action, the third filed
action (Case No. 23STCV13913), Ana Belen Garcia (“Garcia”) filed a complaint on
June 15, 2023, against Metro, Doe Driver, and Does 1 through 100 (the “Garcia
Action”).
 
On May 2, 2024, Metro filed an answer
and a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 20.
 
On October 8, 2024, Metro filed this motion to
consolidate. Notice of the motion was filed in all three related matters. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
The motion (as noticed in all three cases) was initially set
to be heard on November 4.  The hearing
was continued by the Court for scheduling reasons.  The motion in the Garcia Action was continued
to November 6; the motion in the Rojas Action was continued to November 13; and
the motion in the Axelrod Action was continued to November 18.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd.
(a).)  The purpose of consolidation is to
enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence
and the danger of inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield
Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.) 
 
There are two types
of consolidation: a complete consolidation for all purposes, and a more limited
consolidation for trial or certain other specific purposes (such as pre-trial
discovery).  (Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1127, 1147; Sanchez v. Super.
Ct. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d
1391, 1396; see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2024), ¶¶ 12:340-341.3.)  When cases are consolidated for all purposes,
“the two actions are merged into a single proceeding under one case number and
result in only one verdict or set of findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203
Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a
consolidation for limited purposes, “the two actions remain otherwise
separate.”  (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  
“Consolidation under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the trial court to
determine whether the consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.” (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.) 
There are a
number of special procedural requirements for a motion to consolidate.  Such a motion must (among other things): “(A)
List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and
the names of their respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of
all the cases sought to be consolidated; with the lowest numbered case shown
first; and (C) Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd.
(a)(1).)  The motion must be “served on
all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated.”  (Id.,
subd. (a)(2)(B).)  And before the motion
is heard, the cases must all be assigned to the same department.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3,
subd. (g)(1) [“A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and
heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department.”].)
 
Discussion
 
Metro requests
an order consolidating the Axelrod Action, the Rojas Action, and the Garcia
Action.  All three actions arise out of
the same accident on September 7, 2022. 
 
Metro
has satisfied all of the substantive and procedural requirements for the
motion.  There are common issues
of law and fact in the three cases as well as common parties. Consolidation
would promote judicial efficiency as to discovery and motions and preserve
resources.
 
Good cause has been
shown.  Metro’s motion to consolidate is
GRANTED.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Metro’s motion to
consolidate for all purposes.  The matters
filed under case numbers 23STCV09010,
23STCV12815, and 23STCV13913 are consolidated. 
The head case is Case No. 23STCV09010. 

 
All
future filings must be made under Case No. 23STCV09010.
 
The hearings on consolidation scheduled
in Case No. 23STCV12815 on November 13 and in Case No. 23STCV09010 on November
18 are placed off calendar.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
