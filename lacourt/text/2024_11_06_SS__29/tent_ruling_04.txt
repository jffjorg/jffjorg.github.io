Background
On December 10, 2021, Shaobin Zhuo and Jin
Feng Zhuo (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Pomona Valley
Hospital Medical Center (“Pomona Valley”), Seyed Kamali, M.D., and Does 1
through 100 for wrongful death – negligence arising out of medical treatment of
decedent Ryan Zhuo from November 28 to December 15, 2020.
On May 27, 2022, Pomona Valley filed an

On September 30, 2024, Kenneth I. Gross, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed this motion
to be relieved as counsel. 
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel with the
Court, along with proofs of service. 
Counsel states
that there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel
has verified Plaintiff’s current address by telephone. Further, the declaration
and proposed orders served on Plaintiff show all the upcoming hearing dates for
this action.
The Court finds
Counsel has established good cause to be relieved as attorney of record for
Plaintiff due to the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel has
met all substantive and procedural requirements.
Therefore, this
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the client.
Moving Counsel
to give notice.
