And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which means the defendant is asking the court to dismiss the plaintiff's case without a trial. The judge is looking at several issues before making a decision.

First, the judge wants to know why the defendant's witness, Lorenzo Melendez, submitted his declaration late. If the declaration is important, the judge might allow the defendant to file a new response to argue that the declaration doesn't create any disputes that need to be decided by a jury.

Second, the judge is looking at whether the plaintiff's allegations of gross negligence are sufficient. Gross negligence is a high level of carelessness, and the judge wants to know if the plaintiff has alleged enough facts to support this claim.

Third, the judge is considering the plaintiff's allegations of spoliation, which means the defendant might have destroyed or hidden evidence that could have helped the plaintiff's case. The plaintiff is asking the judge to allow them to present this evidence at trial and ask the jury to draw an adverse inference against the defendant.

Finally, the judge is looking at inconsistencies in the testimony of one of the defendant's witnesses, Sean Bleemers, and the testimony of the defendant's designated expert, Joshton Sorrentino. The judge wants to know if these inconsistencies create disputes that need to be decided by a jury.

The judge will hear arguments from both sides before making a final decision.
