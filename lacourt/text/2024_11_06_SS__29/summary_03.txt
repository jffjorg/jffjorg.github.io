The judge is setting a tentative ruling for a hearing on November 6, 2024, regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel by Albert Abkarian & Associates, the law firm representing plaintiff Krystal Renee Castro. The motion was filed on October 9, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The judge notes that the law firm has been unable to communicate with the clients for eight months, making it difficult to represent them. The judge is concerned about several issues, including whether the law firm seeks relief only for Krystal Renee Castro or also for the minor plaintiffs, and what will happen to their claims if relief is granted. The judge will also inquire about the status of the settlement, release, and settlement payment. The hearing will be called to discuss these issues further.
