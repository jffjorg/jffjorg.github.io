And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for leave to file a permissive cross-complaint against Michael W. Chu, M.D. The defendant already filed a cross-complaint against Chu, issued a summons, and served Chu. The court finds that the motion is unnecessary and that the defendant has not shown why the filing of a cross-complaint against Chu is in the interests of justice at this stage of the case. The defendant has not proceeded diligently with the proposed cross-complaint and it appears to be a delay tactic. The judge notes that denial of the motion will not prejudice the defendant, as they will not be barred from asserting future claims against Chu for indemnification in a subsequent, independent action. However, the plaintiff would be prejudiced by a further lengthy delay in trial if leave to amend were granted at this date.
