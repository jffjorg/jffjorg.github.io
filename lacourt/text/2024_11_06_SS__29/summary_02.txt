And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for leave to conduct four additional medical examinations of the plaintiff. The motion is untimely, having been filed nine days after the cutoff date, and does not specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination as required by the governing statute. The court notes that the defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff as of right, without advance leave of the court, but that additional examinations require a motion and "good cause" shown. The court finds that the defendant has not met this burden and therefore denies the motion. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is also denied.
