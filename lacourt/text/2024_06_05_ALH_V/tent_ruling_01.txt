RESPONSES, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, 
TO PLAINTIFF’S FORM AND SPECIAL 
INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE)MOVING PARTIES: Plaintiff EDGAR GERARDO PAREDES RAMIREZ
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant FCA US LLC
The court considered the moving papers and opposition.
BACKGROUNDPlaintiff filed the complaint on July 26, 2023, against defendant FCA US LLC. Plaintiff 
alleges the following causes of action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of express 
warranty, (2) violation of Beverly-Song Act – breach of implied warranty, and (3) violation of 
the Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2. Plaintiff alleges that he purchased a 2020 Dodge Charger 
(subject vehicle) on May 1, 2021. Plaintiff alleges that during the warranty period, the subject 
vehicle contained or developed serious defects and nonconformities including but not limited to, 
electrical, engine, and transmission system defects. Plaintiff alleges the subject vehicle had 
difficulties turning on and issues accelerating.  Plaintiff filed the instant motion on March 28, 2024. Defendant filed its oppositions on 
May 13, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A plaintiff may propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after 
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, 
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days 
after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and 
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 
§ 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) 
If a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories, the party to whom the request is 
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 
2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for 
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on
defendant on September 25, 2023. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 8-10; Exhs. 1-3.) Defendant 
served verified responses to plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories (Set One) and plaintiff’s Form 
Interrogatories (Set One) on May 12, 2024. (Decl. of Vanessa Van Dao, ¶ 4, Exh. A.) Because 
defendant has served verified responses to the interrogatories, the motion is moot.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and special 
interrogatories. A motion must be brought separately for each discovery method at issue. Here, 
the instant motion should have been filed as two separate motions and two filing fees paid, one 
for each motion. Accordingly, plaintiffs are ordered to pay the additional filing fee.
Based on the foregoing, the motion is moot. Plaintiff is ordered to pay the additional filing fee.
