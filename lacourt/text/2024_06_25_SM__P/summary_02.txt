And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the defendants' motion to compel a psychological IME (Independent Medical Examination) is GRANTED. The plaintiff, Gonzales, sued the defendants, Keller and Shimizu, for injuries sustained when their dog bit him, causing physical and emotional distress. The defendants argue that the IME is necessary to evaluate the plaintiff's claimed psychiatric injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The plaintiff objects, claiming that he has not suffered ongoing emotional distress and that the IME is not justified. The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the IME, citing the plaintiff's claims of emotional distress and the need to evaluate his mental state. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not stated whether he plans to introduce psychological expert testimony or the PTSD diagnosis at trial, and that the IME would be unfair if the plaintiff is allowed to present such testimony without giving the defendants the opportunity to have an expert evaluate him. The judge also reprimands defense counsel for revealing the amount of their CCP 998 offer, which is confidential. Finally, the judge notes that the parties should have addressed this issue through an informal discovery conference and recommends that they schedule one in the future if they have similar discovery disputes.
