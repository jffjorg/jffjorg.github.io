Amin
v. Law Offices of Ramin Azadegan, APC, et al., Case No. 24SMCV01109
Hearing
date June 25, 2024
Defendant
Fischer, Zisblatt & Kiss, LLP’s Demurrer
Defendant
Law Offices of Ramin Azadegan, APC’s Demurrer
 
In
this legal malpractice case, plaintiff sued his former lawyers defendants Law
Offices of Ramin Azadegan (Azadegan) and Fischer Zisblatt & Kiss (Fischer),
who represented plaintiff in a breach of guaranty suit against plaintiff and
his former business partner Emein (Underlying Action). 
 
In
plaintiff’s cross-complaint for indemnity against Emein in the Underlying
Action, Azadegan failed to allege a specific sum of damages, though Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.10(a)(2) requires in a cross-complaint “the amount
demanded shall be stated.” Plaintiff substituted in Fischer as counsel; Fisher did
not amend the cross-complaint to allege a specific sum. Nevertheless, on
September 15, 2009 the trial court entered default judgment in plaintiff’s
favor for $2,624,084 against Emein. From 2009-22, plaintiff sought unsuccessfully
to enforce this default judgment. 
 
On
May 4, 2022 Emein moved unsuccessfully in the trial court to vacate the default
judgment, arguing the cross-complaint failed to plead a specific amount of
damages. Emein’s appeal was successful, and on December 5, 2023 the court
reversed, finding the “cross-complaint did not include a specific request for
damages, so the trial court was without jurisdiction to enter the default judgment
in favor of Amin.” Bucknell Decl. Exh. 4. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges damages as a result of defendants’ failure to allege a specific sum in the
cross-complaint in the Underlying Action. Azadegan and Fischer each demur, both
arguing the claim is time barred per Code Civ. Proc. §340.6(a). As defendant
law firm file substantially similar demurrers, they are addressed collectively.

 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendants
Azadegan and Fisher request judicial notice of various court records (Bucknell
Decl., Exhs. 1-5; Fisher, Exhs. A-I). GRANTED per Evid. Code §§452-453. The
court takes judicial notice only as to the existence and authenticity of such
documents; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of factual matters
asserted. Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.
 
Demurrer
In
reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint on demurrer, a court will treat
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co. v.
Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062. A “demurrer lies only
for defects appearing on the face of the complaint[.]” Stevens v. Superior
Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601. For purposes of ruling on a demurrer,
the complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from
the facts pleaded. Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th
952, 958.
 
A
demurrer based on statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,
but is not necessarily, barred. Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225,
1232. For the bar to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows the action may be barred. Id. A statute of limitations
does not begin to run until a cause of action accrues.
 
A
cause of action for legal malpractice accrues when plaintiff knows, or should
know, all material facts essential to show the elements of that cause of
action. Lee, supra, at 1233, citing Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy,
Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 190. Per Code of Civil
Procedure sec. 340.6(a), the statute of limitations for legal malpractice is
“one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable
diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or
omission…”
 
The
one-year period of section 340.6(a) “is triggered when the client discovers, or
should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission and
‘not by his discovery that such facts constitute professional negligence . . .
It is irrelevant that the plaintiff is ignorant of his legal remedy or the
legal theories underlying his cause of action.’” Truong v. Glasser
(2009) 181 Cal.App.4th 102, 110 [quoting Worton v. Worton (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1638, 1650].
 
Plaintiff
and law firm defendants dispute when injury occurred. The demurrers argue (1)
plaintiff learned of the facts constituting the alleged wrongdoing no later
than when Emein’s motion to vacate was filed in the trial court on May 4, 2022,
and (2) Amin’s actual injury occurred when default was entered on September 15,
2009, not when the appellate court ruled it defective on December 5, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff
argues whether he should have discovered the law firms’ negligence in drafting the
cross-complaint is a question of fact, not law. "[I]n legal malpractice
actions statute of limitations issues, including injury, are at base factual
inquiries." Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal. 4th 583, 588. Plaintiff
asserts all he knew was that Emein challenged the legitimacy of the default. Plaintiff
argues the trial court’s denial of the motion is further evidence he should not
have been on notice of Azadegan and Fischer’s alleged negligence. Plaintiff also
argues he did not sustain injury (i.e. his damages did not accrue) until the appellate
court reversal on December 5, 2023.
 
“The
question of when there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action,
especially in malpractice cases, is ordinarily a question of fact. It is only
where reasonable minds can draw but one conclusion from the evidence, that it
becomes a matter of law.” Johnson v. Haberman & Kassoy (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 1468, 1476; see also Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v. Brobeck, Phleger
& Harrison (1998) 18 Cal.4th 739, 751 [“determining when actual injury
occurred is predominantly a factual inquiry”]. 
 
Whether
plaintiff should have known the cross-complaint was defective as of the date of
Emein’s motion is a question of fact. Emein’s filing of a motion to vacate does
not establish that a wrongdoing occurred. Without actual loss or damage, there
is no tort. Jackson
v. Johnson
(1992) 5 Cal. App. 4th 1350, 1355 (quoting Budd v. Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.
3d 195, 200)). Plaintiff’s alleged damage did not occur until the appellate
court reversed the trial court’s entry of default judgment. As of date Emein’s
motion to vacate was filed, May 4, 2022, the default judgment was still valid;
it remained valid until the appellate court ruling on December 5, 2023. 
 
Second,
when the actual injury occurred is disputed. Defendants rely on Worton,
supra, Sharon v. Porter (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 1, and Jordache,
supra, to support the argument that “actual injury” occurred upon entry of
the defective default judgment on September 15, 2009. 
 
Neel,
supra,
at 190 held a cause of action for attorney negligence does not accrue until the
client discovers, or should have discovered, facts essential to a malpractice
claim. In Budd, supra, the court held a cause of action for legal
malpractice does not accrue until the client suffers damage, and determination
of that date raises an issue of fact. Id. at 198. A cause of action does
not accrue until the client both sustains damage and discovers (or should
discover) the cause of action. Id. at 203. “The test for actual injury under section 340.6, therefore, is whether
the plaintiff has sustained any damages compensable in an action, other than
one for actual fraud, against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission
arising in the performance of professional services.” Jordache, supra, at
751.
 
Because the question of when and whether injury
occurred is a question of fact, all plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as
true on demurrer. For the court to resolve the statute of limitations question
on demurrer, it is required to accept plaintiff’s factual allegations. That is,
plaintiff
discovered the alleged malpractice on December 5, 2023. 
 
Defendants argue plaintiff suffered injury in 2009
when default judgment was entered, but admit plaintiff was unaware the default
judgment was defective at that time. The parties dispute whether plaintiff knew
(or should have known) of defendants’ alleged negligence when the appellate
decision voided the default judgment on December 5, 2023, or when Emein filed the
motion to vacate on May 4, 2022. 
 
Plaintiff
arguably suffered actual injury when the default judgment was found void by the
appellate court on December 5, 2023. Based on plaintiff’s allegations, he did
not know of defendants’ allegedly wrongful acts regarding the cross-complaint
in the Underlying Action until the appellate court reversal. 
 
The
factual issues regarding running of the statute cannot be resolved on demurrer,
where the court must accept as true all factual allegations of the complaint. OVERRULED.
