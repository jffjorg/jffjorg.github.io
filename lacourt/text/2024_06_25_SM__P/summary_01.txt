And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to add a theory of disparate impact. The plaintiff, a UCLA graduate student with ADHD, learning disabilities, and migraines, seeks reasonable accommodations from the University. The defendant, the Regents of the University of California, opposes the motion, citing unreasonable delay and prejudice. The Judge notes that courts have a policy of allowing amendments at any stage of the proceeding, and that delay alone is not a basis to deny a motion for leave to amend. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's contention that the disparate impact theory was only discovered recently is supported by the recent PMK depositions, and that the defendant's argument that plaintiff's counsel was aware of the facts that gave rise to the disparate impact claim prior to May 2023 is not persuasive. The Judge grants the motion, but notes that the parties will need to meet and confer regarding any additional discovery required to support the new theory, and that the defendant will have the opportunity to test the new theory via a dispositive motion prior to trial.
