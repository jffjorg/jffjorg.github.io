And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is on a legal malpractice case brought by Plaintiff Amin against his former lawyers, Law Offices of Ramin Azadegan, APC and Fischer Zisblatt & Kiss, LLP. The case involves a breach of guaranty suit against Amin and his former business partner Emein, in which the defendants allegedly failed to allege a specific sum of damages in the cross-complaint. The trial court entered a default judgment against Emein, which was later reversed by the appellate court on December 5, 2023, finding that the cross-complaint did not include a specific request for damages.

The defendants demurred, arguing that the claim is time-barred, and that Amin should have known of their alleged negligence when Emein filed a motion to vacate the default judgment on May 4, 2022. However, the Judge ruled that the question of when and whether Amin suffered actual injury is a question of fact, and that all of Amin's allegations must be accepted as true on demurrer. The Judge also noted that the one-year period for legal malpractice is triggered when the client discovers, or should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission, and that the question of when Amin discovered the alleged malpractice is also a question of fact. Therefore, the Judge overruled the demurrers and ordered the defendants to answer within 10 court days.
