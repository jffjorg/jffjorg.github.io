The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the defendant's motion for order compelling compliance, terminating sanctions, and monetary sanctions. The defendant sought relief due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a Court Order regarding discovery.

The judge also denies the request for additional monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
