Defendant’s Motion for Order Compelling Compliance, for Terminating Sanctions,
and for Monetary Sanctions
Tentative
The motion is granted in part and denied in
part.
Background
On December
3, 2021, Leilani LaCaille (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Lourdes
Rodriguez (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100, asserting cause of action for
negligence, negligence per se, and vicarious liability arising out of an alleged
automobile accident on June 28, 2019.
On March 22, 2024, Defendant filed an
answer.
On September 26,
2024, Defendant filed this motion seeking various relief, including an order
compelling compliance with a prior court order, terminating sanctions, and
monetary sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff filed
an opposition on October 11.  Defendant
filed a reply on October 21.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
On August 6, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses to
discovery and ordered Plaintiff to serve code compliant, written, verified responses,
without objection to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) within 15 days
of notice.  Defendant provided notice of
the ruling by electronic service on August 7, 2024.  (Norling Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)
Plaintiff did not comply with the
Court’s order.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-8.)  Plaintiff filed this motion on September 26,
2024.
On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff belatedly
served verified responses, without objection, to the discovery requests.  (Reply, Exh. B; Basseri Decl.)  Plaintiff asserts that the tardy responses
are code compliant; Defendant disagrees.
Plaintiff
has failed to comply with a Court Order regarding discovery and violated her
obligations under the Civil Discovery Act. This is serious misuse of the
discovery process that is prejudicial to Defendant and that warrants sanctions.
Defendant
asks for four items of relief.
First,
Defendant asks for a court order requiring Plaintiff to comply with the prior
order. That request is denied.  The Court
has already made its order, and Plaintiff is under a legal obligation to comply
with it.  An additional order requiring
Plaintiff to comply with the prior order – which she already must – would not
change anything.
Second, Defendant requests terminating
sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s Order.  That request is denied.  For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall, as Plaintiff has
(belatedly) provided responses. 
Third, Defendant requests monetary sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c).  That request is
granted.  Plaintiff’s violation of a
Court Order is a misuse of the discovery process that, under these circumstances,
warrants monetary sanctions.  The Court
sets sanctions in the requested amount of $869.95, based on four hours of
attorney work multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $200 per hour,
plus filing costs of $69.95.  (See
Norling Decl., ¶ 9.)
Fourth, Defendant requests that the Court
order monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500 paid to the Court under Code
of Civil Procedure section 177.5.  The
Court, under all of the circumstances present here, exercises its discretion to
decline to order such additional monetary sanctions.
Finally, the Courts notes that in her reply, Defendant argues that
the belated responses served by Plaintiff are not code compliant.  The Court makes no ruling in that
regard.  If the responses are not code
compliant, Defendant may obtain relief through a motion to compel further
responses under the Civil Discovery Act (after all procedural requirements for
such a motion are satisfied).
Conclusion
The
Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant’s motion. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s request for an order compelling compliance with the
prior Court Order.
The Court
DENIES Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions.
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery
Act.
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff Leilani Lacaille and her counsel of record, Andy Basseri,
Esq., jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act in the amount of $869.95 to Defendant Lourdes Rodriguez (through
counsel) within 30 days of notice.
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 177.5.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
