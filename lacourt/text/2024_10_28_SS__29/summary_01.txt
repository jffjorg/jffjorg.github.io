And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles (Defendant) has filed a motion for leave to file a permissive cross-complaint against Love Baked Wings LLC and Love Baked Wings Melrose LLC (Proposed Cross-Defendants). The Defendant seeks to assert a cause of action against the Proposed Cross-Defendants, alleging that they exercised control over the walkway where the plaintiff tripped and fell. The Defendant argues that it was not aware of the Proposed Cross-Defendants' liability until September 2024, when its liability expert inspected the location and noted a lack of permit for the Proposed Cross-Defendants. The Court finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same set of facts as the plaintiff's complaint and grants leave to file the proposed cross-complaint in the interest of justice.
