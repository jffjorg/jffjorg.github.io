And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by Privitera seeking the disqualification of Byrnes and Railsback. Although the notice of motion only requested the disqualification of Byrnes, the accompanying memorandum of points and authorities appears to also seek the disqualification of Railsback. Despite the failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a), which requires specific information in the notice of motion, the court will construe the motion as seeking the disqualification of both Byrnes and Railsback. Additionally, the court notes that Privitera repeatedly cites to an outdated rule, Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 3-310, which has been superseded by Rule 1.7, entitled "Conflict of Interest: Current Clients," effective November 1, 2018.
