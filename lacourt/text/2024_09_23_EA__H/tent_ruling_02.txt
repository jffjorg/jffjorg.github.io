   [FN1] While Privitera’s notice of motion is limited to  seeking disqualification of Byrnes, in his accompanying memorandum of points  and authorities, he appears to seek disqualification of Railsback as well. Notwithstanding  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a), which requires that the notice of  motion state the “nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance  of the order,” the Court will construe the motion as seeking disqualification  of both Byrnes and Railsback, as Plaintiff has failed to articulate any  prejudice by this omission in the notice.   [FN2] Privitera repeatedly cites to Rules of Professional  Conduct, rule 3-310; however, Rule 3-310 has been superseded by Rules of  Professional Conduct, Rule 1.7, which went into effect on November 1, 2018.  Rule 1.7 is entitled “Conflict of Interest: Current Clients.”
