The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Privitera's motions for judgment on the pleadings and disqualification. The case involves employment discrimination, with the plaintiff alleging sexual harassment and discrimination by the defendants. The Court notes that the motions are untimely and that the defendant has not demonstrated any conflicts of interest that would warrant disqualification of the plaintiff's counsel. The Court also rejects the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's counsel has engaged in improper conduct. The case will proceed to a Mandatory Settlement Conference, Final Status Conference, and Court Trial.
