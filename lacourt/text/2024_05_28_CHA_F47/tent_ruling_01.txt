MOTION TO
INTERVENE
 
Motion filed on 1/10/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Proposed Intervenor Integon National
Insurance Company
RESPONDING PARTY: all other parties
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order permitting Integon
National Insurance Company leave to file a Complaint-in-Intervention in this
action as insurer for Defendant Jose Luis Gomez Ramirez.
 
RULING: 
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 9/30/22 wherein Plaintiff Juan Francisco Rodriguez Cortes
(Plaintiff) was struck by a motor vehicle driven by Defendant Jose Luis Gomez
Ramirez (Ramirez).  (Complaint ¶16).  Plaintiff alleges that Ramirez drove a
vehicle off the road and struck Plaintiff at the intersection of Laurel Canyon
Boulevard and Mercer Street in Los Angeles. 
Id.  Plaintiff alleges that
on or before the accident Defendants Numero Uno, BBI Capital LLC (BBI), Felipe Camacho
Lopez and Does 1-100 owned and/or controlled the land and/or were managing,
controlling, and/or operating a food truck(s), food cart(s), and/or outdoor
cooking equipment (the Street Food Setup) on the land and area where the
accident occurred.  (Complaint ¶27).  
 
Proposed Intervenor Integon National Insurance Company
(Integon) issued a Personal Auto Policy to Ramirez, effective 2/19/22 through
2/19/23 (the Policy).  (William A. Hadikusumo
(WAH) Decl. ¶6).  Integon agreed to
provide and has been providing a defense in this action subject to a
reservation of rights under the Policy and applicable California law.  Id.
 
From the receipt of the Complaint in September 2023 to the
present, Integon has unsuccessfully attempted to contact Ramirez to discuss the
action with him.  (WAH Decls. ¶¶8-9).  Therefore, on 1/10/24, Integon filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order granting Integon leave to file a
Complaint-in-Intervention in this action as insurer for Ramirez.  No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Upon timely application, a non-party has the right to
intervene in an action if that non-party claims an interest relating to the
transaction in question and the disposition of the action could impair its
ability to protect its interests.  See
CCP 387(d).
 
Integon has a direct and immediate interest in this
action.  If judgment is entered against
Integon’s insured, Ramirez, it would affect Integon’s interests because Plaintiff
could then proceed against Integon under Insurance Code 11580(b)(2) which
permits a judgment creditor to proceed directly against any liability insurance
covering the defendant to obtain satisfaction up to the policy limits.  See Reliance Insurance Co. (200)
84 CA4th 383, 386-387; Nasongkhla (1994) 29 CA4th Supp. 1, 3-4; Executive
Risk Indemnity, Inc. (2009) 171 CA4th 319, 334; Western Heritage
Insurance Co. (2011) 199 CA4th 1196, 1207-1208.
 
Integon’s intervention in this action will not expand the
scope of issues in this action as Integon only seeks to raise the defenses that
its insured driver, Ramirez, would have raised and properly reserve its rights
to raise any coverage issues in a later action under Insurance Code 11580.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court finds that Integon has made a sufficient
showing that it has a right to intervene in this action.  However, based on the arguments set forth in
the motion, the affirmative defenses set forth in the proposed
Complaint-in-Intervention attached to the declaration of William A. Hadikusumo as
Exhibit A and CCP 387(b)(2) and (c), it appears that Integon should be filing
an answer-in-intervention rather than the proposed
complaint-in-intervention.  
 
Therefore, Integon’s request to intervene will be granted
if Integon agrees to re-title its proposed complaint-in-intervention as its
answer-intervention and separately file such  answer-in-intervention.  If Integon disagrees and contends that the
complaint-in-intervention is the proper pleading to be filed, the hearing on
the motion will be continued and Integon will be ordered to file a brief,
limited to 10 pages, at least 10 court days before the continued hearing date
explaining why a complaint-in-intervention, rather than an
answer-in-intervention, is the proper pleading to be filed.
