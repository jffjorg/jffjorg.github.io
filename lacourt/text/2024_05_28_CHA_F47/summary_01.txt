And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled that Integon National Insurance Company has the right to intervene in the action. Integon has a direct and immediate interest in the action as the insurer of the defendant, Jose Luis Gomez Ramirez. The court finds that Integon's intervention will not expand the scope of issues in the action, and Integon will only seek to raise defenses that its insured would have raised. The court concludes that Integon should be granted leave to intervene in the action, but only if Integon agrees to re-title its proposed complaint-in-intervention as an answer-in-intervention and separately file such answer-in-intervention.
