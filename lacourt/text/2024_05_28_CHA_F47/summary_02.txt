And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, which means the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any of the causes of action. The judge also denies the defendant's motion for order declaring the plaintiff a vexatious litigant and the request for pre-filing order requiring the plaintiff to post security. The judge finds that the plaintiff is not a vexatious litigant because none of the eight actions filed by the plaintiff have been finally determined adversely to the plaintiff, and none of the actions have been pending at least two years. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not repeatedly filed unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, or engaged in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
