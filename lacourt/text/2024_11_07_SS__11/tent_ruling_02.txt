Defendants are Transport, American Home, Century Indemnity Co., Fireman’s Fund
Insurance Co., Lexington, National Union, and ERC.  (See Gupta Decl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 14-20 [attaching
the proposed SAC].)


 
[2] “Several
cases have stated that the motion must be denied unless defendant establishes
that California is a ‘seriously inconvenient’ forum.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:408.8.)  But, “where plaintiff is a nonresident, it is
error for the trial court to impose the ‘seriously inconvenient’ burden on
defendant.”  (Ibid.)  “To the extent this standard is appropriate .
. . , it applies only when defendant seeks dismissal of the action on forum non conveniens
grounds.  It does not apply when
defendant seeks a stay of the
action.”  (Ibid., emphasis in original.) 
 


[3] There are only seven Defendants here, so the Court intends
to follow the American Cemwood rule.
