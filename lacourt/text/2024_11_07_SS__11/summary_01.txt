And here is a brief English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff, Legacy Vulcan LLC, is seeking to add breach-of-contract claims against Lexington and ERC. The defendants, American Home Assurance Co., Lexington Insurance Co., and National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, PA, are opposing the motion, arguing that California is an inconvenient forum and that the case should be litigated in Alabama. The Court has granted the motion, finding that California's amendment policy is liberal and that the defendants have failed to establish that Alabama is a suitable alternative forum. The Court has also noted that the defendants' opposition brief constitutes an unnoticed motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens, and that the burden is on the defendants to present evidence to support their claim.
