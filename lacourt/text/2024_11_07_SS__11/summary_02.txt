And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to stay the action filed by the defendants, who are Transport, American Home, Century Indemnity Co., Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co., Lexington, National Union, and ERC. The defendants argue that the court should stay the action because California is a "seriously inconvenient" forum, but the Judge notes that this standard only applies when the defendant is seeking dismissal of the action, not a stay. The Judge intends to follow the American Cemwood rule, which has been applied in similar cases. The Judge is considering the burden of proof for the "seriously inconvenient" forum standard and notes that it may not apply in this case since the plaintiff is a non-resident.
