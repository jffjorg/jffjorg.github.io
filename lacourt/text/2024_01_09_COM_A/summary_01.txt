And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Carson is seeking to continue its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication against James H. Cloudman, the owner of a real property that allegedly has created a nuisance. However, since Mr. Cloudman has passed away, the Court must consider whether the action can continue against his successor-in-interest. The Court has decided to continue the hearing to April 18, 2024, to permit the City to comply with the procedures necessary to continue the action against Mr. Cloudman's personal representative. The City must file a creditor's claim with the estate and provide proof of compliance with Probate Code Section 9000. If the claim is rejected, the City has three months to apply with the Court for an order to substitute Mr. Cloudman's personal representative as the real party in interest.
