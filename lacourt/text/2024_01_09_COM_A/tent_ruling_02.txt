[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
 MOTION BY DEFENDANT, PEYMAN MAHROU, TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES AND PRODUCTION
 OF DOCUMENTS FROM PLAINTIFF AND FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The
complaint filed on May 24, 2022, alleges that Plaintiff contracted to provide
custom lighting and fixtures to Defendants, who allegedly failed to pay the
balance due of $684,625.77. Plaintiff alleges claims for breach of contract,
account stated, common counts, open book account, and quantum meruit.
II.     
ARGUMENTS
      Defendant,
Peyman Mahrou, served Plaintiff with a request for production of documents on
January 17, 2023. Plaintiff sent initial responses and subsequently served supplemental
responses on May 25, 2023, after the parties met and conferred. Defendant sent a
letter advising of the defects in the supplemental responses on May 31, 2023,
but Plaintiff did not respond.
      Plaintiff
argues that the motion is untimely filed more than 45 days after Defendant
served its supplemental responses. The parties did not sign a written
stipulation to extend time to file this motion. The dispute is moot because Plaintiff
responded to Defendant, Parmida, LLC’s request containing the same categories
requested by Defendant Mahrou.            
      In
reply, Defendant contends that Plaintiff does not address the deficiencies in
its document production but asks the Court to award Plaintiff for its
intransigency. The motion is timely made given the parties agreements, to which
Plaintiff did not object. 
III.   
DISCUSSION
      A
motion to compel further responses to a document request is proper where the
requesting party believes the statement of compliance is incomplete, or a
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive
and/or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310.) The parties
have met and conferred informally and with the Court without resolution. 
      However,
the demanding party waives any right to compel further responses if notice of the
motion is given more than 45 days after service of any supplemental, verified
response or a later date to which the parties agreed in writing. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
      Plaintiff
served supplemental responses to the discovery on May 25, 2023. (Rosner decl.,
¶7, Ex. H.) The 45th day expired on Monday, July 10, 2023. Defendant
contends that after the IDC with the Court on August 18, 2023, Plaintiff agreed
to serve supplemental responses to all discovery, including the document
request by September 18, 2023, and agreed to sign a protective order. (Rosner
decl., ¶ 11.) Any stipulation to extend the 45-day period is required to be in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, (subd. (c).) That limitation is “mandatory
and jurisdictional” just as it is for motions to compel further answers to
interrogatories.” (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409–1410.) 
      A
prior version (pre-1986) of the statute gave the court discretion to extend the
time to file a motion to compel further responses. However, the elimination of
that provision “indicates an intention by the Legislature not to vest any
authority in the court to permit discovery that is not timely made.” (Sexton at 1409.) 
      Defendant
has not provided a written stipulation to extend the 45-day period. At the IDC
on August 18, 2023, the parties were required to provide a stipulation and
order. The Court’s file does not reflect that the parties submitted such
documents. While Defendant provides emails with its reply brief, none reference
an agreement extending time to file this motion to compel further responses. 
      Defendant
contends that Plaintiff did not object to various notices providing that the
date for filing a motion to compel was tolled. (Reply decl., Ex. B, 2:7-10.) While
the Discovery Act previously gave the court discretion to toll the deadline for
filing a discovery motion, that statute was repealed on January 1, 2023. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.080.) 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
      Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion is DENIED.
