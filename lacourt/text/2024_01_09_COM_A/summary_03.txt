And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendant's further responses to special interrogatories. The defendant, Kia America, Inc., had failed to respond to the interrogatories in a timely and complete manner, and had not complied with its obligations to meet and confer with the plaintiffs to resolve the issues. The court found that the defendant's objections to the special interrogatories were without merit, and that the discovery sought by the plaintiffs was relevant to issues raised in cases for violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA). The court ordered the defendant to provide verified, further responses to special interrogatories 3, 21, 22, and 23 within 14 days, and did not award sanctions despite the defendant's failure to meet and confer in good faith and failure to show substantial justification for opposing the motion.
