[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO
BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL OF RECORD FOR DEFENDANT, VIVA DONAS, INC. dba
DONAS, INC. 
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO DEEM FACTS ADMITTED AGAINST DEFENDANT, VIVA DONAS, INC.
dba DONAS, INC.
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      This action
arises from Defendants’ alleged breach of a commercial lease agreement.
Plaintiff alleges claims for breach of contract, account stated, and for money
had and received. 
      On June
12, 2023, Plaintiff served a first set of requests for admission on Defendants,
Ashley Leon, and David Vasquez (“Leon and Vasquez”), and Viva Donas, Inc., dba
Donas, Inc. (“the Corporation”).  All
three Defendants failed to serve responses due on July 17, 2023, did not seek
an extension of time to respond, and did not oppose Plaintiff’s motion.
      Subsequently,
defense counsel, Bruce R. Menke, filed substitutions of attorney on behalf of all
three Defendants. On October 3, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
deem facts admitted as to Leon and Vasquez. The Court continued the motion with
respect to the Corporation to permit counsel to move to withdraw and for
Plaintiff to serve the motion on defense counsel, who did not obtain the
Court’s order permitting withdrawal of a corporation. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
II.     
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR THE
CORPORATION
      Counsel
for the
 Corporation, filed this motion on November
 27, 2023, for an order to be relieved as counsel because the
Corporation’s representative authorized counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel served
the motion on the client by electronic transmission confirmed by telephone  within the past 30 days. The Corporation’s
 representative, Mr. Vasquez, also advised of the company’s change of business
 address.
      Defense
counsel has complied with the requirements of California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED. The order is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the
signed order upon the client.
 
III.   
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DEEM FACTS ADMITTED AGAINST
DEFENDANT VIVA DONAS, INC., AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
      Plaintiff re-served the motion on October 3, 2023, on Mr.
Menke, the Corporation’s counsel, who did not file an opposition. The Court can
issue a deemed admitted order against the non-responding party who fails to
timely respond.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).) Imposition of
sanctions is mandatory where a party’s failure to respond to the requests
necessitates the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).)
      As
there is no evidence that the Corporation served code-compliant responses prior
to the hearing, the motion is GRANTED. The Corporation’s responses to requests
for admission are deemed admitted. 
      While
Plaintiff’s counsel requests $525 per hour for attorney’s fees, the Court finds
that $350 per hour is reasonable and one hour to prepare the motion is
reasonable for this discovery motion which is not complex and is unopposed.
(Decl. Sam Yebri, ¶ 5-7.) Accordingly, the Court imposes monetary sanctions of $350
against the Corporation, payable to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10 days.
