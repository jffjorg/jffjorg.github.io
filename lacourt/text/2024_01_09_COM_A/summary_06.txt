And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to relieve counsel for Viva Donas, Inc. (dba Donas, Inc.) due to the company's representative authorizing counsel's withdrawal. The Corporation's representative, Mr. Vasquez, has also advised of the company's change of business address.

The judge has also granted Plaintiff's motion to deem facts admitted against the Corporation, as there is no evidence that the Corporation served code-compliant responses prior to the hearing. The Corporation's responses to requests for admission are deemed admitted. The judge has imposed monetary sanctions of $350 against the Corporation, payable to Plaintiff's counsel within 10 days, as the Corporation's failure to respond to requests for admission necessitated the motion.
