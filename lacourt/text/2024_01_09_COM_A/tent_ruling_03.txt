[TENTATIVE] GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET
ONE
 
                                                                                                                                                       
I.    BACKGROUND
      The
complaint alleges that Defendant issued a written express warranty in
connection with Plaintiffs’ lease of a 2022 Kia Nero-EV. The vehicle developed
electrical and other defects. Defendant allegedly failed to comply with its
statutory obligations to replace the vehicle or pay restitution after failing
to repair the defects, all in violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act (“SBA”).
                                                                                                                                                     
II.           
ARGUMENTS
      Plaintiffs
served the first set of special interrogatories on Defendant on March 23, 2023,
Defendant served unverified, incomplete, and deficient responses on May 24,
2022. Plaintiffs' counsel sent numerous letters and emails to Defendant to
informally resolve the issues and for Defendant to provide verified,
supplemental responses. Defense counsel said he was “working on it.” Defendant
never responded to Plaintiff’s request for an Informal Discovery Conference
with the Court. 
      In
opposition, Defendant contends the requests are non-specific, vague, overbroad,
unduly burdensome, and seeks irrelevant and confidential information. The
requests have no bearing on a claim for civil penalty. 
      In
reply, Plaintiffs contend that the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion regarding
document requests on November 16, 2023, and required the parties to meet and
confer with respect to the present motion. Plaintiff reached out to counsel
three times, who stands by his objections, all of which are without merit.
                                                                                                                                                      
III.          
DISCUSSION
      Where
a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories, the court has authority to
compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290(b).) Late responses result in a
waiver of objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(a). Defendant served
unverified discovery responses on May 17, 2023, which Defendant
has not addressed. Defendant provided a blank sheet entitled “Verification to
Follow.” (Bohloul Decl., Ex. J., .pdf p. 83.) Accordingly, all objections are
waived. 
      The
Court previously granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to request for production of documents after explaining why the
discovery requests (similar if not identical to the issues raised in special
interrogatories) were relevant and discoverable and admonishing the parties to
meet and confer with respect to this motion. (M.O. 11/16/23.) Despite Plaintiffs’
counsel’s effort to confer three times, Defendant did not respond in substance.
(Bohloul Reply Decl., ¶ 3-5, Ex. A.) 
      At
issue are special interrogatories 3, 21, 22 and 23, which request identification
of witnesses who inspected, tested, and performed warranty repairs, the
description of assessments and analysis of defects plaguing the vehicle which Plaintiffs
contends is relevant to Defendant’s knowledge of the defects, the description
of any modification or changes made to the vehicle since production, and defendant’s
assessment of the vehicle’s battery defects.
       Defendant has not complied with its
obligations to meet and confer, which is an abuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010 (i).) Plaintiffs' counsel sent a seven-page meet and
confer letter to defense counsel on July 21, 2023. (Bohloul Decl., .pdf p. 170.)
Plaintiff requested dates for an IDC from Defendant. On September 17, 2023,
Plaintiffs' counsel sent another lengthy meet and confer letter and a follow-up
email on September 26, 2023, and another letter on October 22, 2023 (Id.
.pdf. p. 196-211, 213.)
      A
meaningful, reasonable, sincere, and good faith attempt to meet and confer
requires that the parties present their respective positions with “candor,
specificity, and support” during informal negotiations. (Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1435.)
The Discovery Act is meant to be “self-executing.” (Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1435.)
There is no evidence the parties discussed the issues in substance. 
      Plaintiffs are entitled to witness identity and location
information for persons involved with inspecting and testing
Plaintiff’s vehicle. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.). Although disclosure may
invade percipient witnesses’ privacy, there is generally no protection for the
identity, addresses and phone numbers of such witnesses except where there is a
risk of physical harm to the witness. (Puerto
v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1251–1252.)
Their willingness or unwillingness to testify is not relevant as “witnesses may
be compelled to appear and testify whether they want to or not.” (Id. at
1252.) 
      The
discovery sought is relevant to issues raised in cases for violation of the
SBA. To prevail, Plaintiff has the burden of proving that “(1) the
vehicle had a nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially
impaired the use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element);
(2) the vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the
manufacturer of the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the
manufacturer or his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a
reasonable number of repair attempts (the failure to repair element). " Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.         
      The
extent of Defendant’s knowledge of the defect, and Defendant’s attempt to
address it, or whether Defendant had a “fix” for the defect at issue are
relevant to Plaintiff’s case in chief including whether Defendant attempted to
comply with their obligations under the SBA. (Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) The information
requested is also relevant to the recovery of civil penalties if the buyer
can show that “the manufacturer's failure to comply was willful. The penalty is
important ‘as a deterrent to deliberate violations. Without such a provision, a
seller or manufacturer who knew the consumer was entitled to a refund or
replacement might nevertheless be tempted to refuse compliance in the hope the
consumer would not persist, secure in the knowledge its liability was limited
to refund or replacement.’” (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 112, 136.) 
      Plaintiffs
are entitled to discover information of the same defects in vehicles of the
same year, make, and model other than Plaintiffs’ vehicle as it is relevant to
civil penalties. (Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154; Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)
      Defendant
has not established that compliance will be unreasonably burdensome and oppressive.
Defendant’s remedy is to move for a protective order, not refuse to respond or
unilaterally impose limitations on Plaintiffs’ discovery. Defendant did not
meet its burden of proof on that issue. (West
Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) The
only evidence provided is defense counsel’s declaration, who does not attest to
the number of hours required to obtain and produce the documents. IV.         
CONCLUSION
      Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to
provide verified, further response to special interrogatories 3, 21, 22, and
23, without objection and within 14 days as requested by Plaintiffs. As
Plaintiffs have not requested imposition of sanctions, none is awarded, despite
Defendant’s abject failure to meet and confer in good faith, and failure to
show substantial justification for opposing the motion, and especially given
the Court’s ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s responses to
request for production of documents. These failures constitute an abuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
