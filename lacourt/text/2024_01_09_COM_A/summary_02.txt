And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion by defendant Peyman Mahrou to compel further responses and production of documents from the plaintiff, Amcor Lighting, Inc. dba Jiao Guang USA Group, and for a protective order. The motion was filed late, more than 45 days after the plaintiff served its supplemental responses, and no written stipulation to extend the time was submitted. The judge found that the plaintiff had already responded to the defendant's request for production of documents and that the defendant had not provided a written stipulation to extend the time to file the motion. The judge also noted that the statute requiring a written stipulation to extend time is "mandatory and jurisdictional". The plaintiff is seeking damages of $684,625.77 for breach of contract, account stated, common counts, open book account, and quantum meruit, while the defendant is seeking to compel further responses and production of documents.
