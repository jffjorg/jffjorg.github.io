[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING
 THE  CITY OF
 CARSON’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FOR SUMMARY
 ADJUDICATION AGAINST DEFENDANT, JAMES H. CLOUDMAN
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                    
I.         
FACTS
      The
complaint alleges that Defendant, James H. Cloudman, who owns the real property
at issue, failed to remedy conditions on the property, creating a nuisance. Plaintiff
alleges claims for public nuisance per se and public nuisance. ­­­ Defendant
Bank of New York Mellon (“Bank”) is Trustee with a beneficial interest in the
real property. (Complaint ¶ 11.) Defendant, MTC Financial became the
substituted trustee. (Complaint, ¶ 12.)
      Bank filed
its amended answer to the complaint on December 2, 2021. The clerk entered
default against Defendant, Advantix Lending, Inc. and Ditech Financial LLC, December
10, 2021. Plaintiff dismissed MTC Financial on October 13, 2021. 
      Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment or summary adjudication in its favor against
Defendant, James H. Cloudman, the property owner. The motion was timely served
on all parties and Mr. Cloudman did not file an opposition. However, at the
time of the hearing on October 27, 2023, Plaintiff informed the Court that Mr. Cloudman
passed away on July 11, 2023. The Court continued the hearing on this motion to
permit Plaintiff to file supplemental briefing and submit Cloudman’s death
certificate.
                                                                                                                                                        II.        
DISCUSSION
      As Mr. Cloudman is deceased, he lacks capacity to be sued. The
Court may, upon motion, allow a pending action to continue against the
decedent’s successor-in-interest if the action does not abate. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.41.) Plaintiff can continue the action against Mr.
Cloudman’s personal representatives after Plaintiff provides proof of
compliance with Probate Code Section 9000, by filing a creditor’s claim with
the estate. (Prob.
Code, § 9370.) A “claim” includes a demand for payment for the liability of
the decedent, “whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise.” (Prob.
Code, § 9000). The complaint seeks injunctive relief and recovery of costs,
attorneys’ fees, and investigation costs. (Complaint, ¶ 3.) 
      If the claim is rejected, Plaintiff has three months to apply with
the Court for an order to substitute Mr. Cloudman’s personal representative as
the real party in interest. (Prob.
Code, § 9370.) 
      Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing to April 18,
 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse to permit
Plaintiff to comply with the procedures necessary to continue the action
against decedent’s personal representative.
