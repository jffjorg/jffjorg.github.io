 Case Number:  23STCV17653    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants Parvin
Golshan, Jean-Pierre Okhovat, and Paul Aslan’s Motions for Complete
Consolidation
Defendants Parvin Golshan, individually
and as trustee of the Parvin Golshan Living Trust, Jean-Pierre Okhovat, and
Paul Aslan move to consolidate these two related actions: (1) James
Griffiths, et al. v. Parvin Golshan, et al., No. 23STCV17653, and (2) Carolyn
Sayles Griffiths, et al., v. Parvin Golshan, et al., No. 24SMCV00077.  
Code of Civil Procedure section 1048(a)
provides, “When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending
before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the
matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and
it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.”  These cases
involve common questions of law or fact regarding injuries arising from the
same allegedly dangerous conditions at the subject property, 1101
Loma Vista Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210. 
Consolidating the cases for all purposes will
promote judicial economy.
Defendants’ motions to consolidate the actions
are granted.  
The
court hereby consolidates (1) James Griffiths, et al. v. Parvin
Golshan, et al., No. 23STCV17653, and (2) Carolyn Sayles Griffiths, et
al., v. Parvin Golshan, et al., No. 24SMCV00077, for all purposes including
trial.
