And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants defendants' motion to compel arbitration and orders plaintiff Eric Vasquez to arbitrate this action against defendants CrossTown Electrical & Data, Inc., Justin Adkins, Eric Hudson, and Alex Zepeda. The court finds that defendants did not waive their right to arbitrate, that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable, and that plaintiff's claims are arbitrable. The court holds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies and preempts Labor Code section 229 and the rule that bars arbitration of claims for public injunctive relief. The court stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
