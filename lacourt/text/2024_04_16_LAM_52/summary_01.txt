And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production from the defendant, Federal Express Corporation. The court has granted the motion in part, compelling the defendant to provide further verified responses to requests for production Nos. 14, 37-39, 41, 62, 89, and 90. The defendant had objected to these requests, citing undue burden, lack of particularity, and broad requests. The court has sustained the defendant's objections to certain requests, including Nos. 40, 42, 46, 70, and Nos. 82-87 and 91-97, as those requests were deemed unduly burdensome or too broad. The court has ordered the defendant to provide further responses to the remaining requests within 30 days. The court has also denied both parties' motions for monetary sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.
