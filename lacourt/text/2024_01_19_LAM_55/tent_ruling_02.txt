 Case Number:  23STCV20476    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Defendant to Strike- Rent Not
Payable with No Notice (Death Landlord) and No Proof of Ownership.
 
The motion is ordered off calendar.  
 
On 8/25/23, JOHN OURSLAND (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against self-represented litigant, JOE SHERMAN (“Defendant”), alleging
that Defendant is behind in his rent and has made false and defamatory
statements to other tenants and prospective tenants. 
Defendant filed the “Motion of Defendant to Strike-
Rent Not Payable with No Notice (Death Landlord) and No Proof of Ownership.” The
first page of a motion must specify the date, time and location of the
hearing.  CRC Rule 3.1110(b)(1). As
Plaintiff correctly argues, Defendant’s motion is defective because it has no
notice of the hearing date, time, and location. Titmas v. Sup. Ct.
(2001) 87 Cal. App. 4th 738, 743 (“Failure to specify a date and time
(including a location) renders the notice ineffective.”)    
Plaintiff also contends he was never served with the
motion. Defendant provided no proof of service with the motion, as required pursuant
to CCP §1013a. A proof of service of moving documents must be filed no later
than five court days before the hearing. 
CRC Rule 3.1300(c). Defendant’s motion therefore is legally defective,
and the Court takes it off-calendar without addressing the merits.
