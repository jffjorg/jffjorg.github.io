Background
IMMIGRANT RIGHTS DEFENSE COUNCIL, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed
suit against Defendants for alleged violation of the Immigration Consultant Act
(“ICA”) Plaintiff has filed four motions to compel Defendants IRBusiness, Inc.
and Alexandra Imelda Rodriguez (“Defendants”) to serve verified responses to
Plaintiff’s form interrogatories and document requests, and for sanctions
against each Defendant in the amount of $2,560.00. Defendants oppose the
motions.
.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories and document
requests under oath. CCP §§ 2020.010(a), 2030.210(a); 2031.250(a). An
unverified discovery response is treated as no response.  Steele v. 
Totah (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 545, 549; Appleton v.  Sup. 
Ct.  (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
632, 636-37. In such a case, the propounding party may seek to compel verified
responses. See id.   
CCP § 2015.5 provides that a verification must be signed
under penalty of perjury and state the date and place of execution. “[C]ourts
do not find compliance with section 2015.5 to be both substantial and
sufficient unless all statutory conditions appear on the face of the
declaration in some form.”  Kulshrestha
v. First Union Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 601, 612.  
Generally, courts must impose monetary sanctions against
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice.  E.g., Foothill
Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542,
1557-58.  “ ‘[S]ubstantial justification”
has been understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because
it is well-grounded in both law and fact.” 
Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.  Inadvertence has been excusable under various
circumstances.  Cf., e.g.,  CCP §2030.290(a), 2031.300(a) (“The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver, based upon conditions that
response in substantial compliance was served, and the failure was result of
mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.”). [Emphasis added.] 
Analysis
Here, Defendants served responses on 11/20/2023
without verifications. Defendants contend that after Plaintiff filed the
motions, Defendants served verifications on 1/3/2024 and such verifications
moot the motions. Defendants also argue sanctions are not appropriate. The
verifications provided by Defendants are legally invalid under CCP § 2015.5.
They are not dated and do not state the place of execution. Nor are they signed
under penalty of perjury. And the verification for Defendant IRBusiness does
not state that the signatory is an officer of the entity, or some other
authorized agent authorized and/or competent to verify the responses. CCP §§
2030.250(b), 2031.250(b) (providing that a corporate entity’s verification to
interrogatories and document requests must be signed by “one of its officers or
agents”). Defendants’ failure to serve proper verifications before the hearing
is tantamount to not serving responses at all.
Therefore, all four motions are granted. On or before 1/29/24,
Defendant ALEXANDRA IMELDA RODRIGUEZ and Defendant IRBUSINESS, INC. shall serve
further verified responses, and produce documents, without objections, and in
full compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2015.5 and 2016.010 et
seq., as to the form interrogatories and requests for documents served by
moving party.
The Court also finds that Defendants’ failure to
provide code-compliant responses is not substantially justified and warrants
sanctions. Defendants had months to provide legally valid verifications to the
responses and their failure to do so has resulted in costly motion practice. On
or before 1/29/24, Defendant ALEXANDRA IMELDA RODRIGUEZ shall pay discovery
sanctions in the total sum of $5,120.00 to Plaintiff, and Defendant IRBUSINESS,
INC. shall pay discovery sanctions in the total sum of $5,120, to Plaintiff.
