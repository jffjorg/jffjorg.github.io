Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted four motions filed by the plaintiff, IMMIGRANT RIGHTS DEFENSE COUNCIL, LLC, to compel verified responses from the defendants, IRBusiness, Inc. and Alexandra Imelda Rodriguez, to form interrogatories and document requests. The defendants had failed to serve proper verifications with their responses, and the judge finds that this failure is not substantially justified and warrants sanctions. The judge orders the defendants to serve further verified responses and produce documents by January 29, 2024, and imposes sanctions on them in the total sum of $10,240.
