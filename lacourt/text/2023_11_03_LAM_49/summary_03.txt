Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's special motion to strike the third cause of action for breach of contract. The defendant contends that the plaintiff's allegations arise from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, but the judge finds that the challenged conduct is a private dispute and does not implicate a public issue. The judge notes that the defendant's alleged resistance to permit an inspection of his unit, which allegedly breached his lease agreement, cannot be reasonably understood as implicating a public issue. The judge also finds that the defendant has not demonstrated that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant's right of petition or free speech.
