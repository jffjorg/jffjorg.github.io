And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a new cause of action for indemnification against the defendant Drake. The plaintiff alleges that the parties' management agreement contains an indemnification clause, which gives rise to the cause of action. The court has found that the amendment is timely and that the defendant will not be unduly prejudiced by the addition of the new claim. The court has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve a stand-alone First Amended Complaint within 10 days. Any new parties must be served in a timely manner as provided by law.
