And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Burbank Unified School District's motion to strike portions of the Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) filed by Plaintiff Douglas Smith. The motion is denied. The court finds that the 4AC asserts that wearing a face mask alone prevents the transmission of COVID-19 in a classroom with live students, and that Mr. Smith's vaccination status alone does not make a difference in transmission of COVID-19 in a classroom with live students. The court disagrees with Defendant's assertion that the 4AC fails to state facts sufficient to support any claim of the supposed sufficiency of the claimed accommodations as a substitute for the vaccination.

The court orders Defendant to file an answer to the 4AC within 10 days and sets a non-appearance OSC re Filing of Answer for July 17, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The court also grants Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the California Department of Public Health's Requirement for Universal Masking Indoors at K-12 Schools and the EEOC Complaint against United Healthcare Services, Inc. for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
