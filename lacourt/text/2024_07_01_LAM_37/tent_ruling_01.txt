Background
 
This action arises out of the employment of Douglas Smith
(“Plaintiff”) with Burbank Unified School District (“Defendant” or “BUSD”).
Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant and worked as a teacher from August 1,
1992, to May 27, 2022, when his employment was terminated. According to the
original Complaint, Plaintiff alleges he requested a religious exemption as a
reasonable accommodation for the Defendant’s September 12, 2021, Ordinance
mandating COVID-19 vaccination for all employees (“Vaccination Ordinance”). 
 
On September 12, 2021, an interactive dialogue was initiated for
Plaintiff’s request for reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff’s request was
submitted to Defendant. On October 11, 2021, Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff
was entitled to religious accommodation and placed Plaintiff on an unpaid leave
of absence. On May 27, 2022, Defendant terminated Plaintiff’s employment. 
 
Plaintiff’s original Complaint alleged five causes of action: (1)
religious discrimination in violation of the FEHA; (2) failure to prevent
discrimination and retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3) retaliation in
violation of FEHA; (4) failure to accommodate in violation of FEHA; and (5)
failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging identical causes of action. 
 
On June 6, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to Plaintiff’s
FAC but with leave to amend only the first, second, third, and fourth causes of
action. On July 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).
The SAC alleges four causes of action: (1) unlawful
discrimination based upon religion and religious creed in violation of Gov.
Code § 12940; (2) failure to prevent discrimination in violation of Gov. Code §
12940; (3) retaliation in violation of Gov. Code § 12940; and (4) failure to
accommodate religion and religious creed in violation of Gov. Code § 12940. 

 
On December 11, 2023, the court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to
amend and sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of
action with leave to amend. 
 
On January 1, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) alleging three causes of action: (1) unlawful discrimination based upon religion and religious creed
in violation of Gov. Code § 12940; (2) failure to prevent discrimination in
violation of Gov. Code § 12940;  and (3)
retaliation in violation of Gov. Code § 12940. On March 27, 2024, the court
granted Defendant’s motion to strike the TAC with leave to amend. 
 
On April
25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) alleging
three causes of action for (1) unlawful discrimination based upon religion and
religious creed in violation of Gov. Code § 12940; (2) failure to prevent
discrimination in violation of Gov. Code § 12940; and (3) retaliation in
violation of Gov. Code § 12940;
 
Defendant
BUSD now moves to strike portions of the 4AC. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard¿¿- Motion to Strike 
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
California Department of Public Health’s (“CDPH”) Requirement
for Universal Masking Indoors at K-12 Schools (attached as Exhibit A).
 
2)    
The EEOC Complaint against United Healthcare Services,
Inc. for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, to
correct unlawful employment practices based on religion and provide appropriate
relief to Charging Party Amanda Stone. This case was filed on September 23,
2023 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
Case No. 2:23CV3010. (A copy of this lawsuit is attached as Exhibit B.) 
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike[1]
 
Defendant seeks to strike the following from the 4AC:  
 
·       Paragraph 14 (4:25-4:27), which
states: 
 
14. In
response to the District’s October 11, 2021 letter, Mr. Smith wrote the
District a letter outlining his religious based reasons for refusing the
Vaccine and how he felt that the District’s actions were discriminatory without
offering any reasonable accommodation.
 
·       Paragraph 15 (5:1-5:9), which
states:
15. As an
accommodation and safe alternative to the District’s vaccine mandate to meet
its goals of curtailing Covid-19 transmissions, Mr. Smith requested to simply
wear a face mask during his live teaching sessions and participate in the
District’s mandated routine testing requirement. Wearing a face mask alone
prevents the transmission of Covid-19 in a classroom with live students, which
was the goal of the District in imposing the vaccine mandate. A true and
correct copy of the CDPH’s Requirements for Universal Masking Indoors at K-12
Schools is attached hereto as “Exhibit B.” Mr. Smith’s vaccination status
alone, on the other hand, does not make a difference in transmission of Covid
19 in a classroom with live students. See Exhibit “B.”
 
·       All
other allegations as to accommodation (including those in Paragraphs 16 and 17)
insofar as they are based on the BUSD’s alleged failure to grant the
accommodation requested by plaintiff.
 
Defendant BUSD asserts the above portions should be stricken
because they “fail to state facts sufficient to support
any claim of the supposed sufficiency of the claimed accommodations as a
substitute for the vaccination that the plaintiff refused to have[.]” (Motion,
at p. 2:23-25.) Defendant points out that Paragraph 14 of the 4AC omits details
about the content of Plaintiff’s requested accommodations and excludes the
allegations made in Paragraphs 15 through 18 of the TAC. 
 
Defendant BUSD does not allege that the 4AC is a sham pleading and
that Plaintiff omitted harmful allegations without explanation or that there
are inconsistencies with the prior pleadings. (See Larson
v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336, 343.) 
 
Instead,
Defendant asserts the 4AC fails to add an allegation to show the sufficiency of
the requested accommodation. The court disagrees. 
 
The
court previously found the following deficiencies in the TAC: 
 
·      
“The TAC is devoid of facts
to show how Defendant permitted Mr. Khodagolian to teach without being
vaccinated and if such accommodation was provided without any safety measures
or with safety measures that were in line or similar to the safety measures Plaintiff
proposed in his request for religious accommodations to the vaccine mandate.
Without such facts, Paragraph 18 is conclusory.” (3/27/24 Order, p.6.)
 
·      
Plaintiff fails to state
facts to show that masks alone or in combination with PCR testing are more
effective or just as effective as the Defendants routine swab testing,
universal mask mandate, and vaccination mandate. (TAC ¶¶ 11, 14, 15.)(3/27/24
Order, p. 5.)
 
The
4AC asserts that “Wearing a face mask alone prevents the transmission of
Covid-19 in a classroom with live students” and that “Mr. Smith’s vaccination
status alone, on the other hand, does not make a difference in transmission of
Covid 19 in a classroom with live students.” (4AC, ¶ 15, Ex. B.) In addition,
the 4AC alleges that BUSD acted in a discriminatory manner by granting Mr. Khodagolian the same accommodation that Plaintiff requested but
was denied because Mr. Khodagolian’s
accommodation was medically based rather than religiously based. (4AC, ¶¶ 16,
17.) 
 
The court finds that the above allegations respond to the
deficiencies previously pointed out by the court. Moreover, Defendant BUSD
fails to show how the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s accommodation is relevant to
the issue of discrimination and renders Plaintiff’s claims legally invalid. “We
conclude that when a substantive defect is clear from the face of a complaint,
such as a violation of the applicable statute of limitations or a purported
claim of right which is legally invalid, a defendant may attack that portion of
the cause of action by filing a motion to strike.” (PH II,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682–1683.) Specifically,
Defendant BUSD fails to show what portion of the causes of action Defendant
seeks to attack in this Motion. “Its use has also been approved in a case where
the face of the complaint failed to state facts showing a primary right of the
plaintiff and a primary duty of, or wrong committed by, the defendant.” (Id.
at p. 1683.) 
 
The motion to strike is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant BUSD’s motion to strike
portions of the 4AC is denied. Defendant to give notice.
