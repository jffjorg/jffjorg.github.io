And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Jared D. Moses states that the plaintiff's six motions to compel are moot. Regarding sanctions, the plaintiff requests $3,402, calculated as follows: 4.8 hours of work at a rate of $650 per hour, plus $477 in filing fees. The court finds the hourly rate and amount expended reasonable. Although the defendant's counsel provides a detailed explanation for the delay in responding to discovery requests, the court does not find this explanation justifies the lack of response or makes the imposition of sanctions unjust. Therefore, the court orders the defendant's counsel to pay the plaintiff's counsel sanctions in the amount of $3,402 within 30 days.
