[1]     “Criminal malpractice” refers to legal
malpractice in the course of defending a client accused of a crime.  (Wiley v. County of San Diego (1998)
19 Cal.4th 532, 536, fn. 1.)


[2]    In the
criminal proceeding, Ms. Villa was also charged with violation of Penal Code
section 245, subdivision (a)(4), assault upon a person by means likely to
produce great bodily injury, a felony. 
When she pleaded nolo contendere to Penal Code section 203, the assault
charge was dismissed.  As discussed
below, in later proceedings, based on the prosecution’s motion, Ms. Villa withdrew
her plea to the mayhem charge, pleaded nolo contendere to the section 245,
subdivision (a)(4) assault charge, with aggravated circumstances, and was
resentenced to the high term under the assault statute, which is four years.
