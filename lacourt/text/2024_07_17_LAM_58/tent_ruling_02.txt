Responding Party:      Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.



 

Tentative
Ruling:      Plaintiff’s Motion for

a memorandum of costs pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
 

 
I.          Background
 
            Plaintiff
purchased a 2018 Honda Odyssey manufactured and distributed by Defendant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc.  Plaintiff
alleges that the vehicle contained or developed defects during the warranty
period.  Plaintiff alleges that shepresented
the vehicle to Defendant for repairs and Defendant was unable to repair the
vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts. 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to provide her with restitution
pursuant to Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 

 
            Plaintiff
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on November 8, 2021.  Plaintiff filed a Notice of Conditional
Settlement on May 3, 2024.  
 
II.        Legal
Standard 
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action under Song-Beverly
“shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal
to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based
on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The prevailing party has the burden of showing that the
requested attorney fees were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, and were reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel
Trailers of California Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party
seeking attorney fees “ ‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the
value of attorney services according to [his] own notion or to the full extent
claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge
being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances,
then the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
III.  Request for
Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiff
and Defendant request judicial notice of court opinions in other Song Beverly cases
discussing counsel’s rates.  The request
for RJN is granted.  
 
IV.  Evidentiary
Objections
 
            Defendant’s
Objections to Shahian’s Declaration are overruled.
 
            Defendant’s
Objections to Castro’s Declaration are sustained.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
Objections to Stuhlberg’s Declaration are overruled.             
 
IV.  Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
moves for attorney’s fees as prevailing party under Civil Code §1794(d) and the
parties’ settlement agreement. Plaintiff obtained a settlement of $82,500 from
Defendant after three years of litigation wherein Defendant agreed that
Plaintiff would be prevailing party for purposes of a fee motion.  (Castro Dec., ¶78, Ex. 4.)  Plaintiff argues she is clearly the
prevailing party under Civil Code §1794(d) and is entitled to a mandatory fee
award in the amount of $129,110.59 based on (1) $84,751.50 in attorney’s fees
for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (“SLP”); (2) a 1.35 multiplier enhancement;
(3) $11,196.06 in costs and expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $3,500 for
Plaintiff’s counsel to review the Opposition, draft the Reply and attend the
hearing on the Motion.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
attorney’s fees are based on 164.6 hours of attorney time.  Plaintiff’s counsel identifies no fewer than
nineteen attorneys who worked on this case. 
The hourly rates of these attorneys ranged from $350 to $650.  
 
            Defendant
does not dispute that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees as prevailing
party under Civil Code §1794(d). 
Defendant argues, however, that when the parties were negotiating
settlement, Plaintiff represented that the attorney’s fees would range from $40,000
to $50,000.  Defendant argues Plaintiff’s
request for $129,110.59 in fees is excessive. 
Defendant argues Plaintiff is, at most, entitled to $21,000 for this
cookie cutter litigation.  
 
            Defendant
objects to the hourly rate and number of attorneys assigned to the case as
excessive.  Defendant argues the hourly
rate should be set at no more than $350/hr for all attorneys.  
 
            Defendant
objects to the number of hours as excessive given the cookie-cutter nature of
Song Beverly litigation.  Defendant attached
as Exhibit A to the Opposition a table addressing each of the time entries
submitted by Plaintiff.  Defendant also
objects to the costs requested and requests a reduction of $6,023.  
 
            Number
of hours excessive and improper time entries submitted 
 
            Plaintiff
counsel expended 164.6 hours on this litigation, which was pending for approximately
three years and was litigated up to the eve of trial.  Parties’ submitted motions in limine and
engaged in a last minute mediation before Judge Stern.  (Minute Order dated January 4, 2024.)
 
·      
Improper redactions.  Based on a review of Plaintiff’s time
entries, the entries on the following dates are so heavily redacted that the
court cannot determine their reasonableness or the nature of the task
performed:  (1) 3/15/22, Avelino, .5
hours @ $595/hr for a total of $297.50; (2) 9/29/22, Mkrdech, 7.6 hours @
$350/hr for a total of $2,660; (3) 11/9/22, Carvalho, .7 hours @ $550/hr for a
total of $385; (4) 11/10/22, Mkrdech, 1.4 @ $350/hr for a total of $490; (5)
6/28/23, Carvalho and .7 hours @ $570/hr for a total of $399.  As such, the requested fee award is reduced
by $4,231.50 for failure to provide sufficient detail regarding the work
performed.  (Shahian Dec., Ex. 20, pp. 1
and 2.)  
·      
Unreasonably excessive time entries.  Counsel Deleon spent (1) 2.4 hours on
5/10/23 preparing for deposition of Defendant’s PMQ; (2) 3.4 hours on 5/11/23
preparing for deposition of Defendant’s PMQ; and (3) 7.8 hours on 5/12/23 preparing
and taking the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ. 
The billable rate for the task was $575/hr.  Counsel’s entry on 5/12/23 also improperly
block billed multiple tasks.  (Shahian
Dec., Ex. 20, p. 2.) The amount billed for the PMQ deposition totaled
$7,820.  The amount of billable time for
both preparation and taking the deposition is reduced from 13.6 hours @
$575/hr to 8 hours @ $575/hr for a total of $4600, a reduction of $3,220.  
Counsel Miller indicates that he spent 10 hours preparing for, travel to
and attend continued FSC on January 5, 2024. 
(Shahian Dec., Ex. 20, p. 3.) The Jury Trial/FSC began at 9 a.m. and the
settlement was put on the record.  (Minute
Order dated 1/8/24.)  There is nothing
indicating that preparation for and attendance at the FSC on 1/5/24 would have
required 10 hours.  The 1/5/24 entry by
Miller for 10 hours @ $595/hr for a total of $5,950 is reduced to 5
hours @ $595/hr for a total $2,975, a reduction of $2,975.
·      
Estimated time for reply prep and hearing
attendance.  Plaintiff’s counsel
estimates $3,500 for preparation of the reply and hearing attendance.  Counsel does not provide an hourly rate for
this estimate.  However, using the
maximum rate allowed as discussed below ($575/hr), the number of hours spent
would be 6 hours @ $575/hr for a total of $3,500.  Given the reply, including objections and
additional evidence, six hours for opposition review, reply prep and hearing
attendance is reasonable.  
 
            In total, the requested fees are
reduced by $10,426.50 due to excessive hours or improperly redacted time
entries.  This leaves a balance of $72,073.50.
 
            Hourly rates
 
            The hourly rates to be used in
computing the lodestar must be “within the range of reasonable rates charged by
and judicially awarded comparable attorneys for comparable work.”  (Children's Hospital & Medical Center
v. Bonta´ (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095  (“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work”).  Particularly where it is
difficult to obtain evidence of market based rates for the same type of work,
the courts look at fees charged for cases requiring similar skills.  (The Utility Reform Network v. Public
Utilities Com. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 522, 536–537; Prison Legal News v.
Schwarzenegger (9th Cir.2010) 608 F.3d 446, 454–455 (“all attorneys in the
community engaged in ‘equally complex Federal litigation,’ no matter the
subject matter”).  
 
            In determining the reasonable rate
and reasonable hours, the Court looks to that “prevailing in the community for
similar work.”  (PLCM Group, Inc.,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at 1095; Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1132
(“the lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community”).  “A reasonable trial court
might determine that the ‘similar work’or ‘comparable legal services’ related
to insurance defense litigation, rather than to civil litigation in general.
Were the court to so conclude, it could view the relevant ‘market’ to be that
of insurance defense litigation and litigators, rather than general civil
litigation. The “market rate” for such services might be limited accordingly.
Again, we emphasize that such determinations lie within the broad discretion of
the trial court.”  (Syers Properties
III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 702–703.)
 
            The burden is on the fee applicant
to produce evidence that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing
in the community for similar work.  (ComputerXpress,
Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1019.)  “Affidavits of the plaintiffs' attorney and
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community, and rate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market
rate.”  (Heritage Pacific Financial,
LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)
 
            The trial court is not required to
adopt counsel’s opinion as to the “market rate” for services of the type
performed.  (Syers Properties III,
supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at 702.) 
The trial court may accept the actual rate charged as the reasonable
rate.  (Id.) 
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel consisted of
nineteen attorneys who performed work at hourly rates of $350, $385, $400,
$450, $460, $475, $495, $550, $570, $575, $595, $610, $620 and $650.  (Shahian Dec., Ex. 20, p. 5.)  Counsel Shahian testifies as to his extensive
experience in Song Beverly litigation, but he does not seek recovery for his time
supervising this matter.  (Id. at ¶¶1-45,
86.)  The experience and background of
the remaining attorneys is set forth in Shahian’s declaration.  (Id. at ¶¶46-84.)  Based on a review of the attorneys’ profiles
and the market rate charged for similar services based on the court’s own
experience, the hourly rates charged above $575 are excessive.  Those hours billed at $595, $610, $620 and
$650 are recalculated at the hourly rate of $575.  
 
·      
Avelino. 
7.8 hours @ $595 for a total of $4,641 reduced to $4,485, for total
reduction of $156.
·      
Carvalho. 
.9 hours @ $595 for a total of $535 reduced to $517, for total reduction
of $18.
·      
Lunn.  4.9
hours @ $620 and 9.8 @ $650 for a total of $9,408 reduced to $8,452.50, for a
total reduction of $955.50.
·      
McCallister and Miller. 34.5 hours @ $595 for a
total of $20,527.50 reduced to $19,837.50, for a total reduction of $690.
·      
Vaziri. 
1.2 hours @ $610 for a total of $732 reduced to $690, for a total
reduction of $42.
 
            The
adjustment of hourly rates claimed by six of the nineteen attorneys will also
address the overstaffing issue raised by Defendant. In total, the requested fee
award is reduced by $1,861.50 for excessive hourly rates.  Applying this further reduction to the
balance of $72,073.50, the total remaining attorney’s fees total $70,212.
 
            Multiplier
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            “The
purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the
particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether
the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.”  (Santana
v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 351.)
 
            “Perhaps
the most common multiplier applied, at least where a plaintiff prevails, is a
modifier for the contingent nature of the representation.”  (Id.) 
The court may not consider the contingent nature of the representation
in both setting the lodestar and applying a modifier.  (Id.) 
 
            Another
factor considered by a court in applying a multiplier is the “result
obtained.”  
“The ‘results obtained’ factor can properly be used to
enhance a lodestar calculation where an exceptional effort produced an
exceptional benefit.”  (Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 582.)  “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a
fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court
determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk
or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned
lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.”  (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)   
 
            Plaintiff
fails to present any facts that would require a multiplier to compensate
counsel for their services at fair market value. The lodestar presented by
counsel, as adjusted by the Court, fixes the fee at fair market value.  The cases did not involve any novel legal
issues.  There is no justification to
apply a multiplier.  
 
 
            Costs
 
            Plaintiff
includes a request for an award of costs in the amount of $11,196.06.  (Shahian, Dec., Ex. 20, pp. 4-5.)  Defendant objects to the costs on grounds
that no supporting documentation is provided, several entries associated with
the demurrer provide no explanation as to the nature of the $896.95 in costs, the
basis for $2,837.89 in deposition costs when the deposition only lasted a few
hours and $4,614 in unnecessary reporter fees on 1/3/24, 1/8/24 and
1/10/24.  
 
            Parties
stipulated that Defendant would pay Plaintiff’s reasonable fees and costs.
(Castro Dec., Exs. 2 and 4, ¶2.)  Parties
also referenced a “Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs” and stipulated that
Plaintiff would be prevailing party for purposes of such a motion.  However, there is nothing explicitly stating
that Plaintiff would not be required to file a memorandum of costs under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700. 
Based on the mandatory language of California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700, Plaintiff must comply with the procedure for recovery of costs under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, which requires submission of a verified memorandum
of costs within 15 days of mailing of notice of entry of judgment.  Submission of a memorandum of costs would
organize the requested costs into categories under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5.  A memorandum of costs would also
trigger Defendant’s right to tax those costs by noticed motion, with an
opportunity to reply to any opposition.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for fees by noticed motion is denied. 
Plaintiff must file a memorandum of costs pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1700.  
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED as to the request for
attorney’s fees in the amount of $70,212. 
As to Plaintiff’s costs, Plaintiff must file a memorandum of costs
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
