And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff, Eloisa Villa, brought a criminal legal malpractice action against her former attorney, Wayne Eugene Redmond, alleging that he negligently advised her to plead guilty to Penal Code section 205. However, the court found that Villa's plea was actually to Penal Code section 203, a lesser included offense. The court also found that Villa was not exonerated of the charges and did not demonstrate actual innocence. The court concluded that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action for legal malpractice and is therefore dismissed.
