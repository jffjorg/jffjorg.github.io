BACKGROUND
 
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Lloyd E. Rollins (“Rollins”)
filed a Complaint against Defendant Walditrudez P. Lopez (“Lopez” or
“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 250, alleging (1) Elder Abuse (Welfare and
Institutions Code §§ 15600 et seq.), and (2) Negligence. Subsequently, on May
8, 2024, Lopez filed an Answer to the Complaint.
 
On July 1, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
appoint Janice Motta (“Plaintiff” or “Motta”) as Successor in Interest to the decedent,
Rollins. (7/1/24 Minute Order.)
 
On July 3, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to compel Hastings Wound Solutions (“HWS”) to comply with the deposition
subpoena. (7/3/24 Minute Order.)
 
On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Compel Hastings Wound Solutions’ Compliance with the Court’s July 3, 2024,
Order (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If
that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an order compelling
attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated.
In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that
deponent or against the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated, and
in favor of any party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the
expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to that
order.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).)¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Motion to
Compel Compliance with the Court’s Order
 
The Court’s July 3, 2024,
Order was to compel HWS to comply with deposition subpoena served by Plaintiff
to produce records relating to Rollins under the custody and control of HWS
within 15 days of the ruling. Additionally, the Court’s July 3, 2024, Order
imposed monetary sanctions against HWS in the amount of $560.00. (7/3/24 Minute
Order.)
 
Here, Plaintiff states that
the Notice of Ruling was served on HWS via Federal Express on July 3, 2024, and
also personally served on HWS on July 8, 2024. (Garcia Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “1.”)
However, as of the filing of the Motion, HWS had failed to produce a single
document in response to the Court’s July 3, 2024, Order. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
HWS does not file an
Opposition, thereby waiving the issues raised in the Motion. 
 
Accordingly, based on the
records above, the Court finds that HWS has failed to comply with the Court’s
July 3, 2024, Order.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
the unopposed Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Additionally, Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against HWS
in the amount of $3,060.00, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010
and 2023.030 against misuse of discovery. (See also Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (h).) 
 
Additionally, “willfulness [in violating any court orders]
is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery sanctions.” (Reedy
v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291.)
 
The
Court finds that HWS’s failure to obey the July 3, 2024, Order to comply with
the deposition subpoena clearly constitutes a misuse of discovery under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.010, thereby justifying monetary sanctions
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (h). 
 
Utilizing
a lodestar approach and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court
finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $1,060.00, calculated at a
reasonable hourly rate of $500 for two hours of work reasonably spent, plus $60.00
for filing fees.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Hastings Wound Solutions’
Compliance with the Court’s July 3, 2024, Order. Specifically, Hastings Wound
Solutions is ordered to comply with the deposition subpoena, dated May 14, 2024,
and to pay $560.00 monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10 days.
 
Plaintiff’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Hastings
Wound Solutions is further ordered to pay additional sanctions in the amount of
$1,060.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10 days.
