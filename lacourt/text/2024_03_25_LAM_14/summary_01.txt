And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which was set for March 25, 2024. The trial will now take place on October 21, 2024, at 9:00 am. A final status conference is set for October 9, 2024, at 10:00 am. The judge has granted the motion in part because the plaintiff has urgent medical issues that require eye surgery and has been unable to properly prepare for trial. The court is also engaged in trial on an older case and has a heavy docket in the coming months, making it best to set this case out to October.
