And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the respondents' demurrer to the amended petition for writ of mandate is overruled, and the motion to strike portions of the complaint is denied. The court finds that the petitioner has sufficiently alleged that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) failed to act as required by law in having implemented a policy or practice that reads participation in an approved training program as a requirement for hours to count in a calculation of a facility's nursing hours per patient day (NHPPD).

The court also finds that the petitioner has sufficiently alleged an actual controversy over the enforcement of the 3.2 NHPPD staffing requirement despite the issuance of a staffing waiver and CDPH's interpretation and application of statutes concerning nursing hours and direct care hours. Therefore, the demurrer to the third cause of action for declaratory relief is overruled.

The court further finds that the motion to strike paragraphs and certain words in paragraphs 13, 24, 30, 44, 47, 48, 59-65, 69-71, 80, 89-95, and 97 to the extent that they are incorporated into the first cause of action is denied. The court exercises its discretion to decline to strike the challenged paragraphs, which are relevant background information pertaining to the administrative proceedings.
