Case:                           Bank of America,
N.A. v. Performance Engineered Products, Inc. et al. (23STCV31128)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A.’s UNOPPOSED
applications for right to attach order with respect to defendants (1) Dinesh V.
Savalia and (2) Babulal A. Savalia are GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP §484.090, the Court finds:
 
1)     
the claim is one upon which attachment may be issued;
2)     
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim;
3)     
attachment is not sought for any purpose other than
recovery on the claim;
4)     
the amount to be attached is greater than zero.
 
Plaintiff disbursed money to Performance Engineered
Products, Inc. (“Performance Engineered”) pursuant to a Loan Agreement
(comprised of a Note, Master Credit Agreement, and Financial Covenant
Agreement) between plaintiff Bank of America, N.A. and defendant Performance
Engineered Products, Inc. (“Performance Engineered”), as well as an Equipment
Agreement (comprised of a Master Loan and Security Agreement and Equipment
Security Note) between plaintiff and Honor Plastics & Molding, Inc. (the
former fictitious name of Performance Engineered). (Corkery Decl. ¶¶ 8, 12
& Exs. 1, 3.)
 
The Loan Agreement defines a default to include a failure to
make a payment under the agreement when due. (Corkery Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. 1,
Loan Agreement at § 5.1(a).) The Equipment Agreement defines a default to
include when Performance Engineered defaults under any other agreement to which
Performance Engineered and plaintiff are parties. (Corkery Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. 3
at Master Loan and Security Agreement, § 10(8).) 
 
Performance Engineered defaulted under the Loan Agreement by
failing to pay amounts due purportedly totaling $776,814.50. (Corkery Decl. ¶¶
8, 11, 19, 20, 22, & Ex. 5.) Based on Performance Engineered’s default
under the Loan Agreement, it is also in default under the Equipment Agreement
in the amount of $5,665.24. (Corkery Decl. ¶¶ 14, 15, 23 & Ex. 6.) 
 
Defendants Dinesh V. Savalia and Babulal A. Savalia signed
guaranties for the Loan Agreement and the Equipment Agreement, pursuant to
which they guaranteed the amounts owed by Performance Engineered. (Corkery
Decl. ¶¶ 16, 17 & Exs. 2, 4.) Defendants have failed to pay the amounts
owed by Performance Engineered. (Corkery Decl. ¶ 18.) Accordingly, plaintiff
has established the probability of the breach of guaranties claim against
defendants Dinesh V. Savalia and Babulal A. Savalia.
 
However, with respect to the Loan Agreement, plaintiff
claims that, as of December 22, 2023, interest had accrued in the amount of
$3,862.83. (Corkery Decl. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff also claims that, as of the same
date, default interest had accrued in the amount of $2,951.67. (Ibid.) Based
on the Statement of Account for the Loan Agreement provided by plaintiff, it is
unclear whether these interest figures, totaling $6,814.50 are accurate. (Corkery
Decl. ¶ 22 & Ex. 5.) There is no end date of December 22, 2023 reflected in
the statement. Further, the interest balance as of December 31, 2023 was
$5,702.27. Moreover, it appears as of January 8, 2024, the balance of interest
was $1,471.55, after an interest payment was applied. Accordingly, the amount
to be attached for amounts owed under the Loan Agreement shall be $771,471.55,
the sum of the $770,000 principal and $1,471.55 in interest, as reflected in
the Statement of Account. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the applications will be granted in
the amount of $777,136.79 ($771,471.55 Loan Agreement + $5,665.24 Equipment
Agreement).
 
Writ will issue upon the posting of two separate bonds in
the amount of $10,000 each for the two defendants. (CCP §489.220.)
