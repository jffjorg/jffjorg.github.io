And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Respondents' Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Required Exhaustion of Remedies Before the Coastal Commission is granted. This means that the proceedings in this case will be stayed in their entirety pending the outcome of the petitioners' appeal to the Coastal Commission.

The Judge has also denied the petitioners' Motion to Bifurcate, which sought to separate the first cause of action from the rest of the case. The Judge believes that allowing the appeal to the Coastal Commission to be resolved first is in the interests of judicial economy, as it will allow the parties to accomplish their goals without the need for further litigation.

The Judge has also granted the Respondents' request for judicial notice in connection with both motions.
