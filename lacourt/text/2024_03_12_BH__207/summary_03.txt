And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has ruled on several motions in this case. The demurrer to the first cause of action for services rendered and the third cause of action for quantum meruit was overruled. The demurrer to the second cause of action for open book account was also overruled. The court found that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a cause of action.

The court also ruled on the defendants' motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint. The court denied the motion, finding that the allegations were not redundant or immaterial.

The court further ruled on the defendants' request for judicial notice of the SEC filing. The court granted the request, finding that the filing was relevant to the case and that there was no opposition to the request.

The court also considered the defendants' demurrer to the contract-based causes of action, including breach of implied contract, breach of oral contract, and promissory estoppel. The court overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action.

Finally, the court considered the defendants' demurrer to the seventh and eighth causes of action, which alleged intentional and negligent misrepresentation. The court overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action.

The court noted that the economic loss doctrine does not bar the plaintiffs' misrepresentation claims, and that the specific requirements of pleading fraud with particularity are met in this case.
