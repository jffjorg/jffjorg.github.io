Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendant City of Santa Monica against the Plaintiff Arezou Mary Alipourfereshteh. The Plaintiff alleges personal injury from a slip and fall on a public street sidewalk, but the complaint is vague and fails to specify where and when the incident occurred. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Government Claims Act and has not alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action. Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer and dismisses the complaint without leave to amend. The Plaintiff is required to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
