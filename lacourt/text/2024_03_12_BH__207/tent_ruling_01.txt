MOTION
 
Plaintiff Arezou Mary Alipourfereshteh (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
personal injury lawsuit against Defendant City of Santa Monica (“Defendant”) on
May 23, 2023, but did not serve Defendant until December 26, 2023.  On January 23, 2024, Defendant filed a
declaration in support of an automatic extension.  
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD – DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if one consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.      DEMURRER
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds that (1) it
is impermissibly vague pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f); and (2) it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision
(e) because Plaintiff has not complied with the presentation requirements of
the Government Claims Act. 
 
 
 
 
A.   
UNCERTAINTY
 
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading
is so bad that the responding party cannot reasonably respond - i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
claims are directed against him or her. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Where a demurrer is made upon the
ground of uncertainty, the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why
the pleading is uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to
page and line numbers.  (See Fenton
v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)  
 
Here, the Complaint states “Plaintiff Arezou Mary Airpourfereshteh
alleges causes of action against defendant City of Santa Monica” (Complaint ¶
1) and “Plaintiff has suffered other damage (specify): physically limited from
slip and fall public street sidewalk, therapy, injections, pain + suffering”
(Complaint ¶ 11).
 
Thus, while the Complaint alleges Plaintiff suffered injuries from a
slip and fall, it is unclear where and when the alleged incident occurred, or
even whether it occurred on a public street, a public sidewalk, or both.  It is further unclear what the alleged defect
to the “public street sidewalk” is.
 
As such, Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied.  Therefore, the Court
grants Defendant’s demurrer on the basis of uncertainty.
 
B.    
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
Per the Government Claims Act (“GCA”), also known as the Tort Claims
Act, (Gov. Code, 810 et seq.), a party with a claim for money or damages
against a public entity must present a written claim directly with that public
entity. (Gov. Code, § 905.) And under Government Code section 945.4, “no suit
for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented in accordance with Section
910 until a written claim therefore has been presented to the public entity and
has been acted upon by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by
the board.” (Stockett v. Association of Cal. Water Agencies Joint Powers
Ins. Authority (2004) 34 Cal.4th 441, 445 [cleaned up]; see also Munoz
v. State of Cal. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767.) In sum, “compliance with the
claims provisions is mandatory. Fulfilling the requirements of the tort claims
presentation procedure is a condition precedent to filing suit; it is not an
affirmative defense.” (Castaneda v. Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1061 [cleaned up].)
 
“[F]ailure to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with
the claim presentation requirements subjects a claim against a public entity to
a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.” (State of California v.
Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.) “Moreover, a plaintiff need
not allege strict compliance with the statutory claim presentation requirement.
Courts have long recognized that a claim that fails to substantially comply
with sections 910 and 910.2, may still be considered a ‘claim as presented’ if
it puts the public entity on notice both that the claimant is attempting to
file a valid claim and that litigation will result if the matter is not
resolved.” (Id. at p.1245 [cleaned up].)
 
Further, under Government Code section 945.6, “any suit brought
against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to
be presented…must be commenced…[i]f written notice is given in accordance with
Section 913, not later than six months after the date such notice is personally
delivered or deposited in the mail.” (Gov. Code., § 945.6, subd. (a)(1).)
 
Here, although Plaintiff alleges a personal injury against a
government entity, Plaintiff has not checked the boxes in paragraph nine of the
form complaint, indicating that Plaintiff either complied with the applicable
claims statute or is excused from complying. 

 
Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to allege compliance with or excuse
from complying with the claims statute, as is required to withstand demurrer.[1]
 
2.     
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden as Plaintiff did not
oppose the demurrer, and therefore does not address whether leave should be
granted if the demurrer is sustained.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains Defendant’s Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint without leave to amend. 

 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
