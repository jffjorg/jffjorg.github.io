And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Further Responses. The Court grants the motion in part with limitations and denies it in part. The Court orders Defendant to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 20, 23-24, 53-55, and 56-60 with the following limitations: Request No. 20 is limited to the actual agreement in place between Defendant and the leasing dealership on the date of lease; Request No. 23 is limited to training materials that are relevant to the task of determining whether a vehicle is eligible for a vehicle repurchase; Request No. 24 is limited to training materials that are relevant to the task of determining whether a vehicle is eligible for a vehicle repurchase; Request Nos. 53 and 54 are limited to repairs and customer complaints concerning 2020 Honda CR-Vs sold in California; and Request Nos. 56-60 are denied.

The Court also denies Plaintiffs' request for sanctions against Defendant. The Court finds that Defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing Plaintiffs' overbroad requests.

**Order**

The Court orders Defendant to serve its responses within 30 days of this Order. Plaintiffs' request for sanctions is denied.
