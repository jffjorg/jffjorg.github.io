And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the parties' dispute over discovery requests. The court granted in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to defendant's discovery responses. Specifically, the court ordered the defendant to provide further responses to RFP No. 12, which relates to the subject vehicle itself. However, the court denied the plaintiff's requests for further responses to RFP Nos. 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, and 39, which are overbroad and unduly burdensome. The court also denied the plaintiff's requests for further responses to RFP Nos. 49, 75, and 86, which are vague, ambiguous, or lack justification. The court's ruling is subject to modification based on the parties' agreement.
