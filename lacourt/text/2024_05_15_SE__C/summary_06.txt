Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the demurrer filed by defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc. and Rafiq Shah to the second amended complaint. The demurrer was based on the grounds that the causes of action in the complaint do not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and the pleading is uncertain. The judge previously found that the defendants did not meet the meet-and-confer requirements, and the defendants' counsel failed to submit a declaration attesting to the meet-and-confer efforts for the second amended complaint. As a result, the judge continued the hearing date and ordered the parties to meet and confer before the new hearing date.
