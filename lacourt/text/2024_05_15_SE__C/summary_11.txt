The judge finds that the notice of lis pendens filed on February 28, 2024, is void and invalid because it was not served properly on KIM. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not address the electronic service in its opposition. The judge awards attorney's fees and costs to KIM, but reduces the amount requested by the plaintiff.
