 Case Number:  22NWCV01502    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  C VICTOR FUENTES v. H.P.
PALOMINO, INC. ET AL
CASE NO.:  22NWCV01502
HEARING:   5/15/24 @ 10:30 AM
#6
 
Defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc. and Rafiq Shah’s demurrer is
CONTINUED.   
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
This
is a wage-and-hour employment law action. Defendants H.P. Palomino, Inc. and
Rafiq Shah demur to the nine causes of action in the second amended complaint
on the grounds that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of
action and the pleading is uncertain.  
 
This matter came on for
hearing on April 17, 2024. The Court found that Defendants
did not satisfy the meet-and-confer requirements. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a).) Defendants’ counsel stated that he submitted declarations on
February 8, 2023 and May 17, 2023 attesting to the meet and confer efforts he
made. (Decl. Orloff, ¶ 2.) But Defendants’ counsel has not stated he did the
same for the second amended complaint. The matter was
continued and the
parties were ordered to meet and confer before the new
hearing date. Defendants were ordered to submit a declaration attesting that
the parties met and conferred.   
 
No such declaration has
been filed.
 
Accordingly, the motion
is DENIED.
