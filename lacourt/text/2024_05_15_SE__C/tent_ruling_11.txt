TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant KAREN KIM’s motion to expunge lis pendens is GRANTED. KIM is awarded $2,460.00 in
attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
Moving Party to Give Notice. 
 
Defendant KAREN KIM moves to expunge lis pendens and for
attorney fees and costs in the sum of $7,560 incurred in making this motion.
Kim argues that Tapia cannot establish a probable validity of their claim that
this action involves title or possession of the real property owned by Kim. Kim
also argues that the lis pendens is void or invalid as neither Kim nor any of
the other owners of record who are holders of deeds of trust to the subject
property were ever served properly with the lis pendens. 
 
Any party or a non-party having an interest in the property
affected by a notice of lis pendens may move for expungement any time after the
lis pendens is recorded. (CCP § 405.30.) A lis pendens must be removed for
being improper on account of (a) the pleading on which the notice is based not
containing a real property claim, assuming the allegations to be true, or (b)
the claimant not being able to establish by a preponderance of the evidence the
probable validity of the real property claim. (CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32; Ziello
v. Superior Court (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 321, 331-32; Urez Corp. v.
Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149.)
 
In a motion to expunge a notice of lis pendens, the claimant
who filed the lis pendens has the burden of proof. (CCP § 405.30.) Thus, that
claimant, in opposing the motion to expunge the lis pendens, must demonstrate
the following: (1) the action affects title to or right of possession of the
real property described in the notice; (2) in so far as the said notice is concerned,
the party recording the notice has commenced the action for a proper purpose
and in good faith; and (3) the probable validity of the real property claim by
a preponderance of the evidence. (Hunting World, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 67, 70; see also CCP § 405.30, et seq.) Only admissible
evidence is permitted on the motion. (Burger v. Superior Court (1984)
151 Cal.App.3d 1013, 1019.)
          
 
CCP § 405.22, requires that the claimant "shall, prior
to recordation of the notice, cause a copy to be mailed, by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, to all known addresses of the parties
to whom the real property claim is adverse and to all owners of record of the
real property affected by the real property claim as shown by the latest county
assessment roll."  
 
CCP § 405.23, states: "Any notice of pendency of action
shall be void and invalid as to any adverse party or owner of record unless the
requirements of section 405.22 are met for that party or owner and a proof of
service in the form and content specified in Section 1013a has been recorded
with the notice of pendency of action."
 
Kim presents evidence that she was not served by certified
mail, return receipt requested as required by CCP § 405.22. (Kim Decl., ¶5.)
The Court observes that the Notice of Lis Pendens filed on February 28, 2024,
only indicates electronic service. Plaintiff does not address this in
opposition. Accordingly, the Court
finds the notice void and invalid. 
 
The motion is GRANTED.
 
CCP § 405.38 provides “[t]he court shall direct that the
party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust.” 
 
As Kim is the prevailing party on this motion, attorney’s
fees and costs are warranted.  Counsel requests
attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $7560 for having spent 8 hours
researching and preparing this motion and another 4 hours in anticipation of reviewing
the opposition and preparing the reply, all at his hourly rate of $600.
Further, Kim has incurred a filing fee of $60 for this motion. The Court finds
that the amount of fees requested is excessive given the motion’s lack of
complexity and the absence of a reply brief. 
The Court awards attorney’s fees and costs in the reasonable sum of $2,460.00,
payable in 60 days.
