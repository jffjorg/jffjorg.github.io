TENATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request
for Production of Documents (Set One) is GRANTED
in part and DENIED in part.  Defendant is ordered to provide further
responses, as set forth below, within 30 days. 
This date may be extended by agreement of the parties.  
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
 
Background
 
This matter was first before the Court on February 21,
2024.  On that date, the Court ordered
the parties to further meet and confer and file a joint statement of the
remaining issues.  The parties did not do
so.  Defendant’s counsel stated that she
reached out to Plaintiff’s Counsel but did not get a response.  The Court continued the matter to today’s
date.  The parties filed a joint
statement on May 8, 2024.
 
Pursuant to the further meet and confer efforts, Plaintiffs
agree to withdraw RFP Nos. 1-3, 7, 9, 17, 18, 40, 41, 45, 51, 54, 56, 57, 74,
82, 84, and 85.
 
The Parties remain at an impasse regarding RFP Nos. 12, 20,
22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 39, 49, 75, and 86.
 
Plaintiffs agree to limit the documents they seek to the
same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle (other 2019 Honda CR-V
vehicles) that are equipped with the CVT transmission like that in the Subject
Vehicle.
 
The specific language of the discovery requests at issue is
set forth below:
 
RPD No. 12: All pre-sale or pre-purchase DOCUMENTS that YOU
made available to purchasers or lessees concerning the disclosure of a problem,
failures, malfunctions, or defect(s) regarding the TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S) in
HONDA VEHICLES equipped with the CVT transmission like the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
RPD No. 20: All DOCUMENTS, including ESI and emails,

RPD No. 22: All DOCUMENTS concerning field reports, dealer

Legal Standard
 
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply: (1) A state of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general.” (CCP §2031.310(a).) 
A motion to compel further responses to a request for
production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (CCP §2031.310(b).) 
 
Analysis
 
RFP No. 12
 
Plaintiff asserts that RFP No. 12 relates to the subject
vehicle itself, but the text of the request does not so indicate.  The Court will limit the request to vehicles
of the same year and model with similar defects within California.  
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s request for further response to RFP No. 12
is GRANTED in part.  
 
RFP Nos. 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, and 39
 
These RPPs seek “All Documents” regarding broad categories
of internal investigations performed by Defendant.  As phrased, the requests
are overbroad and unduly burdensome.  The
court has no obligation to modify discovery requests to make them entirely
proper. (Deaile v. Gen. Tele. Co. of Cal. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 841,
850-53.) 
 

Thus, Plaintiff’s request for further responses to these RFPs
is DENIED.  
 
RFP No. 49
 
RFP No. 49 relates to software release notes.  However, Plaintiff does not refer to, or even
attempt to justify the disclosure of, software release notes in the joint
statement.  
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s request for
further response to RFP No. 49 is DENIED.
 
RFP No. 75
 
This RFP seeks “All communications … and Documents” from the
supplier of the CVT transmission regarding “an actual or suspected CVT
transmission condition, issue, problem, or defect.”  As phrased, the requests are overbroad and unduly
burdensome.  The court has no obligation
to modify discovery requests to make them entirely proper. (Deaile v. Gen.
Tele. Co. of Cal. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 841, 850-53.) 
 
RFP No. 86
 
This RFP seeks all documents concerning performance
standards relating to the CVT transmission in HONDA VEHICLES.
 
Plaintiff does not address performance standards in the joint
statement.  Defendant argues, and the
Court agrees, that the request is vague and ambiguous.  
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s request for further response to RFP No. 86
is DENIED.
