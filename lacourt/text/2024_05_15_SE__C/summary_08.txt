And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of Defendant PIH to the third cause of action in the FAC with leave to amend. The Judge finds that the third cause of action is insufficiently alleged, failing to specify how Defendant PIH engaged in neglect, abandonment, or deprivation of goods or services necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff fails to allege specific facts showing that Defendant PIH acted with recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice. The Judge grants Defendant PIH's demurrer and allows leave to amend. The Judge also finds that the Motion to Strike is moot since the demurrer has been sustained.
