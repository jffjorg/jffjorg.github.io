 Case Number:  23NWCV01596    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  C MISTY KRISHELLE
BLANKS v. JAGUAR LAND ROVER NORTH AMERICA
CASE NO.:  23NWCV01596     
HEARING:   5/15/24 @ 10:30 AM
#8
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses is DENIED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
This is a Song-Beverly
action. Plaintiff Misty Krishelle Banks sued Jaguar Land Rover North America,
LLC for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and violation
of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b).
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to request numbers 1 to 32 served on Defendant.

Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion compelling
further responses to document requests if the party finds that the response is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection is without merit or too
general.
This
matter came on for hearing on April 10, 2024. It was apparent to the Court that
neither side had addressed the discovery requests with sufficient specificity.
The parties were ordered to meet and confer again, and, if court intervention was
still necessary, to submit a Joint Statement within 20 days regarding the
specific items of discovery still at issue.
No
Joint Statement has been filed. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
