And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling pertains to a lemon law matter, where the plaintiff, Vladimir Ouzdin, seeks reconsideration of an arbitration order issued on November 24, 2020. The court compelled arbitration, but the plaintiff did not initiate arbitration. The plaintiff now argues that new law indicates that a non-signatory manufacturer like BMW of North America, LLC cannot compel arbitration under the circumstances. The court finds that it has inherent authority to reconsider its own orders and that it has jurisdiction to reconsider the arbitration order. Since no signed order of dismissal was entered, the court can still hear the motion for reconsideration. The court grants the motion and finds that the plaintiff's claims are not dependent on the sales contract.
