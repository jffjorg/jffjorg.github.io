Plaintiffs Irene Young and Jesse Chang seek to compel a further response from Defendant Pacific Plaza Elite-Alhambra Homeowners Association as to their request for admission no. 15.Request no. 15 states, “Admit that YOU have not repaired the defects that were the subject of the CONSTRUCTION DEFECT DISPUTE.”Previously, Defendant responded: “After a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter contained in this request, admit in part and deny in part.”  The Court compelled a further response because there was no specificity as to what was admitted and denied.Defendant then served the following amended response that is the subject of the current Motion: “After a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter contained in this request, to the best of Responding Party’s knowledge, the Developer has completed the repairs to Plaintiff’s property and therefore responds: Deny.”Plaintiffs argue that this is evasive because the request did not relate to “the Developer”, who is never identified in the response anyway.  They also contend that it is unclear whether the phrase “Plaintiff’s property” relates to Plaintiffs’ unit or the entire condominium building that was the subject of the “CONSTRUCTION DEFECT DISPUTE.”The Motion to Compel is granted.  A further response should be provided in 10 days that (a) admits that Defendant itself did not do the repairs at issue, but (b) denies that the repairs were never done, because the developer, Pacific Plaza Investments, LLC, addressed them.  This would seem to better embody a response that complies with CCP § 2033.220.  The Court declines to award sanctions.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
