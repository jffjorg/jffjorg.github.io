And here is the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling**

Plaintiffs Irene Young and Jesse Chang seek to compel a further response from Defendant Pacific Plaza Elite-Alhambra Homeowners Association regarding their request for admission no. 15. The Defendant previously responded to the request, but the Court found the response to be evasive. The Defendant's amended response does not provide sufficient specificity, leading to the Court's decision to grant the Motion to Compel. The Court orders the Defendant to provide a further response within 10 days, which should admit that the Defendant itself did not do the repairs at issue but deny that the repairs were never done. The Court declines to award sanctions. Counsel are strongly encouraged to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
