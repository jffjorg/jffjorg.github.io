```

And here is the English-language summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' request to reconsider the denial of their motion for summary adjudication. The defendants had sought to present new evidence, including discovery responses, an email from the plaintiff's father, and notes from the plaintiff, to support their claims that the workers' compensation exclusivity rule bars this action and that the plaintiff only asserts labor code claims to gain leverage against the defendants. The judge has ruled that this new evidence does not change the court's previous finding that there are triable issues as to whistleblower retaliation and the circumstances surrounding the end of the plaintiff's employment. The motion is denied, and the requests for judicial notice are granted.
