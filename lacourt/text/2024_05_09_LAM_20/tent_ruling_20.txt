 This is a lemon law matter.  On November 24, 2020, the Court compelled this matter to arbitration.  Since that time, Plaintiff Vladimir Ouzdin did not initiate arbitration.  Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of the Court’s November 24, 2020, arbitration order on the basis of new law that indicates that a non-signatory manufacturer like BMW of North America, LLC cannot compel arbitration under the circumstances here. The Court has inherent authority to reconsider its rulings, (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(c)), particularly when the parties have had ample opportunity to brief the issues. Further, the Court has jurisdiction to reconsider an arbitration order.  (Pinela v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 227, 237 [“the trial court has authority to reconsider orders compelling or denying arbitration.”].)It’s true that when a final judgment of dismissal has been entered, there is no jurisdiction to hear a motion for reconsideration.  (See, e.g, Betz v. Pankow (1993)16 Cal.App.4th 931, 937 [“a motion for reconsideration may only be considered before final judgment is entered and while the case is still pending in the trial court.”].)  Here, however, no such final judgment was ever entered.  To the contrary, the Court merely issued an unsigned minute order on November 30, 2021, for a dismissal without prejudice.  Indeed, “All dismissals ordered by the court shall be in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action and those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for all purposes . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 581d (emphasis added).)  Because there was never any signed order of dismissal, there was never a judgment.  (See, e.g., Hyundai Motor Am. v. Superior Ct. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 418, 426 [“an unsigned minute order itself cannot serve as the judgment of dismissal.”]; Powell v. Cnty. of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1578.)  Thus, the Court can still hear a motion for reconsideration.  Plaintiff is correct that neither third-party beneficiary or equitable estoppel theories would allow for BMW of North America, LLC, a non-signatory to a dealer’s arbitration agreement, to compel arbitration here.  (See, e.g., Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1336 [“Plaintiffs’ claims in no way rely on the sale contracts. Equitable estoppel does not apply.”]; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (Cal. Ct. App. June 26, 2023) No. B320477, 2023 WL 4181909, at *7 [“We look to the facts alleged in the complaint to determine whether the Montemayors’ claims against Ford are dependent on and inextricably intertwined with the obligations imposed by the sales contract. [ ] They are not. As discussed, the Montemayors allege as part of each cause of action against Ford at issue on appeal that Ford's obligations arose out of its express written warranty, not the sales contract.”].) Therefore, the Motion for Reconsideration is granted.  The Request for Judicial Notice is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
