And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by the defendants, Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P., and Theta Holding IV, Inc., seeking a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Court finds that the defendants' arguments are without merit and fail to explain why the same arguments were not raised earlier. The Court denies the defendants' motions and orders them to provide notice. The Court also reminds counsel that they may participate in the hearing remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
