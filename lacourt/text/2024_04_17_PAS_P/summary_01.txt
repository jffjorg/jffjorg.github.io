Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jared D. Moses regarding a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production. The case concerns allegations of childhood sexual abuse and assault by three defendants against two plaintiffs. The discovery disputes have been resolved, and the court declines to award sanctions to either party. The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' supplemental brief and declines to order the plaintiffs to produce information as requested by the defendant. The court reminds parties that civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention.
