The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's application for a Right to Attach Order and order issuing a writ of attachment against the defendant. The application is not opposed by the defendant, but the court cannot grant it due to several procedural and evidentiary errors. The errors include failure to properly serve the defendant, failure to execute declarations and certifications under penalty of perjury, and submitting a proposed order on the wrong form. The court continues the hearing to March 19, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to correct the errors and provide proper notice to the defendant.
