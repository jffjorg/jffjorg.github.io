And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants defendant Benjamin Pena's motion to compel answers to special interrogatories and imposes sanctions on plaintiff Ray Gomez. The court finds that plaintiff failed to serve responses to the special interrogatories and did not oppose the motion. As a result, the court orders plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days. The court also grants defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $235, to be paid within 20 days. The sanctions are imposed for plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses and for failing to act with substantial justification.
