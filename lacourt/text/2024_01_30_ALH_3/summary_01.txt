And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, which sought to partition the real property located at 1109 Avon Place in South Pasadena, California, by sale. The plaintiff, William Henry Meuer, alleges that he and the defendant, Qinpei Li, are co-owners of the property and that the defendant has refused to voluntarily sell the property or buy out the plaintiff's interest. The plaintiff presented evidence showing that the property is a single-family residence and that partition by appraisal is not possible.

The defendant, Qinpei Li, opposes the motion and argues that the plaintiff lost his interest in the property through adverse possession, having built a fence around the property and changed the locks. The defendant also claims that the property can be divided and that it is not required to be sold, citing a city ordinance that permits the construction of an accessory dwelling unit on the lot. Additionally, the defendant claims that the plaintiff owes her a significant amount of money and that the plaintiff promised not to sell the property without her consent to avoid taxes.

The judge found that the defendant's submitted evidence raises a triable issue of material fact regarding the nature of the plaintiff's interest in the property and whether a partition by sale is preferable to subdivision. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
