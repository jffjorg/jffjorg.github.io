And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's Counsel Devin A. Cutting, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. The next hearing is scheduled for October 25, 2024, which should provide sufficient time for the plaintiff to retain new counsel. Alternatively, if the plaintiff or new counsel needs additional time to prepare for trial, sufficient time exists for the plaintiff to take action to seek a continuance of the trial."
