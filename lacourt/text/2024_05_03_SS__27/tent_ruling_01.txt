Legal Standard  
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party
to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)


Factual Background and Analysis
On July 1, 2019,
Plaintiffs filed the present auto accident case against Cleverson Fernandes,
who was allegedly driving within the scope of employment of Ivory Heron Group.
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiffs served their Request for Production, set one,
on Defendant Ivory Heron Group. Defendant did not provide any responses by the
statutory deadline. Plaintiffs now move the Court to compel Defendant to
provide the discovery responses at issue. Defendant did not file an opposition
or any other filing indicating that the discovery responses were filed prior to
the hearing. Thus, the motion to compel is granted. Defendant is ordered to
provide complete discovery responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production, set
one, without objections within 20 days of today.
Defendant’s lack of a
response forced Plaintiffs to file the present motion and incur attorney’s
fees. Plaintiffs request sanctions in the amount of $2,760.00. The Court
exercises its discretion and lowers the amount to $1,000, considering the
simplicity of the issues involved and the lack of an opposition. The Court
ORDERS Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of
$1,000 to Plaintiffs within 20 days of today’s date.
