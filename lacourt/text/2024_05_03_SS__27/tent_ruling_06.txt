On March 15, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present auto accident case against Defendant State Center
Locating, Inc. The fact discovery cut-off is March 17, 2024 and currently
follows the previous trial date of March 27, 2024. On February 16, 2024,
Defendants submitted an ex parte application to continue the trial and all
related dates. The Court continued the trial date from March 27, 2024, to July
29, 2024 but specified that any reopening of discovery would require a
stipulation or a noticed motion. On April 15, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to
extend the discovery cut-off date with a hearing set for May 9, 2024.  Since Defendant is seeking to conduct
discovery, IME and Neurological exam, beyond the fact discovery deadline, the
Court must rule on Defendant’s motion to reopen discovery first. Therefore, the
present motions are continued to ________, 2024, a date after the Court rules
on Defendant’s motion to extend discovery.
