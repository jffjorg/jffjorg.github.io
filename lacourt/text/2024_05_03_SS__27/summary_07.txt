And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The plaintiff's counsel, Kate Jamsheed, has moved to be relieved as counsel due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion is unopposed. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion must be made on the required Judicial Council forms and served on the client and all parties. The court notes that there are three hearings scheduled within six days, which would be insufficient time for the plaintiff to retain new counsel. Therefore, the court denies the motion to withdraw.
