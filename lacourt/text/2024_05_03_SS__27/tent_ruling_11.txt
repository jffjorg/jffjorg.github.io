Case No./Name:          23STCV30097 HEIDY GARCIA vs IN-HOME SUPPORT
SERVICES
Motion:                              MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Moving Party:                 Plaintiff
Responding Party:      Defendant County of Los Angeles, erroneously sued as In-Home
Support Services
Notice:                                Insufficient
 
Ruling:                              MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS DENIED.
 
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff, appearing in
pro per, filed the present general negligence claim against Defendant County of
Los Angeles, erroneously sued as In-Home Support Services. On February 28,
2024, Defendant filed an answer. On March 13, 2024, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff now moves the Court
for summary judgment against Defendant for a hearing set for May 3, 2024.
 
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350(c)
states that a motion for summary judgment must contain and be supported by a
notice of motion and separate statement of undisputed material facts in support
of the motion. These required documents are missing from the motion.  Furthermore, pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 437c, notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other
parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.
The present motion filed on March 27, 2024, was not filed 75 days before the
hearing date set for May 3, 2024.
 
Because a motion for summary judgment is
potentially case dispositive and usually requires considerable time and effort
to prepare, a summary judgment motion is perhaps the most important pretrial
motion in a civil case. The 75-day deadline is mandatory, and the Court has no
authority to shorten the minimum notice period for a summary judgment hearing.
(McMahon v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 112, 117.)
 
Thus, the present motion is denied.
