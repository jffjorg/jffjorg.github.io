ANGELES
Motion Name:           MOTION TO DEEM REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED;
MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION AND TO COMPEL DEPOSITION OF PMQ
Moving Party:           Plaintiff
Responding Party:    Defendant City of Los Angeles
Notice:                     Sufficient
 
Tentative Ruling:         GRANT, BUT THE COURT WILL HEAR FROM THE PARTIES
 
On August 10, 2020,
Plaintiff filed the present case. On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff served discovery
on Defendant, including Requests for Admission (RFA), Set One. The discovery responses
were due by February 27, 2024; however, Defendant neither responded nor
requested extensions. Plaintiff now moves the Court to deem the contents of
Plaintiff’s RFA, Set One, admitted and to compel responses to Form and Special Interrogatories,
Sets One, and to compel a PMQ deposition.  Plaintiff also requested sanctions.  No opposition was filed as to any of these
motions.
Defendant did not serve
the discovery responses by the statutory deadline, and, as a result, the Court
intends to grant the motions.  However,
before doing so, given the unusual lack of engagement by the City Attorney’s
Office in this case-- the City did not file any documents concerning the ex
parte hearing on October 3, 2023, the motion to reopen discovery on
November 13, 2023, or any of Plaintiff’s five motions to compel initial
responses on March 21, 2024 – the Court would like to hear from the
parties.
