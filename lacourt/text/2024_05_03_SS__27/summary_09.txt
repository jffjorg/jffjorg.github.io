This tentative ruling is about a motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions, special interrogatories, and requests for sanctions. The Plaintiff, Maritza Ramirez, filed a premises liability case on September 26, 2022, and moved the court to compel further responses from the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, on March 21, 2024.
