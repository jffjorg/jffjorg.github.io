And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on DB Insurance Co.'s motion to intervene in the case of Carolina Parra vs. Juan Ernesto Soto Valladares. The case was filed on September 8, 2022, and the Defendants have not yet filed an answer. DB Insurance, which issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to the Defendants, seeks to intervene to protect its interests. The Court has granted DB Insurance's motion to intervene, finding that DB Insurance meets all the factors set forth in Reliance Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000). The Court has discretion to permit DB Insurance to intervene where the proper procedures have been followed, DB Insurance has a direct and immediate interest in the action, intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation, and the reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the parties presently in the action. The Court has determined that DB Insurance's proposed answer-in-intervention will only litigate liability and damage issues as they relate to the Defendants. The Court has granted DB Insurance's motion to intervene, allowing it to participate in the litigation to protect its interests.
