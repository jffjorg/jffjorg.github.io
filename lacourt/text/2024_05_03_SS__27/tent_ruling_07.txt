Hearing Date:                    5/3/2024 at 1:30 p.m.
Case No./Name.:         22STCV15456 KELLY DENISE SMITH vs
CRANFORD SCOTT
Motion:                              MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
Moving Party:                 Plaintiff’s Counsel Kate Jamsheed
Responding Party:      Unopposed
Notice:                                Sufficient
 
Ruling:                               MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
IS DENIED.
 
Background
 
Attorney Kate Jamsheed represents
Plaintiff. Jamsheed moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
The Court notes that a FSC is set
for 5/3/24, a OSC RE: Dismissal is set for 5/6/24, and trial is set for 5/9/24.
There are a total of 3 hearings within 6 days of today and would be
insufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel and accordingly withdrawal
at this time would be prejudicial or would disrupt the orderly process of
justice. Thus, the present motion is DENIED.
