And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against Universal Protection Service LP. The plaintiff filed the motion on March 18, 2024, but it was filed late and not properly served on the defendant. The defendant was previously granted terminating sanctions and dismissed on March 7, 2024. The court ruled that the 75-day deadline for serving notice of the motion was not met, and the court has no authority to shorten the notice period. The judge also noted that a motion for summary judgment is potentially case dispositive and requires considerable time and effort to prepare.
