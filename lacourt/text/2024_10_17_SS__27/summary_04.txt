And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by the defendants, Reno Keshishian and Legacy Global Private Security. The motion concerns the settlement agreement entered into between the defendants and the plaintiff, Daniel Ortiz. The judge has concluded that the settlement was made in good faith and has taken into account the relevant factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the defendants' proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. The judge has also considered the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. The motion is granted, and the parties are advised to submit their arguments in writing or appear remotely or in person for oral argument on the hearing date.
