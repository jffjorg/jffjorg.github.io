And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the trial in the case of Christie John vs 855 N. Fairfax Avenue, LLC, with West Hollywood Healthcare and Wellness Center as the moving party. The trial is currently set for November 4, 2024, but the defendant is seeking to continue it to February 28, 2025. The defendant argues that a continuance is necessary to allow the parties to attend mediation on February 5, 2025, and to provide more time for discovery. However, the Court previously denied a similar ex parte application and found that the bases for a continuance did not constitute good cause. The defendant has raised no new rationale for the continuance, and the Court perceives no reason to deviate from its prior ruling. Despite this, the Court will hear from the parties to provide them an opportunity to persuade the Court to grant their joint request.
