And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from default judgment. The default judgment was entered on January 11, 2024, and the motion was filed on July 2, 2024, within the six-month statutory deadline. The defendant's counsel failed to instruct office staff to properly calendar the defendant's response, leading to the entry of default judgment. The judge finds that the default judgment was entered due to counsel's neglect. The statutory requirements for relief have been met, and since no opposition was filed, the motion for relief is granted.
