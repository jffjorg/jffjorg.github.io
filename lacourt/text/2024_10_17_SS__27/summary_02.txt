And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to exclude expert testimony at trial. The motion is based on the Plaintiff's failure to make their experts available for deposition and to produce their expert files. Specifically, the Plaintiff failed to contact Dr. Nourian and Dr. Morris regarding the deposition dates, and Dr. Choi failed to appear for his deposition and refused to provide expert documents. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff acted unreasonably and that the Defendant made a timely expert disclosure under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2034.260. As a result, the Judge excludes Dr. Morris and Dr. Nourian from testifying at trial, and Dr. Choi is excluded from providing expert testimony at trial, although he can testify as a percipient witness.
