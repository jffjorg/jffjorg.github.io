CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV15440 CHRISTIE JOHN vs
855 N. FAIRFAX AVENUE, LLC
Moving Party: Defendant West Hollywood Healthcare and Wellness
Center
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient
 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE WILL BE HEARD
 
On May 9, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present case. On May 5, 2023, Defendant West Hollywood
Healthcare and Wellness Center filed its answer. The trial is currently set for
November 4, 2024. Defendant West Hollywood now moves the Court to continue the
trial to February 28, 2025.
On September 12, 2024,
Defendant filed an ex parte application for a stipulated continuance of
the trial, arguing that a continuance should be granted to allow the parties to
attend mediation on February 5, 2025, and to provide more time to conduct
discovery, citing the various factors under California Rule of Court 3.1332.
The Court rendered its ruling on Defendant’s ex parte application,
stating: “The bases for a continuance do not constitute good cause. The parties
knew of the trial date and should have planned for mediation prior to that
date. The failure to complete discovery is likewise not, in and of itself, a
good cause basis for a continuance.”
On September 20, 2024,
Defendant filed the present motion to continue trial, raising the same
arguments that the continuance is stipulated and necessary for mediation.
However, this had already been presented in the ex parte application and
denied by the Court. Defendant raises no new rationale for the continuance, and
the Court perceives of no reason to deviate from its prior ruling. Nonetheless,
the Court will hear from the parties to provide them an opportunity to persuade
the Court to grant their joint request.
