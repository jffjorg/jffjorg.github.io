Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment with prejudice. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendant alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's business was inaccessible to the plaintiff, but failed to comply with mandatory alternative dispute resolution requirements before filing the lawsuit. The judge also found that the plaintiff's evidence was unclear and lacked specificity, and that the complaint failed to meet basic pleading standards. Therefore, the application for default judgment is denied with prejudice.
