And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a dispute between Cast Parts, Inc. and its employees regarding an arbitration agreement. The agreement has already been enforced by this Court against two former employees in a PAGA-only action pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The judge notes that the United States Supreme Court has made clear that California policy that seeks to prohibit enforcement of arbitration agreements, including class action waivers, is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The judge also finds that the arbitration agreement is specific and does not make any reference to the Labor commissioner's jurisdiction regarding labor code violations. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's opposition to the arbitration agreement is incongruent with the basis of the opposition and that the plaintiff's reliance on certain case law is inapposite.
