Summary in English:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on two motions: one to compel arbitration of plaintiff's claims on an individual basis and another to compel arbitration of PAGA claims. The plaintiff has waived his right to a class action suit and consented to arbitrate any individual wage/PAGA-related claims. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to contracts that involve interstate commerce, and the court must take the contract as a whole and interpret it in favor of arbitration. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the claims are covered within the scope of the agreement. The court also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the agreement is unconscionable, finding that there is no evidence of procedural unconscionability and that the agreement is not overly harsh or one-sided. The motions are granted, and the matters are stayed, not dismissed.
