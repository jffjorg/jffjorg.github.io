And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add three new causes of action: breach of contract, fraudulent billing, and unfair business practices. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown an excusable reason for the delay in filing the motion, as the full billing records were not available until late July or early August 2023. The judge also finds that the proposed amendments will not prejudice the defendants.

The judge notes that Section 425.13 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which bars claims for punitive damages in certain cases, does not apply in this case. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is not barred and that the court has broad discretion to liberally grant leave to amend the complaint.

The judge sets a hearing date of October 9, 2024, and orders that the proposed amended complaint be filed with the court.
