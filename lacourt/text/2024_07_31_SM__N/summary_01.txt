And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of documents by the defendants, James Bekhor, Jeremy Bekhor, James S. Bekhor Insurance Services, Inc., and JBEK Insurance Agency, LLC. The plaintiff sought to compel the production of documents related to the defendants' financial condition, arguing that the defendants waived their objections by serving them one day late. However, the court found that the plaintiff is not entitled to the documents because the court previously denied the plaintiff's motion for pretrial discovery of the defendants' financial condition. Additionally, the court was not convinced that the defendants' one-day delay in serving their objections waived their privacy right in their financial information.
