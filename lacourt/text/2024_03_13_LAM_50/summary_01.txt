And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining CENTRAL METAL, INC.'s demurrer to the first and second causes of action of J&I Consulting, Inc.'s Second Amended Cross-Complaint. The demurrer was filed in response to J&I Consulting, Inc.'s allegations that CENTRAL METAL, INC. and Jong Uk Byun breached a consulting agreement and failed to pay a real estate commission payment. The Court found that J&I Consulting, Inc. lacks standing to bring the claims because it is not a licensed real estate broker. The Court also found that the Consulting Agreement requires a real estate broker's license and that J&I Consulting, Inc. did not provide any services that require a broker license. The Court ordered CENTRAL METAL, INC. to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days of the date of the order.
