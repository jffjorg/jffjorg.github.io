Background
 
On March 22, 2023, Angel
Gallegos-Botello and Araceli Mejia (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against various Defendants alleging six causes of action: (1)
negligence, (2) strict liability – warning defect, (3) strict liability -
design defect, (4) fraudulent concealment, (5) breach of implied warranties,
and (6) loss of consortium. This is a toxic torts action wherein Plaintiff
Angel Gallegos-Botello alleges he developed silicosis and other injuries due to
his work with stone products manufactured, distributed, and/or supplied by
various named Defendants.  
 
On November 16, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the
same causes of action in the original Complaint. 
 
On December 19, 2023, Defendant
Dal-Tile International, Inc. (“Dal-Tile”) filed a motion to strike the FAC.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion to
strike the first amended complaint[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
¿Any party, within the time
allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a
motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend
is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendant
Dal-Tile requests that the following be stricken from the FAC: 
 
1)
Page 21, Line 19: 
 

“[a]nd other crystalline-silica containing products to be
     identified in the course of discovery”

 
2)
Pages 169-170, Paragraph 421
 

“In 1991 the Texas Water Commission imposed a record $1
     million fine against Dal-Tile for 12 years of illegally dumping hazardous
     waste into two gravel pits in southeastern Dallas County. It was the
     largest fine ever levied by a state agency for environmental violations.
     The company was required by law to send contaminated wastes from the
     manufacturing process to special landfills but, according to state
     investigators, dumped the material from 1975 to 1987 in pits that were not
     specially licensed. The commission also found that Dal-Tile used waste
     oils on farmland for dust control, failed to notify the state it had
     discharged industrial solid wastes into water, and failed to keep records
     of the waste and file annual reports.”

 
 
 
 
3) Page 170, Paragraph 422
 

“In 1993, a federal grand
     jury indicted Robert Brittingham, Jr., and company president John Lomonaco
     on 17 criminal counts, including conspiracy to dump hazardous waste.
     Brittingham was found guilty in 1993, fined $4 million, and sentenced to
     five years' probation, which he began fulfilling with 15 hours a week in
     community service by financing and operating a $6 million lead- abatement
     program for Dallas. The total cost of the fines and dumpsite cleanup came
     to $16.5 million.”

 
In Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, the California
Supreme Court considered what a plaintiff would have to allege in their revised
complaint to meet the “substantial factor” test of proving that the defendant’s
conduct contributed to the plaintiff’s injury. (Id. at p. 79.) 
 
The California
Supreme Court held that: 
 
1) Plaintiff must allege
that he was exposed to each of the toxic materials claimed to have caused a
specific illness. An allegation that he was exposed to “most and perhaps all”
of the substances listed is inadequate.
 
(2) He must identify each
product that allegedly caused the injury. It is insufficient to allege that the
toxins in defendants' products caused it.
 
(3) He must allege that as
a result of the exposure, the toxins entered his body.
 
(4) He must allege that he
suffers from a specific illness, and that each toxin that entered his body was
a substantial factor in bringing about, prolonging, or aggravating that
illness.
 
(5) Finally, except in a
case (unlike this one) governed by the principle of liability based on market
share for a uniform product that we outlined in Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980)
26 Cal.3d 588, 612, 163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, he must allege that each
toxin he absorbed was manufactured or supplied by a named defendant.
 
(Id. at p. 80.) 
 
Defendants maintain that the allegation in Page 21, Line 19 of the
FAC is too conclusory and not in conformity with the pleading standard set out
in Bockrath. 
 
Plaintiffs argue their allegation is
sufficient under Bockrath because the Supreme Court asserted that: 
 
If the plaintiff does not
believe the requisite evidence exists, but does actually believe that it is
likely to be discovered later, ‘after a reasonable opportunity for further
investigation or discovery’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (b)(3)), the
complaint must so state (ibid.).
 
(Bockrath, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 82.) Plaintiffs
therefore argue that the allegation on Page 21, line 19 is properly pled as
discovery is likely to uncover facts as to the specific products sold by
Dal-Tile. “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v.
Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
The court agrees that discovery procedures will clarify for
Defendant Del-Tile what specific products it sold to Plaintiff’s employer and Plaintiffs’
basis for liability. Plaintiffs must then amend the pleadings  to encompass the newly discovered information
or else the allegations will not be part of the record if Defendants move for
summary judgment. (See Hutton v. Fidelity
National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493 [nn summary judgment the defendant
need only negate the plaintiff’s theories as alleged in the complaint].) 
 
Accordingly, the motion to strike Page 21, Line 19 is denied. 
 
Defendant-Tile moves to strike Paragraphs 421 and 422 on the basis
that the allegations are irrelevant and improper. (CCP § 436.) Plaintiffs fail
to explain how Paragraphs 421 and 422 show that Defendant Del-Tile acted with
malice, fraud, or oppression in this instant action. Nor does Plaintiff argue
that Paragraphs 421 and 422 are relevant to show that Defendant Del-Tile had
current knowledge about the toxicity posed by its silica-containing products. 
 
As Plaintiff fails to show the relevance of Paragraphs 421 and
422, Defendant’s Motion to strike Paragraphs 421 and 422 is granted without
leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Del-Tile’s
motion to strike is denied as to Page
21, Line 19 and granted without leave to amend as to Paragraphs 421 and 422.
Defendant to give notice.
