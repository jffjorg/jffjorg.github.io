Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to strike certain allegations from the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The motion is denied as to Page 21, Line 19, which alleges that the defendant sold crystalline-silica containing products to the plaintiff's employer. The judge finds that the allegation is sufficient because it is likely that discovery will uncover facts as to the specific products sold by the defendant.

The motion is granted without leave to amend as to Paragraphs 421 and 422, which allege that the defendant dumped hazardous waste and failed to notify the state. The judge finds that these allegations are irrelevant and improper because they do not show that the defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression in this instant action.

The judge orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling and the plaintiff to amend the pleadings to encompass any newly discovered information. The ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.
