And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has found that there has been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship due to irreconcilable differences between Counsel and Defendant, and has ordered that the relief be effective after notice of this ruling has been served on the Defendant and proof of such has been filed with the Court. The judge has also set an OSC hearing for December 3, 2024, to determine whether Defendant, a corporate entity, has retained new counsel.
