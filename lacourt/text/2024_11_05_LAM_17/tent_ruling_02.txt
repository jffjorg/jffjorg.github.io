LLP (Counsel) moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Voge Inc.
(Defendant).  
 
Legal Standard
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other.   (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).)  An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation.  (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).)  “The determination
whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998)
66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
            An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
            Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).)  The court may delay effective date of the
order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on
the client has been filed with the court. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
 
Discussion 
 
            Counsel
has filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. Also, Counsel has
served the forms on Defendant and opposing counsel as well as confirmed
Defendant’s address via telephonic conversation. (See Proof of Service; MC-052
at ¶ 3a(1)(b).) 
 
            Counsel declares that there has been a complete breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship due to irreconcilable differences between
Counsel and Defendant based on Defendant’s conduct. (MC-052 at ¶ 2.)  A post-mediation status conference is set for December
3, 2024, a final status conference for June 12, 2025, and a jury trial for June
23, 2025. As these dates can be continued, Defendant will not suffer prejudice
if Counsel is permitted to withdraw.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Counsel’s motion to be relieved
as counsel of Defendant is GRANTED. This
order will be effective after notice of this ruling has been served on the Defendant
and proof of such has been filed with the Court. Further, an OSC hearing is set
for December 3, 2024 as to whether Defendant, a corporate entity, has retained
new counsel.
