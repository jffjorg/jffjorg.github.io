Hearing Date: June 17, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
Moving Party: Petitioner Glaser Weil Fink Howard Jordan Shapiro LLP
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     THE PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION
AWARD IS GRANTED.
 
PETITIONER TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving
papers.  No opposition has been
received.  
 
Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition
the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  (CCP § 1285.) 
Petitioner has complied with CCP § 1285.4: it has set forth the name of
the arbitrator (Hon. Elizabeth A. White (Ret.)), attached documents evidencing an agreement to
arbitrate, and attached a copy of the arbitration award. Respondent was served
with the petition by substitute service.
 
The court file reflects that no
response to the petition has been filed by Respondent.  (See CCP § 1290.6 [“A response shall
be served and filed within 10 days after service of the petition”].)  As Respondent has not filed a timely
response, the allegations of the petition are deemed admitted by
Respondent.  (CCP § 1290.) The petition
is GRANTED.
