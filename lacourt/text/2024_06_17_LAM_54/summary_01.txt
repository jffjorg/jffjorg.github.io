And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff Dr. Nayyer Ali's claims for failure to renew his residency agreement. The defendants had argued that the arbitration agreement in the residency agreement established their right to compel arbitration. However, the court found that the defendants had waived their right to compel arbitration by participating extensively in the litigation in court, filing demurrers, an anti-SLAPP motion, and a motion for attorney's fees, and unreasonably delaying the filing of their motion to compel arbitration. The court held that the defendants had acted inconsistently with the intent to compel arbitration and had waived their right to do so.
