Date:               11/9/23 (1:30 PM) 
Case:               Ally Bank v. Kareem M. Ali (23STLC05350) 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
The Unopposed Application for Writ of Possession by
plaintiff Ally Bank is DENIED. 
 
The Retail Installment Sale Contract at issue was assigned
by seller Car Star Motors to Ally Financial, not plaintiff Ally Bank. (Singleton
Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. A at p. 6.) Accordingly, based on the moving papers,
plaintiff Ally Bank does not have standing to seek writ of possession. 
 
Further, under CCP § 512.030, prior to the hearing on an
application for a writ of possession, the defendant “shall be served” with
specific documents, including the Summons and Complaint, the Notice of
Application and Hearing, and a copy of the application and any affidavits.
Plaintiff has neither filed any proofs of service of the foregoing with the
court nor attached proofs of service to the filed document. Because plaintiff
has failed to provide proof of service as required, the application cannot be
granted.
