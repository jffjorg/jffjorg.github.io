[1]           Instead, petitioner merely presumes
harm in the full amount of the purported $4 million security interest, failing
to account for—or, more to the point, carry his burden to demonstrate—any
actual unpaid portion of the loan that the security interest would be used to
satisfy.  As such, petitioner also fails
to demonstrate that his claim is for a “fixed or readily ascertainable amount,”
which is a separate and independent reason why he is not entitled to a writ of
attachment.  (CCP § 483.010(a).)
