Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the petitioner's application for a right to attach order against FMB Development, LLC in the amount of $4,000,000. The petitioner, Dr. Roy Lubit, MD Ph.D, seeks to attach the property of FMB Development, LLC to secure a claim for breach of contract. The judge finds that the petitioner has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will obtain a judgment in his favor. The judge also finds that the petitioner has not shown how an arbitration award may be rendered ineffectual without the writ of attachment. The judge notes that the parties had agreed to arbitration and that attaching FMB's property with a speculative showing would only serve to invade the province of the arbitrator.
