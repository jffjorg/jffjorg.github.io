The court notes that Plaintiff has previously filed some of these documents,
without redactions, with the court.  (TAC
Ex. A [D. Linsmaier’s Death Certificate]; Pl. Decl. filed December 16, 2020 Ex.
J [Kaiser records].)  Because Plaintiff
did not move to seal those documents, the court does not include those
documents in this order.  


[2] The
court notes that Plaintiff has entitled her third through fifth causes of
action to be “Elder Abuse – Fraud,” “Elder Abuse – Constructive Fraud,” and “Elder
Abuse – Undue Influence,” respectively. 
However, abuse of an elder is defined to mean (1) physical abuse,
neglect, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting
physical harm or pain or mental suffering, (2) the deprivation by a care
custodian of goods or services necessary to avoid physical harm or mental
suffering, and (3) financial abuse as defined in section 15610.30.  (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.07, subd.
(a).)  Elder abuse, therefore, does not
encompass claims for fraud.  However, it
appears that Plaintiff has alleged causes of action for financial abuse of an
elder under these theories (i.e., that Defendant obtained D. Linsmaier’s
property (1) “with intent to defraud” as defined in section 15610.30 and (2)
“by undue influence” as defined in sections 15610.30 and 15610.70).  (TAC ¶¶ 91, 95-96, 113-14, 128-129.)  Thus, the court has discussed these causes of
action with the first cause of action for financial elder abuse. 


[3] It
appears that Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant obtained D. Linsmaier’s
property as a result of his undue influence over her in support of all of her
financial elder abuse causes of action. 
(TAC ¶¶ 50, 96, 114, 129.)  Thus,
while Plaintiff does not appear to have alleged facts establishing that
Defendant took D. Linsmaier’s property with the intent to defraud her, the
allegations of undue influence are sufficient to support each financial elder
abuse cause of action.
