Request
for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff DeeAnna Linsmaier, as
an individual and on behalf of Donna Marie Linsmaier a/k/a Dawn D. Linsmaier (“D.
Linsmaier”) (collectively, “Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
sealing documents filed in support of her request for default judgment, and (2)
entering default judgment in her favor and against defendant Carl J. Linden, a/k/a
Carl Linden (“Defendant”). 
MOTION TO SEAL
Plaintiff requests that the
court seal the following documents: (1) Exhibits 1-10 attached to the filing
entitled “Declaration of DeeAnna Linsmaier in Support of Application for
Default Judgment Pursuant to CCP §585(d), and Request for Equitable Relief
Under Probate Code §259(a),” filed on June 12, 2024 by Plaintiff; (2) pages
4:14-15, 4:17-25, 5:17-18, 5:21-24, 5:26-28, 6:1, 6:3-4, 6:7-15, 6:17, 6:19-21,
6:23-27, 7:1-4, 7:6-10, 7:12-14, 7:16-18, 7:20-28, 8:1, 8:7-14, and 8:18-20 of
the “Declaration of Deeanna Linsmaier in Support of Application for Default
Judgment Pursuant to CCP §585(d), and Request for Equitable Relief Under
Probate Code §259(a),” filed on June 12, 2024 by Plaintiff; and (3) page 3,
lines 9-20 of the filing entitled “Plaintiff’s Brief Summary of the Case in
Support of Application for Default Judgment,” filed by Plaintiff on June 12,
2024.
Generally, court records are
presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by law.¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of access applies, the court
may order that a record be filed under seal “if it expressly finds facts that
establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of
public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the
record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will
be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding
interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (d).)¿¿¿¿ 
First, the court finds that
Plaintiff has established, as to exhibits 1-2 and 4-10 attached to her
supporting declaration,[1] that (1) there exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
information in those exhibits since the documents include (i) death
certificates of individuals that are not parties to this action, (ii) D.
Linsmaier’s medical records, and (iii) sensitive financial information of the
parties (i.e., their account numbers), (2) the overriding interest supports
sealing the records, (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding
interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed, (4) the proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored, and (5) no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (d).)  
The court acknowledges that
Plaintiff has also moved to seal various emails that appear to describe D.
Linsmaier’s condition.  (Pl. Decl., Ex.
3.)  However, Plaintiff did not present
adequate argument to show that there exists an overriding interest that
overcomes the right of public access to these records.  
Second, the court finds that
Plaintiff has established, as to the identification of account numbers with
various financial institutions described in the Plaintiff’s supporting
declaration on pages 4:18, 4:23,
4:24, 6:4, 6:14, 6:15, 6:17, 7:2, 7:3, 7:7, 7:10, 7:13, 7:18, 7:22, 7:24, 7:26,
7:28, 8:7, 8:9, 8:11, and 8:13, that (1) there exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record since those portions of
the declaration list the numbers associated with various financial accounts
belonging to D. Linsmaier and Defendant, (2) the overriding interest
supports sealing the record, (3) a substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed, (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored since the
court will seal only the account numbers, and (5) no less restrictive means
exist to achieve the overriding interest. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd. (d).)  The court denies Plaintiff’s request to seal
the information describing the transfers made by Defendant, including the
amount of the transfers, because Plaintiff has not established an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to that information.  
Third, the court finds that
Plaintiff has established, as to the account numbers listed on page 3, lines 9,
10, 13, 15, 17, and 19 of the case summary, that (1) there exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record since those
portions of the Brief Summary list the numbers associated with various
financial accounts belonging to D. Linsmaier, (2) the overriding
interest supports sealing the record, (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed, (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored since the court will seal only the account numbers, and (5) no less
restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)  The court denies Plaintiff’s
request to seal the amount of compensatory damages sought as to the amounts
transferred from each account and the names of the financial institutions.  Thus, the court will seal only the account
numbers. 
 
 
REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint in this action
on June 6, 2023, alleging five causes of action against Defendant for (1) elder
abuse (financial), (2) elder abuse (physical), (3) elder abuse—fraud, (4) elder
abuse—constructive fraud, and (5) elder abuse— undue influence.  Defendant’s default was entered on March 14,
2024. 
Plaintiff now requests that the court enter default judgment in her
favor and against Defendant in the amount of $1,202,751.61, consisting of
$834,510.19 in damages and $368,241.42 in interest. 
1.     Sufficiency
of Third Amended Complaint
The court finds that the Third Amended Complaint is well pleaded and
therefore may support Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 281 [“‘Substantively, “[t]he judgment by default is
said to ‘confess’ the material facts alleged by the plaintiff, i.e., the
defendant’s failure to answer has the same effect as an express admission of the
matters well pleaded in the complaint”’”] [internal citations omitted]
[emphasis in original].) 
First, the court finds that the first and third through fifth causes
of action state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for financial
elder abuse.[2]
As a threshold matter, the court finds that Plaintiff filed, on May 6,
2022, a declaration setting forth all information required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 377.32, showing that Plaintiff (1) is the successor in
interest to D. Linsmaier, and therefore (2) has standing to allege claims for
elder abuse on behalf of D. Linsmaier under the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult
Civil Protection Act (the “Elder Abuse Act”). 
(Pl. May 6, 2022 Decl., ¶¶ 3-8; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 377.32, 377.11
[defining a decedent’s successor in interest]; Welf. & Inst. Code, §
15657.3, subd. (d)91) [“after the death of the elder . . . , the right to
commence or maintain an action shall pass to the personal representative of the
decedent” or, if there is no personal representative, to the decedent’s
successor in interest, if the requirements of section 377.32 are met].)  
“‘Financial abuse’ of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a person
or entity does any of the following: [¶] (1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains,
or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a
wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both. . . . . [¶¶]    (3)
Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking,
secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of
an elder or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Section
15610.70.”  (Welf. & Inst. Code, ¶
15610.30, subds. (a)(1), (a)(3); Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 156, 174.)  Undue influence
is defined to mean “excessive persuasion that causes another person to act or
refrain from acting by overcoming that person’s free will and results in
inequity.”  (Welf. & Inst. Code, §
15610.70, subd. (a).)  In determining
whether a result was produced by undue influence, courts shall consider several
factors set forth in the Elder Abuse Act, including the vulnerability of the
victim, the influencer’s apparent authority, the actions or tactics used by the
influencer, and the equity of the result. 
(Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.70, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3),
(a)(4).) 
Plaintiff has alleged facts establishing the following.  D. Linsmaier was, at all relevant times, an
elder within the meaning of the Elder Abuse Act.  (TAC ¶ 45 [D. Linsmaier was over 65 years old
at the time of all wrongful acts]; Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.27 [“‘Elder’
means any person residing in this state, 65 years of age or older”].)  D. Linsmaier was also diagnosed with
dementia, which had advanced by the years 2005-2006.  (TAC ¶ 27.)  As a result of her impaired cognitive ability,
D. Linsmaier became vulnerable to Defendant’s actions.  (TAC ¶ 94.) 
Defendant took control of D. Linsmaier’s property, including “hundreds
of thousands of dollars” belonging to her and other financial accounts, which
she accumulated “while living separate and apart from” Defendant such that it
was D. Linsmaier’s sole property.  (TAC
¶¶ 22, 29, 43-44.)  Defendant used D.
Linsmaier’s property “for his own benefit and not” for the benefit of D.
Linsmaier, including by representing that “there were no funds or insurance to
pay for [D. Linsmaier’s medical] care . . . .” 
(TAC ¶ 30.)  Moreover, he
fraudulently obtained power of attorney and “sign[ed] himself into [D.
Linsmaier’s investment accounts] because [D. Linsmaier] lacked necessary
capacity at the time.”  (TAC ¶¶ 32, 50,
subd. (b) [Defendant forced D. Linsmaier to “change her beneficiaries” and to
change her power of attorney “despite her incapacity and inability to legally
make such decisions”].) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has alleged facts showing that (1) D.
Linsmaier was an elder within the meaning of the Elder Abuse Act; (2) Defendant
took, appropriated, and obtained D. Linsmaier’s property for a wrongful use,
i.e., to use for his own benefit despite knowing that it would be harmful to D.
Linsmaier (TAC ¶¶ 30, 113); and (3) Defendant took, appropriated, and obtained
D. Linsmaier’s property by undue influence[3]
because (i) he was acting as D. Linsmaier’s caregiver, friend, and, at certain
times, significant other (TAC ¶¶ 21, 25, 111), such that he had apparent
authority over her, (ii) he controlled D. Linsmaier’s medical care, medications,
and interactions with her family members (TAC ¶¶ 29, 50, 96, 129), (iii) he,
acting in this capacity, persuaded D. Linsmaier to allow him to obtain her
power of attorney and to sign himself onto her investment accounts, despite the
fact that she did not have the legal capacity to do so and was vulnerable due
to her impaired cognitive ability (TAC ¶¶ 46, 50, 96, 129), which (iv) led to
the inequitable results of Defendant obtaining her funds and assets and using
them for his own benefit, rather than D. Linsmaier’s benefit (TAC ¶¶ 32, 50,
subds. (e), (f)).  (Welf. & Inst. Code,
§§ 15610.30, subds. (a)(1), (a)(3), (b), 15610.70, subd. (a).) 
Second, the court finds that the second cause of action states facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action for physical elder abuse. 
Physical abuse within the meaning of the Elder Abuse Act means, inter
alia, assault and battery, as defined in Penal Code sections 240 and 242,
respectively, and the use of a physical or chemical restraint or psychotropic
medication for any purpose not authorized by the physician or surgeon.  (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.63, subds.
(b), (f)(3).)  Plaintiff has alleged
facts showing that (1) D. Linsmaier was an elder at all relevant times (TAC ¶
45); (2) Defendant threatened D. Linsmaier and caused her physical harm by
striking her on the face and shoulder, pushing her against a wall and into a
couch, and pushing her until she fell (TAC ¶¶ 68, subd. (a), 69), and therefore
has alleged facts establishing that Defendant battered D. Linsmaier within the
meaning of Penal Code section 242; and (3) Defendant used physical and chemical
restraints to control D. Linsmaier’s access to family, friends, and
authorities, and for punishment (TAC ¶¶ 68, subd. (b), 70), and therefore has
alleged facts establishing that Defendant used physical and chemical restraints
for punishment and for purposes not authorized by D. Linsmaier’s physician.  (Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 15610.27,
15610.63, subds. (a), (f)(1), (f)(3); Pen. Code, § 242 [defining battery to be
“any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of
another”].)  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action for physical
elder abuse against Defendant. 
The court further finds that Plaintiff has alleged facts establishing
that Defendant acted with malice and oppression in committing the physical and
financial abuse of D. Linsmaier.  (Civ.
Code, § 3294, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2).) 
2.     Proof
of Damages
The court finds that Plaintiff has proven that she is entitled to
recover from Defendant, as successor-in-interest to D. Linsmaier, damages in
the amount of $824,660.19, consisting of $574,660.19 in economic compensatory
damages and $250,000 in pain and suffering. 
(Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 15657.5, subd. (a) [plaintiff shall recover
from a defendant found liable for financial abuse compensatory damages], 15657.5,
subd. (b), 15657, subd (b).)
As a threshold matter, the court notes that, on November 4, 2022, the
court issued an order denying Plaintiff’s request for default judgment because,
inter alia, the evidence appeared to show that Defendant and D.
Linsmaier were married, which could have triggered the community property laws
and rendered the use and transfer of D. Linsmaier’s funds potentially lawful.  However, Plaintiff has now (1) alleged that “no
legal marriage existed between [D. Linsmaier] and [Defendant] in any other
jurisdiction” (TAC ¶ 21), and (2) presented a copy of D. Linsmaier’s death
certificate, which reflects that it has been amended (i) to state D.
Linsmaier’s marital status to be divorced, and (ii) to state that Defendant
(who is identified as the informant) is D. Linsmaier’s “friend,” not
husband.  (Pl. Decl., Ex. 1, D. Linsmaier
Death Cert, p. 3.)  Thus, Plaintiff has
addressed the issue regarding the potential application of the community
property laws. 
First, Plaintiff has proven that Defendant took property belonging to D.
Linsmaier in the amount of $307,245.55 in funds deposited on her behalf with
Brighthouse Financial.  
Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that (1) a total of $353,503.71
was deposited on behalf of D. Linsmaier by her financial advisor and from her
401k accounts; (2) at the end of June 2015, the account balance was $305,404.01;
and (3) on January 16, 2016, a distribution in the amount of $307,245.55 was
made from this account to Defendant.  (Pl.
Decl., ¶ 19; Pl. Decl., Ex. 5, pp. 5-03-5-09, 5-11, 5-12 [Acknowledgement from
MetLife showing the lump sum distribution to the account with Pershing “FBO”
Defendant].)  Moreover, as set forth
above, Plaintiff has alleged, and therefore Defendant has confessed, that
Defendant unlawfully “sign[ed] himself into [D. Linsmaier’s] investment
accounts” (TAC ¶ 32) and “took unauthorized control of [D. Linsmaier’s]
investment, retirement, and financial accounts” (TAC ¶ 43).  (Kim, supra, 201 Cal.App.4th at
p. 281.)  
Thus, Plaintiff has shown that D. Linsmaier was damaged in the amount
of $307,245.55 as a result of Defendant’s financially abusing her by taking
control of, and receiving the disbursement from, her Brighthouse account. 
Second, Plaintiff has proven that Defendant took property belonging to
D. Linsmaier in the amount of $81,760.44 in funds deposited on her behalf with
Voya and therefore has proven damages in that amount.
Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that (1) D. Linsmaier held an
account with Voya; (2) an account transfer form was completed, by which the
funds held in D. Linsmaier’s Voya account were to be transferred to Defendant’s
Pershing account; and (3) $81,760.44 was deposited into Defendant’s account
from D. Linsmaier’s Voya account on February 8, 2016.  (Pl. Decl., Ex. 6, pp. 6-01, 6-06 [Account
Transfer Form], 6-11.)  Plaintiff has
also alleged, and therefore Defendant has confessed, that his acts in assigning
himself as the beneficiary and taking control of this account before D.
Linsmaier’s death was unlawful and constitutes financial abuse of an
elder.  (TAC ¶¶ 32, 43; Kim, supra,
201 Cal.App.4th at p. 281.)  
Thus, Plaintiff has proven damages in the amount of $81,760.44 as a
result of Defendant’s financially abusing D. Linsmaier by taking control of,
and receiving the disbursement from, her Voya financial account. 
Third, Plaintiff has shown that Defendant took property belonging to
D. Linsmaier in the amount of $150,000 based on Defendant’s unauthorized
receipt of D. Linsmaier’s life insurance funds.  
Plaintiff has (1) alleged that Defendant took unauthorized control of
D. Linsmaier’s life insurance policy (TAC ¶ 22), and (2) proven that Defendant
received from D. Linsmaier’s life insurance policy $152,842.43 on June 16,
2016.  (Pl. Decl., Ex. 7, p. 7-09).  Although Plaintiff has proven that Defendant
received $152,842.43 from D. Linsmaier’s life insurance policy, Plaintiff has
requested only $150,000 in damages.  (Brief
Summary of Case, p. 3:13 [“Plaintiff seeks the return of the following funds
stolen: [¶¶] $150,000” held in D. Linsmaier’s life insurance policy].) 
Thus, Plaintiff has proven $150,000 in damages based on Defendant’s
unauthorized receipt of D. Linsmaier’s life insurance funds.
Fourth, Plaintiff has shown that Defendant took $8,343.07 from D.
Linsmaier’s Voya Financials account on January 26, 2016.  Specifically, Plaintiff has (1) alleged that
Defendant unlawfully took control of D. Linsmaier’s financial accounts (TAC ¶
22), and (2) presented evidence showing that (i) D. Linsmaier transferred funds
to an account with Voya Financials (at that time known as ING / Golden American
Life Insurance Company), and (ii) Defendant received from this account $8,343.07
on January 26, 2016.  (Pl. Decl., Ex. 8,
pp. 8-05, 8-06-8-07 [check to Defendant for $8,343.07 for “DeathBenefit Payout
for Contract [number associated with D. Linsmaier]]”].) 
Thus, Plaintiff has proven $8,343.07 in damages based on Defendant’s
unauthorized receipt of D. Linsmaier’s funds that were deposited with Voya
Financials. 
Fifth, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
withdrew a total amount of $9,850 from one of D. Linsmaier’s accounts with Voya
Financials.  Plaintiff has (1) alleged
that Defendant took unauthorized control of D. Linsmaier’s financial accounts
(TAC ¶ 22), and (2) presented evidence showing that (i) $5,212 was withdrawn
from that account on August 20, 2012, and (ii) $4,638 was withdrawn from that
account on January 17, 2013.  (Pl. Decl.,
Ex. 9, pp. 9-01, 9-07.)  However,
Plaintiff did not submit evidence showing that those amounts were deposited in
an account belonging to Defendant, and therefore has not shown that Defendant
unlawfully took these funds from D. Linsmaier. 
Thus, Plaintiff has not proven $9,850 in damages based on Defendant’s
withdrawal of funds from D. Linsmaier’s account with Voya Financials in August 2012
and January 2013.
Sixth, Plaintiff has shown that Defendant unlawfully received $27,311.13
from D. Linsmaier’s ING / Golden American Life Insurance Company account. 
Plaintiff has (1) alleged that Defendant took unauthorized control of
D. Linsmaier’s life insurance policy and financial accounts (TAC ¶ 22), and (2)
presented evidence showing that    (i) D.
Linsmaier’s account with ING / Golden American Life Insurance Company had a
death benefit value of $27,311.13, and (ii) Defendant transferred that amount
to himself by submitting a Claimant Statement with the account holder.  (Pl. Decl., Ex. 10, pp. 10-05, 10-06.) 
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff, as successor in interest to
D. Linsmaier, is entitled to an award of compensatory damages in the amount of
$574,660.19. 
Finally, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that D. Linsmaier
suffered pain and suffering damages in the amount of $250,000 before her death
as a result of the physical abuse of Defendant.  (Pl. Supp. Decl. re Pain & Suffering, ¶¶ 1-5,
7-13; Estate of Lowrie (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 220, 226-227 [Elder Abuse
Act permits “pain and suffering damages even after the abused elder dies”];
Welf. & Inst. Code, §15657, subd. (b).)
3.     Prejudgment
Interest
Although Plaintiff requests $368,241.42 in interest, Plaintiff did not
(1) submit interest computations as required, or (2) identify a statute
authorizing the court to award interest on the economic damages proven.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd.
(a)(3).)  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not proven that she is entitled to prejudgment interest and
therefore denies the request for prejudgment interest in the amount of
$368,241.42. 
4.     Requests
for Equitable Relief
Plaintiff requests that the court (1) deem Defendant to have
predeceased D. Linsmaier for the purpose of entitlement pursuant to Probate
Code section 259, and (2) determine that Defendant is to take nothing from D.
Linsmaier’s estate.  (TAC p. 26, ¶ 10.) 
“Any person shall be deemed to have predeceased a decedent . . . where
all of the following apply: [¶] (1) It is proven by clear and convincing
evidence that the person is liable for physical abuse, neglect, or financial
abuse of the decedent, who was an elder or dependent adult.  [¶] (2) The person is found to have acted in
bad faith.  [¶]  (3) The person has been found to have been
reckless, oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious in the commission of any of
those acts upon the decedent.  [¶]  (4) The decedent, at the time those acts
occurred and thereafter until the time of his or her death, has been found to
have been substantially unable to manage his or her financial resources or to
resist fraud or undue influence.”  (Prob.
Code, § 259, subd. (a).) 
The court has found, as set forth above, that Plaintiff alleged facts
establishing that Defendant, while acting in bad faith and engaging in conduct
that was malicious and oppressive, is liable for the physical abuse and
financial abuse of D. Linsmaier.  (Prob.
Code, § 259, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3).)  The court has also found that D. Linsmaier, at
the time that the acts occurred, was unable to substantially manage her
finances or to resist the undue influence of Defendant as a result of her
diagnosis of advanced dementia and her impaired cognitive ability.  (Prob. Code, § 259, subd. (a)(4).)  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that she is entitled to
an order deeming Defendant to have predeceased D. Linsmaier to the extent
provided by Probate Code section 259, subdivision (c).  
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for an order that “any such
property the Defendant came into possession, transferred the title to his name
or become entitled to shall revert back to Decedent’s estate” because (1)
Probate Code section 259 does not appear to authorize such an order, and (2)
Plaintiff did not request that relief in the Third Amended Complaint. 
5.     Request
for Dismissal of Doe Defendants
The court finds that Plaintiff has dismissed all parties against whom
judgment is not sought as required.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7); June 6, 2024 Req. for Dismissal.) 
6.     Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the court grants Plaintiff’s request
for court judgment by default against Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff, as
the successor in interest to D. Linsmaier, in the total amount of $824,660.19. 
The court notes, however, that Plaintiff appears to be requesting
default judgment be entered in favor of herself, as an individual.  However, Plaintiff only has standing to
assert causes of action under the Elder Abuse Act as successor in interest to
D. Linsmaier, and does not have standing to assert individual claims against
Defendant under this statute.  (Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15657.3, subd. (d)(1) [successor in interest of a decedent
elder may commence an action under the Elder Abuse Act].)  Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff requests
default judgment in her favor as an individual, the court denies that request. 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff Deeanna Linsmaier, as an individual
and on behalf of Donna Marie Linsmaier a/k/a Dawn D. Linsmaier’s motion to seal
as follows. 
            The court orders that the unredacted
versions of the following documents, lodged with the court by plaintiff Deeanna Linsmaier, as an individual
and on behalf of Donna Marie Linsmaier a/k/a Dawn D. Linsmaier on or around
June 12, 2024, shall be filed under seal:       
 (1) “Declaration of DeeAnna
Linsmaier in Support of Application for Default Judgment Pursuant to CCP
§585(d), and Request for Equitable Relief Under Probate Code §259(a),” and                    (2) “Plaintiff’s Brief
Summary of the Case in Support of Application for Default Judgment.”
            The court orders plaintiff Deeanna Linsmaier, as an individual
and on behalf of Donna Marie Linsmaier a/k/a Dawn D. Linsmaier, no later than
September 13, 2024, to file a revised redacted version of the “Declaration of
DeeAnna Linsmaier in Support of Application for Default Judgment Pursuant to
CCP §585(d), and Request for Equitable Relief Under Probate Code §259(a)” that
