And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The plaintiff has previously filed documents with the court without redacting certain information. The court notes that the plaintiff has alleged causes of action for financial abuse of an elder, including claims that the defendant obtained the elder's property through undue influence. The court discusses these causes of action, noting that the allegations of undue influence are sufficient to support each financial elder abuse cause of action. The court also notes that the definition of elder abuse does not encompass claims for fraud, and that the plaintiff's allegations do not appear to establish that the defendant took the elder's property with the intent to defraud her.
