And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Intervenor's motion for leave to intervene in the products liability complaint filed by Plaintiff Stacey Taylor against defendants Wheels Labs Operations Inc., Wheels Labs Inc., Apollo Syndicate 1969, and AON UK Limited. The Intervenor, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, seeks to intervene to protect their pecuniary interest as insurers of defendant Wheel's Labs, Inc. The judge finds that the Intervenor has satisfied the legal standards for intervention, including having a direct and immediate interest in the litigation, not enlarging the issues in the case, and having reasons for intervention that outweigh any opposition by the existing parties. The judge notes that no opposition has been filed to the Intervenor's motion.
