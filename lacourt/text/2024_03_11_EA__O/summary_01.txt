And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel the deposition of Bobby Cagle, the director of DCFS, on the grounds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Cagle has unique or superior personal knowledge of discoverable information. The plaintiff seeks to depose Cagle on six subject matters, including comments he made to the press, protocol for applying for a removal order, and policies and procedures related to executing a removal order. However, the judge finds that Cagle was not involved with matters before Noah's death, but only after his death, and that the plaintiff has failed to show that Cagle has knowledge or was involved in Noah's case. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's own arguments undermine their position that Cagle has knowledge or was involved in Noah's case.
