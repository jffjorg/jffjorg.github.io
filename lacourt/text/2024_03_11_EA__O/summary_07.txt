And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's application for default judgment, but reduces the award for attorney fees from $14,906.50 to $9,750. The court finds that the original award was unreasonable and that the hours spent on the case were largely duplicative. The judge also requests that the plaintiff file an amended proposed judgment. The case arises from a breach of a lease agreement between the plaintiff, Best Western Summit, Inc., and the defendants, CPI Security Corp. and Joseph Carmona. The plaintiff seeks judgment for $66,735.13, which includes damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees. The court's decision is based on the parties' lease agreement, which states that each tenant is individually and completely responsible for the performance of all obligations. The judge cites relevant case law, including Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University and Ketchum v. Moses, in support of the decision.
