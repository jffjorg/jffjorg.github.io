And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motions filed by the parties and has reached a tentative ruling. The parties involved are Shandong Linglong Tyre Co., et al. and the plaintiff, who has alleged that the defendants sold and distributed products that competed with a California corporation. The Judge has considered the evidence presented and has determined that the defendants may have purposefully availed themselves of California by competing with a California corporation. The Judge has also considered the laws governing specific jurisdiction and has determined that the plaintiff has not established a sufficient connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.

The Judge notes that the defendants' motion to dismiss the federal case was not opposed by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has not identified any adequate link between the state and the non-resident claims. The Judge also cites several case law decisions, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. Ct. and Walden v. Fiore, to support its determination.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after oral argument and further consideration of the evidence.
