[1] Plaintiff is named as an “occupant” of the unit. 
 


[2] Demurrer notes
damages date back to 2013 (Demurrer p. 6:6-7 [“What this means is Plaintiff’s
purported injuries dating back 3 years (01/03/20), 8 years (2015), and 10
years (2013) are time-barred. (Complaint, ¶¶ 11-16)”], emphasis added), but
the court sees no reference 2013 in the complaint. 
 


[3] “If a demurrer demonstrates that a pleading is untimely
on its face, it becomes the plaintiff's burden “even at the pleading stage” to
establish an exception to the limitations period.” (Fuller v. First Franklin
Financial Corp. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 955, 962.) Here, despite the
pleading on its face indicating that the claims are time-barred, Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition to meet her burden. Additionally, as a fundamental
change in the facts would save the pleading, there is no possibility of
curing the defect by amendment, meaning leave to amend would be futile. Furthermore,
as leave to amend is within the discretion of the court, the court would
exercise its discretion to deny leave to amend due to Plaintiff’s, effectively,
frivolous filing of this complaint. 


[4] (See 11/16/23 Minute Order in Case
22STCV21615 [“To the extent Plaintiff seeks to amend the Complaint to allege a
cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, Plaintiff
has not explained why she has waited 16 months to raise this new cause of
action. (See Le Mere v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th
237, 245 [finding no abuse of discretion when the plaintiff failed to explain
14- month delay in raising a new cause of action in amended pleading].) Without
any such explanation, the Court finds granting leave to amend to be
unwarranted.”].)
