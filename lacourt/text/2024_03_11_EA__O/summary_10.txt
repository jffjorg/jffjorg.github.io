And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant. The plaintiff's claims are time-barred, and the court finds that the plaintiff has not established an exception to the limitations period. The court also finds that the plaintiff's failure to explain a 16-month delay in raising a new cause of action is a sufficient reason to deny leave to amend the complaint. The court notes that the plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the demurrer and that leave to amend would be futile.
