Background
 
This is a
habitability case. 
 
On December
28, 2023, Plaintiff Aurora Mora filed suit against Defendants AAENESON
PROPERTIES dba WALNUT PARK APARTMENTS, P.F.C. ENTERPRISES, INC. dba ALLEN
PROPERTIES asserting the following causes of action (COAs): 1.     BREACH OF WARRANTY OF HABABILITY
(CONTRACT) 2.     BREACH OF WARRANTY OF HABABILITY
(STATUTE) 3.     BREACH OF CONTRACT 4.     NUISANCE
On February
8, 2024, the instant demurrer and motion to strike were filed. 
 
There is a notice of related case: 22STCV21615. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants
demur to the first three causes of action on the grounds that they are
uncertain, fail to state sufficient facts, and are barred by the SOL. 
 
The court agrees with Defendants on all points. 
 
The court
first turns to the complaint to provide the relevant facts: 
 
Plaintiff has
been a tenant of unit 4D since 2015 (¶7); “For at least 10 years,
Defendants, while under their control, failed to provide a habitable residence
for Plaintiff and other tenants;” (¶11, emphasis added); “On January 3, 2020,
the unsafe condition of unit 4D’s exterior floors, stairways, and railing
caused Plaintiff to fall down such stairs and suffer severe spinal injuries and
a head injury;” (¶13, emphasis added). In sum, since 2015 (for nearly 10
years), the property has been inhabitable. With problems existing since
2015, the first three COAs are barred by the SOL. 
 
a.     Contract Claims 
 
Here, though
there is a written contract (Complaint, Ex. A), Plaintiff is not a signatory.
(Demurrer p. 5.) Instead, the contract/lease is signed between Pedro Hernandez
and Allen Properties. (See Complaint p. 10 of 37 of PDF.)[1]
Consequently, at best, Plaintiff can only allege breach of an oral contract,
if any, which carries a two-year SOL period. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 339, 337,
337.2 [The statute of limitations for breach of contract is two years for an
oral contract and four years for a written contract or written lease.].) With a
2-year SOL, Plaintiff can only complain of any breach dating back to two years
before her Complaint was filed, or as far back as December 23, 2021.
(Demurrer p. 6.) Here, however, Plaintiff claiming damages from injuries dating
well beyond December 23, 2021 (head injury dated 01/03/2020 and general
lack of habitable conditions dated to 2015).[2]
 
For these
reasons, as the claims are barred by the SOL, Defendants’ Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s first and third COAs are SUSTAINED WITHOUT leave to amend.[3]

 
b.     Statutory Claim
 
A claim for
breach of implied warranty of habitability under Civil Code section 1941 is
subject to the one-year limitation period prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure
section 340. (Demurrer p. 6.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s second cause of action is “[a]n action upon a statute for a penalty
or forfeiture” and subject to the one-year limitations period set forth in Code
of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (a). For reasons discussed above,
the claim is time-barred. 
 
Therefore,
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer as to the 2nd COA WITHOUT leave to
amend. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the demurrer is sustained in its entirety without leave to amend. 
 
Motion to
Strike
 
Defendants
move to strike portions of the complaint that relate to the 1/3/2020 injury.
Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff “suffered … severe spinal injuries and a head
injury as a result of Defendants failing to ensure the Property’s floors,
stairways, and railings were maintained in good condition and repair at all
times while she resided at the Property.” (Complaint p. 2.) Based on said
damages, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages. 
 
However, Plaintiff’s January 3, 2020, personal
injury claim is barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. (MTS p. 2.) 
 
In Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. 22STCV21615, Plaintiff filed suit against the
same Defendants (identical parties) for property damage and personal
injury in connection with her trip and fall on January 3, 2020 at the premises
located at 2817 Valley Blvd., West Covina, CA 91792 (the same property).
The problem: on 12/18/23, the court entered judgment for Defendants after
finding that the claim was claim was time-barred by the two-year statute of
limitations pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1. 
 
Now, in
this action, Plaintiff seeks to re-litigate her time-barred trip and fall
personal injury of January 3, 2020, under the guise of breach of warranty of
habitability/breach of contract. This is very purpose res judicata: to “prevent[] relitigation of the
same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in
privity with them.” (MTS p. 5, quoting Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. (2002)
28 Cal.4th 888, 896.)
 
Under CCP
section 436, the court has discretion to strike “out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff seeks to circumvent the prior court’s ruling by re-litigating a claim
and issue that has already been adjudicated to judgment.[4]

 
Therefore,
the court STRIKES the allegations regarding Plaintiff’s January 3, 2020
personal injury claim WITHOUT leave to amend. 
 
As for
punitive damages, Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants intended to injure
her. (See MTS p. 7, quoting Ebaugh v. Rabkin (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 891,
894 [“There must be an intent to vex, annoy or injure. Mere spite or ill will
is not sufficient; and mere negligence, even gross negligence is not sufficient
to justify an award of punitive damages.”].) At most, what is alleged is
negligence, but that is an insufficient basis to justify an award of punitive
damages under. (Id. at p. 894.) Moreover, any allegations of malice are
pled in a conclusory manner, which is insufficient for punitive damages. (MTS
p. 7, quoting Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872
[“[C]onclusory characterization of defendant’s conduct as intentional, willful
and fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement of ‘oppression, fraud, or
malice.’”].) 
 
Therefore, as
Plaintiff has set forth blanket conclusions of malice, oppression or fraud,
Plaintiff’s claim and prayer for punitive damages are STRICKEN without leave to
amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, demurrer is sustained without leave to amend and the MTS is granted
without leave to amend.
