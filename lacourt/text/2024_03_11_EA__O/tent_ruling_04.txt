[1] On January 21, 2022,
Plaintiffs amended their Complaint to include EMS Distributing LLC.
Specifically, against EMS, Plaintiffs allege causes of action (COAs) for
negligence, strict liability – design/manufacturing defect, strict liability –
failure to warn, product liability – negligence and failure to warn, and a
survivor action. 
 


[2] Their motion was unopposed, the
insurance paid the maximum amount, and evidence shows that if it was not for
the detached tire from Defendant Esqueda’s vehicle, then Defendant Adrianna
Jimenez would have not run over decedent. 
 


[3] According to the
motion, EMS is the seller/distributor of the wheels and Axe Wheels fulfilled
Esqueda’s order and the subject wheels. As for Esqueda, Ulloa, In and Out Tire,
and Affordable Wheel Repair, they may have at some point prior to the incident repaired,
maintained, and/or installed the subject wheel that detached from Esqueda's
vehicle
 


[4] It is unclear as to the relevance of
this party in this action.  
 


[5] Though a meet and
confer is not required for this motion, the lack of opposition(s) suggests that
had Defense Counsel informally discussed the matters with Plaintiffs and other
parties, there may have been no need to file this motion. 
 


[6] Though the court may
refer to Axe Wheels as defendant, it is only does so for brevity. It is
understood that Axe Wheels is making a special appearance (not a general
appearance) thus Axe Wheels is a specially appearing defendant.  
 


[7] The “paradigm” places where a
corporation can be “fairly regarded” as at home are its place of incorporation
and its principal place of business. (Goodyear, supra, 564 U.S. at
p. 924.) 
 


[8] Because neither plaintiff alleged any injury from work
in or related to Montana, only the propriety of general jurisdiction was at
issue in the case. (Id. at p. 413.)
 


[9]  More specifically, the corporation “operates
railroad lines in 28 States. [citation omitted]. BNSF has 2,061 miles of
railroad track in Montana (about 6% of its total track mileage of 32,500),
employs some 2,100 workers there (less than 5% of its total work force of
43,000), generates less than 10% of its total revenue in the State, and
maintains only one of its 24 automotive facilities in Montana (4%).”

12-13, citing Monkton Ins. Services, Ltd. V. Ritter, 768 F.3d 429, 432
(5th Cir. 2014) [State and federal courts throughout the country have similarly
recognized that it is “incredibly difficult to establish general jurisdiction
in a forum other than the place of incorporation or the principal place of business.”];
see also Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 627 (2d Cir.
2016) [explaining that plaintiff “bears a heavy burden when she asserts that
[defendant’s] presence in Connecticut presents such an ‘exceptional’ case”]; see
Cahen v. Toyota Motor Corp., 147 F.Supp.3d 955, 965 (N.D. Cal. 2015) [commenting that the “bar . . . is very high” to find
that a forum state can exercise general jurisdiction over a nonresident
defendant.  
 


[11] It is unclear exactly what was
discovered during discovery such that EMS claimed (in its motion for leave to
file a cross-complaint) that Axe was responsible in some way for the subject
tire. 
 


[12] As to the timeline,
as presented in the instant motion, on 2/15/2019, Lenso Wheels sold the
wheel(s) to EMS. EMS then sold the wheels to the end user, Esqueda, who
obtained fittings from EMS. On 11/12/2019, Axe Wheels was incorporated in
Arizona. On 4/30/2020, after Esqueda used the wheels for more than one year
without issue, he presented the tires to In and Out Tire for repair. The day
after, on 5/1/2020, the subject wheel detached from Esqueda’s vehicle and
struck Plaintiffs’ decedent. (See generally Motion p. 8.)
