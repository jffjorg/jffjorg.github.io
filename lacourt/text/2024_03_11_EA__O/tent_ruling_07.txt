 Case Number:  23PSCV02684    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED, but attorney fees are
reduced to $9,750.
The court requests Plaintiff file an amended proposed judgment. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from a breach of a lease agreement. 
 
On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff Best Western Summit, Inc.
filed suit against Defendants CPI Security Corp. and Joseph Carmona.[1] 
 
On November 1, 2023, default was entered against both
Defendants. 
 
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff a default judgment
application, which the court on 1/23/24 denied without prejudice. 
 
On February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant default
judgment application. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendants CPI and Carmona
for a total of $66,735.13. The break-down is as follows: $46,645.00 in damages;
$3,625.66 in prejudgment interest in 10%, $1,557.97 in costs; and $14,906.50 in
attorney fees. 
 
Previously, the court denied the application for a variety
of defects, including (1) the lack of clarity as to the individual Defendant’s
liability; (2) $9,595.50 in attorney fees was unreasonable for a simple breach
of contract case; and (3) lack of interest computation. 
 
Now, as for the first defect (liability of the individual
defendant), Plaintiff explains that both CPI and Carmona are named
“Tenants” pursuant to Plaintiff and Defendants’ lease agreement. (See
Plaintiff’s Summary of the Case.)
 
Here, pursuant to Paragraph 35 of the Parties’ lease, “If
there is more than one Tenant, each one shall be individually and completely
responsible for the performance of all obligations of Tenant under this
agreement, jointly with every other Tenant, and individually, whether or not in
possession.” (See Declaration of Kelly Stanaway, Exhibit A-5, p. 16 of 82 of
PDF.) 
 
Therefore, that defect is cured as both can the corporation
and individual defendant can be liable as they are both tenants. 
 
As for
attorney fees,[2] the
court finds them unreasonable. According
to the appellate court in Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, attorney
fees are meant to “fully compensate counsel for . . . services reasonably
provided to his or her client.” (Id. at p. 395.) “The basis for
the trial court's calculation must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to
the case.” (Ibid, emphasis added.) In assessing the actual hours spent,
when counsel presents verified time records, there is a “presumption of
credibility” such that the time records are “entitled to credence in the
absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Id. at p.
396.) That said, while a trial court abuses its discretion in “rejecting
wholesale counsels’ verified time records,” (ibid) it may deny
compensation for “inefficient or duplicative” work. (Id. at p.
394, quoting Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132, emphasis added.)
 
According to Counsel Larson, $14,906.50 is reasonable “[d]ue
to Defendants’ multiple breaches, Plaintiff has continually had to expend more
time and fees to recover its losses.” (Larson Decl., p. 2.) There is no
elaboration or explanation otherwise. 
 
But the hours are largely duplicative. The activities are largely,
if not mostly, dedicated to “communicat[ing] with others,” which includes “preparing
emails” and “email exchanges” (spanning from 12/1/22 to 2/7/24). While
Defendants may have repeatedly breached (presumably) the lease agreement, the
number of repeated billing entries regarding said breaches appears to
outnumber the breaches, impressing upon the court that the communications of
this volume are exaggerated. 
 
Thus, the court reduces the billable hours. (For
clarification, the court does not reduce the hours spent on drafting
documents.) 
 
As for the hourly rates, they are as follows: Counsel
Larson’s hourly rate is $400/hour, which he reduced for Plaintiff in or around
July 2023 to $385/hour; Counsel Moy’s hourly rate is $325/hour. 
 
Here, however, Plaintiff has not provided a discussion of
the local hourly rate to justify its hourly rate. 
Therefore, for a seemingly simple breach of lease agreement
(contracts), the court reduces the award to $325/hour. 
 
Therefore, as the docket reveals no substantive motions and
no substantive work was required in this case aside from settlement/mediation, the
court awards attorney fees in the reduced amount of $9,750 ($325/hour x 30
hours). 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the default judgment is granted,
subject to the modification above.
