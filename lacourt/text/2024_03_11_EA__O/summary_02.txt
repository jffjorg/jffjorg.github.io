And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in a case involving the death of a minor, Noah. The judge will only discuss relevant filings in the case. The minor's biological great-grandmother, Eva, and his biological siblings, AC, EC, and RC, will be referred to as the "Minor Plaintiffs." The County has a contract with Hathaway, a mental health agency, to provide services to dependent minors. The judge notes that the County has argued that an internal investigation is privileged, but the judge does not address this point. The judge also notes that Cagle is willing to be deposed about statements he made to the press and confirms that his only involvement in the case was after Noah's death. The judge denies the motion on its merits, without addressing the issue of its timeliness.
