And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Chance Berman. The demurrer was filed to the first and second causes of action in the complaint, which allege negligence and premises liability. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a cause of action against defendant Berman in his individual capacity. The judge has given plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which do not show that defendant Berman had a duty to plaintiff or breached a duty of care that caused plaintiff's injuries. The judge has also considered the legal authority and precedents cited by the parties, including Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power and Brooks v. Eugene Burger Management Corp.
