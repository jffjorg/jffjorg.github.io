This tentative ruling is issued by the Court in the case of ADF Enterprises, LTD v. Daniel J. Woods, et al. On December 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants, alleging a cause of action for Quiet Title. The Defendants disavowed any interest in the property and admitted to each allegation set forth in the Complaint.

The Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that there is no triable issue of material fact with respect to the sole cause of action for quiet title. The Court analyzed the legal standard for summary judgment and found that the Defendant had failed to present facts to negate an essential element or establish a defense.

The Court also reviewed the facts presented by the Plaintiff, including the acquisition of the property, the recognition of gross rents as income, and the execution of binding lease agreements with tenants. Based on these facts, the Court found that no triable issues of fact exist as to the title of the subject property and GRANTED the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.
