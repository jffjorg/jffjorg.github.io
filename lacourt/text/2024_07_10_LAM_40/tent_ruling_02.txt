Plaintiffs Fidel
  Hernandez Medina and Patricia Hernandez’s Motion to Tax Costs



 
Background
            Pleadings
Plaintiffs Fidel Hernandez Medina and
Patricia Hernandez (Plaintiffs) sue Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(Toyota USA) pursuant to an October 14, 2022 Third Amended Complaint (TAC)
alleging claims of (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express
Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and
(3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b). 
The claims arise from allegations that
Toyota USA has breached express and implied warranties in favor of Plaintiffs
by failing to repair, replace, or repurchase a used Toyota vehicle purchased by
the Hernandez Plaintiffs subject to express warranties through which Toyota USA
“undertook to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of Plaintiffs’
vehicle or to provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or
performance.”

Motion
to Tax Costs
Legal Standard: 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606;
Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)
Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no
discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit. (Michell
v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term “prevailing party” for costs purposes is
defined by statute to include: ¿ 
(1) The party with a net monetary recovery; ¿ 
(2) A defendant who is dismissed from the action; ¿ 
(3) A defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
recovers anything; and ¿ 
(4) A defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) 
If the party does not fall within one of these four express
categories, the court may exercise its discretion to award or deny costs. (See Lincoln
v. Schurgin (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 100, 105.)  
If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in
situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) For example, even if a
plaintiff maintains a net monetary recovery, in determining the prevailing party
in the litigation, the trial court should also consider, if applicable, the
defendant’s success on its declaratory relief claims and exercise its
discretion to allow costs or not and, if allowed, to apportion them as
appropriate. (Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures & Television (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 1107, 1142; see, e.g., Lincoln v. Schurgin, supra, 39
Cal.App.4th at pp. 104-105 [when plaintiff wins net monetary recovery but
defendant prevails in its cross-action for declaratory relief, case presents
circumstance not otherwise specified; in that case, determination of prevailing
party is matter within court’s discretion].) 
¿Allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable
in amount. An item not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor
prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the
discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably
necessary and reasonable in amount). If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) 
A verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence that
the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were necessarily incurred. (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) A party seeking to
tax costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima facie showing. (Jones v.
Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266, superseded by statute on other
grounds in Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (c)(1) [whether costs permissible from
filing of complaint or from date of 998 offer].) Mere statements unsupported by
facts are insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing that costs were
necessarily incurred. (Jones v. Dumrichob, supra, at p. 1266.)¿On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.)
Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a
question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of
discretion. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc., supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) However, because the right to costs is governed
strictly by statute, a court has no discretion to award costs not statutorily
authorized. (Ibid.) Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the
court “exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being
considered.” (Lincoln v. Schurgin, supra, 39 Cal.App.4th at p.
105.)¿ 
 
Order Striking or Taxing Costs:
GRANTED IN PART
            As a
preliminary matter, it is undisputed that Toyota USA is not seeking to recover
costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1794(d) because that statute is
limited to buyers of consumer goods. Rather, as the prevailing party in this
action, Toyota USA is entitled to recover costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 1032(a)(4) and 1033.5. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs appear to argue the
opposite. (See Reply at pp. 3-4, relying on Wohlgemuth v. Caterpillar, Inc.
(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1264.) However, this argument is not persuasive.
Code of Civil Procedure § 1794(d) does not explicitly preclude a seller of
consumer goods from recovering their costs under Code of Civil Procedure §
1032. Indeed, in Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17
Cal.4th 985, the Court rejected this argument. (Id. at p. 988 [“In this
case, plaintiff filed suit under the Song-Beverly Act, but defendants prevailed.
Defendants sought to recover their costs and expert witness fees under sections
1032, subdivision (b) and 998, subdivision (c), whereas plaintiff argued the
more specific provisions of the Act prohibited prevailing defendants from any
such recovery. We conclude defendants are entitled to their costs and expert
witness fees”].) Thus, in determining whether an award of costs should be
issued, the Court will rely on the guideline set forth under Code of Civil
Procedure § 1033.5(c).
            Here,
Toyota USA seeks $22,309.48 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1032 and
1033.5. By way of its motion, Plaintiffs seek to tax these costs in the
following categories: (1) motion and filing fees in its entirety or
alternatively $181.08; (2) deposition costs in the amount of $4,351.70; (3)
court reporter fees in their entirety; and (4) other costs and fees in the
amount of $2,338.49.
            First, Plaintiffs
argue that Toyota USA’s requested costs of $1,447.72 for motion and filing fees
should be stricken because they include attorney service fees, and Toyota USA
has failed to “correctly identify the actual court motion and filing fees
incurred.” (Motion at pg. 5.) However, this ignores the numerous invoices
enclosed and referenced by Toyota USA’s Memorandum of Costs at Attachment 1g that
identify the court motion and filing fees incurred. 
Furthermore, “ ‘[i]f the items in a
cost memorandum appear proper, the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence
the expenses were necessarily incurred by the’ prevailing party. (Citation.) To
controvert this evidence, the burden is on the objecting party to present evidence
showing the contrary. (Citation)” (Whatley-Miller v. Cooper (2013) 212
Cal.App.4th 1103, 1115.) Filing fees and electronic filing fees are recoverable
costs (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(1), (14).) Thus, it is Plaintiffs’
burden to present evidence to show why these costs should not be awarded. In
this regard, Plaintiffs identify $181.08 worth of filing fee costs that should
be taxed. (Motion at pp. 6-7.) Of these costs, the Court finds that the filing
fees associated with Toyota USA’s Motions in Limine were not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation because they had been untimely
filed. Therefore, these costs are taxed in the amount of $65.34. As to the
costs associated with unsuccessful motions, the Court finds that these costs
were not prepared merely out of convenience and are recoverable as a result.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c).) 
Second, Plaintiffs argues the
claimed deposition costs should be taxed in the amount of $4,351.70 because the
amounts are excessive and unnecessary. Recovery of deposition costs is
allowed.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(3).) Defendants point out that multiple deposition dates for the
plaintiffs had to be scheduled and rescheduled. In this instance, Plaintiffs
have failed to meet their burden to undermine the prima facie evidence that the
expenses were necessarily incurred by Toyota USA. (Whatley-Miller, supra,  212 Cal.App.4th at 1115.) 
Third, Plaintiffs contend that
Toyota USA’s claimed court reporter fees should be taxed because they are not
recoverable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1033 subd. (b)(5). (Motion at
pg. 8.) This argument is not persuasive. The Court has discretion to allow additional
costs that are reasonable in amount. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5 subd. (c)(4). Based
on the invoices submitted with its Memorandum of Costs, Toyota USA has shown
that these claimed costs were for court reporting fees during the trial. Such
expenses are reasonable in light of the understandable prudence of preserving a
record for appeal. Notably, Plaintiff has failed to submit any evidence to
suggest that the amount of these fees is unreasonable. Therefore, the Court
declines to tax this category of costs. 
Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that the
claim for other costs and expenses that include meals, copying charges, travel,
and lodging. (Motion at pp. 8-12.) The Court largely agrees that many of these
costs are either not allowed or not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation. For instance, Toyota USA seeks to recover $50.37 in FedEx charges
of trial documents and the final status conference. “Courier and messenger fees
are recoverable, at the discretion of the trial court, if they are reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation.” (Dept. of Children & Family
Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 696, as modified (July 18, 2019), reh’g
denied (Aug. 9, 2019), review denied (Oct. 23, 2019).) Because these costs are
not expressly allowed under Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5, it is Toyota
USA’s burden to establish why these costs were necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) However, the
opposition fails to articulate such a necessity. Thus, the Court taxes these
courier costs as not reasonable. 
Also, Toyota USA seeks to recover
$19.98 associated with a CARFAX report for trial, but Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5(b)(2) excludes investigation costs. Moreover, Toyota USA seeks to
recover a combined amount of $2,095.49 for meals, lodging, and travel. While it
is in the Court’s discretion to award these costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 1033.5(c)(4), they have been properly objected to, and Toyota USA
has failed to meet its burden in establishing why these costs were not merely
convenient and reasonable in amount. 
In terms of the $196.90 in costs
spent for additional copies of trial exhibits, these costs are allowed under
Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5(a)(13) and appear to be reasonable in amount.
Thus, the Court declines to tax these amounts. 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’
motion to tax costs is granted in part in the amount of $2,231.18.
Consequently, Toyota USA shall be entitled to recover $20,078.30 in costs. 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Fidel
Hernandez Medina and Patricia Hernandez’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in
part in the amount of $2,231.18. Consequently, Toyota USA shall be entitled to
recover $20,078.30 in costs.
