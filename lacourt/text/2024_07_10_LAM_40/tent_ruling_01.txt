 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Petitioner Guardian
  Ad Litem Maria Fredholm’s Expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending
  Action for Minor of Person with a Disability.



 
The named Plaintiffs bring this breach of
habitability suit against their landlords or former landlords—Defendants R.E.C.
Development, Inc. and LAN—based on allegations that the Defendants rented to
the Plaintiffs four different rental units with numerous alternate
uninhabitable conditions and that the Defendants failed—despite numerous
complaints by the Plaintiffs—to remediate these conditions in the Plaintiffs’
respective rental units, all located at 22307 Kent Avenue, Torrance, CA 90505
(“Subject Premises”).  These conditions include(d): cockroach and rodent
infestations; lack of adequate control of infestations; resulting health
problems to tenants; water leaks and intrusion; toxic mold causing mold spores
to float in the air and be inhaled by plaintiffs; holes and cracks in the
ceilings and/or interior walls; damaged and deteriorated carpeting/flooring;
inoperable heating; lack of air conditioning; lack of sanitary plumbing; lack
of fixtures in bathrooms; inoperable stoves or ovens; broken kitchen cabinets; an
unsanitary and unsafe pool; and extensive trash strewn across the common areas. 
On May 21, 2024, Guardian Ad Litem Maria
Fredholm filed with the Court an unopposed Expedited Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor
or Person with a Disability (the “Petition”) in favor of Plaintiff Pelestene
Fredholm. The Petition details a gross $50,000.00 Settlement between the
Parties, with a distribution of gross distribution $45,100.00 to each Maria
Fredholm and $4,900.00 for Pelestene Fredholm, and a final net settlement of
$3,551.41 for Pelestene Fredholm.  
 
Expedited
Petition to Approve Compromise for Minor or Person with Disability: GRANTED
 
Legal Standard: Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372, any settlement of a claim made by a minor or
adult with a disability must be approved by the Court.  (See also Prob. Code § 3600, subd. (b) [a
compromise or covenant for a disputed claim or damages, money, or other
property of a minor or person who lacks legal capacity is valid only after it
has been approved by the superior court].) ¿A petition for court approval of a
compromise of a minor or disabled adult’s compromise or settlement of a pending
action or proceeding to which this person is a party must be verified by the
petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or
disposition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rules 7.951-52.)  The petition is generally submitted on a
completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability (form
MC-350).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.)  If the Court is satisfied that
the settlement is in the best interest of the¿person, then the Court should
approve the settlement.¿¿(See Pearson v. Superior Ct.¿(2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)¿¿¿¿ 
Procedural Requirements: A
review of the instant Petition shows that it meets the requirements of
California Rules of Court, rules 7.950 to 7.955.
 
The Petitions satisfy California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.  Petitioner Maria
Fredholm submits a verified Civil Form MC-350EX seeking a settlement between R.E.C.
Development, Inc. also known as Real Estate Connection (“R.E.C., Development,
Inc.”) and Pelestene Fredholm. (See Petition, p. 7 [Petitioner
verification].)  Further, the Petition
contains a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition, in
satisfaction of California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.  The Petition details $50,000.00 in gross
settlement funds to be distributed to the Fredholm family.  (Petition, ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff Maria Fredholm is set to receive the
gross settlement of $45,100.00. 
(Petition, Attach. 12.)  Pelestene
Fredholm is set to receive a gross settlement of $4,900.00 and net compromise
of $3,551.41.  (Petition, ¶ 17(f), Attach.
12; Attach. 19(b)(4).)  Additionally, $1,225.00
of the Pelestene Fredholm’s net settlement will be used to pay attorney’s fees.  (Petition, ¶ 17(c), 14(a).) Moreover, the
remaining $123.59 will be used to pay the expenses which include mediation and
filing fees. (Petition 17(e), see also Ohn Decl. ¶ 8 [“limiting its cost
reimbursement request as to the Minor Plaintiff in the amount of $123.59”].)
 
The Petition satisfies California
Rules of Court, rule 7.951.  This
requirement provides that where a petitioner that has been represented or
assisted by an attorney in preparing the petition to compromise the claim or in
any other respect with regard to the claim, the petition must disclose specific
information, which the Petition contains as follows:
 
(1) The name, state bar number, law
firm, if any, and business address of the attorney. (Ohn Decl. p.1) [Gerald S.
Ohn, SBN 217382, The Law  Offices of
Gerald S. Ohn, APC, 800 South Figueroa Street, Suite 750 Los Angeles, CA 90017].)
 
(2) Whether the attorney has received
any attorney’s fees or other compensation for services provided in connection
with the claim giving rise to the petition or with the preparation of the Petition,
and, if so, the amounts and the identity of the person who paid the fees or
other compensation.  (Petition, ¶ 18(b)
[has not nor expects to receive]).
 
(3) Whether the attorney became
involved with the Petition, directly or indirectly, at the instance of any
party against whom the claim is asserted or of any party’s insurance
carrier.  (N/A).
 
(4) Whether the attorney represents or
is employed by any other party or any insurance carrier involved in the
matter.  (Petition ¶ 18(a), Attach.
18(a) [is representing another party, i.e., all of the plaintiffs in this
action which is the subject of this Petition]).
 
(5) If the attorney has not received
any attorney’s fees or other compensation for services provided in connection
with the claim giving rise to the petition or with the preparation of the Petition,
whether the attorney expects to receive any fees or other compensation for
these services, and, if so, the amounts and the identity of the person who is
expected to pay the fees or other compensation. 
(Petition, ¶ 17(d), Ohn Decl. ¶ 8) [is not being compensated by
another party]).)
 
(6) The terms of any agreement between
the petitioner and the attorney.  (Petition,
Attach. 14(a) [Redacted Attorney-Client Retainer Agreement].)
 
The Guardian Ad Litem Petitioner and Plaintiff satisfy
California Rules of Court, rule 7.952.  
 
The Petition states that $3,551.41
be paid or delivered to a parent of the minor on the terms and under the
conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402, without bond. The name
of the parent is MARIA FREDHOLM and her current address is P.O. Box 1783
Lynwood, CA 90262. Thus, a separate check in the amount of $3,551.41 shall be
issued to Petitioner and parent MARIA FREDHOLM. (Petition Attach. 19b(4).)
 
The Petition need not satisfy
California Rules of Court, rule 7.954. 
This rule provides the requirements for requesting the withdrawal of
funds already deposited in favor of a minor or person with a disability
pursuant to a prior compromise, which is not the case here.  (See Petition generally.)
 
The Petition satisfies California
Rules of Court, rule 7.955.  This rule
requires that the Court determine whether the attorney’s fees charged of a
minor or a person with a disability are reasonable.  Here, the Petition contains a Declaration
from Gerald S. Ohn, Esq.—the attorney who represents the Plaintiffs—indicating
that Pelestene Fredholm will be paying 25% of their $4,900.00 gross
settlement—i.e., $1,225.00—toward Mr. Ohn’s legal services.  (Petition, Attach. 14(a).)  The Court finds that a 25% recovery for the
type of action at bar is reasonable.
 
Substantive Requirements:
The Court finds that the settlement is in the best interests of Pelestene
Fredholm.  (See Pearson, supra,
202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1338.)  Pelestene
Fredholm will receive $4,900.00 of which $1,348.59 will be used for attorney’s
fees and costs. The remainding $3,551.41 will be paid or delivered to a parent
of the minor on the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code
sections 3401-3402, without bond. Thus, a separate check in the amount of
$3,551.41 shall be issued to Petitioner and parent MARIA FREDHOLM. (Petition
Attach. 19b(4).) The remaining $45,100.00 of the Settlement will be distributed
to her parent, Maria Fredholm is in the best position to care for her children
and can use the remaining proceeds of the Settlement to further the economic
welfare and physical wellbeing of Pelestene Fredholm.
 
Conclusion: Accordingly, the Expedited Petition for
Approval of Compromise is GRANTED.
Conclusion 
Guardian Ad Litem Maria Fredholm’s Petition for Approval of
Compromise for Minor or Adult with Disability on behalf of Pelestene Fredholm
is GRANTED because the Petition meets all requirements set forth in California
Rules of Court rules 7.590 to 7.595 and the Court is satisfied that the Settlement
is in the best interests of Plaintiff Pelestene Fredholm.
