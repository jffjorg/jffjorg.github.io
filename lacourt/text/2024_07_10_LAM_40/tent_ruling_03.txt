(18) failure to comply with Labor Code § 432.5.
On September 8, 2023, the parties indicated
to the Court that the case had settlement at mediation and that they were
working in good faith to finalize a settlement agreement concerning Plaintiff’s
PAGA claim. initiated settlement discussions concerning Plaintiff’s PAGA claim.

On December 20, 2023, the parties
represented that they were still working out the finalities of the settlement
agreement. 
On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff moved
for an order approving settlement under California Labor Code PAGA and entering
judgment thereon. The motion attaches the settlement agreement as Exhibit 1 to
the declaration of Michael Jones. A separate proof of service was filed on June
5, 2024 indicating service by mail of the motion and supporting papers on June
5, 2024 on the Defendants and via online filing on the California Labor &
Workforce Development Agency.
The motion is unopposed and is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement
Legal
Standard
The
PAGA is “a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756,
AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.) The statute
provides a mechanism for private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the
public benefit. (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969,
986.)  
 To incentivize employees to bring PAGA
actions, the statute provides aggrieved employees 25 percent of the recovered
civil penalties. (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (i).) The remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their
rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].” (Lab. Code § 2699, subd.
(i).) 
 In reviewing the terms of a settlement
agreement, the court determines whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and
adequate to all concerned, and not the product of fraud, collusion, or
overreaching. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th
576, 581.) Although a PAGA plaintiff need not satisfy class action requirements
(see Arias v. Superior Court, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 975),
general principles applicable to class action settlements apply equally in this
context. In the context of a class action settlement, the court considers
various factors including whether (1) the settlement is the result of arm’s
length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow
counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small. (Nordstrom
Commission Cases, supra, at p. 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer,
Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 245.) In considering the amount of
settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and necessary in
the settlement process. (Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc., supra,
at p. 250.)
Order
Approving PAGA Settlement: GRANTED.
I. Summary of Settlement
The
terms of the settlement involve approximately 328 aggrieved employees, with a
PAGA period of May 1, 2021 through July 18, 2023, a gross settlement amount of
approximately $325,000, with reductions of $108,333.33 in Plaintiff’s counsel’s
fees (representing one-third of the gross settlement amount), $10,017.82 in litigation
costs, and $4,000 in settlement administrator costs, for a net settlement of $202,649.39.
The net settlement will be distributed 75% to be paid to the California Labor
and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and 25% to the aggrieved employees, for
commensurate payment amounts of $151,987.04 and $50,662.35, respectively. The
distribution to the aggrieved employees is to be made on a pro rata basis
according to the number of pay periods worked by each PAGA member from May 1,
2021 through July 18, 2023 (the PAGA period), with the aggrieved employees
comprised of all current and former hourly-paid, non-exempt employees who were
employed by Defendant in the State of California at any time during the PAGA period.
The funding of the settlement amount will take place no later than 14 days
after the Court enters Plaintiff’s proposed order and the judgment is final.
The release under the settlement agreement narrowly applies to the civil
penalty claims brought under PAGA. (Mot., pp. 3-4; Jones Decl., ¶¶ 3, 13-15,
Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, §§ 1, 3-5.) Plaintiff Julio Lopez also represents
that he entered into a separate settlement in connection with his personal
claims, and as a result, he is not seeking a service award. (Jones Decl. ¶ 12.)

II. Fairness, Reasonableness, and Adequacy
& Fraud, Collusion, and Overreaching
Plaintiff
argues that the settlement should be found to be fair and reasonable for
various reasons: Plaintiff complied with the necessary Labor Code
administrative requirements; the settling parties reached a compromise through
arms-length negotiations; sufficient investigation and discovery by experienced
counsel to act competently in negotiating settlement; the settlement is
reasonable in light of the parties’ legal positions, the risk of continued
litigation, and the underlying purpose of the PAGA. (Mot., pp. 4-9; see Mot., Jones
Decl., ¶¶ 16-28.)
No
opposition is on file.
The
Court finds that the settlement before the Court is a result of arms-length
bargaining. A declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel explains the parties’
negotiations. The negotiations included, among other things, a determination by
Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendants faced a maximum statutory penalty estimate of
$3.66 million and a consideration of the risks of litigation and viability of
defenses to Plaintiff’s claims to determine that the gross settlement of $325,000
was fair and reasonable. (Mot., Jones Decl., ¶¶ 19-28.)
III. Proof of Service
A
proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to the LWDA at the same time that it
is submitted to the court for review and approval. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2).)
Here,
Plaintiffs provide a copy of an electronically filed June 3, 2024 Notice to the
LWDA Regarding Proposed PAGA Settlement, thus satisfying this statutory
section. (Mot., Jones Decl. ¶ 29, Ex. 5.)
IV. Administrator Appointment and Costs
The
proposed settlement contemplates using the services of Simpluris Inc. (Simpluris)
as the neutral party that will administer the settlement. (See Mot., Jones
Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, §§ 1.2, 7.1-7.4.) Simpluris is allocated
$4,000 for its services per the terms of the settlement agreement. (Id.
at § 3.2.2.)
 Simplurs itself has provided a declaration
from Eric Springer, Simpluris’ Director of Client Services, which explains the
qualifications and experience of Simpluris to be an administrator, the
protection of class data, and procedures for notice preparation and
distribution. Such distribution would include identification of the addresses
of the aggrieved employees (including by skip tracing if necessary), mailing a
notice of settlement to the aggrieved employees, and providing court-approved
notices and translations to aggrieved employees. (Mot., Springer Decl., ¶¶ 1-9,
Exs. A-C.)
The
Court GRANTS the settlement insofar as it seeks appointment of Simpluris as the
settlement administrator. Simpluris is ORDERED APPOINTED as settlement
administrator.
V. Enhancement Award
The
motion seeks no enhancement award.
VI. Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Plaintiff’s
motion seeks confirmation of $108,333.33 of the settlement agreement’s gross
settlement to Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees and $10,017.82 to Plaintiff’s
counsel’s costs. Counsel’s declaration provides grounds in support of the
requested fees and costs, including counsel’s extensive experienced in class
action and PAGA actions, counsel’s aggressive litigation approach and
sponsorship of settlement discussions, counsel’s procedural litigation efforts,
counsel’s skill and time expended on necessary tasks, the contingent nature of
the case, and other grounds for reasonability. Counsel’s declaration provides
that his firms applicable fee rate ranges from $650 to $800 per hour and that his
firm worked 162.1 hours in this action, totaling $109,880 in possible fees, which
is less than the requested amount, thus supporting reasonableness. Counsel also
explains that the $10,017.82 in costs are comprised of filing fees, expert
witness fees, mediation costs, and other costs associated with the action. (Mot.,
Jones Decl., ¶¶ 30-49; Ex. 6.)
The
Court finds that the fees sought are reasonable in light of the representations
by Plaintiff’s counsel, which are entitled to deference and adequately explain
the grounds for the fees request here. (See Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651 [fees awarded based on attorney’s representation as to
hours actually spent on contingency fee representation where no time records
were available].) The fee range provided of the various attorneys that worked
on this matter is reasonable for practitioners with extensive experience in the
Los Angeles area. (Mot., Jones Decl., ¶ 43-45.) The Court notes that the hours
spent on this action are reasonable for recovery in light of the amount of time
litigated on behalf of nearly 328 aggrieved employees under the Labor Code,
with a reasonable return on the civil penalties that could be imposed on
Defendants. (See Sections I and II above.)
The
Court thus GRANTS the settlement insofar as it relates to attorney’s fees and
costs related to Plaintiff’s counsel’s work.
VII. Discussion Conclusion
The
motion to approve PAGA settlement is thus GRANTED.
 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Julio Lopez’s Motion for Approval
of Settlement Under California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act is
GRANTED.
