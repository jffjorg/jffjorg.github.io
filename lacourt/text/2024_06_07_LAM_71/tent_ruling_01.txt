Plaintiff
Jennifer Hua’s motion for attorneys’
fees is granted in the total reduced amount of $1,303,168.00.
Defendant Western Asset Management
Company, LLC’s motion to tax Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs is granted in the
total reduced amount of $154,430.72.

 
Plaintiff Jennifer Hua (“Hua”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves for an order awarding her statutory attorneys’ fees.  (Notice of Motion Fees, pg. 2; Lab.
Code §1197.5.)  
Defendant Western Asset Management, LLC
moves for an order taxing Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs.  (Notice of Motion Tax, pgs. i-ii; C.C.P.

1.   
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
CRC Violation
CRC Rule 3.1354(b) provides, in part: “All written
objections to evidence must be served and filed separately from the other
papers in support of or in opposition to the motion. . . . Each written
objection must be numbered consecutively.” 
(CRC, Rule 3.1345(b), emphasis added.)
           Plaintiff’s
objections filed with its reply are in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1345(b) because
they are not numbered consecutively.  To
avoid confusion, this Court numbers Plaintiff’s objections for them.
 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s 5/31/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Gerald G. Knapton (“Knapton”) are overruled as
to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and sustained as to Nos. 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
Plaintiff’s 5/31/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Lindsay Ryan (“Ryan”) are overruled as to Nos.
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.
 
           Request
for Judicial Notice
           Plaintiff’s
5/31/24 request for judicial notice of the September 20, 2023, Order of Hon.
Michael P. Linfield in the mater of Contreras v. Kelly
Pipe Co, LLC (LASC Case No.
21STCV17933; 2023 Cal. Super. LEXIS 64818) is denied as not relevant.
 
Background
This is a California Equal
Pay Act (“EPA”) and FEHA case involving claims of discrimination and retaliation
in the workplace.  This matter came on
regularly for a jury trial on October 30, 2023. 
On November 22, 2023, the jury returned a special verdict in favor of
Plaintiff, awarding her $46,000 in damages, an additional $46,000 in liquidated
damages, and $20,000 in interest under the EPA, for a judgment in the total
amount of $112,000.  Judgment was entered
on January 11, 2024.  
On
February 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Defendant filed its opposition on May 24,
2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply on May 31,
2024.
 
Discussion
Labor Code §1197.5, also known as
California’s Equal Pay Act (“EPA”), provides a mandatory award of attorneys’
fees and enhanced costs to a prevailing plaintiff.  (See Lab. Code §1197.5(h).)  The California Supreme Court has affirmed
that a fee award for a successful EPA plaintiff is mandatory under the statute.
 (See Jones v. Tracy School District
(1980) 27 Cal.3d 99, 110.)
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party
because she prevailed on her EPA cause of action.  Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is
the prevailing party in its opposition, rather Defendant argues Plaintiff’s fee
petition should be denied outright because she prevailed on one part of one
claim.  For the purpose of this motion,
Plaintiff is regarded as the prevailing party and is therefore entitled to
attorneys’ fees pursuant to Labor Code §1197.5(h).
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel.  The Supreme Court of California has concluded
that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private
attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Tamar Freeze
and Robert Odell declare the following hourly rates for attorneys of Workplace
Justice Advocates and Odell Law, PLC: (a) Tamara Freeze ($750-$900 per hour); (b)
Robert Odell ($775 per hour); (c) Claudette Villicaña ($525 per hour); (d)
Zuleima Porron ($400 per hour); (e) Shirin Forootan ($500-$600 per hour); and (f)
Sharon Perez ($450 per hour).  (Decl. of
Freeze ¶¶30-34, Exh. J; Decl. of Odell ¶32-24.)  These rates are appropriate given the
attorneys’ relative experiences and qualifications.  (See id.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated her
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
Defendant challenges
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates as unreasonable but Defendant’s argument is
unavailing.  (Opposition, pgs. 7-8.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates
to be reasonable in their community of practice and do not warrant reductions.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
“The court’s
discretion in awarding attorney fees is, initially (‘absent circumstances
rendering the award unjust’), to be exercised so as to fully compensate counsel
for the prevailing party for services reasonably provided to his or her client.
The basis for the trial court’s calculation must be the actual hours counsel
has devoted to the case, less those that result from inefficient or duplicative
use of time.  [Citation.]  Then the court must adjust the resulting fee
to fulfill the statutory purpose of bringing ‘the financial incentives for
attorneys enforcing important constitutional rights . . . into line with
incentives they have to undertake claims for which they are paid on a
fee-for-service basis.’”  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 359, 395.)
Plaintiff’s counsel’s
fee recovery is based on 2,501 hours Workplace Justice Advocates, PLC, spent litigating
this case ($1,716,016.68) and 1,148.8 hours Odell Law, PLC, spent litigating
this case ($890,320.00), for a combined total of 3,649.8 hours ($2,606,336.00).
 (Decl. of Freeze ¶30, Exh. J at pg. 45;
Decl. of Odell ¶26, Exh. A.)  Defendant
argues Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billed hours were not reasonably incurred, were
block billed, vague, duplicative, and excessive, and therefore should be
cut.  (Opposition, pgs. 8-9.)  The Court has reviewed Defendant’s objections
to Plaintiff’s counsel’s billed hours and accounts for the objections in the
final lodestar determination.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is granted in the amount of $2,606,336.00.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination
The Court grants
Plaintiff’s request for lodestar multiplier in the reduced multiplier of 0.5.  Given the routine work done in this case,
aside from the complex explanation necessary to inform jurors on the duties of
a database administrator, and the results obtained, a 2.0 multiplier is not
appropriate.  Further, Plaintiff’s
minimal recovery compared to her stated litigation goal for a multi-million-dollar
recovery necessitates a 0.5 multiplier. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s final lodestar is calculated as follows:
$2,606,336.00
x 0.5 = $1,303,168.00
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total of $1,303,168.00.

2.   
Defendant’s
Motion to Tax Costs
On
January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed her memorandum of costs, requesting a total
of $256,166.51.  On February 6, 2024, Defendant
filed this motion to tax costs.  Plaintiff
filed her opposition on May 24, 2024.  Defendant
filed its reply on May 31, 2024.
 
Discussion
A court may only award costs when
authorized by statute.  (See Ladas v.
California State Automobile Association (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)  C.C.P. §1033.5 outlines which costs are
recoverable, and which are not.  Even if
a cost is generally recoverable under §1033.5, the Court may, in its
discretion, reject costs that were not “reasonably necessary to conduct . . .
the litigation” but were “merely convenient.”  (C.C.P. §1033.5(c).)
A “prevailing party” under C.C.P. §1032(a)(4),
states that a “prevailing party” occurs under the following scenarios:
“‘prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff
nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs
who do not recovery any relief against that defendant.”
Here, for the purposes of this motion,
Plaintiff is the prevailing party based on her net monetary recovery for her
EPA cause of action at trial.
Defendant objects to the following
costs in Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs:
 
1.   
Deposition
Costs (Item 4E)
Plaintiff requests $85,291.83 in
deposition costs.  Defendant moves to tax
(1) the costs and fees associated with depositions of three experts who opined
only as to damages available under FEHA and not the EPA (Lala Tagiyeva
($2,903.93), Robert Crandall ($3,231.41), and James E. Rosenberg ($5,269.03)
(collectively, “FEHA Damages Experts”)); and (2) deposition video clips for
trial ($15,484.50).
The right to recover deposition costs
is expressly authorized by C.C.P. §1033.5(a)(3).  C.C.P. §1033.5 permits the recovery of costs
for the “[t]aking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions” as
well as for “[s]ervice of process by a public officer, registered process
server, or other means.”  (C.C.P.
§1033.5(a)(3)(A), (a)(4).)  Costs are
allowable if they are “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation
rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”  (C.C.P. §1033.5(c)(2).)
Defendant’s contention that these costs
should not be awarded because Plaintiff did not ultimately prevail on certain
claims is meritless and without legal support as the matter of necessity is
viewed from the vantage point of a pretrial litigant, who does not yet know
whether or not to depose certain witnesses and their relevance for trial.  (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 132; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.). Further, courts have routinely refused to tax costs
on the ground that a deponent did not end up testifying or providing useful
testimony at trial.  (Garcia v.
Tempur-Pedic North America, LLC (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 819.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s request to tax
$85,291.83 in deposition costs is denied.
 
2.   
Expert
Witness Fees (Item 8b(5))
Plaintiff requests $36,893.75 in expert
witness fees.  Defendant moves to tax all
expert witness fees.  
Expert witness fees that are not
ordered by the court are explicitly not recoverable.  (See C.C.P. §1033.5(b).)
Although a plaintiff may be awarded
certain discretionary expert fees and costs under C.C.P. §998 if the
plaintiff makes a valid §998 offer to compromise and the Plaintiff
obtains a more favorable judgment at trial, Plaintiff cannot make any such
showing here.
On July 13, 2022, Plaintiff made a §998
offer to Defendant in the amount of $650,000, inclusive of attorneys’ fees and
costs, which Defendant rejected.  (See
Decl. of Ryan ¶3, Exh. A.)  At trial,
Plaintiff only recovered a total sum of $112,000, representing lost wages,
interest, and liquidated damages, far shy of the $650,000 demand.
Under §998(d), where a plaintiff makes
a valid §998 offer and obtains a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff is only
entitled to post-offer expert fees.  (See
C.C.P. §998(d); see also Finlan v. Chase (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 934, 940.)  Here, Plaintiff has failed to give any
specific breakdown as to the purported expert witness fees and costs she
requests, let alone the date the costs were incurred.
Accordingly, Defendant’s request to tax
$36,893.75 in expert witness fees is granted.
 
3.   
Court
Reporter Costs (Item 12C)
Plaintiff requests $12,242.90 in court
reporter fees.  Defendant moves to tax
all court reporter fees.  Here, Plaintiff
was not ordered to obtain transcripts. This cost was merely for the convenience
of Plaintiff; it was not necessary for the litigation, and is, therefore, not
recoverable.  (See C.C.P. §
1033.5(c).)
Accordingly, Defendant’s request to tax
$12,242.90 in court reporter fees is granted.
 
4.   
Other
(Item 16)
Plaintiff requests $105,294.07 in
“other” costs.  Defendant moves to tax
discovery referee fees ($68,475.00), FedEx charges ($394.73), jury consultant
costs ($15,527.50), mock jury/focus group costs ($3,812.08), lodging costs for
trial ($10,909.76), mileage/parking/transportation ($1,775.00), and a mediation
fee ($4,500).
Defendant’s request to tax the
abovementioned fees is granted.  First,
Plaintiff’s discovery referee fees must be paid according to this Court’s order
that each party pay its pro rata portion. 
(Order Appointing Discovery Referee; see Baker-Hoey v. Lockheed
Martin Corp. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 592, 605 [affirming trial court
decision to tax cost of a discovery referee where it previously ordered the
parties to split the cost of the referee].)
Second, Plaintiff’s request for $394.73
as a cost for FedEx delivery charges should be taxed as postage charges are not
recoverable under §1033.5.  (See
Ripley v. Pappadopoulos (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1616, 1627-1628 [denying
recovery of FedEx costs].)
Third, Plaintiff requests costs for a jury
consultant and a mock jury trial/focus group, but has failed to demonstrate
such costs are recoverable, necessary, or reasonable.  Plaintiff has failed to identify a single
California state court authority that would entitle her to these costs.
Fourth, Plaintiff claims counsel would
have otherwise had a three-hour commute to trial each day, but this does not
explain how her lodging was necessary for the litigation, rather than merely
convenient for the attorneys.  (See
Ladas, 19 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 775-776 [holding that local travel expenses are
not recoverable and noting that §1033.5 only authorizes travel costs to attend
depositions].)
Fifth, Plaintiff does not contest or
offer any contrary evidence that she voluntarily agreed to pay for 25% of the
mediation cost.  Plaintiff only cites to
cases that stand for the general proposition that mediation costs can be
awarded in the court’s discretion. 
           Accordingly,
Defendant’s request to tax $105,294.07 in “other” costs is granted.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to tax costs is
granted in the total reduced amount of $154,430.72.
Moving Party to give notice.
