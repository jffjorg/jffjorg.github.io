            vs.
BYTE TO BITE
  (CALIFORNIA), LLC, et al.,
                        Defendants.

[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Brian Whitaker (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant
Byte to Bite (California), LLC. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of
$9,710.32, comprising $4,000.00 in damages, $1,770.32 in costs, and $3,940.00 in
attorney fees.
The
Court notes that in the June 18, 2024 Order on Plaintiff’s previous request for
default judgment, the Court noted that “Plaintiff seeks $200.00 in ‘other’
unspecified costs. It is unclear if such unspecified costs are allowable under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.” (June 18, 2024 Order at p. 1:19-20.)
Plaintiff’s new request filed on June 26, 2024 still indicates that Plaintiff
seeks $200.00 in “other” unspecified
costs. (See Form CIV-100, Item 7(c).) It is still unclear
if such unspecified costs are allowable
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Otherwise, Plaintiff has sufficiently supported his request with
the submitted declarations and evidence. 
Plaintiff
may file a revised request for court judgment (Form CIV-100) and a revised
proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) to address the above-referenced defect. If the
foregoing defect is corrected before the hearing, the Court will grant
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.
