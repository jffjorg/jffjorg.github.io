  - "California courts are guided by the strong principle that any elapsed time other than that reasonably required for pleadings and discovery is unacceptable and should be eliminated." (Alpha Media Resort Investment Cases (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1132.)
  - "The burden is a heavy one, requiring the District to 'make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to someone else.'" (Opp. p. 9:15-17.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Covina-Valley Unified School District, has moved to stay the trial pending the outcome of two appeals. The plaintiff, Nicholas Inclan, was sexually assaulted by a teacher, Kimberly Northrop, while in school. Inclan sued the school district and Northrop for negligence and sexual battery. The district argues that the trial should be stayed because the appeals may affect the outcome of the case. However, the court finds that the district has not met its burden to show that the stay is necessary. The court notes that the appeals do not involve the same parties or facts as the current case and that the district can still defend itself without the stay. Therefore, the motion to stay the trial is denied.
