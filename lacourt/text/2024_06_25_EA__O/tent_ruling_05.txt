[1] (See Case No.
21STCV23749, Amended Complaint filed on 6/29/21, p. 3 of 44 of PDF.) However,
according to 19STCV00984, one reason that the medical board denied Plaintiff’s
license to practice in California was that Plaintiff “repeatedly engaged in
fraudulent conduct by falsely holding herself out to as a medical doctor in
California to the public (including on her website), to law enforcement, and to
the Wisconsin Medical Board, even though she did not have a medical license.”
(‘Defendants' Notice Of Motion And Motion To Transfer. Venue; Memorandum Of
Points And Authorities In Support Thereof’ p. 6 of 13 of PDF.)  
 


[2] In fact, she
urges this court of the “Urgent Need To Stop Man-Made Heart Attack in
California” (23PSCV01807.)
 


[3] As to the
insurance fraud COA, this may have been the only legally cognizable COA.
However, as observed by the ruling trial court, the FAC contained no specific
facts concerning how, when, where, to whom, or by what means any
representations or statements were made to Plaintiff but instead contained
“general allegations that Mercury tricked and fooled Plaintiff.” (See 10/7/21
Minute Order p. 5 of 8 of PDF.) 
 


[4] According to the
CDC, about in 1 in every 5 deaths is caused by heart disease.

) 
 


[5] Additionally, she
filed an amended motion for recusal on 1/7/22 re-stating what was previously
said, and she did so despite the court striking her motion. (See 12/22/21
Minute Order [“The Court has read and reviewed the above referenced motion by
plaintiff, and the Statement is stricken pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 170.4.”].)  


[6] Whether Plaintiff
was criminally charged is unclear from her vexatious litigant brief. (Brief p.
3 of 7 of PDF.) However, while reviewing filings in other cases filed by
Plaintiff, it appears that one of the many reasons that the Medical Board of
California denied Plaintiff’s license to practice medicine was because of
multiple criminal convictions. (See Case 19STCV00984, 5/20/2019 ‘Motion for
Change of Venue,’ pp. 5-6 of 13 of PDF [“In 1995, plaintiff was
convicted of theft in. Minnesota. In 2005, plaintiff received her second
conviction for assaulting a flight attendant while on a Southwest Airlines
flight from Houston to Dallas, Texas. Plaintiff punched the flight attendant in
the stomach and forearm because the flight attendant failed to provide plaintiff
with a blanket. Plaintiff received five years’ probation, and she was ordered
to participate in mental health treatment services, including anger management
classes.”].) 
 


[7] Bin Yang is the
plaintiff in all these cases based upon the same address and phone number as in
the 24PSCV00329 currently before this court. 


[8] A motion to
strike may be used to attack an entire pleading. (See e.g., Vaccaro v.
Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761.) 
 


[9] To the
extent that Plaintiff may argue that the SOL is tolled because she
voluntarily dismissed her first action (that was timely filed), that is not so.
“A plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of her action has the effect of an absolute
withdrawal of his claim and leaves the defendant as though he had never been a
party . . . When an action is willfully dismissed by the plaintiff . . . it is
as though no action had ever been filed.” (Paniguia v. Orange County Fire
Authority (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 83, 89.)
