And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute over a stay in a court hearing. The plaintiff, whose name is unclear due to a discrepancy in spelling, has filed a motion for a stay. The judge notes that the parties' requests for judicial notice are granted, and that the caption on the CC filing is incorrect. The judge also finds that the first factor in determining whether to grant a stay does not apply. The plaintiff has also argued that the likelihood of success of an unrelated appeal is a factor, but the judge finds that this is not supported by case law. The judge notes that the standards for staying a state action versus a federal action are different. The judge has reviewed the dockets and found that no oral argument has been scheduled in the related cases, which supports a showing of undue delay. The judge intends to grant the stay, citing the case law of Landis and Farmland.
