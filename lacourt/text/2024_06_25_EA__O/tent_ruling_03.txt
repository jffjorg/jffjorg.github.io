 Case Number:  22STCV16288    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANT,
FRIENDLY FRANCHISEES CORP.’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES – GENERAL, SET ONE, FROM PLAINTIFF; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND
AUTHORITIES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,680.00 is GRANTED,
but sanctions are imposed in the reduced amount of $1,050 (since
no time was spent writing an opposition and reply) and only imposed upon
Plaintiff as she is currently pro per. Sanctions are due within 20 days of this order. 
 
Background
 
This is a
negligence case. Plaintiff Vanessa Melody Singh alleges the following against
Defendants Friendly Franchisees Corporation dba Carls Junior (“Carls Junior”);
Manager Jasmine; Peco Foods, Inc.: On May 17, 2020, Plaintiff bit into a
chicken nugget that contained a metal spring. 
 
On May 1,
2022, Plaintiff filed suit.
 
On December
7, 2022, Carls Junior and Manager Jasmine filed a cross-complaint (CC) against
Peco Foods, Inc. for (1) indemnity and (2) apportionment of fault. That same
day, the defendants also filed their answer.
 
On December
15, 2023, Peco filed its answer to the CC.
 
On March 4,
2024, Peco Foods, Inc. filed its answer to the complaint. 
 
On April 15,
2024, the parties attended an IDC. 
 
On April 22,
2024, Carls Junior filed a ‘MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES – GENERAL, SET ONE, FROM PLAINTIFF; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND
AUTHORITIES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF  $ 1,680.00; DECLARATION OF JOEL S. POREMBA.’
 
On May 2,
2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.
 
On May 28,
2024, the court heard oral argument on the motion to be relieved as counsel
motion, which the court granted. Additionally, the court made the following
notes: “Order to Show Cause Re: Why the Court Should not Dismiss in its
Entirety for Lack of Prosecution is scheduled for 06/25/2024 at 09:00 AM in
Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. On the Court's own motion, the Hearing
on Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses Form Interrogatories (PER THE
COURT) scheduled for 06/05/2024 is advanced to this date and continued to
06/25/2024 at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. The Court
admonishes the parties that the Hearing on Motion to Compel Further Discovery
Responses will not be heard on the next court date - instead the matter is to
be re-scheduled after representation of the Plaintiff is resolved.”
 
Discussion
 
A motion to
compel is authorized where the party to whom the interrogatories were directed
gave responses deemed improper by the propounding party, such as an improper
objection or evasive or incomplete answers. Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.300
et seq. (Motion p. 6, citing Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court
(Granatelli Motorsports, Inc.) (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1189-1190.) 
 
According to
Carls Junior’s separate statement (SS), it seeks further responses to the
following three interrogatories:
 
FORM INTERROGATORY NO. 6.5: Have you taken any medication, prescribed or not, as a
result of injuries that you attribute to the INCIDENT? If so, for each
medication state: (a) the name; (b) the PERSON who prescribed or furnished it;
(c) the date it was prescribed or furnished; (d) the dates you began and
stopped taking it; and (e) the cost to date.
 
FORM INTERROGATORY NO. 6.6: Are there any other medical services necessitated by the
injuries that you attribute to the INCIDENT that were not previously listed?
(for example, ambulance, nursing, prosthetics)? If so, for each service state:
(a) the nature; (b) the date; (c) the cost; and (d) the name, ADDRESS, and
telephone number of each provider.
 
FORM INTERROGATORY NO. 6.7: Has any HEALTH CARE PROVIDER advised that you may
require future or additional treatment for any injuries that you attribute to
the INCIDENT? If so, for each injury state: (a) the name and ADDRESS of each
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER; (b) the complaints for which the treatment was advised;
and (c) the nature, duration, and estimated cost of the treatment.
 
As to all,
Plaintiff has “direct[ed] the propounding party to medical records which are
attached to Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s request for production of
documents concurrently served herewith.” Effectively, by referring moving
Defendant to 44-page cache of unnumbered, non-Bates Stamped documents,
Plaintiff states “go see my documents.” (See generally SS.) 
 
While section
2030.230 permits a party to refer to documents in responding to an
interrogatory, a party may only exercise this option “[w]hen in order to answer
an interrogatory, it is necessary to make a compilation, abstract,
audit, or summary of business records of a party, and such compilation,
abstract, audit, or summary does not exist or is not under the
control of the party.” (See SS, citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 784, emphasis added.) 
 
Here,
however, despite Plaintiff answering “yes” to the seemingly straight-forward
interrogatories, she is leaving the moving party to “guess” as to which
document(s), if any, aide Plaintiff in his answer. (See SS generally.)
Plaintiff’s failure to provide further responses will but only serve as a
disadvantage on a subsequent motion, such as summary judgment. (See Motion p.
8, citing Union Bank v. Sup.Ct. (Demetry) (1995) 31 CA4th 573, 580-581; Collin
v. Calportland Co. (2014) 228 CA4th 582, 592 [The responding party’s
incomplete answers can be used to satisfy the moving party’s burden on summary
judgment to show there is no evidence of a triable issue of material fact.].) 
 
Thus, the
Defendant’s Motion to Compel is granted by ordering Plaintiff to provide
further responses to Nos. 6.5; 6.6; and 6.7 per Code, answering the subsections
of each one of these interrogatories without objection. 
 
As for
sanctions, meet and confer efforts began in September 2023. Despite a few meet
and confer efforts and an IDC, Plaintiff’s then Counsel Tom Kinan represented
the responses were sufficient. Though Counsel Kinan no longer represents Plaintiff,
Plaintiff has had about one month to retain new counsel and provide responses
to three interrogatories that were propounded nearly one year ago.
Even if pro per, a pro per litigants is held to the same standards as
attorneys. (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536.) 
 
Accordingly,
as an attorney would be subject to sanctions for misusing the discovery process
(§ 2023.010(d)-(f)) so to would Plaintiff under said circumstances. Defendant
is merely attempting to prepare its case, a case which Plaintiff seemingly has
not diligently prosecuted. Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the
totality of the circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s
fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending
motion is $1,050 (i.e., $210/hour (as requested by Counsel) for 5 hours (4
hours preparing the motion and 1 hour for the hearing)).
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted.
