 Case Number:  24PSCV00329    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
(1)   Motion to Deem Plaintiff a Vexatious
Litigant is GRANTED and a prefiling order is issued. 
(2)   MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
FOR CORPORATE FRAUD is GRANTED without leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
This case
arises from a car accident that happened on 1/31/2020. 
 
On February
1, 2024, Plaintiff Bin Yang filed suit against Mercury Insurance Company
(“Defendant” or “Mercury Insurance”) for Corporate Fraud and Crime based upon
Mercury’s alleged mishandling of an insurance claim. 
 
On March 18,
2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to strike (MTS) to strike Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
On April 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition.
 
On May 6,
2024, Defendant filed its reply. 
 
On May 13,
2024, the court held its hearing regarding the MTS. The court continued the
hearing allowing for supplemental briefing regarding whether to deem Plaintiff
a vexatious litigant. According to the minute order, the parties were ordered
to file supplemental briefing on or before June 10, 2024. 
 
On May 24,
2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Notice of Related Cases.’ The filing, however, is not
a notice of related case but instead reiterates Plaintiff’s statement(s) that
Defendant is purportedly causing heart attacks. 
 
On May 28,
2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Response to Motion on Vexatious Litigant.’ That same
day, Plaintiff filed another ‘Notice of Related Cases,’ which is identical to
the 5/24/24 filing.
 
On June 10,
2024, Defendant filed a ‘Notice of Related Case’ indicating that related cases
are: 21STCV23749 (Bin Yang V. Thomas Ton; Mercury Insurance Company);
23PSCV00230 (Bin Yang V. Thomas Ton; Mercury Insurance Company). That
same day, Defendant also filed its brief re: Plaintiff Should Be Deemed a
Vexatious Litigant. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The inherent
powers of the courts are derived from the state constitution, exist even in the
absence of explicit constitutional or statutory authorization, and are not
confined by or dependent on statutory law. (Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 266-267.) For example, a
“court has inherent power, upon a sufficient factual showing, to dismiss an
action shown to be sham, fictitious or without merit, and to impose sanctions,
in order to prevent abuse of the judicial process.” (Kinney v. Clark (2017)
12 Cal.App.5th 724, 740, citing Flores v. Georgeson (2011) 191
Cal.App.4th 881, 887.) A vexatious litigant is one who abuses such judicial
process and the court may
raise the issue sua sponte. (See e.g., In re Marriae of Falcone of
Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 1005-1006; Fink v. Shemtov (2010)
180 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1164.)  
 
In relevant part, a “vexatious litigant” is a party who “[i]n any litigation while acting in propria persona, repeatedly
files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts
unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or
solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. (Code Civ. Proc., § 391, subd.
(b), subs. (3), emphasis added.)
 
Declaring a person to be a vexatious
litigant has two possible consequences: 
 
i.          
The
defendant can make a motion to have the court require the plaintiff to furnish
security in a pending action; if the plaintiff does not do so, the action must
be dismissed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
391.1, 391.6.)

The court on its own motion, or
     on a party’s motion, may enter a prefiling order against the person
     requiring the person to first obtain permission of the presiding judge
     before filing any litigation. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 391.7, subd. (a).) “Disobedience
     of the order by a vexatious litigant may be punished as a contempt of
     court.” (Ibid.) 

Discussion
 
Before
turning to the merits of the motion, the court raises two prefatory points. 
 
First, to
make an adequate record, it is incumbent on the
court to make substantive findings as to the frivolous or harassing nature of
the litigant's actions. To make such a finding, the court looks at the content
of the filings as indicia of the frivolousness of the litigant's claims.
Inherent in such inquiry is to determine whether, at least, a claim
warranted under existing law or, if not, it can be supported by a “good faith
argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of the existing law.”
(Rules of Prof. Conduct Rule 3.1 [Meritorious Claims and Contentions].) 
 
Here, as will be depicted below, all of
Plaintiff’s actions and filings are beset by incoherent statements. And deeming them as statements is a
generous characterization. Plaintiff is not conveying any facts, views, or
opinions. Instead, throughout, Plaintiff meditates with ceaseless agitation against
various parties. 
 
Thus, absent asserting cognizable legal claims,
the task of determining the frivolousness of the litigant’s claims is
automatically satisfied by the unintelligible statements. 
 
Second and
lastly, the court emphasizes the simple facts of this case. This case arose
from a minor car accident. The driver was exiting a parking space
in front of his residences and sideswiped the front of Plaintiff’s vehicle.
(Defendant’s brief p. 2:3-6.) According to Plaintiff’s own various complaints,
the repair cost about $3,600 with a $1,000 deductible. There are no
allegations, let alone evidence, of emergency care at the time of the accident,
broken bones, or a totaled vehicle. Despite sounding in negligence (e.g.,
negligence against the driver and perhaps negligence against Mercury for its handling
of Plaintiff’s insurance claim), Plaintiff attempts to hold Defendant Mercury criminally
liable. Not only do
Plaintiff’s assertions grossly deviate from any cognizable claims but the
purported injuries more seriously question the sincerity of
Plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff, though an “outstanding doctor”[1]
alleges Defendant has “tortured her physically and psychologically”
abused her and caused her to suffer two “Mercury-made heart attack[s].”
(See FAC 23PSCV00230 p.7 ¶3-4, emphasis added.)[2]
Apparently, according to Plaintiff, Mercury Insurance is causing heart attacks
in this country. 
 
With that, the court now turns to each of the three
cases (and others unrelated to Mercury Insurance), which when read together,
unequivocally demonstrate Plaintiff’s campaign of frivolous filings via
incoherent statements and frivolous tactics by filing and dismissing cases.
 
1.     First Case: LASC Case No. 21STCV23749
(Bin Yang v. Thomas Ton; Mercury Insurance Company) filed on 6/25/2021
and dismissed by Plaintiff on 1/12/2023. 
 
In this case,
Plaintiff initial form Complaint lists COAs for (i) Motor Vehicle, (ii)
Negligence, (iii) General Negligence, (iv) Insurance Fraud,[3]
and (v) Manslaughter for injuries arising from the accident. Aside from the
fact that the amended complaint fails to adhere to any pleading standards such
as Section 425.10(a)(1)’s requirement that a
statement of the facts constituting
the cause of action be presented in ordinary and concise language, some of
Plaintiff’s “allegations” are as follows:
 
-       
“Mercury
set Plaintiff up, totaled her, tortured her with additional challenges, abuse,
anger, worsened her injuries.” 
-       
Defendant
“threaten[ed] her life” 
-       
Defendant
“nearly ended Plaintiff’s life, career, and business”
-       
Defendant
“treat[s] human like shits.”
 
However,
despite the trial court in its 10/7/21 ruling explaining that manslaughter is a
criminal cause of action, and Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she can bring
this claim as a private cause of action such that the COA fails as a matter of
law, Plaintiff again asserts that COA in other filings. 
 
Not only was
the FAC and opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike replete with
disjointed statements, but Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration and pertinent
papers were equally fatally uncertain. Aside from the motion for
reconsideration failing to set forth “new” or “different” matter (See 11/16/21
Minute Order), the motion provides statistics about heart disease in the United
States. (See 10/18/21 ‘Motion to Reconsider Plaintiff’s Motion to Quash and
Oppositions to Ton’s Demurrers; Request Punitive Damages & Default Entry on
Mercury Insurance Company’ (“Motion for Reconsideration”), p. 7 of 26 of PDF). Putting
aside the inaccuracy of her statistic that that 1 in every 4 deaths in the
United States happens due to heart disease,[4]
its relevance is so unfounded that it is frivolous. Continuing in her pattern
of taking great concern with heart health, Plaintiff continues to state that
“without a powerful heart” (due to Mercury’s purported manslaughter), she
“could easily become a living dead, an easy target for COVID-10, and cost
millions of healthcare dollars and disability benefits.” (See 10/18/21 Motion
for Reconsideration p. 8 of 26 of PDF.) Again, to imply that she is a zombie is
a frivolous argument found in a frivolous filing. But the statements do not
stop there. 
 
On December
21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for the trial Judge to recuse herself
because, allegedly, Judge Mori was a partner at Perkins Coie which is a firm
that “ha[s] been hacking Plaintiff’s business like crazy.” (See 12/21/21 Motion
to Recuse, p. 3 of 17 of PDF.)[5]
Echoing the court in In re Marriage of Deal (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 613,
Plaintiff “clearly considers [herself] aggrieved
by our judicial process. That is no excuse, however, for resorting to this sort
of [] language, which has no place in our courthouses or communities. It
degrades our institution while also wasting its valuable resources.” (Id. at
p. 617.) 
 
Ultimately, after an unsuccessful appeal (See 12/30/2022 filing),
Plaintiff dismissed the action without prejudice on 1/12/2023. 
 
But she resumed her frivolous tactics with another seemingly identical action.
 
2.     Second Case: LASC
Case No. 23PSCV00230 (Bin Yang v. Thomas Ton; Mercury Insurance Company)
filed on 1/26/2023 and dismissed on 12/06/2023. 
 
The complaint makes similar allegations, but also includes the
following:
 
-       
Plaintiff
asked Mercury’s CEO and adjuster “to stop the killing again and again”
(Complaint p. 7 of 68 of PDF)
-       
Plaintiff’s
medical records have “proven” that Mercury (and Ton) caused Plaintiff the heart
attack. 
-       
“Plaintiff
worked day and night to try Eastern medicine and her 6Q expertise to beat the 1st
Mercury-made heart attack and associated post-traumatic stress syndrome. (p. 6
of 68 of PDF.) 
-       
Mercury
“threaten[ed] her with a 2nd Mercury-made heart attack.” (p. 5 of 58
of PDF.) 
-       
“Unlike
George Floyd, Plaintiff can still breathe.” (p. 8 of 68 of PDF.) 
 
On 4/19/23,
the court sustained Mercury’s demurrer and allowed Plaintiff file a First
Amended Complaint as to the 1st Cause of Action only (Personal Injury) on or
before 05/09/2023. On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a FAC that was not in
compliance with the court’s 4/19/23 order. Plaintiff’s 7/13/23 was also not
compliance with the court’s subsequent minute order. After denying Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration (as it failed to set forth new evidence but merely regurgitated
all previous arguments), the court dismissed the action on 12/6/23. Plaintiff’s
appeal was dismissed as she was in default. (See 4/22/24 and 6/6/24 filings.) 
 
3.     Third Case/Instant Case: 24PSCV00329
 
Though a new
case and though she asserts new COAs for corporate fraud and crime, the very
same allegations made in her previous complaints are realleged. 
 
In her vexatious
litigant brief, she continues to make references to heart attacks, torture, and
harm. But she adds more unfounded, unsubstantiated, irrelevant, immaterial, and
frivolous arguments. Plaintiff alludes to “break-ins” that happened in
August 2022, a past head injury she experienced in 1997 and another injury in
2018, that all are alleged to be linked.[6]
The statements are indecipherable. 
 
Overall, as shown above, the record shows that the litigant's activities
are numerous and frivolous. Plaintiff’s plea that this court “stop man-made heart attack” is outside
the purview of what it can and does do which is adjudicate matters. (Brief p. 5
of 7 of PDF.) If the over 40 filings in the three related cases are
insufficient to illustrate the vexatious nature of Plaintiff and her unfounded
statements, Plaintiff has filed more frivolous cases.[7]

-

Malpractice).
 
All in all,
in her brief, Plaintiff asserts that she is “unsure what made the court raise
the issue of vexatious litigant.” (Brief p. 2:2-3.) The foregoing provides the
answer.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing—as Plaintiff has filed an exorbitant number of cases that are all unsupported
by sound facts, allegations, or evidence—the court deems Plaintiff a vexatious
litigant. As permitted by section 391.7, the
court enters a prefiling order prohibiting Plaintiff from filing any new
litigation in propria persona without prior
leave of the presiding judge. 
 
Motion to
Strike
 
As for the
motion to strike, Defendant Mercury seeks to strike in its entirety and dismiss
Plaintiff’s complaint[8]
of corporate fraud and crime on three grounds: (i) Mercury is not a proper
defendant because Plaintiff’s use of Penal Code section 186.11 involves a criminal
proceeding and action against a person (not an entity); (ii) a
direct action against Defendant is precluded because liability insurance is not
a contract for the benefit of the injured party so as to allow it to sue the
insurer directly (Motion p. 6, citing Royal Indemnity Co. v. United Enters.,
Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194, 205); (iii) Plaintiff’s action is barred
by res judicata because the court entered judgment in the case of 23PSCV00230
dismissing Plaintiff’s SAC without prejudice and Plaintiff’s own dismissal of
her 21STCV23749 case; and (iv) Plaintiff’s new complaint is barred by the SOL. 
 
As already
laid out above, this complaint again pleads the same statements as were set
forth in her previous actions. Thus, the action is barred by res judicata. 
 
The action is
also barred by the SOL. Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1 provides for a
2-year SOL. Plaintiff’s latest complaint, filed on February 1, 2024, was not
filed within two years of the subject January 31, 2020 accident and is,
therefore, barred by the statute of limitations. (Motion p. 17.)[9]
 
Based on the
foregoing, the MTS is granted. As for leave to amend, for the reasons set forth
in the vexatious litigant discussion, leave to amend is DENIED.
