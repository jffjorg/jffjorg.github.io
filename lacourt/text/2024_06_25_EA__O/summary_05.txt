And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the case of Bin Yang, who is suing Mercury for insurance fraud and license to practice medicine. The judge notes that Yang repeatedly engaged in fraudulent conduct, including falsely holding herself out as a medical doctor, and was denied a license to practice medicine in California. Yang has also been criminally charged and convicted multiple times. The judge is concerned about Yang's vexatious litigation and notes that she has filed numerous lawsuits, including one that was voluntarily dismissed. The judge is also considering Yang's motion to strike and motion to transfer venue. The case is complex and involves multiple legal issues, including the statute of limitations and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. The judge will need to carefully consider the evidence and arguments presented by both sides in order to make a decision.
