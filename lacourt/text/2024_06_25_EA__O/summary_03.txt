And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a negligence case where the plaintiff, Vanessa Melody Singh, alleges that she bit into a chicken nugget that contained a metal spring at a Carls Junior restaurant on May 17, 2020. The defendant, Friendly Franchisees Corporation dba Carls Junior, has filed a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, seeking information about medical treatment and services related to the incident.

The court has granted the motion, ordering the plaintiff to provide further responses to three interrogatories. The court has also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $1,050, as the plaintiff has failed to provide further responses despite having had ample opportunity to do so. The court notes that the plaintiff is currently representing herself and is held to the same standards as an attorney.

The court has also scheduled an order to show cause for June 25, 2024, to determine why the case should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution.
