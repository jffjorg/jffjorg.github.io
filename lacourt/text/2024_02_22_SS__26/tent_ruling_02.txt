Discussion
 
The Motion to
Reclassify is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040,
which allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an action
within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) If the motion is made after the time for the
plaintiff to amend the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case
is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for not
seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) In Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court
held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to limited only if
it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily
be less than $25,000. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.) 
 
In Ytuarte v.
Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278, the Court of Appeals
examined the principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to
reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an
“unlimited” case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiffs’ burden is to present evidence to demonstrate
a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must
review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is
obtainable.” (Ibid.) 
 
As the instant Motion was filed after the time to amend the
complaint, Plaintiff must show both good cause for the timing of the request
and that the case is incorrectly classified. First, Plaintiff argues that the
Complaint was incorrectly classified as limited due to the clerical error of
Plaintiff’s paralegal, Jack Ingram. (Motion, p. 1:6-9.) The declaration of Jack
Ingram is attached to the Notice of Errata filed on December 1, 2023 and states
that the boxes for limited jurisdiction and amount demanded were incorrectly
checked. (Notice of Errata, filed 12/01/23, ¶¶4-7.) This declaration alone,
however, does not show a possibility that Plaintiff’s damages exceed
$25,000.00. It simply demonstrates that the paralegal did not complete the form
Complaint as directed by Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues in the reply that her
damages included rent for a new apartment, moving costs, and damages for
discrimination. However, the Reply does not cite the relevant parts of the
Complaint that allege discrimination, nor attach evidence of the amount of
these damages. 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that
reclassification of the action is appropriate.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Samara
A. Weiner’s Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
