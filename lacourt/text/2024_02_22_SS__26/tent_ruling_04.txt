 Case Number:  23STLC06375    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  26  Howard  v. Veros Credit, LLC, et al.MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST  FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS(CCP §§ 2031.310; 2033.290) TENTATIVE  RULING:   Defendant Veros Credit, LLC’s Motion for Order Compelling  Further Responses to Request for Admission, Set One, and Request for Sanction  is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF ANDREA HOWARD IS TO SERVE FURTHER VERIFIED RESPONSES TO REQUEST  FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS  ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $700.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE  OF THIS ORDER. SANCTIONS STAYED TWENTY DAYS AND MAY BE PERMANENTLY STAYED UPON DISCOVERY COMPLIANCE    Defendant Veros Credit, LLC’s Motion for Order Compelling  Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request  for Sanction is DENIED.     ANALYSIS:   Plaintiff Andrea  Howard (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract against  Defendant Veros Credit, LLC (“Defendant”) on October 4, 2023. Defendant filed  an answer on November 9, 2023. On January 12, 2024, Defendant filed the instant  (1) Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses to Request for Admissions,  Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion for Order Compelling Further  Responses to Request for Production, Set One, and Request for Sanctions. No  opposition has been filed to date.   Discussion   Notice of the  motion to compel further must be given “within 45 days of service of the  verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later  date to which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in  writing,” otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further  response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c); § 2033.290, subd. (c).) The  45-day deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)  58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409.) Following service of Plaintiff’s discovery  responses on December 1, 2023, Defendant timely filed the instant Motions on  January 12, 2024. (Motions, Naples Decl., ¶3 and Exh. 2.)    Also, the Motion must  be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,  subd. (b)(2).) The supporting declarations demonstrate an effort by defense  counsel to obtain further responses from Plaintiff after service of the  original responses. (Motions, Naples Decl., ¶4 and Exh. 3.) The meet and confer  requirement, therefore, is satisfied.    Finally, Cal. Rules  of Court Rule 3.1345 requires all motions or responses involving further  discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the  response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further  responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) Alternatively, “the court  may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request  and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b)(2).) The  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions, Set One, is accompanied  by a separate statement. (Separate Statement, filed 01/12/24.) However, the Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is  not. Nor does the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, demonstrate  why Plaintiff’s responses are insufficient under the moving statute. (Motion,  p. 5:16-28.) The Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production  of Documents, Set One, therefore, is denied.    Regarding to Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions, Set One,  Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 states in relevant part:    On  receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the propounding party may  move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems  that any of the following apply:   (1)  An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete.   (Code Civ. Proc., §  2033.290, subd. (a)(1).) Defendant moves to compel further responses to Request  for Admissions, Nos. 1-7, which ask Plaintiff to admit statements about the  subject contract and their contact information. (Separate Statement, p. 3.)  Plaintiff’s responses are not verified and do not answer the substance of the  requests, nor assert objections, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section  2033.210. Instead, the responses confusingly state that Plaintiff accepts an  unknown offer to produce communications between the parties. The Motion  demonstrates that Plaintiff’s responses to Requests for Admission, Set One, are  incomplete. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to an order  compelling Plaintiff’s further responses. Sanctions are appropriate and have  been properly noticed. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) However,  the amount sought is excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, Plaintiffs’  request for monetary sanctions is granted in the amount of $700.00 based on two  hours of attorney time billed at $320.00, plus $60.00 in costs. (Motion, Naples  Decl., ¶7.)    Conclusion   Defendant Veros Credit, LLC’s Motion for Order Compelling  Further Responses to Request for Admission, Set One, and Request for Sanction  is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF ANDREA HOWARD IS TO SERVE FURTHER VERIFIED RESPONSES TO REQUEST  FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
