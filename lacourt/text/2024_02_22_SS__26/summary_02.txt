Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Samara A. Weiner's Motion to Reclassify the action from limited to unlimited. The Motion was filed after the time to amend the complaint, and the Plaintiff must show both good cause for the timing of the request and that the case is incorrectly classified. The Plaintiff argues that the Complaint was incorrectly classified due to a clerical error by the paralegal, but the declaration of the paralegal does not demonstrate a possibility that the damages exceed $25,000.00. The Plaintiff's reply does not provide sufficient evidence of the damages, and therefore, the Motion is denied.
