And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Veros Credit, LLC's motion to compel further responses to its request for admissions, set one, and ordered the plaintiff, Andrea Howard, to serve further verified responses within 20 days. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to pay sanctions of $700.00 to defense counsel within 20 days. The sanctions are stayed for 20 days and may be permanently stayed upon discovery compliance.

The judge denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to its request for production of documents, set one, because the motion was not accompanied by a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses to the requests for admissions were incomplete and did not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.210.
