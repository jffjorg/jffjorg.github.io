 Case Number:  22STLC05554    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  26  The Hinds Law Group, APC v. California Company et al. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (1)(CCP § 437c)TENTATIVE RULING:   Plaintiff Hinds Law Group, APC’s Motion for
Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication with respect to
Defendant Family Medical Associates, Inc., is DENIED.  ANALYSIS: Plaintiff The Hinds Law Group (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for breach of retainer agreement and
common counts against Defendants California
Company, LLC (erroneously sued as Defendant California Company) (“Defendant
CC”) and Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. (“Defendant FMA”) on August 22, 2022. Defendants filed an answer on
October 13, 2022. Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication
against Defendant CC on June 26, 2023. The Motion for Summary Adjudication was
denied without prejudice on August 21, 2023. (Minute Order, 08/21/23.) The
instant Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary
Adjudication, was filed on August 25, 2023. Defendants filed a joint opposition
on December 6, 2023 and Plaintiff replied on December 18, 2023.  On January 29, 2024, the case was transferred from
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse to Department 26 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. Discussion Incorrect Name of Defendant Frontline Medical Associates,
Inc. The Complaint names Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. as a
defendant in this action; Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. filed an answer to
the Complaint. However, the Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative,
Summary Adjudication, is brought against an entity named “Frontline Medical
Group, APC.” (Motion, filed 08/28/23, pp. 1:27-2:1.) Indeed, the Motion
abbreviates the entity’s name as “FMG.” (Ibid.) This appears to be a
clerical error in the Motion and the Court will refer to the relevant Defendant
as Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. (“Defendant FMA”).  Legal Standard Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. On a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication of a particular cause of action, a moving plaintiff must show that
there is no defense by proving each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in ruling on the Motion, the
Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such inferences [citations], in
the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri v. Superior Court
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].) Furthermore,  The pleadings play a key role in
a summary judgment motion. “ ‘The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues’ ” and to frame “the
outer measure of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.” ( FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381, 282 Cal.Rptr.
508.) As our Supreme Court has explained it: “The materiality of a
disputed fact is measured by the pleadings [citations], which ‘set the
boundaries of the issues to be resolved at summary judgment.’
[Citations.]” ( Conroy v. Regents of University of California (2009) 45 Cal.4th
1244, 1250, 91 Cal.Rptr.3d 532, 203 P.3d 1127 ( Conroy ).) Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff’s theories of liability as alleged in the complaint; that is,
a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical possibility not
included in the pleadings. ( Id. at pp. 1254–1255, 91 Cal.Rptr.3d 532, 203 P.3d
1127; County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th
292, 332, 40 Cal.Rptr.3d 313; Lockhart v. County of Los Angeles (2007) 155
Cal.App.4th 289, 304, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 62; see Melican v. Regents of University
of California (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 168, 182, 59 Cal.Rptr.3d 672 [“We do not
require [defendant] to negate elements of causes of action plaintiffs never
pleaded.”].) (Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co. (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 486, 493 [emphasis added].) Allegations in the Complaint The Complaint alleges causes of action for breach of
contract, open book account, and for work, labor, services, and materials
rendered. Specifically, that on December 9, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant CC
entered into a written engagement letter for legal services in exchange for
compensation. (Compl., ¶BC-1.) Defendant CC breached the engagement letter by
“failing to communicate with counsel, failing to pay monthly invoices, and
failing to following [sic] the legal advice of counsel.” (Id. at ¶BC-2.)
As a result, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $13,315.91 plus ten
percent interest per annum from the date of each unpaid invoice. (Id. at
¶BC-4.) Similarly, in the last four years, Defendant CC has become indebted to
Plaintiff in the amount of $13,315.91 “for work, labor, services and materials
rendered at the special instance and request of defendant and for which
defendant promised to pay plaintiff.” (Id. at ¶CC-1.) As set forth herein,
the Complaint does not allege any facts against Defendant FMA. All facts
alleged are against Defendant CC. Accordingly, the facts raised in the instant
Motion improperly address matters outside the scope of the Complaint.  Conclusion Therefore, Plaintiff Hinds Law Group, APC’s Motion for
Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication with respect to
Defendant Family Medical Associates, Inc., is DENIED.  Court clerk to give notice.  

















































































  MOTION  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (2)(CCP § 437c) TENTATIVE RULING:     Plaintiff Hinds Law Group, APC’s Motion for Summary Judgment,  or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication with respect to Defendant  California Company, is DENIED.       ANALYSIS:   Plaintiff The Hinds Law Group (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for breach of retainer agreement and  common counts against Defendants California  Company, LLC (“Defendant CC”) and Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. (“Defendant FMA”) on August 22, 2022.    Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication  against Defendant CC on June 26, 2023. The Motion for Summary Adjudication was  denied without prejudice on August 21, 2023. (Minute Order, 08/21/23.)

However, the Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative,  Summary Adjudication, is brought against an entity named “Frontline Medical  Group, APC.” (Motion, filed 08/28/23, pp. 1:27-2:1.) Indeed, the Motion  abbreviates the entity’s name as “FMG.” (Ibid.) This appears to be a  clerical error in the Motion and the Court will refer to the relevant Defendant  as Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. (“Defendant FMA”).    Allegations in the Complaint   The Complaint alleges causes of action for breach of  contract, open book account, and for work, labor, services, and materials  rendered. Specifically, that on December 9, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant CC  entered into a written engagement letter for legal services in exchange for  compensation. (Compl., ¶BC-1.)

On a motion for summary judgment  or adjudication of a particular cause of action, a moving plaintiff must show that  there is no defense by proving each element of the cause of action entitling  the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.  (p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue  of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in ruling on the Motion, the  Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such inferences [citations], in  the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri v. Superior Court  (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.  (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].)   Plaintiff’s Burden to Demonstrate No Disputed Material  Facts   The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are  (1) the existence of contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for  nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach (or anticipatory breach); and (4)  resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008)  164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)    In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment for breach of  the engagement letter, Plaintiff presents the following facts. In August 2021,  Plaintiff was approached by Dr. Munir Uwaydah (“Uwaydah”), as a representative  of Defendant FMG, to represent Defendant FMG in a bankruptcy proceeding. (Motion,  Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Hinds Decl., ¶¶2-4.) Defendant FMG executed the  engagement letter on or about August 2, 2021. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact  No. 2; Hinds Decl., ¶3 and Exh. A.) Investigation revealed that the FMG claim  had been assigned to Defendant CC so Plaintiff prepared new engagement letters  for Defendant CC. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 3; Hinds Decl., ¶4 and  Exh. B.) Plaintiff provided legal services pursuant to the terms of the  engagement letters. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Hinds Decl., ¶5.) Problems  arose regarding payment of attorney’s fees and costs; Defendant CC failed and  refused to pay for the transcripts of the judgment debtor examinations and  Plaintiff was forced to fire Defendant CC and assert its lien rights. (Motion,  Separate Statement, Fact No. 5; Hinds Decl., ¶¶5-6.) On April 24, 2023, the  Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests for admission admitted  against Defendant CC. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; Minute Order,  04/24/23.) Defendant CC owes Plaintiff the sum of $27,474.24, plus interest at  the legal rate of interest. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 11; Hinds  Decl., ¶6.)   This evidence fails to carry Plaintiff’s initial burden of  proof as to its claims for breach of the engagement letter against Defendant CC.  Plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of the agreement between itself and  Defendant CC and Defendant CC’s breach by failing to pay Plaintiff as agreed.  However, the resulting damage to Plaintiff is not demonstrated by the evidence.  The Motion contends only that Defendant CC failed to pay for transcripts for  the judgment debtor examinations in the bankruptcy proceeding. (Motion,  Separate Statement, Fact No. 5; Hinds Decl., ¶¶5-6.) Proof of the cost of these  transcripts is not included in the Motion. Plaintiff’s counsel provides only a  conclusory statement that it is owed $27,474.24 plus interest thereon at the  legal rate since August 22, 2022. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 7;  Hinds Decl., ¶6.) The Motion purports to attach a true and accurate copy of a  history hill reflecting all invoices sent to Defendant CC at Exhibit C, but it  is not attached. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Hinds Decl., ¶7 and  Exh. C.) Nor does the Motion explain whether the invoices relate to the unpaid  transcripts or other unpaid services. Therefore, Plaintiff has not carried its  burden of proof regarding the resulting damages from Defendant CC’s breach of  the engagement letter.    Regarding the cause of action for open book account,  Plaintiff must demonstrate provide a detailed statement which constitutes the  principal record of one or more transactions between a debtor and a creditor  arising out of a contract or some fiduciary relation and that shows the debits  and credits in connection therewith, and against whom and in favor of whom  entries are made. (Code Civ. Proc., §337a; Tsemetzin v. Coast Federal  Savings & Loan Assn. (1997) 57 Cal. App. 4th 1334, 1343.) As noted  above, the billing history is not attached. Similarly, for work, labor,  services, and materials rendered, Plaintiff must show that Defendant CC is  indebted to it in a certain sum. (Evans v. Zeigler  (1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 226, 230; Haggerty v.  Warner (1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 468, 475.) As discussed above, that sum is not  demonstrated through the evidence.    Defendant’s Burden to  Demonstrate a Triable Issue of Material Fact   Defendants filed a joint  opposition to the Motions for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary  Adjudication, making for muddled arguments and evidence. Defendant CC’s  opposition arguments are summarized, as follows: (1) the only exhibit attached  to the Motion is Exhibit A, the engagement letter with Defendant FMG; (2) Defendant  CC never signed a retainer agreement with Plaintiff and was never billed for  service by Plaintiff; (3) Defendant CC has been suspended for failing to file  its annual paperwork but this is not grounds to grant the Motion, only to delay  the ruling. The opposition is supported only by the declaration of Munir  Uwaydah (“Uwaydah”) whose connection to Defendant CC is unclear. Uwaydah  declares that they are “the person most knowledgeable concerning the matters  addressed in this action as to the defendants” but offers no facts to support  this statement. (Opp., Uwaydah Decl., ¶1.) The engagement letter between  Plaintiff and Defendant CC was signed by its named manager, Patrick Rubeiz.  (Motion, Hinds Decl., Exh. B.) In reply, Plaintiff objects to portions of  Uwaydah’s declaration. The Court sustains objection nos. 5-8. Ultimately, both  parties’ papers are not models of clarity but as the burden is on Plaintiff to  demonstrate that no triable issues of material fact exist as to its claims, the  Motion is denied.   Conclusion   Therefore, Plaintiff Hinds Law  Group, APC’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary  Adjudication with respect to Defendant California Company, is DENIED.     Court clerk to give notice.
