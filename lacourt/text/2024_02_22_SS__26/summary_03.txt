The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication with respect to Defendant California Company, LLC. The Plaintiff brought this action for breach of retainer agreement and common counts against Defendants California Company, LLC and Frontline Medical Associates, Inc. on August 22, 2022. The Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication against Defendant California Company, LLC on June 26, 2023, which was denied without prejudice on August 21, 2023. The instant Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication, was filed on August 25, 2023.

The Plaintiff claims that Defendant California Company, LLC breached the engagement letter by failing to communicate with counsel, failing to pay monthly invoices, and failing to follow the legal advice of counsel. The Plaintiff seeks summary judgment or summary adjudication on the grounds that there is no defense and that the Defendant has failed to pay the legal fees and costs. However, the Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden of proof regarding the resulting damages from the breach of the engagement letter.

The Defendant, California Company, LLC, filed a joint opposition to the Motion, arguing that the Plaintiff has not carried its burden of proof and that there are triable issues of material fact. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that there is no defense and that the Defendant has failed to pay the legal fees and costs. Therefore, the Motion is denied.
