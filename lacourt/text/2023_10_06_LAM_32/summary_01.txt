And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to plaintiffs' request for production of documents in a lemon law action. The plaintiffs, Maria Ponce and Daniel Saucedo Ponce, sued American Motors Co., Inc. for violating the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act regarding defects with their 2021 Honda Civic. The Court finds that the plaintiffs' discovery requests are overly broad and unduly burdensome, and orders the defendant to produce specific documents, including the warranty policy and procedure manual, recall notices, technical service bulletins, and other relevant documents. The Court also denies other requests for further production and orders the defendant to provide supplemental responses within 45 days. The Court finds that both sides acted with substantial justification and does not award sanctions.
