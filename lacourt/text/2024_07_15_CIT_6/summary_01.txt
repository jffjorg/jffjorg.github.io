And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.'s motion to compel binding arbitration in a lemon law case. The case involves a dispute between the plaintiffs, Angelica Moreno, Rolando Martinez, and Ramon Moreno, and the defendant, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.

The judge found that the arbitration provision in the sales contract between the plaintiffs and Longo Toyota only applies to the two parties, and does not provide a benefit to the defendant. Additionally, the judge rejected the defendant's argument that it is a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration provision, as there is no language in the contract indicating an express intent to benefit the defendant.

The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that it is entitled to enforce the arbitration provision under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, as the warranties at issue are independent of the sales contract and did not arise out of any express contractual language.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Arbitration Act, the Federal Arbitration Act, and the California Civil Code, as well as prior case law, including Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1332 and Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958.

The plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
