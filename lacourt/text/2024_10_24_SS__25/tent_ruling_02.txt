On January 27, 2023, plaintiff State Farm Mutual  Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff) filed the complaint, alleging that  defendant Ildefonso Torres Chavez (Defendant) negligently collided their  vehicle with the property of a person insured by Plaintiff.   On May 20, 2024, the parties  stipulated to a judgment in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $14,000, of  which $10,000 was to be paid by Defendant’s insurance carrier and $4,000 was to  be paid by Defendant.   On May 30, 2024, the court  dismissed the case without prejudice based on the stipulation for entry of  judgment.   On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed  this motion to set aside/vacate dismissal and to enter judgment. No opposition  has been filed.   II.                  Legal Standard    Under Code of Civil Procedure,  section 664.6, subdivision (a), if parties stipulate for settlement of the case  in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally  before the court, the court may, upon motion of a party, enter judgment  pursuant to the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain  jurisdiction to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms  of the settlement.              III.               Discussion    Plaintiff and  Defendant entered into a stipulation that Defendant will pay Plaintiff a total  of $14,000, plus costs of suit and prejudgment interest. The stipulation  included a clause that, in the event of Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may  cause judgment to be entered pursuant to the stipulation for the full amount of  the agreed-upon judgment, less any money paid prior to the date of breach.  (Stip. for Entry of Judg., ¶ 6.)   In the order for  dismissal filed on May 30, 2024, the court retained jurisdiction of the case  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6.   Plaintiff, in the  motion and in the declaration of Susan M. Benson, has stated that Defendant has  defaulted on payments required under the stipulation, the remaining principal  owed totaling $3,000. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff sent a default payment  letter to Defendant on June 21, 2024. (Benson Decl., ¶ 6.) Nonetheless,  Defendant has failed to pay any money since the Notice of Default was sent.  (Benson Decl., ¶ 7.)   Plaintiff  requests an entry of judgment against Defendant in the sum of $3,000, plus  costs to file suit and serve the lawsuit of $472.30 and filing costs of $75,  for a total judgment of $3,547.30. The court finds these costs to be  reasonable.   Based thereon,  the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set aside dismissal and to enter  judgment.   IV.               Conclusion & Order   Plaintiff’s Motion  to Set Aside Dismissal and to Enter Judgment is GRANTED.   The Dismissal  entered on 05/30/2024 is set aside and vacated.   Judgment is  entered against the Defendant in the sum of $3,000, plus costs to file suit and  serve the lawsuit of $472.30, and filing costs of $75, for a TOTAL JUDGMENT of  $3,547.30   Moving party is  ordered to give notice.
