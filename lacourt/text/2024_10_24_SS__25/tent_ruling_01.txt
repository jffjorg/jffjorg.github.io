ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
In 2022, Petitioner Alison Kendall (“Petitioner”), a
licensed California architect, signed a contract with Respondents Chikako
Bryner Van Deusen and Roger Van Deusen (“Respondents”). (Amended Petn., p. 2;
Amended Petn. Exh. A.) The parties eventually entered into a dispute over
aspects of Petitioner’s service, and Petitioner submitted the dispute to the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). (Amended Petn., p. 2; Amended Petn.,
Exhs. A, B; 9/30/24 Smith Decl. in Support of Demurrer and Motion to Strike,
Exh. 2.) 
 
On August 7, 2023, an arbitration by the AAA occurred. The
arbitrator, Marion T. Hack, issued a final ruling on August 16, 2023, naming Petitioner
as the prevailing party and awarding her $27,182.  (Amended Petn., Exh. B.) 
 
On September 6, 2023, self-represented Petitioner filed a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“Original Petition”) in which she sought
to confirm the Final Arbitration Award of $27,182. At the January 18, 2024 Case
Management Conference, Petitioner informed the Court that Respondents had made
partial payment resulting in the amount sought falling below the $25,000
jurisdictional limit. Accordingly, the Court ordered the matter reclassified as
a civil limited jurisdiction case and subsequently reassigned it to Department
25.
 
On July 24, 2024, Petitioner, represented by counsel, filed
a First Amended Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“Amended Petition”), in
which she sought the amount of $18,299.20 in recognition of Respondents’
partial payment. Specifically, while the Amended Petition seeks to confirm the
award, in Section 10, Petitioner requests that the Court correct the award,
noting that while the award is accurate, Petitioner wishes to acknowledge a
credit for partial payment which reduces the amount owed plus interest at the
legal rate from the date of the award. The Court notes the Proof of Service
attached to the Amended Petition indicates the filing was electronically served
on Respondent’s Counsel Ames Smith at an email address listed on the June 20,
2024 Notice and Declaration of Archibald Smith Automatically Extending
Respondent’s Time to File a Responsive Pleading following the Original Petition.

 
On September 3, 2024, Respondent Roger
Van Deusen (hereinafter “Respondent”) filed the instant Demurrer to the Amended
Petition and a Motion to Strike. The Court notes the Proof of Service attached
to the Demurrer and Motion to Strike indicates the filings were electronically
served on Petitioner’s Counsel Collins + Collins LLP at email addresses listed
on the Amended Petition. On September 25, 2024, Respondent filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition by Petitioner.
 
On October 1, 2024, Respondent filed a
separate Motion to Strike in conjunction with the Demurrer to the Amended
Petition identical to the Motion to Strike filed with the Demurrer on September
3, 2024. 
 
On October 2, 2024, Petitioner filed untimely
Opposition briefs to the Respondent’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike. 
 
On October 3, 2024, Petitioner filed
an Ex Parte Application to Continue Hearing of Respondent’s Demurrer and Motion
to Strike from October 7, 2024 to October 15, 2024 or to a date thereafter
convenient for the Court. Petitioner explained the request for the continuance
was on the grounds that Petitioner failed to file a timely Opposition due to
the mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect of counsel, and the
continuance would allow Respondent time to file a Reply. (10/3/24 Ex Parte
Application, p. 1.) Respondent opposed the application. 
 
On October 4, 2024, the Court granted Petitioner’s Ex
Parte Application and continued the Demurrer and Motion to Strike hearing to
October 24, 2024. (10/4/24 Minute Order.) In light of the new hearing date,
Petitioner’s Opposition briefs filed on October 2, 2024 are considered on the
merits. (See Code of Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
On October 17, 2024, Respondent filed Reply briefs to
Petitioner’s Oppositions to the Demurrer and Motion to Strike. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
“Regardless of the particular relief granted, any
arbitrator's award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the
superior court.” (O'Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants¿(2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to confirm an award is filed, the
superior court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm
the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc.¿(2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled that the scope of judicial
review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.
v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) 
 
“A response to a petition under this chapter may request
the court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.) 
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether
the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
The Court notes Respondent does not cite authority
supporting his assertion that a demurrer is the proper procedural mechanism for
attacking a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. As noted above, the Court’s
authority once a Petition is filed is to confirm the award, correct and confirm
it, vacate it, or dismiss the Petition. However, Petitions to Confirm
Arbitration Awards have been subject to demurrers, and here the Court considers
the demurrer as equivalent to a request to dismiss the Petition and vacate the
arbitration award. (See Precision Automotive v. Northern Ins. Co. of New
York (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 1036.) 
 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
A.    
Service of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§
1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that:
“The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on
each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or
as provided in the agreement.”¿(Emphasis added.) 
 
“A petition to confirm an award shall be served and filed
not later than four years after the date of service of a signed copy of the
award on the petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to correct an award
shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.)

 
“No petition [to confirm arbitration award] may be served
and filed … until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1288.4.) 
 
Here, the Final Arbitration Award,
dated August 16, 2023 and attached to Petitioner’s Petition as Exhibit 1 and
Amended Petition as Exhibit B, does not include a proof of service or other
document demonstrating the neutral arbitrator served a copy of the Final
Arbitration Award on the parties. (Amended Petn., Exh. B.) In addition, the
Arbitration Agreement does not appear to specify terms for service of the Award
different from those set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6. However,
the Court notes Petitioner’s Original Petition filed on September 6, 2023
includes a copy of an email dated August 28, 2023 from Petitioner to Respondent
which purports to attach the August 16, 2023 Arbitration Award Letter. (Original
Petn., Exh. 2.) While the precise date of service of the Final Arbitration
Award on the parties by the arbitrator is uncertain, it appears the parties
received a copy of the Final Arbitration Award sometime between August 16, 2023
and August 28, 2023. Respondent does not raise issues regarding receipt of the Final
Arbitration Award. 
 
Given then that the parties received the Final
Arbitration Award sometime between August 16, 2023 and August 28, 2023, Petitioner
needed to serve and file a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award within four
years from August 28, 2023 or serve and file a Petition to Vacate or Correct
Award within 100 days from August 28, 2023 to be timely. (Code of Civ. Pro. §
1288.)
 
Petitioner’s Original Petition was a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award, which Petitioner filed on September 6, 2023 and attempted to
serve on Respondent on June 11, 2024. (Original Petn.; 6/20/24 Decl.
Automatically Extending Respondent’s Time to File Responsive Pleading, fn. 1,
Exh. A, ¶ 2.) However, while the filing and service was timely under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1283.6 given that it occurred within four years after
the service of the Final Arbitration Award on Petitioner, the Court notes
service of the Original Petition on Respondent may have been improper as there
is no proof of service, and it appears Petitioner served Respondent with the Original
Petition herself. (6/20/24 Decl. Automatically Extending Respondent’s Time to
File Responsive Pleading, fn. 1, Exh. A, ¶ 2.) While Respondent does not deny
having received the Original Petition, he does not concede that the June 11,
2024 service of the Original Petition on him was proper. (6/20/24 Decl.
Automatically Extending Respondent’s Time to File Responsive Pleading, Exh. A.)

            Petitioner then filed and
served the Amended Petition on July 24, 2024, which, if the Amended Petition is
a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award, would satisfy all statutory
requirements as it would be timely – the filing occurred less than a year from the
service of the signed copy of the Final Arbitration Award – and was served
electronically upon Respondent in accordance with an electronic service
agreement between the parties. (7/29/24 Decl. Extending Respondent’s Time to
File Responsive Pleading to Amended Petn., Exh. 2, p. 2; Code of Civ. Pro. §
1288.) However, if Petitioner intended the Amended Petition to be a Petition to
Correct Arbitration Award, then it would be untimely given it was filed and
served well after 100 days after the date of service of the signed copy of the
Final Arbitration Award on Petitioner. (Code of Civ. Pro. § 1288.) 
 
The Court notes there is a discrepancy
in the type of relief requested by the Petitioner in the Amended Petition. On
the first page of the Amended Petition, Petitioner marked the Amended Petition
as a “Petition to Confirm”; however, on the third page of the Amended Petition,
Petitioner marked in ¶10b that she is requesting the Court “correct the
award and enter judgment according to the corrected award.” (Amended Petn., pp.
1, 3, italics added.) While Petitioner mentions in the Opposition brief that
the Amended Petition does not seek to alter or “ ‘correct’ the arbitration
award,” (Opposition, p. 2), the Petition itself is not clear on this matter. 
 
Accordingly, the Court is not able to fully address the
timeliness of the Amended Petition until Petitioner clarifies whether her
Amended Petition is a Petition to Confirm or to Correct Arbitration Award.
 
B.     The Arbitrator’s Authority
 
Respondent argues the Amended Petition
should be dismissed because the arbitrator had no authority or subject matter
jurisdiction to arbitrate the dispute, as the arbitration provision in the
parties’ contract was “expressly limited to only disputes where there has been
an unsuccessful mediation.” (Demurrer, p. 1.) As such, Respondent argues the
arbitration ruling cannot be enforced. To support his claim, Respondent points,
in part, to the portion of the contract that states:  “Any claim, dispute or other matter in
question arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to
mediation as a condition precedent to binding dispute resolution.” (Amended
Petn., Exh. A, p. 16.) 
 
Respondent also argues objections to subject matter
jurisdiction, such as here, may never be waived, and thus his contention is
timely.  (Demurrer, pp. 5-6, citing United
Firefighters of Los Angeles v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
1576, 1581.) 
 
In Opposition, Petitioner argues the
arbitrator has authority to determine their own jurisdiction by virtue of the
AAA rules. (Demurrer Opposition, p. 3, citing Rodriguez v. American
Technologies, Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1123; Dream Theater,
Inc. v. Dream Theater (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 547, 549, 557.) Nonetheless,
Petitioner states Respondent waived any challenge to arbitrability by failing
to ask the arbitrator to “rule on arbitrability or compel mediation before
proceeding to the arbitration on the merits.” 
(Demurrer Opposition, p. 5, italics added.) As such, Petitioner states
Respondent “cannot wait until after an award is made to claim that an issue is
beyond the arbitrator’s authority.” (Demurrer Opposition, p. 5, citing J.C.
Gury Co. v. Nippon Carbide Indus. (USA) Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1300,
1302.) Finally, Petitioner requests leave to amend any defects to the extent
the Court finds grounds to sustain Respondent’s demurrer. (Demurrer Opposition,
p. 6.) 
 
In Reply, Respondent argues Petitioner
fails to address numerous arguments raised in the demurrer and thus forfeits
them. (Demurrer Reply, p. 1.) Respondent reiterates arguments made in the
demurrer and acknowledges that the “parties agree that the scope of the
arbitrator’s authority turns on their contractual intent.”  (Demurrer Reply, p. 4.) Respondent also argues
the contract states “the intent of the parties to allow for binding arbitration
subject to the AAA rules only when mediation had first been attempted without
success is inescapable.”  (Demurrer Reply,
p. 5.) 
 
As relevant here, the parties’ contract states: 
 
“§ 8.2 Mediation
 
§ 8.2.1 Any claim, dispute or other
matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject
to mediation as a condition precedent to binding dispute resolution. If such
matter relates to or is the subject of a lien arising out of the Architect's
services, the Architect may proceed in accordance with applicable law to comply
with the lien notice or filing deadlines prior to resolution of the matter by
mediation or by binding dispute resolution.
 
§ 8.2.2 Mediation, unless the parties
mutually agree otherwise, shall be administered by the American Arbitration
Association in accordance with its Construction Industry Mediation Procedures
in effect on the date of this Agreement. The parties shall share the mediator's
fee and any filing fees equally. The mediation shall be held in the place where
the Project is located, unless another location is mutually agreed upon.
Agreements reached in mediation shall be enforceable as settlement agreements
in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
 
§ 8.2.3 If the parties do not resolve
a dispute through mediation pursuant to this Section 8.2, the method of binding
dispute resolution shall be the following: Arbitration pursuant to Section 8.3
of this Agreement.”
 
            (Amended Petn., Exh. A, p. 16.) 
 
While Respondent’s arguments are
somewhat persuasive, it is not immediately apparent as a matter of law that the
arbitrator did not have authority to arbitrate the claim at issue, and the
question appears to ultimately be one of contract interpretation. Indeed, AAA
highlighted in a letter to the parties that since the parties could not come to
an agreement about mediation, the matter would proceed to arbitration. (9/30/24
Smith Decl. in Support of Demurrer and Motion to Strike, Exh. 2.) Given the
contract’s ambiguity on the proper protocol in the event the parties disagree
about the condition precedent of mediation (which arguably could be said to
make the mediation unsuccessful, a circumstance which would then
necessitate arbitration pursuant to the contract), the AAA’s read of the
specific contract’s terms offers a plausible interpretation given the
circumstances and the language of sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. 
 
As such, the Amended Petition is not
invalid on its face. A general demurrer does not like to only part of a cause
of action. If there are sufficient allegations to entitle plaintiff to relief,
other allegations cannot be challenged by general demurrer. Daniels v.
Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal. App. 4th 1150,
1167.  “Objections that a complaint is
ambiguous or uncertain, or that essential facts appear only inferentially, or
as conclusions of law, or by way of recitals, must be raised by special
demurrer, and cannot be reached on general demurrer.” Johnson v. Mead (1987)
191 Cal. App. 3d 156, 160. Special demurrers are not permitted in limited civil
cases. The grounds for special demurrer must be raised, if at all, as
affirmative defenses in the answer. Code of Civ. Procedure § 92( c). 
 
Furthermore, moving party argues that
the arbitrator lacked subject matter jurisdiction, this argument is misplaced
in a demurrer, because the moving party is not making a claim that the court
is lacking subject matter jurisdiction. Code of Civil Procedure §430.10(a) permits
general demurrer on grounds that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.” (Code of Civ. Procedure
§430.10). The challenge is to the court’s power to grant relief.  The demurrer lies only where it appears from the
face of the complaint that the court is not competent to act. Buss v. J.O.
Martin Co. (1966) 241 Cal.App. 2d 123, 133.  Thus, a demurrer is not the proper procedural
mechanism for attacking a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. 
 
As already mentioned, the Court’s
authority once a Petition is filed is to confirm the award, correct and confirm
it, vacate it, or dismiss the Petition. 
 
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer. 
  
IV.             
Motion
to Strike
 
Respondent moves the Court to strike 10b and 10d of the
Amended Petition without leave to amend because (1) Petitioner untimely filed
the Amended Petition more than 100 days after the date of the service of a
signed copy of the award on Petitioner and improperly requested a new form of
relief, and (2) Petitioner’s requested modification to add additional interest
goes beyond “mere correction.” (Notice of Motion, p. ii; Code of Civ. Proc. §
92(d).) 
 
In Opposition, Petitioner contends Respondent’s motion
should be denied because the Amended Petition does not seek to alter or “
‘correct’ the arbitration award”; rather, Petitioner states the Amended
Petition seeks to account for Respondent’s partial payment and adjust for
interest accrued on the arbitration award since it was awarded.  (Strike Opposition, pp. 2-3.) Petitioner
contends such interest is allowed pursuant to California Civil Code section
3287. (Opposition, p. 3, citing County of Solano v. Lionsgate Corp. (2005)
126 Cal.App.4th 741, 753; Tenzera, Inc. v. Osterman (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 16, 21-22.) 
 
In Reply, Respondent argues Petitioner fails to address
numerous arguments raised in the motion to strike and thus waives them. (Strike
Reply, p. 1.) Respondent further argues Petitioner’s Amended Petition is
untimely, the arbitration award’s calculation of interest is erroneous, the
Court may not modify the award to provide additional interest, and Petitioner’s
Amended Petition is to correct, not confirm, the arbitration award. (Strike
Reply, pp. 2-3.)  Finally, Respondent
contends the arbitrator’s interest award is final and thus Petitioner is not
entitled to any additional interest past July 12, 2023. (Strike Reply, p. 5.) 
 
As a preliminary matter and as discussed above, the Court
is unable to fully address the question of timeliness until Petitioner
clarifies whether her Amended Petition is a Petition to Confirm or to Correct
Arbitration Award. 
 
As to Petitioner’s requested modification, the Court notes
the discrepancy in the type of relief requested by the Petitioner in the
Amended Petition, as mentioned above. On the first page of the Amended
Petition, Petitioner marked the Amended Petition as a “Petition to Confirm”;
however, on the third page of the Amended Petition, Petitioner marked in ¶10b
that she is requesting the Court “correct the award and enter judgment
according to the corrected award.” (Amended Petn., pp. 1, 3.) Petitioner then
explains that: “The award itself is accurate. However, Petitioner acknowledges
a credit for a partial payment made by Respondent after the date of the award,
which reduces the amount owed to $18,299.20, plus interest at the legal rate
from the date of the award on August 16, 2023.” 
(Amended Petn., p. 3.)  
 
The court has discretion to grant leave to amend. (Code
of Civil Procedure § 472a(d); Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal. App. 4th
761, 768-769). 
 
Based on the discrepancy in the type of relief requested
in the Amended Petition, the court GRANTS the Motion to Strike with leave to
file Second Amended Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award within
the next twenty (20) days. 
 
V.               
Conclusion
& Order
 
The Court OVERRULES the Demurrer. 
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to Strike.

 
Petitioner is to file Second Amended
Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award within the next twenty (20)
days. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
