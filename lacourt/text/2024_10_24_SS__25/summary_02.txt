Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., filed a motion to set aside the dismissal of the case and enter judgment against the defendant, Ildefonso Torres Chavez. The defendant defaulted on payments required under the stipulation for judgment, and the plaintiff sent a default payment letter to the defendant on June 21, 2024. Despite this, the defendant failed to pay any money since the notice of default was sent. The court finds that the costs to file suit and serve the lawsuit are reasonable and grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment. The court enters judgment against the defendant in the sum of $3,000, plus costs to file suit and serve the lawsuit of $472.30, and filing costs of $75, for a total judgment of $3,547.30.
