And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for determination of good faith settlement. The case involves a lawsuit arising from an automobile accident on June 18, 2021, and subsequent settlement agreements between the parties. The judge has reviewed the settlement agreement and has determined that it was entered into in good faith. The settlement agreement provides for payments to the plaintiffs and cross-complainant, and the judge has determined that the agreement reflects an approximation of the total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability. The judge has also found that there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct between the settling parties. As a result, the judge has granted the motion and has determined that the settlement was made in good faith.
