And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs' Complaint is granted. The motion was filed by Defendants Terry Alexander Burton and Delena Zimmerman, who argued that Plaintiffs did not plead sufficient facts to support their request for punitive damages. The Judge found that Plaintiffs did not allege sufficient facts to demonstrate a conscious disregard of the probable and dangerous consequences of Burton's conduct, including driving while intoxicated. Therefore, the Judge struck the request for punitive damages from the complaint. However, the Judge allowed Plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to allege additional facts that may demonstrate a conscious disregard.
