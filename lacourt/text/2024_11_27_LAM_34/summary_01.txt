And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant's Counsel Thomas S. Carter's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed order. The motion was properly filed and served, and the court finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, have been met. The declaration filed by Counsel states that a breakdown in communication has occurred, making effective representation impossible. The court notes that the Defendant is a corporation and cannot represent itself, and therefore, Counsel's request for withdrawal is granted.
