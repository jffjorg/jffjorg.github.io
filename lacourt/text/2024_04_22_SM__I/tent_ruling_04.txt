 Case Number:  23SMCV04262    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The court gave its FSC order on November 9,
2023.  There was a prior FSC but the case
was not ready for trial and thus it was continued.  It has been continued before at plaintiff’s
request.  On April 17, 2024, the court
received what appears to be a joint witness list and a joint exhibit list.  There are five witnesses for a total of 7
hours of direct and cross examination. 
There are 5 exhibits.  The court
also received plaintiff’s trial brief and defendants’ trial brief.  The court did not receive a trial brief from
the defense.  The court believes this is
substantially compliant with the court’s FSC order and the court deems the case
READY FOR TRIAL.  Trial will begin on
April 29, 2024, at 10:30.
