 Case Number:  22STCV30200    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  I The sanctions were meant to be a total of the sanctions
awarded on that day.  If it is the day
the court believes that it was, there were multiple motions to compel on file
and sanctions sought for all of them. 
The court gave an “all-in” number for those on calendar that day.  The court did not mean to say that it was an
all in number for all sanctions including those awarded at different
hearings.  The court does not intend to
hear argument on this ex parte application.
