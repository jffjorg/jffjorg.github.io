 Case Number:  23SMCV04441    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  I The application to move the various discovery hearings to a
single date is GRANTED.  The various
hearings will all be held on May 3, 2024 at 9 am.  Briefing, however, will go forward based on
the originally scheduled hearing dates. 
That means that the two hearings set for April 26, 2024, are advanced to
this day and continued to May 3, 2024, at 9 am. 
The hearing set for April 30, 2024, is advanced to this date and
continued to May 3, 2024, at 9 am.  The
opposition is unconvincing.  The court
sees no reason to have these related hearings span over three days and all the
application seeks is to hear them on the same day.  The court does not intend to hear argument on
this matter today.
