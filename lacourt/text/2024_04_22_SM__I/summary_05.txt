And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the application to move the various discovery hearings to a single date. The hearings will be held on May 3, 2024, at 9 am. Briefing, however, will continue as scheduled based on the originally scheduled hearing dates. The hearings set for April 26 and April 30, 2024, will be advanced to May 3, 2024, at 9 am. The judge finds the opposition to the application unconvincing and sees no reason to have the related hearings span over three days. The judge does not intend to hear argument on this matter today.
