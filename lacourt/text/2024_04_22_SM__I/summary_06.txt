And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations brought by Live Nation is denied. The Plaintiff alleges that Chris Brown assaulted him at a nightclub in London, and that Live Nation knew about Brown's violent behavior and failed to protect the public. The Judge finds that the allegations of malice and oppression are adequately pleaded, and that the matter is better suited for summary judgment than the pleadings stage. The Judge also addresses Live Nation's claim that the Plaintiff is splitting his primary right, and concludes that the duplication does no mischief, as the Plaintiff is not entitled to a double recovery. The Judge rules that the matter will be addressed at the trial or on a dispositive motion, rather than at the pleading stage.
