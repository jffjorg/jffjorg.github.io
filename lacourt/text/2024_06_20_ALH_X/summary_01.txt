And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The defendant, La Canada Unified School District, requests an order staying the trial in this matter pending the resolution of two petitions for writ of mandate regarding the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218. The court has denied the motion, finding that while the writ process is generally quicker than appeals, the court anticipates that the Appellate Courts will rule relatively soon. The court has therefore denied the motion to stay the trial, and the parties are directed to proceed with the trial as scheduled on April 7, 2025."
