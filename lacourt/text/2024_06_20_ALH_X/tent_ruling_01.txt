BACKGROUND
 
            On December 16, 2022, Plaintiff John
Doe (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants La Canada Unified School

            On January 29, 2024, Defendant La

the Pleadings. This Court denied the motion. 
             
On May 13, 2024, the District filed the

opposition. On June 12, 2024, the District filed a reply. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
             Defendant
La Canada Unified School District’s Motion to Stay the Trial is DENIED. 
 
 
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendant
La Canada Unified School District request for judicial notice is GRANTED
pursuant to Evidence Code sections 451, 452(d), and 453 (except as to the
truth of the matters).
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Any party may file a
motion for an order under Code of Civil Procedure section 404.5 staying the
proceedings in any action being considered for, or affecting an action being
considered for, coordination, or the court may stay the proceedings on its own
motion.” (Cal. Rules Ct., Rule 3.515(a).)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 404.5, “Pending any
determination of whether coordination is appropriate, the judge making that
determination may stay any action being considered for, or affecting an action
being considered for, coordination.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            The
District moves for an order staying the trial of this matter pending resolution
of the Court of Appeals’ decision on two writs regarding the constitutionality
of California Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”).  
 
In Caiafa Prof. Law Corp. v.
State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 800, the court held,
[i]t is black letter law that, when a Federal action has been filed covering
the same subject matter as is involved in a California action, the California
court has the discretion but not the obligation to stay the state court action.”
(Caiafa Prof. Law Corp. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (1993) 15
Cal.App.4th 800, 804.) However, the court in California Dept. of Water
Resources v. Powerex Corp. (E.D. Cal.
2009) 653 F.Supp.2d 1057, held “[w]here it is proposed that a
pending proceeding be stayed, the competing interests which will be affected by
the granting or refusal to grant a stay must be weighed. Among those competing
interests are the possible damage which may result from the granting of a stay,
the hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being required to go
forward, and the orderly course of justice measured in terms of the simplifying
or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected
to result from a stay.” (California Dept. of Water
Resources v. Powerex Corp. (E.D. Cal.
2009) 653 F.Supp.2d 1057, 1063 [citing to Lockyer v. Mirant Corp. (9th
Cir. 2005) 398 F.3d 1098, 1110)].)
 
            Here,
the Court recognizes that two petitions for writ of mandate are currently
pending before the First and Second District Appellate Courts in West Contra
Costa USD v. Superior Court, Case No. A16934 (concerning decision to
overrule demurrer predicated on unconstitutionality of AB 218) and Roe #2 v.
Superior Court, Case No. B334707 (concerning decision to deny motion for
judgment on the pleadings predicated on unconstitutionality of AB 218). While these
two writs challenge the rulings of the trial courts in Contra Costa County and
Santa Barbara County, respectively and not a judgment or order made by this
Court, they do relate to the same issue as was raised in this Court, i.e., the
constitutionality of AB 218 raised on the District’s Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings. Nevertheless, the writ process is much quicker than that in the
case of appeals, such that this Court anticipates that the Appellate Courts
will rule relatively soon. In fact, the writ in the Contra Costa case has been
fully briefed and awaits oral argument. (Def. RJN 8 – Ex. C.) Likewise, trial
in the instant case is not until April 7 of next year (2025). If in fact
no ruling is made by the Appellate Courts until closer to the trial date, or if
the ruling of the Appellate Courts results in a Petition for Review in the
California Supreme Court, then the District may bring an ex parte application
to continue the trial. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Based on
the foregoing, Defendant La Canada
Unified School District’s Motion to Stay the Trial is DENIED.
 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
