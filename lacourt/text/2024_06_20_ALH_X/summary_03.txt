And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

**Tentative Ruling**

The judge denies Defendant Iris Liya Liu's Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Judgment. The judge also denies Defendant Liu's Motion for New Trial. The judge sustains Defendant Liu's objections to Defendant Rebecca Chiu's opposition and Defendant Liu's objections to Defendant Daniel C. Chiu's opposition. The judge finds that Defendant Liu did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she was authorized to sign contracts on behalf of ARC. The judge concludes that the evidence presented at trial indicates that Plaintiff entered into the 2011 and 2014 agreements in her own capacity, rather than as an agent for ARC.
