**Case Summary**

The Court has reviewed the demurrers filed by the defendants (Breckenridge Property Fund 2016, LLC, Jack R. Barnes, and So-Cal Capital, Inc.) and has sustained all of them without leave to amend. The Court finds that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to state a cause of action for several reasons:

* The FAC is uncertain and lacks specificity, making it impossible for the defendants to prepare a defense.
* The FAC fails to plead fraud with specificity, as required by California law.
* The FAC does not plead a breach of fiduciary duty, as the plaintiff allegedly engaged in arms-length transactions with the lender defendants.
* The FAC does not plead a claim for wrongful foreclosure, as the plaintiff has not pled any fraud or tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness.
* The FAC does not plead a claim for RESPA and TILA violations, as the plaintiff has not pled the basis for statutory liability with particularity.

The Court has sustained the demurrers without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot cure the defects in the FAC.
