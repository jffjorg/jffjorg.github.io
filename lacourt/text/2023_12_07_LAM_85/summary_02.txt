And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The judge is critical of Cisneros' counsel for not following Local Rule 3.231(j) when preparing a Joint Appendix, which was filed late and in disorganized order. The judge has reviewed relevant pages and found them to be relevant, despite the parties not citing certain sections of the Education Code. The judge also dismisses Cisneros' contention that Johnston did not investigate who printed the label reports, and criticizes Burks for not investigating who ran the label report. The judge's ruling aims to ensure that future joint appendices are prepared in compliance with the local rules and that the court's review process is efficient.
