And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling on a dispute between Virgen and MTA and the City regarding a collision. The dispute centers around whether Virgen had enough information to justify a claim against MTA and the City. MTA argues that Virgen's counsel believed MTA was implicated in the collision, citing a preservation of evidence letter sent to Chevron in August 2021. However, the judge finds that this letter was likely sent to understand the circumstances of the collision and to gather evidence against the County, rather than to implicate MTA. Additionally, the judge notes that a claim filed by Adrian, the decedent's child, against the County based on dangerous conditions at the Intersection lacks solid information and is based on speculation. The judge concludes that Virgen's counsel did not have sufficient information to justify a claim against MTA and the City, and the dispute is still pending further resolution.
