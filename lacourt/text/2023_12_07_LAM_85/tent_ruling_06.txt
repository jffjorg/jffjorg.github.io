[2] It is unclear whether the video itself was included and
disclosed with the reports.


[3] MTA notes that
Virgen’s counsel sent Chevron a preservation of evidence letter on August 18,
2021, just weeks after the collision.  Levine
Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  MTA Opp. at 9.  MTA argues that this suggests her counsel
already believed MTA was implicated in the collision.  MTA Opp. at 9.  Not so. 
Virgen’s attorney knew almost nothing about the accident, and he needed
to see the video to understand how it occurred and as potential evidence
against the County.  Carrillo Decl., ¶3.
MTA also notes that the decedent’s child, Adrian, filed a
claim against the County based on dangerous conditions at the Intersection as
early as August 5, 2021.  Levine Decl.,
¶6, Ex. B.  MTA Opp. at 7.  As Virgen replies, Adrian’s claim has so
little information it seems based on speculation rather than solid
information.  An unsubstantiated claim by
another person says little about whether Virgen should have had enough
information to justify a claim against MTA and the City.  Reply at 5.


[4] The court need
not discuss whether leave to file a late claim would prejudice either
governmental entity.
