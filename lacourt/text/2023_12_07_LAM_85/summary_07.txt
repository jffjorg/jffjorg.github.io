And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Petition for leave to present a late claim filed by David Keliher against the City of Los Angeles. Keliher suffered serious personal injuries on January 30, 2022, and filed a Notice of Claim with the City on October 7, 2022, which was rejected on October 24, 2022. He then applied for leave to present a late claim on January 23, 2023, which was denied on March 6, 2023. The judge found that the failure of Keliher's attorneys to file a timely notice of claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, specifically the breakdown in their usual procedures caused by remote work. The court has granted the Petition and ordered Keliher to file all exhibits supporting his declarations.
