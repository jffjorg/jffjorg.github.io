 Case Number:  23STCP02156    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  85 
David
Keliher v. City of Los Angeles, 23STCP02156


Tentative
decision on petition for leave to file late claim: granted 




 
            
 
            Petitioner David Keliher (“Keliher”)
seeks leave to present a late claim for damages against Respondent City of Los
Angeles (“City”).
            The court has read and considered
the moving papers and supporting declarations (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner Keliher commenced this
action on June 15, 2023, seeking leave to present a late claim for damages against
the City.  The unverified Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Keliher suffered serious personal
injuries on January 30, 2022.  He filed a
Notice of Claim with the City on October 7, 2022, which the City rejected.  On January 23, 2023, he filed an Application
to File a Late Claim.  The City rejected
it on March 6, 2023.
            Keliher’s failure to file a Notice
of Claim within six months was due to mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect.  The City will not suffer
prejudice if the court grants leave to file a late claim.  
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On June 27, 2023, Keliher served the
City with the Petition and moving papers through personal service.
            No Answer is on file.
 
            B. Applicable Law
            Under the Government Claims Act (the
“Act”), a plaintiff bringing suit for monetary damages against a public entity
or employees thereof must first present a claim to the public entity
(“government claim”) which must be acted upon or deemed rejected by the public
entity.  Govt. Code[1]
§§ 945.4, 950.2, 950.6(a).  To be timely,
a government claim for damages must be presented to the public entity within six
months of the date the cause of action accrued. 
§911.2. 
            If a plaintiff fails to file a
government claim within the six-month period, he or she may apply to the public
entity for permission to file a late claim. 
§911.4.  Such an application must
be presented within a reasonable time, and not later than one year after the
cause of action’s accrual.  §911.4(b).  
            If the public entity denies the
application for permission to file a late claim, the plaintiff may file a civil
petition for relief from section 945.4's requirement of timely claim
presentation prior to suit.  §946.6.  The petition must be filed within six months
after the application to the public entity is denied or deemed to be
denied.  §946.6(b). The petition must
show: (1) that an application was made to the public entity under section 911.4
and was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to timely present
the claim to the public entity within the time limit specified in section
911.2; and (3) the information required by section 910.  §946.6(b).




            The court shall grant relief only if
it finds that (1) the application to the public entity for leave to file a late
claim was made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after accrual of
the claim as specified in section 911.4(b), (2) was denied or deemed denied by
the public agency pursuant to section 911.6, and (3) one or more of the
following is applicable: (a) the failure to timely present the claim was
through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, unless the
public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the
claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of section
945.4; (b) the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss was a
minor during all of the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of
the claim; (c) the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss was
physically or mentally incapacitated during all of the time specified in
section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim and by reason of that
disability failed to present a claim during that time; or (d) the person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss died before the expiration of the
time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim.  §946.6(c).
 
            C. Statement of Facts[2]
            1. Background
            Since 2013, Cohen Law Partners
(“CLP”) and the Pierry Law Firm (“PLF”) have worked as co-counsel on numerous
cases for personal injury claims against various governmental entities.  Pierry Decl., ¶15.  Most of these cases involve defects in the
condition of a roadway.  Pierry Decl.,
¶15.  Until this case, they have never
failed to file timely notice of claims with the proper governmental entities
before commencing civil actions.  Pierry
Decl., ¶15.
            For any such case, one law firm will
handle the labor in preparing and filing the claim forms.  Pierry Decl., ¶16; Cohen Decl., ¶5.  The firms would circulate an email confirming
which firm would do this.  Pierry Decl.,
¶16.  
            Before COVID-19 compelled remote
work, when PLF was supposed to calendar a date, PLF partner Joseph Pierry, Esq.
(“Pierry”) would email his assistant David Campos, Esq. (“Campos”) to do so.  Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶2.  He would also generate a paper memo for Campos
and calendar a follow-up date ten days after the memo.  Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  
            Campos would calendar the requested
date and return the memo with his initials on it to Pierry.  Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶3.  Campos would calendar the deadline for filing
the tort claim, an event two months before, another one month before, and one
for every day of the last two weeks before the due date.  Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶4.  
            CLP partner Josh Cohen, Esq.
(“Cohen”) would also tell his paralegal to calendar the six-month deadline.  Cohen Decl., ¶3.
 
            2. Case History
            On January 30, 2022, Keliher was riding
his bicycle on the sidewalk at or near 3427 Griffith Park Blvd., Los Angeles,
CA 90027.  Pierry Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  The front tire of his bike struck a dangerous
change in elevation on the sidewalk. 
Pierry Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  Keliher
lost control and fell to the ground. 
Pierry Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  Injuries
included a fractured jaw with severe lacerations of his chin.  Pierry Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  
            On February 1, 2022, CLP retained
PLF to help represent Keliher.  Pierry
Decl., ¶14.  CLP sent PLF various case
materials for review, including photos of the Street.  Pierry Decl., ¶14.  On February 2, the firms agreed to work
together on the case.  Pierry Decl.,
¶17.  At the time, both firms were both
working remotely due to COVID-19.  Pierry
Decl., ¶¶ 16-17.  This led to the
collapse of communication and of longstanding procedures.  Pierry Decl., ¶16.
            Pierry emailed Campos to calendar
the six-month government tort claim for Keliher.  Pierry Decl., ¶17, Ex. 1.  Pierry forwarded this email to Cohen to remind
him to calendar the deadline.  Pierry
Decl., ¶17, Ex. 1.  Cohen interpreted the
email to mean that PLF was going to calendar the six-month date and file the
Notice of Claim. Pierry Decl., ¶17, Ex. 2; Cohen Decl., ¶5.  Cohen therefore never filed the claim.  Pierry Decl., ¶17.  
            Because PLF was working remotely, Pierry
did not generate his usual paper memo to his associate and PLF did not calendar
the follow-up event ten days after such memo. 
Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶6. 
Campos never saw Pierry’s email, and PLF never calendared the claim
deadline.  Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos
Decl., ¶5.  Working remotely also caused
Cohen to fail to calendar the deadline. 
Cohen Decl., ¶3.  As a result, neither
firm filed a timely notice of claim with the City.  Pierry Decl., ¶19.
            Upon realizing the defect, on
October 7, 2022, Keliher submitted a Notice of Claim to the City.  Pierry Decl., Ex. 3.  On October 24, 2022, the City rejected it as
untimely and advised Keliher to apply for leave to present a late claim.  Pierry Decl., Ex. 4.  
            On January 23, 2023, Keliher applied
for leave to present a late claim to the City. 
Pierry Decl., Ex. 5.  The City
denied it on March 6, 2023.  Pierry
Decl., Ex. 6.  
            This was the first time in the
firms’ partnership that they missed a deadline to file a government tort claim.
 Pierry Decl., ¶15.  To remedy this, PLF calendar emails now
require a received notice and a notification that the email was read.  Campos Decl., ¶7.  Campos must also send Pierry a return email
stating he has calendared the requested date. 
Campos Decl., ¶7.
            
            D. Analysis
            Petitioner Keliher seeks leave to
present a late claim to the City.  No
opposition is on file.
            
            1. Accrual of the Claim
            A cause of action accrues at the
time a claim is complete with all of its elements.  Norgart v. Upjohn, (1999) 21 Cal.4th
383, 397.  An exception to this usual
rule exists where accrual is delayed until the plaintiff discovers, or has
reason to discover, the cause of action. 
Id.  A plaintiff has reason
to discover a cause of action when he or she “has reason to at least suspect a
factual basis for its elements.”  Id.             
            Keliher’s injury occurred on January
30, 2022.  Pierry Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  The claim accrued on that date.
 
            2. Presentation of the Claim
            Section 911.2 mandates that claims
based on causes of action for death and personal injury must be presented “not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  To be timely, Keliher was required to present
his claim to the City within six months of January 30, 2022, or by July 30, 2022.  §911.2.
            Keliher filed the Notice of Claim
with the City on October 7, 2022.  Pierry
Decl., Ex. 3.  Keliher did not present a
timely claim to the City.
 
            3. Application for Leave to
Present a Late Claim
            If a plaintiff fails to file a
government claim within the six-month period, he or she may apply to the public
entity for permission to file a late claim.  §911.4. 
Such an application must be presented within a reasonable time, and not
later than one year after the cause of action’s accrual.  §911.4(b). 

            On January 23, 2023, Keliher applied
for leave to present a late claim to the City. 
Pierry Decl., Ex. 5.  Because this
was before January 30, 2023, it was less than a year after the accrual of the
cause of action.  As there is no
opposition, there is no argument that the delay in making the application to
file a late claim was unreasonable.  The
application is not time-barred.
            
            4. The Petition is Timely



            If the public entity denies the
application for permission to file a late claim, the plaintiff may file a civil
petition for relief from section 945.4’s requirement of timely claim
presentation prior to suit.  §946.6.  The petition must be filed within six months
after the application to the public entity is denied or deemed to be
denied.  §946.6(b).
            The City denied Keliher’s
application on March 6, 2023.  Pierry
Decl., Ex. 6.  Keliher commenced this
action on June 15, 2023, a little over three months later.  His Petition is timely.
            
            5. The Failure to Timely Present
the Claim Was the Result of Mistake, Inadvertence, Surprise, or Excusable Neglect

            The court may grant relief if it
finds that the failure to timely present the claim was through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, unless the public entity
establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the court
relieves the petitioner from the requirements of section 945.4.  §946.6(c)(1).
            Timely compliance with claim
presentation is a mandatory prerequisite to maintaining a cause of action
against a public entity and failure to file a claim is fatal to the claimant’s
cause of action.  Pacific Telegraph
& Telephone Co. v. County of Riverside, (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 83, 188; San
Leandro Police Officers Assoc. v. City of San Leandro, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d
553.  Ignorance of the claim filing
deadline is no excuse.  Harrison v.
Count of Del Norte, (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1, 7; Drummond v. County of Fresno,
(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1412. 
Excusable neglect is neglect which might have been the act of a
reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances.  Ebersol v. Cowan, (1983) 35 Cal.3d
427, 435.  Mere failure to discover a
fact does not constitute excusable neglect for failing to present a timely
claim; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to discover the fact
in the exercise of reasonable diligence. 
Munoz, supra, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1783.  “Excusable neglect” is defined as an act or
omission that might be expected of a prudent person under similar
circumstances.  Department of Water
& Power v. Superior Court, (“DWP”) (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288,
1294.
Once a party retains counsel, that attorney must diligently
investigate facts, identify possible defendants, and timely file the
claim.  Ebersol, supra, 35
Cal.3d at 439.  Calendar errors by an
attorney or a member of his staff are excusable under appropriate circumstances
but not every mistake of an attorney constitutes excusable neglect.  Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles, (1967)
249 Cal. App. 2d 976, 980.  A mere
mistake of counsel does not provide basis for granting relief.  Tackett v. City of Huntington Beach,
(1994) 22 Cal. App. 4th 60, 64-65.  
            Keliher’s counsel consisted of two
firms, CLP and PLF, who have worked as co-counsel on numerous government tort
claims since 2013.  Pierry Decl., ¶15.  They have always assigned one firm to file
the claim forms, and they circulate an email confirming which one would handle
the forms for a particular case.  Pierry
Decl., ¶16; Cohen Decl., ¶5.  PLF’s
partner Pierry would then ask his assistant Campos to calendar the deadline and
a series of reminders beforehand.  Pierry
Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.  Pierry
also generates a paper memo for Campos and calendar a follow-up date ten days
after the memo.  Pierry Decl., ¶18;
Campos Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  Cohen would tell
his own paralegal to calendar the six-month deadline for CLP.  Cohen Decl., ¶3.
            The firms did not follow this
practice when working remotely on Keliher’s case.[3]  Pierry Decl., ¶¶ 16-17.  This led to the collapse of communication and
longstanding procedures.  Pierry Decl.,
¶16.  Campos did not receive the email to
calendar the deadline, and there was no written memo when working remotely.  Pierry Decl., ¶18; Campos Decl., ¶6.  Cohen also failed to calendar the
deadline.  Cohen Decl., ¶3.  This caused neither firm to file a timely
notice of claim with the City.  Pierry
Decl., ¶19.
            In Flores v. Board of Supervisors,
(1970) 13 Cal. App. 3d 480, 483, the plaintiffs contacted counsel about
representation for a medical malpractice suit for their child’s death, counsel
advised them that they only had 18 days left to file suit.  Id. at 482.  The firm knew that it needed to act quickly
to meet this deadline and sought medical records.  Id. 
However, the plaintiff’s law firm failed to file a timely claim because
it failed to open a file which would have reminded it of the 100-day limitation
in effect.  Id.  Thereafter, the attorneys diligently followed
statutory requirements in pressing plaintiffs’ claim.  Id. 
The court held that this was excusable neglect.  Id. at 485.
            In Renteria v. Juvenile Justice,
Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, (“Renteria”) (2006)
135 Cal. App. 4th 903, 906, an incarcerated youth claimed that he was bitten by
a Department of Corrections dog.  In
support of a late claim petition, the law firm representing him presented
evidence that its secretary removed the six-month public entity statute of
limitations from its calendaring system. 
Id. at 907.  She had
received a letter from the Attorney General’s office concerning the
preservation of evidence which made her believe that a paralegal had served the
governmental claim.  Id.  She therefore removed the six-month deadline
from the law firm’s calendaring system.  Id.  The court granted late claim relief, noting
that generally lawyers who adopt a system or plan by which their duties may be
directed to their attention, and who are accustomed to the functioning of that
system, should not be held to the same strict accountability when there is a
break in that system as those for whom no system has been formed. Id. at
912.  
As Kekiher asserts, the law firms have a system in place for
presenting claims.  This system broke
down due to the remote work caused initial by COVID.  As in Renteria, they should not be
held to the same strict accountability as though the habit of reliance upon the
system had not been formed.  The failure to
timely present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  Because no opposition
was filed, the court need not consider whether granting the Petition would
prejudice the City.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The failure of Keliher’s attorneys to
present a timely claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.  The Petition for relief from
claim filing requirements is granted. Keliher is ordered to file all exhibits
supporting his declarations.
