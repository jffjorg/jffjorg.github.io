  Case Number:  22STCP04419    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  85 
 
Elia Cisneros v. Commission
on Teacher Credentialing State of California, 22STCP04419

 
Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:   denied



 
 
            Petitioner
Elia Cisneros, aka Elvia Duenas (“Cisneros”), seeks a writ of mandate
compelling Respondent Commission on Teacher Credentialing (“Commission”) to set
aside its decision revoking her credentials. 

            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. The Petition
            Petitioner
Cisneros commenced this proceeding on December 19, 2022, alleging a cause of
action for administrative mandamus.  The verified
Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
December 3, 2003, the Commission issued a Clear Multiple Subject Teaching
Credential to Cisneros.  On November 19,
2018, Cisneros applied for a Clear
Multiple Subject Teaching Credential with an added authorization in English.
            In
the 2016-17 school year, Cisneros worked as an academic coach in the English
Language Learners (“EL”) Department of the Bakersfield City School District (“District”).  In early 2017, the EL Department learned that
it would be disbanded and reconstituted. 
This restructuring included the promotion of Cisneros’ supervisor, Erick
Casallas (“Casallas”), to school principal. 
            EL
Department academic coaches were assigned to different district school sites
and spent most of the day at those sites. 
The EL Department’s office space has no cubicles, and EL Department
employees can use their own login information on any computer to print mailing labels.
            On
November 27, 2017, the District discovered a letter purportedly from Casallas in
Spanish (the “Letter”) that someone had mailed out in District envelopes.  The Letter said that he was gay, he loved
boys, and it invited parents to a school board meeting to discuss his sexual
orientation.  The Letter included a
picture from social media of Casallas with his male partner.  The District Superintendent Office’s phone
number was on the back of the Letter. 
Someone also distributed the letter by text and social media to parents
and former and current students. 
Casallas did not know about the Letter until an employee sent him a
photo of it.
            The
District’s investigation named only Cisneros as a possible suspect.  The District made a police report to the San
Bernardino Police Department to that effect. 
On December 28, 2017, the Kern County District Attorney's Office filed
charges against Cisneros of petty theft and embezzlement.  On September 21, 2018, the District Attorney's
Office dismissed the criminal charges against Cisneros.
            On
January 23, 2018, District filed a Statement of Charges to dismiss Cisneros, and
she resigned instead of disputing them.  
            On
April 2, 2021, the Commission filed an Accusation and Statement of Issues (the “Accusation”)
against Cisneros.  The Administrative Law
Judge (“ALJ”) heard the Accusation on January 18 and 19, 2022.
            On
March 22, 2022, the ALJ issued a Proposed Decision.  On June 24, the Commission notified Cisneros
that it had rejected the Proposed Decision pending further argument and review
of the record.  After further argument,
on November 20, 2022, the Commission issued a Decision revoking Cisneros’
credentials.
            Cisneros
seeks a writ of mandate compelling the Commission to set aside the Decision,
plus an award of attorney’s fees and costs in excess of $20,000.
 
            2. Course
of Proceedings
            On
December 20, 2022, Cisneros served the Commission with the Petition.
            On
January 19, 2023, the Commission filed an Answer.
 
            B.
Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
            CCP
section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence. Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”)
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143; see CCP
§1094.5(c).  An administrative decision imposing
discipline on a professional licensee is decided under the independent judgment
standard.  Griffiths v. Superior Court, (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 757,
767. 

            Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
            “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with the
agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51;
Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative
decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691. 
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga,
supra, 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15. 
Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set
forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
decision or order.  Id. at 115.
            The standard of
proof in administrative proceeding is relevant to judicial review in
mandamus.  Li v. Superior Court (Sacramento County, (2021) 69
Cal.App.5th 836, 844.  Where
the administrative burden of proof is clear and convincing evidence, the trial
court must account for that standard of proof when exercising its independent
judgment on the sufficiency of the evidence. 
Id. at 865.   The trial court must
apply the principles of deference and presumptive correctness in deciding whether
the findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere
preponderance of the evidence.  Id.
 
            C.
Governing Law
            1.
Education Code
            The
Commission may revoke a teacher’s credentials due to immoral or unprofessional
conduct, evident unfitness for service, or any cause that would have warranted
the denial of an application for such credentials or their renewal.  Education Code[2]
§44421.  
            “Immoral”
conduct is that which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and
contrary to good morals, including conduct inconsistent with rectitude or
indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, or dissoluteness.  Orloff v. Los Angeles Turf Club,
(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740.
            “Unprofessional
conduct” is conduct which violates the rules or ethical code of a profession or
such conduct which is unbecoming a member of a profession in good
standing.  Board of Education of the
City of Los Angeles v. Swan, (1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 553.
            The
concept of moral turpitude defies exact description but includes acts of
baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man
owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and
customary rule of right and duty between men. 
Clerid v. Department of Motor Vehicles, (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d
1016, 1027.
 
            2.
Administrative Hearing Procedure
            Within
100 days of receipt by an agency of the ALJ’s proposed decision, the agency may
(1) adopt the proposed decision in its entirety, (2) reduce or otherwise
mitigate the proposed penalty and adopt the balance of the proposed decision,
(3) make technical or other minor changes in the proposed decision and adopt it
as the decision, (4) reject the proposed decision and refer the case to the
same administrative law judge if reasonably available, otherwise to another
administrative law judge, to take additional evidence, or (5) reject the
proposed decision and decide the case upon the record, including the
transcript, or upon an agreed statement of the parties, with or without taking
additional evidence.  Government Code
(“Govt. Code”) §11517(c)(2).
            If
the agency chooses to decide the case upon the record, it must (1) make a copy
of the record available to all parties (Govt. Code §11517(c)(2)(E)(i)), (2) not
decide any case without affording the parties the opportunity to present either
oral or written argument before the agency itself (Govt. Code
§11517(c)(2)(E)(ii)), and (3) issue its final decision not later than 100 days
after rejection of the proposed decision (Govt. Code §11517(c)(2)(E)(iv)).   
             
            D. Statement of Facts[3]
1. The Letter
            On November 27, 2017, the
District learned about the Letter sent via U.S. mail to parents of students at Voorhies
Elementary School (“Voorhies”).  AR 183, 265,
268.  The letter was in Spanish and
impersonated Casallas, introducing himself as Voorhies’s new principal.  AR 183, 265, 268.  The Letter said that Casallas was a gay man
who loved boys and would have them close to him.  AR 183, 268. 
He invited anyone who considered that a problem to come to a board
meeting to express their opinions.  AR 183-84,
265.  The label on the back of the
envelopes advised recipients to call the number for the District Superintendent’s
Office.  AR 184, 266.
            On November 25, 2017,
Casallas filed a police report with the Bakersfield Police Department.  AR 175. 
On December 28, 2017, Cisneros was charged in Kern County Superior Court
with misdemeanor violations of Penal Code sections 488 (petty theft) and 503
(embezzlement of $950 or less).  AR
175.  On September 21, 2018, the criminal
case against Cisneros was dismissed.  AR
175.
On November 28,
2017, the District notified Cisneros that she was being placed on paid
administrative leave, effective that day. 
AR 316.  The notice explained that
the District would investigate allegations of inappropriate use of District
property and unauthorized distribution of communication to parents.  AR 316.
 
            2. The District’s Investigation
            Erin Johnston
(“Johnston”) was assigned by the District to investigate who wrote the Letter.  On January 19, 2018, Johnston released a
summary of her investigation.  AR 268.
            Johnston interviewed Casallas,
who said that Jayme Cook, a Vorhees teacher and mother to a Voorhies student,
told him about the Letter and sent him a screenshot of it.  AR 268. 
Casallas knew that someone had distributed the Letter via text messages
and Facebook.  AR 268-69.  The Letter included a picture of Casallas and
his partner, which his partner uses as a Facebook and Snapchat profile
picture.  AR 184, 269.  
            Casallas said that the
parents who approached him did not believe that he wrote the Letter.  AR 269. 
Casallas said he could only think of two people with motive: Cisneros
and Jorge Solis (“Solis”).  AR 269.  Cisneros was upset when her position was
dissolved and was returned to a classroom for the 2017-2018 school year.  AR 269. 
She also frequently asked for time off to go to doctor’s appointments in
Santa Barbara (where the Letter was postmarked).  AR 269. 
Solis was dismissed in January 2017 after failing his probationary
period.  AR 269.  Casallas said that employees in the EL Department,
including both suspects, would have easy access to the envelopes.  AR 269.
            Johnston conducted interviews
of Voorhis employees beginning on November 27, 2017, including Cisneros, Secretary
Linda Villalpando (“Villalpando”), Program Specialist Courtney McMahon (“McMahon”),
EL Department Director Beatrice Castilleja-Gray (“Castilleja-Gray”), Technology
Data and Assessment Analyst Tina Mendez (“Mendez”), Instructional Specialist
Maldonado, Lead Language Assessor Ana Hensen (“Hensen”), Coordinator of Migrant
Education Janie Flores (“Flores”), Academic Coach Holly Hinh (“Hinh”), and Academic
Coach Jane Ferdinand (“Ferdinand”).  AR
269, 270, 273, 275, 276-278, 281, 283.
 
            a. Cisneros
            Cisneros was first
interviewed on November 28, 2017.  AR
270.  Cisneros said that she was one of
four academic coaches.  AR 270.  She had a cordial relationship with
Casallas.  AR 270.  When asked if that changed when Casallas
accused her of falsifying his letter of recommendation, she brought her concern
to the teachers’ union, knew that she was not going to work in the EL
Department for long, and patched it up with Casallas.  AR 270. 

Cisneros asserted
that, although she helped send mass mailers for EL Department events, she did
not prepare envelopes or labels.  AR
271.  Villalpando prepared them because it
required use of the machines in the back of the office.  AR 271. 
Cisneros never received training on how to prepare those labels.  AR 271.
            Johnston asked why a
mass production of labels would appear on Cisneros’ computer.  AR 271. 
Cisneros said that, although her computer was password protected,
Villalpando and Ferdinand had her password. 
AR 271.  She stated that Villalpando
showed her how to print labels, but then stated that Villalpando would print
the labels because she (Cisneros) did not know how.  AR 271.
            When asked where she was
during the Thanksgiving vacation, Cisneros said that she was visiting an uncle
in Baja, California and stopped to visit a sister in Ventura County on the day
before Thanksgiving.  AR 272.  She returned to Bakersfield on Saturday.  AR 272.
            Cisneros swore on her
father’s grave that she did not prepare the Letter, the envelopes, or the labels.  AR 272. 

            During a second
interview on December 6, 2017, Cisneros confirmed that her last day of work
with the EL Department was June 8, 2017. 
AR 279.  She stated that she only
went back on one occasion to speak with the Migrant Office and stated that she
could not remember if she used the copy machine during the month of June.  AR 279. 

Cisneros admitted
writing a different letter in 11-point Calibri font, the same size and font as
the letter.  AR 279.  She first denied going to Santa Barbara during
Thanksgiving weekend, then retracted that statement and said that she went to a
medical clinic in Santa Barbara on November 20, 2017, the Monday before
Thanksgiving.  AR 279.
            Cisneros admitted that
her relationship with Casallas was rocky. 
AR 279.
 
            b. Villalpando
            Villalpando stated that Cisneros
prepared her own paperwork and was good at running labels and printed her own.  AR 272. 
Villalpando only had to help Hinh and another employee on occasion with
labels.  AR 272.
            Cisneros always
questioned Casallas’ authority and she did not want to substitute teach when
there was a shortage.  AR 276.  Cisneros did not react well when she was told
she was going back into the classroom for the 2017-2018 school year due to
restructuring.  AR 276.  Cisneros was well aware that Casallas was
going to Voorhies and that it was not his decision to dissolve her
position.  AR 276.
 
            c. McMahon
            In her November 28, 2017
interview, McMahon said that Cisneros often was not where she said she would be
and Casallas had to speak with her about it. 
Cisneros was upset that she was losing her position at the end of the
school year.  AR 274.  McMahon always went to Villalpando for help
with labels.  Cisneros often sent letters
to parents and ran her own labels.  AR
274.
            Solis is gay and would
not have written such a letter based on its content.  AR 274. 
She would not put it past him to have helped Cisneros, however.  AR 274.
            In a December 5, 2017
telephonic follow-up interview, McMahon stated that this past summer she and
Maldonado were the only two EL Department members still working because they
were providing staff training.  AR
278.  One day, Maldonado texted McMahon
and asked why Cisneros was working in the office.  AR 278. 
McMahon responded that she did not know. 
AR 278.  
            On one occasion, McMahon
also saw Cisneros working in the EL Department, but she knew this was not the
first day Cisneros had been there working late. 
AR 278.  Cisneros seemed to be
making a lot of copies of the same thing, but McMahon did not look at it or
speak to her because they did not have a good relationship.  AR 278. 
Cisneros had no business being in the EL Department.  AR 278.
 
            d. Mendez and Maldonado
            Cisneros once sent an
upsetting letter to parents.  AR
276.  The letter scared those parents
into thinking their children would not be reclassified and they needed to attend
a parent training that Cisneros was putting on. 
AR 276.  No one in the EL
Department was aware that Cisneros sent out the letter, and it was sent as if
it was coming from Casallas.  AR 276.
 
            e. Conclusion
Johnston concluded
that, although Cisneros denied it, there was sufficient evidence that she
prepared and sent the Letter.  AR 284.
 
3. Burks’
Deposition 
            On March 21, 2018, Cisneros
deposed Robert Burks (“Burks”).  AR
429.  Burks was the Assistant Director of
Information Technology (“IT”).  AR 633-34.
            Cisneros asked Burks
about a November 27, 2017 email stating: “It appears 35 people ran that particular
label that is formatted differently.”  AR
428.  Burks explained that meant 35
people ran a collection of multiple reports that produced labels with the name format
that started with the first name, showed the middle initial, and ended with the
last name.  AR 429.  
            Burks could only
remember one of the men, Chris Holloway (“Holloway”), who ran these labels
specifically for Voorhies.  AR 429. 
Burks did not think the other was Solis. 
AR 429.
 
            4. The Discipline
            In September 2018,
Cisneros and the District signed a Resignation Agreement and Release of all
Claims (“Resignation”).  AR 359, 361.  The District agreed to cancel the pending
dismissal proceedings if Cisneros resigned and relinquished any right she might
have to reinstatement in District employment for any position.  AR 360. 
She agreed not reapply for District employment or seek any other
business relationship with the District. 
AR 360.
                        
            5. The Accusation
            On November 19, 2018,
the Commission received Cisneros’ application for a Clear Multiple Subject
Teaching Credential with an added authorization in English (the “Application”).  AR 133
            On April 2, 2021, the
Commission’s Executive Director (“Complainant”) filed an Accusation against
Cisneros.  AR 143.  The Complainant sought both denial of her
Application and revocation of her existing credentials.  AR 143. 
The causes of discipline for revocation included unprofessional conduct,
immoral conduct, and acts of moral turpitude. 
AR 142.  The Accusation alleged acts
of moral turpitude as a cause for denial of the Application.  AR 143. 

 
            6. The Hearing
            An ALJ heard the
Accusation on January 18 and 19, 2022. 
AR 83.  Pertinent documentary
evidence and testimony is as follows.
 
            a. Johnston
            Cisneros’
last day of work with the EL Department was June 8, 2017.  AR 544.  Close to 600 Voorhies families received the Letter.  AR 566.
            When
the EL Department was disbanded, Casallas was reassigned to be Voorhies’
principal.  AR 571.  This was not a demotion and was more akin to
a lateral reassignment.  AR 571.  Casallas never said that he was upset about
the reassignment.  AR 571.  Johnston never investigated whether anyone
who wanted the position was responsible. 
AR 572.
            When
asked who had a positive motive, Casallas could only think of Cisneros and
Solis.  AR 530.  Casallas had previously disciplined
Solis.  AR 571.  Because Solis had been dismissed in January 2017
and the address labels were printed in May, he was ruled out.  AR 530, 534-35.  
            IT
confirmed that the labels were generated from Cisneros’ computer using her
password.  AR 538.  Her computer was password protected.  AR 538. 
Cisneros said that Villalpando and Ferdinand had her password and the
District wanted to rule out anyone’s access to Cisneros’ computer.  AR 539. 

Johnston understood that, of the academic coaches, only
Cisneros ran her own labels.  AR
575.  According to Burks, the labels used
to send the Letter match labels printed on April 27 and May 18, 2017.  AR 578. 
Johnston found that only Cisneros and Villalpando ran labels in the EL
Department.  AR 575.  Johnston never compared the labels printed
for the Letter to labels Cisneros had previously printed because she did not
have any old labels to make such a comparison. 
AR 579.
            When
Johnston interviewed Cisneros on November 28, 2017, Cisneros denied sending the
Letter.  AR 542.  Johnston asked her where she was during
Thanksgiving break.  AR 541.  Cisneros said she visited an uncle in Baja California
and a sister in Ventura.  AR 541.  She did not say she was in Santa
Barbara.  AR 541.  In a December 6, 2017 interview, Cisneros
admitted that she was in Santa Barbara at some point during Thanksgiving.  AR 549-50.
            Johnston
did not have anyone check if there was surveillance footage or fingerprints on
the drop mailbox in Santa Barbara that was used to send the Letter.  AR 589. 
She did not recall if she investigated Cisnero’s alibi that she was at
an off-site training on May 18, 2017.  AR
591.
            Cisneros
showed Johnston a document reflecting that she had a doctor's appointment in
Santa Barbara on November 20, 2017.  AR
595.  Johnston could not determine Cisneros’s
whereabouts on November 21 or 22, 2017. 
AR 583, 595.  
            Nobody
saw Cisneros write the Letter, print the label reports in April or May 2017, or
take 600 envelopes from the District office. 
AR 595-96.  Johnston believed Cisneros
did these things because she had no evidence to the contrary.  AR 596. 
Cisneros was the most likely suspect, she was in the area at some point,
it was within a reasonable timeline, and she had some motive.  AR 596.
            
            b.
Casallas
            Casallas’s
interactions with Cisneros as her supervisor were professional but sometimes
awkward.  AR 607.  She did not like to be supervised, overly
managed, or receive feedback.  AR 607.  It reached a point where their conversations
stopped being positive.  AR 607.  Her honesty was questionable.  AR 607. 
She would sometimes say she was going to school sites but not report
there, or she would say that she was there for two hours and really was there
only 15 minutes.  AR 607.
            At
the end of 2015, Cisneros asked Casallas for a letter of recommendation for
employment in the school district her children attended.  AR 608. 
He agreed to write it.  AR
608.  In 2017, various smaller issues
made Casallas feel that the contents of the letter were no longer valid.  AR 609. 
He called Human Resources, which told him that Cisneros had submitted a
letter of recommendation from him just two weeks earlier.  AR 609.  He had not done so.  AR 609-10. 
He checked the letter and found that it was the same letter he had
written in 215 with the date changed.  AR
610.
            Cisneros
did not react with animosity toward Casallas when she learned her position was
being eliminated.  AR 613.  All his performance evaluations for Cisneros
were positive.  AR 618.
            When
Johnston asked Casallas who may have written the Letter, he said Cisneros.  AR 614. 
He does not feel like he has enemies, but there was a lot of bad blood
in the air.  AR 614.  If anyone was going to do something like
that, it probably would be her.  AR 614.
            It
was not common for EL Department academic coaches to run label reports.  AR 627. 
Only Cisneros and the secretary did so. 
AR 627.  Cisneros held a lot of
parent sessions, and Casallas wanted to support that.  AR 627. 
Everyone in the EL Department had access to label reports, but not
everyone used it.  AR 628.
 
            c.
Burks
            Burks
was asked to determine who made the labels; he was not asked to determine who
wrote the Letter.   AR 636.  He later learned that the Letter had been
sent to Vorhees alumni who had gone on to middle school.  AR 636. 
This was important because it told him a school year to look at.  AR 637.
            Burks
noticed the labels displayed the names by first name, then middle, then
last.  AR 637.  This was uncommon because most labels start
with the last name, then first, then middle initial.  AR 637. 
In the computer system they use, only two or three label generators
would start with the first name.  AR 637.
            Burks
narrowed down who generated the labels to three people.  AR 639. 
Halloway, a database administrator, had run that label report twice at
the beginning of the school year within a few minutes of each other.  AR 639. 
This was most likely testing.  AR
639.  The other two possible generators
of the labels were Cisneros and a name Burks could not remember.  AR 639.
            Burks
knew that Cisneros’s account generated the label reports on April 27 and May
18, 2017.  AR 652.  He could not say for certain that Cisneros was
the person using her account.  AR
652.  It is also possible to run a label
report on one occasion but not print the labels until another day.  AR 652. 
This meant the labels printed on April 27 and May 18, 2017 could have
used label reports made some period earlier. 
AR 655.
            Burks
knew that the envelopes used the send the Letter were available somewhere in
the District building, but he did not know where.  AR 658.
            Burks
was very confident that on May 18, 2017 Cisneros generated the labels used to
send the Letter.  AR 663.
 
            d.
Villalpando
            Villalpando
worked with Cisneros on a daily basis and never saw anyone else use Cisneros’
computer.  AR 669.  The EL Department employees all were aware if
anyone had used their computers.  AR 669.  It was not common practice to share passwords
for employee accounts.  AR 668.   
Villapando did not recall that Cisneros ever gave her
computer login and password to Villalpando. 
AR 668.  Even if Cisneros had, Villalpando
had no reason to generate address labels for Vorhees on May 17, 2017.  AR 668. 
Villalpando printed labels as part of her job duties.  AR 681. 
She never generated address labels for Voorhies students for another
year.  AR 668.  Villalpando never saw Cisneros print a label
report for Voorhies.  AR 683.  
            Although
Villalpando and Cisneros had a cordial relationship for the first few years,
Villalpando soon grew to not trust her. 
AR 670.  It started with things
Cisneros would say or do without being illegal. 
AR 670.  She started doing
personal tasks while at work and contradicting herself as to where she was
going to be.  AR 670-71.  Villalpando once saw Cisneros shopping at
Costco when she was supposed to be on assignment somewhere else.  AR 672. 
Another time, she saw Cisneros leave the District in her car when she
said she was just going to see Human Resources. 
AR 672-73.
            All
EL Department and District staff had access to envelopes used to mail the Letter.  AR 683. 
They were in an office cupboard, but the cupboard was unlocked.  AR 683. 

She never saw Cisneros print letters mailed to District
students and employees.  AR 683.  She never saw Cisneros mail the envelopes
containing the Letter.  AR 684.  Villalpando never saw Cisneros in the EL
Department office after June 8, 2017.  AR
682.
            After
Cisneros left the EL Department, she sent Villalpando a text threatening her
family for her role in the District investigation and Cisneros’
unemployment.  AR 674-75.  
 
            e.
Ferdinand
            When
he was an academic coach, he had his own login and password.  AR 692. 
Cisneros never gave Ferdinand her login information.  AR 692. 
Ferdinand does not know of anyone with whom Cisneros shared her password
and username.  AR 692-93.  He never used her computer and does not know
that anyone else did.  AR 692.
            As
an academic coach, he would only have reason to create address labels for
schools assigned to him.  AR 693.  Villalpando was their secretary, and she ran
label reports for him.  AR 694.  He did not send the Letter.  AR 693.
 
            f.
Icardo
            Icardo
was an academic coach until July 1, 2017. 
AR 697.  She worked with Cisneros
for five years.  AR 697.   Cisneros never gave Icardo her login
information.  AR 699.  Icardo never used Cisneros’ computer or saw
anyone else use it.  AR 699-700.  It was not common practice to share
computers.  AR 700.  They each had their own beautiful
computer.  AR 700.
 
            g.
Hinh
EL Department coaches spent the day visiting school sites to
support principals, teachers, and students. 
AR 706.  Whether Hinh saw Cisneros
varied by day.  AR 706.
            Hinh
had her own EL Department login, and policy prohibited sharing it.  AR 707-08. 
Cisneros never shared her login with Hinh, and Hinh does not know anyone
else she shared it with.  AR 708.
            When
the EL Department academic coaches learned they would no longer be coaches,
they were upset to varying degrees.  AR
713-14.  They were not losing their jobs insofar
as they would remain teachers, but two of them did retire instead.  AR 714.
 
            h.
Maldonado
            When
Maldonado started working in the EL Department in 2016, she observed a few
interactions between Cisneros and Casillas. 
AR 729-30.  Those moments created
a hostile work environment.  AR 729.  Cisneros did not speak to Casillas in a
professional way, and she always tried to do the opposite of whatever he
said.  AR 730.
            In
2017, the District chose to eliminate the EL Department’s academic coaching
positions.  AR 730.  Cisneros was the only coach who was very
upset about this.  AR 731.  She blamed Casillas and thought the decision
was made against her personally.  AR 731.  She was very vocal about it.  AR 731. 
The decision came from the superintendent and other superiors; Casillas
did not decide to eliminate the coaching positions.  AR 732. 

            EL
Department employees signed a document of privacy promising not to share
passwords to their accounts.  AR
732-33.  Cisneros never shared her login
with Maldonado, and Maldonado does not know anyone else with whom she shared
it.  AR 733.  She never saw anyone else use Cisneros’
computer.  AR 733.
            In
either June or July 2017, after she learned the coaching positions were
eliminated, Maldonado saw Cisneros printing letters in the EL Department
offices on a couple of occasions.  AR
733.  On one occasion she saw Cisneros
with a rolling cart.  AR 734.  Between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m., she then saw her
printing labels from her computer printer. 
AR 734.  At the same time, Cisneros
was making a large number of copies on the copier.  AR 734-35. 
She did not see the content of what Cisneros was printing and copying.  AR 739. 
This was after Cisneros’ position had been eliminated and she had taken
all her personal stuff.  AR 735.  Cisneros became upset that Maldonaldo was
there and asked why.  AR 735.  Cisneros acted like she was not expecting
anyone else to be there at the time.  AR
735.  
            Maldonado
texted McMahan, the program specialist, to let her know that Cisneros was in
the office.  AR 739.  She had instructions to document the date and
time she saw Cisneros, but she did not because she was so busy and did not
think anything of the incident.  AR
739-40.
 
            i.
McMahon
            McMahon
was an academic coach at the District. 
AR 788.  At the time of the incident,
the EL Department had five coaches: Hinh, Icardo, McMahon, Casallas, and Mendez.  AR 791-92. 
There was also a secretary, Villalpando. 
AR 792.
            EL
Department employees were not supposed to share passwords to their
accounts.  AR 792.  Cisneros never shared her login with McMahon,
and McMahon does not know anyone else she shared it with.  AR 792-93. 
No one else used Cisneros’ computer. 
AR 793.
            It
was commonplace for EL Department staff to run label reports, although McMahon
did not personally do so.  AR 803.  McMahon was not aware of secretaries running label
reports, although Villalpando may have done so. 
AR 803-04.
            Sometime
toward the end of June or the beginning of July 2017, McMahon reported that she
saw Cisneros inside the EL Department office. 
AR 804.  Maldonado was with
her.   AR 805.  Cisneros was copying or printing something,
but McMahon could not see what it was. 
AR 805.  She and Cisneros did not
speak to each other on that occasion.  AR
805.  
            During
the District’s investigation, McMahon produced pictures posted on Facebook that
showed Cisneros at a landmark restaurant in Santa Barbara in November
2017.  AR 796, 798-99.
            She
believed the postmarks show the Letter was mailed from Ventura County.  AR 799. 
McMahon tried to place Cisneros in Santa Barbar because she was the only
one who disliked Casallas enough to write the Letter.  AR 799, 812-13.  She never saw Cisneros write the Letter, print
its label reports, take the 600 envelopes, or mail the Letter.  AR 813.
 
            j.
Mendez
            In
the five years Mendez worked with Cisneros, she never saw Cisneros share her
computer login information.  AR 831.  She also never saw anyone use Cisneros’
computer.  AR 831.
 
            k.
Cisneros
            She
never saw the Letter until her second interview in December 2017.  AR 919.
Cisneros shared her EL Department computer password with
Icardo and Ferdinand.  AR 856.  Villalpando also would have had it.  AR 856. 
IT also would have had it. AR 856.
            Cisneros’
flight itinerary shows that she was in Mexico from June 24 to July 8,
2017.  AR 881.  Her calendar for April and May 2017 is 100%
accurate.  AR 497-98, 897.
            On
Thanksgiving week, she was in Ventura County and returned to Bakersfield on
November 21, 2017.  AR 917. Cisneros was
confronted with Johnston’s testimony that Cisneros said in her November 28,
2017 interview that she spent Thanksgiving in Baja California and then with her
sister in Ventura County.  AR 914.  Cisneros initially stated that Johnston
misunderstood, and that her testimony was false.  AR 915. 
Cisneros subsequently testified that Johnston was lying.  AR 919. 

She never told Johnston that she was in Santa Barbara for
the week; she told her that she was visiting her sister in Santa Barbara but
failed to realize that her sister lives in Ventura County.  AR 918. 
She went to a doctor’s appointment in Santa Barbara on Monday, November
20, 2017.  AR 918.  Johnston lied when she testified that
Cisneros never mentioned Santa Barbara in the interview. AR 918-19.
Villalpando also was lying when she testified that Cisneros texted
and threatened her and her family for her role in the incident.  AR 923.
            
l. Cisneros’
Documentary Evidence
            Cisneros’ April and May
2017 calendars show that she was scheduled on May 18, 2017 to be out for the
“Renaissance/STAR 360 Program” from 9:00 a.m. thereafter.  AR 497-98.
            Printouts from Expedia
show that Cisneros booked flights between various cities in Mexico on June 24,
June 28, and July 7, 2017.  AR 491.
 
7. The ALJ’s Proposed Decision
            On
March 22, 2022, the ALJ issued a Proposed Decision recommending that the
Commission revoke Cisneros’ Clear Multiple Subject Teaching Credential and deny
the Application to add an English authorization.  AR 30. 
The Proposed Decision noted that Cisneros asserted Mendez, Villalpando,
Ferdinand, and Johnston all lied in their testimony.  AR 24. 
Her uncorroborated testimony alone did not raise sufficient doubt to
refute this clear and convincing evidence. 
AR 24.
            On
June 24, 2022, the Commission notified Cisneros that it had rejected the
Proposed Decision and would decide the case itself at a regularly scheduled Commission
meeting.  AR 31.  On July 6, Cisneros was notified that the
Commission had received the transcript of the administrative hearing and that
she was invited to submit written argument by August 15.  AR 33.
 
            6.
The Decision
            On
November 20, 2022, the Commission issued the Decision modifying two of the ALJ’s
factual findings and 11 of the legal conclusions.  AR 83-84, 110.  The Decision expanded the proposed revocation
to all credentials the Commission had issued Cisneros and denied her
application to add an English authorization to her Clear Multiple Subject
Teaching Credential.  AR 110.
 
            a.
Factual Findings
            During
the 2016-2017 academic year, Casallas was the EL Department’s supervisor.  AR 85. 
Casallas supervised the four academic coaches and other staff in the EL
Department.  AR 85.  Each academic coach was assigned to different
District school sites.  AR 85.  Cisneros started the 2016-2017 academic year
as the academic coach responsible for Voorhies. 
AR 85.  Academic coaches spent
part of the day in the EL Department office, but most visit their assigned
school to support students and staff.  AR
85.
            The
EL Department’s office space had no cubicles. 
AR 86.  Each staff member created
their own confidential computer login name and password.  AR 86. 
Although each employee had a separate computer, any EL Department
employee could use their own login information to log onto any of the
computers.  AR 86.  Coaches and secretaries alike could use those
computers to generate labels for mailings to parents of students at particular
schools.  AR 86.  Any EL Department staff member could access
the G&T Department’s envelopes stored in an unlocked cupboard.  AR 86.
            In
early 2017, the District informed Casallas that he would be reassigned as the
principal of Voorhies.  AR 86. The EL
Department’s four academic coach and program specialist positions would be
eliminated, and the four coaches and program specialist McMahan would be
permitted to apply for District teaching positions.  AR 86-87.
            To
demonstrate that Cisneros wrote and sent the Letter, the Complainant introduced
evidence that Cisneros had motive and opportunity and that no one else in the
EL Department did.   Everyone in the EL
Department testified.  AR 88-89.
            IT
Director Burk testified that the labels for the letter were in Arial font, the
font used by the District’s SIS program for most of its labels.  AR 89. 
The labels used the parent names with first name, middle name, and then
last name rather than the usual last name first that is used in most label
programs.  AR 89.  The text in the Letter suggested that the
labels were created with 2016-17 Voorhies enrollment information.  AR 90. 

            SIS
keeps a record of every time a label report is run, including the date and time
and user whose login was entered to run the report.  AR 90. Burks identified Holloway, Cisneros,
and a third person as the only ones whose logins showed that they ran the
program that could have generated these labels. 
AR 90.  He ran a spreadsheet showing
35 pertinent label reports.  AR 90.  The spreadsheet showed that on April 27, 2017
someone used Cisneros’ login to run these mailing labels.  AR 90. 
On May 18, someone used the same login to run a schoolwide student
address label report.  AR 90.  This report only runs when the user specifies
that the labels are to be sent to parents of students at a particular school.   AR 90. 

            Burks
is very confident that the May 18 labels were used to send the Letter to
Voorhies parents.   AR 91.  This May 18 date was close to the end of the
school year, and he did not know whether an academic coach would have reason to
generate labels so late in the school year. 
AR 91.  He acknowledged that
generated label reports can be saved and used to print labels at a later date.  AR 91. 
Thus, he acknowledged that label reports generated earlier than April 27
could have been used to mail the Letter. 
AR 91.  
Burks did not investigate who had access to Cisnero’s
login.  AR 92.  He acknowledged that he cannot be certain
Cisneros generated the labels.  AR
92.  However, his evidence supports the
conclusion that Cisneros’ login and password were used to generate the labels
to send the Letter.  AR 92.
            The
other academic coaches and EL Department employees all testified that they had
their own logins and passwords.  AR
92.  Some of them testified, without
contradiction, to a policy prohibiting the sharing of login information.  AR 92. 
All of them said that Cisneros never shared her login information with
them, and they did not know anyone with whom she shared it.  AR 92. 
They also all said that they never used her workstation or saw anyone else
use it, and it was very uncommon and not generally appreciated to use another
employee’s computer.  AR 92.
            The
coaches all prepared letters to families of students, but their testimony
varied as to who prepared the labels.  AR
93.  Some said the EL Department secretary
or clerk would do that.  AR 93. But the clerk,
Mendez, denied preparing label reports for the coaches.  AR 93. 
Both Mendez and the secretary, Villalpando, testified that Cisneros
never asked them to run a label report. 
AR 93.  McMahon testified that coaches
often run labels for their own school sites. 
AR 93.  Maldonado testified that she
saw Cisneros do so a couple of times.  AR
93.  Even if the secretary or clerk
sometimes prepares labels, the coach does not need to share login information for
them to do so; the secretaries have their own logins and can access the same
information.  AR 93.
            No
one in the EL Department saw Cisneros write the Letter, print the label
reports, take 600 envelopes from the office, or mail the letter.  AR 95. 
All EL Department staff denied sending the Letter.  AR 93.  
No evidence supports a finding that any EL Department employee other
than Cisneros created the Letter or envelope labels.  AR 93.
Maldonado and McMahan testified that they saw Cisneros in
the EL Department office in June or early July 2017, after her coach position was
eliminated on June 8.   AR 94. 
Maldonaldo said she saw her enter with a rolling cart and print a huge
number of photocopies, but she did not see what the document was.  AR 94. 
Cisneros was upset when she saw Maldonaldo and asked why she was still
there.  AR 94.  Maldonaldo texted McMahon about it, who was
also in the office.  AR 94.  McMahon advised her to document it, but Maldonado
was too busy to do so.  AR 94.    Cisneros’ only duty during the summer was
to supervise students, not prepare mass mailings or photocopies.  AR 95. 

            McMahon
testified that she saw Cisneros at her old desk while copying machines were
running.  AR 95.  She could not see what she was copying or
printing.  AR 95.  She reported it to Casallas but did not
document it.  AR 95.
After the Letter’s publication, McMahon found photographs
from Cisneros’ Facebook showing that she was in Santa Barbara on November 20,
2017.   AR 95.  The Letter was mailed from Santa Barbara and
postmarked on November 22.  AR 95.
            McMahon,
Mendez, and other EL Department employees testified that Cisneros was the only employee
who had a difficult relationship with Casallas. 
AR 95-96.
 
            b.
Johnston’s Conclusions
            Casallas
suspected Cisneros because of their negative professional relationship, which
is rare for Casallas.  AR 96.  Johnston did not consider whether other
candidates for the position of Voorhies principal might have prepared the Letter.  AR 96. 
She concluded that someone printed the Letter at the EL Department
office because no evidence suggested it was printed offsite.  AR 96. 
She did not compare the April and May 2017 labels with labels that Cisneros
had previously printed because the District did not have them.  AR 96-97. 
No one saw firsthand who wrote or sent the Letter, and attempts to test
it for fingerprints failed.  AR 97.
            Johnston
testified that Cisneros was in Santa Barbara around the time the Letter was
mailed from that location.  AR 97.  The postmark was dated November 22, 2017, and
Cisneros was in Santa Barbara sometime between November 20 and 24.  AR 97. 

            Johnston
was confident that Cisneros sent the letter. 
She was the most likely to do so, she had motive, she was in Santa
Barbara around the right time, other EL Department employees testified to facts
suggesting that she created the Letter and labels, and IT confirmed that Cisneros
must have made the labels.  AR 97.
 
            c.
Cisneros’ Evidence
            Cisneros
denied any involvement with the Letter. 
AR 98.   Cisneros testified that she learned about the Letter on the Monday
after Thanksgiving, November 27, 2017. 
AR 98.
She admitted that she was in the office on April 27, 2017, but
did not remember if she ran a label report that day.  AR 98. 
She could have asked Mendez, Villalpando, or Ferdinand to do it and she would
have given them her login information. 
AR 98.  This testimony was not
credible.  AR 98.  Cisneros did not identify Mendez as someone
she would share her password with during the investigative interviews.  AR 98. 
All three employees denied she ever gave them her password.  AR 98. 
They had their own passwords and would not have needed it to create
labels.  AR 98.  Cisneros testified that the testimony of
Mendez, Villalpando, and Ferdinand on this issue was false.  AR 98.
            After
Cisneros left the EL Department on June 8, 2017, she still had access to its
office.  AR 99.  She spent that summer as a Migrant Education
Services coordinator at the District’s Pioneer Elementary School.  AR 99. 
She went to the EL Department office on July 25, 2017 for an interview
but did not go there any other day that summer. 
AR 99.  She said that McMahon and
Maldonado were “absolutely lying” about seeing her there because she was out of
the country on the days when they claimed to have seen her in the office.  AR 99. 

            Cisneros
testified that she planned to visit her uncle in Baja California the week of Thanksgiving.  AR 99. 
 When that plan fell through, she visited
her sister in Ventura instead.  AR
99.  She arrived there on Sunday, November
19.  AR 99.  On November 20, she left her children with
her sister while she visited a Santa Barbara medical clinic, then returned to
Ventura.  AR 99.  Cisneros testified that she then drove to
Bakersfield on November 21 to spend Thanksgiving with her husband.  AR 99. 
Cisneros failed to explain how there were Facebook pictures of her
entire family in Santa Barbara on November 20. 
AR 99.  
            The
District’s summary of Cisneros’ interview during the week after Thanksgiving reflects
that Cisneros said she visited her uncle in Baja California, then her sister in
Ventura.  AR 100.  Johnston testified that Cisneros never
mentioned Santa Barbara in the interview. 
AR 100.  Cisneros testified that
she said in the interview that she visited her sister in Santa Barbara, and she
did so because she did not understand her sister lived in Ventura.  AR 100. 
Cisneros testified that Johnston lied that she never mentioned Santa
Barbara in her interview.  AR 100.  
            Cisneros
testified that her relationship with Casallas was cordial and that she would
never impugn him in a letter.   AR
100.  She admitted their relationship
faltered in January or February 2017, when substitute teaching assignments
forced her to cancel her parent workshops. 
AR 100.  
            Cisneros
testified that she wanted to use Casallas’ 2015 letter of recommendation in
2017 to apply for some jobs.  AR
100-01.  Ms. Stout in Human Resources
suggested that Cisneros change the date from 2015 to 2017.  AR 101. 
She “was floored” when she learned on April 26, 2017, that Casallas
asserted she had fraudulently written the letter.  AR 101. 
This April 26 accusation was made one day before her login was used to
print label reports for Voorhies.  AR
101.  
            Cisneros asserted that
Johnston’s Investigative Summary’s description of both interviews was
inaccurate and that Johnston’s testimony at the hearing was absolutely false.  AR 102. 
Cisneros asserted that Mendez, Villalpando, Ferdinand, and
Johnston all lied in their testimony.  AR
102.  However, her own testimony as to
the events in her interviews was inconsistent and confused.  AR 102. 
Her uncorroborated testimony did not raise sufficient doubt to refute what
appears to be clear and convincing evidence. 
AR 102.  
The evidence supports the conclusion that she planned the Letter,
ran label reports in April and May 2017, printed the Letter and envelopes in
June or July, and mailed the Letter in November while in Santa Barbara.  AR 102.
 
            c.
Legal Analysis
            Drafting
and mailing the letter while using school resources to further her scheme is cause
to take adverse action against Cisnero’s credentials under section 44421 based
on unprofessional conduct.  AR 106.  
            The
Letter’s fraudulent content and the steps taken to mail it to parents reflect indecency,
depravity, and moral indifference to the opinions of respectable members of the
community.  AR 106-07.  Cisneros also ignored the public welfare
because the Letter encouraged parents to voice concerns about statements
wrongfully attributed to Casallas at a public meeting.  AR 107. 
Cause exists to take adverse action under section 44421 based on immoral
conduct.  AR 106.
            The
entire scheme reflects a general readiness to do evil without excuse.  AR 107. 
The Complainant established by clear and convincing evidence cause to take
adverse action against Cisnero’s credentials based on acts of moral
turpitude.  AR 107.
 
            c.
Morrison Analysis
            Multiple
aggravating factors are present.  AR
108.  Cisneros demonstrated a pattern of
misconduct because she engaged in a multi-step scheme with multiple acts of
misconduct.  AR 108.  She drafted a fraudulent Letter, used
District resources to print and mail it to parents, and denied the misconduct
during the District’s investigation.  AR
108.  The nature of these bad acts proves
they were made in bad faith and dishonesty. 
AR 108.  They also harmed the
educational and public system because many parents and staff members approached
Casallas about the letter.  AR 109.
            There
was nothing praiseworthy about this conduct. 
AR 109.  The likelihood of
recurrence was high because Cisneros would not take responsibility for her
actions.  AR 109.  She instead chose to argue that every witness
except herself lied under oath.  AR 109.  Finally, the widespread distribution of the Letter
shows Cisneros intended to create both negative publicity and notoriety for
Casallas.  AR 109.
            
            E. Analysis
            Petitioner Cisneros contends that (a) the Commission erred in applying the
burden of proof, (b) Johnston’s investigation was biased and incomplete, and
(c) the findings that she wrote and sent the Letter to student parents is not
supported by the weight of the evidence. 
 
1.      The Burden of Proof 
Cisneros contends
that the Commission’s Decision[4] states that “Respondent’s uncorroborated
testimony alone has not raised sufficient doubt to refute what appears to be
clear and convincing evidence” (emphasis added).  AR 102. 
The Complainant’s burden of proof was actual clear and
convincing evidence, not the appearance of clear and convincing
evidence.  Just as the appearance of
impropriety is not the same as actual impropriety, the appearance of clear and
convincing evidence is not tantamount to actual clear and convincing
evidence.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
Further, the
Commission inappropriately shifted the burden of proof to Cisneros, noting, in
relevant part, that her “uncorroborated testimony alone has not raised
sufficient doubt to refute” the evidence established by the record.  AR 102.  Cisneros argues that it was solely the burden
of the Complainant to prove each and every allegation by clear and convincing
evidence, regardless of whether or not Cisneros could refute the evidence or
present any evidence on her own behalf.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
The Commission
responds that Cisneros is conflating the Complainant’s clear and convincing
burden of proof to revoke Cisneros’ credentials with Cisneros’ burden to prove
by a preponderance of evidence that her Application for English authorization
should be granted.  The Commission’s Decision
states that the Complainant established by clear and convincing evidence that Cisneros
engaged in unprofessional, immoral conduct and committed acts of moral
turpitude by sending the Letter.  AR
110.  For the Application, it states that
Cisneros failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that she did not engage
in acts of moral turpitude.  AR 110.  Opp. at 11.
Cisneros does not
reply to this argument.  In any event, loose
language in the context of analysis does not show that the Commission was
unaware of or misapplied the correct burdens of proof for revocation and the
Application or that the burden was improperly shifted to Cisneros. 
 
2.     
Johnston’s Investigation
Cisneros notes that
the Letter was mailed in November 2017 to the parents/families of
Voorhies.  Almost immediately, two persons
were designated as likely culprits: Cisneros and Solis.  Solis had been disciplined by Casallas but was
never investigated by Johnston.  From the
onset, Johnston’s investigation solely focused on Cisneros.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12. 
Johnston worked
with the IT Department Director John Deaton and Assistant Director Burks.  Johnston estimated that 600 copies of the Letter
were sent out to the parents of the Voorhies Elementary School.  Burks noticed that the labels that were sent
to the parents of Voorhies were in a unique format of first name, middle name,
last name, which allowed him to narrow down the search to three people: Chris
Holloway, the database administrator; a second person whose name Burks could not
remember when he testified, and Cisneros.  AR 639. 
Johnston never interviewed Chris Holloway or investigated the reason why
he ran a label report.  Nor did she
attempt to locate the other person who ran the labels for Voorhies.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.  
The Commission
contends that, on May 18, 2017, Cisneros generated the labels that were used to
mail out the Letter in November 2017.  No
one saw Cisneros type the Letter.  No comparison
of the labels was made to any labels that Cisneros printed on other occasions.  AR 579.  Cisneros presented evidence that she was
offsite for training on May 18, 2017.  AR
497, 498, 897.  Yet, Johnston did not investigate
Cisneros’ alibi for May 18.  AR
591.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
Johnston learned
from the U.S. post office that the envelopes were mailed on November 22, 2017
from a postal drop box in Santa Barbara.  However, the evidence only established that
Cisneros was in Santa Barbara on November 20, 2017.  AR 583.  No video surveillance existed to determine who
mailed the Letter. AR 589.  No
fingerprints were recovered from the envelopes and copies of the Letter.  AR 589.  There was no evidence that Cisneros was in Santa Barbara on November 22, 2017.  AR 595. 
Cisneros testified that she returned home to Bakersfield from her
sister’s house in Ventura County on November 21, 2017.  AR 917. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
Cisneros argues
that Johnston’s investigation concerned motive and opportunity as opposed to actual
evidence.  No witnesses saw Cisneros print
the labels.  No witnesses saw Cisneros type
the Letter.  No witnesses saw Cisneros print
copies of the Letter.  No witnesses saw
Cisneros mail the Letter. Cisneros’ fingerprints were not on any documents.
Thus, there is no actual evidence linking Cisneros to creating and mailing the Letter.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
Much of Cisneros’
argument really is that the Commission’s Decision is not supported by sufficient
evidence as opposed to an argument about the inadequacy of Johnston’s
investigation.  The sufficiency of the
evidence is addressed post.  It also
should be noted that the adequacy of Johnston’s investigation is significant only
as it bears on Complainant’s circumstantial case.  Cisneros is not entitled by due process or
statute to any particular type of , or a complete, investigation.
With this in mind,
much of what Cisneros states is true with a few exceptions.  AR 429. 
Cisneros faults Johnston for never interviewing Chris Holloway about the
reason why he ran a label report and for not attempting to locate the second
person who ran the labels for Voorhies.  
Yet, it was clear
that Holloway was not a suspect.  He was
a data administrator who that label report twice at the beginning of the school
year within a few minutes of each other. 
AR 639.  This was most likely
testing.  AR 639.  The timing of Holloway’s label report early
in the year also eliminated him as a suspect. 
As for the third, unstated person, it is true that Johnston did not
investigate him or her.  However, other
evidence shows that the label reports were generated with Cisneros’ login and
password and there is no evidence that this third person had access to Cisneros’
computer or any EL Department computer.
Cisneros states
that no comparison of the labels was made to other labels that Cisneros had printed.  AR 579. 
She leaves out the fact that Johnston never compared the labels to
labels Cisneros had previously printed because she did not have any old labels
for such a comparison.  AR 579.
Cisneros notes that
she presented her calendar and testified that she was offsite for training on
May 18, 2017 (AR 497, 498, 897) and argues that Johnston did not
investigate Cisneros’ alibi for May 18.  AR
591.  Actually, Johnston testified
that she did not recall if she investigated whether Cisneros was at offsite
training on May 18.  It is true that
Johnston could have checked whether Cisneros attended the May 18 training, but
it would not have proved much.  She could
have come back to work after the training ended, or after hours, to run the
label report.  
Finally, although
Solis may have had motive to attack Casallas, he could not have written the Letter.  First, McMahan stated in her interview that
Solis is gay and would not have written a Letter like that.  AR 274. 
While she would not put it past him to help Cisneros (AR 274), he had
been dismissed in January 2017 after failing his probationary period and did
not have access to the EL Department computers. 
See AR 269.[5]
Cisneros further fails
to show any bias in Johnston’s investigation.
 
3.     
The Weight of the Evidence
In reviewing the weight of the
evidence, the
court must apply the principles of deference and presumptive correctness to the
Commission’s Decision in determining whether the findings are supported by
clear and convincing evidence.  Li v.
Superior Court (Sacramento County, supra, 69 Cal.App.5th at 865.   
Cisneros argues
that the Complainant did not meet the burden of proving the allegations by
clear and convincing evidence. Pet. Op. Br. at 14.  This is a circumstantial evidence case and
Cisneros focuses mostly on the evidence that does not exist.  But the court’s independent review of the evidence
that does exist shows that Cisneros wrote and mailed out the Letter.
 
a.     
The Label Reports
Cisneros argues that no witnesses saw her run label reports
for Voorhies students.  IT Assistant
Director Burks was asked to determine who created the labels used on the
envelopes, but not who printed the Letter.  AR 636. 
On May 18, 2017, the labels were run for Voorhies students from the 2016
through 2017 school year.  AR 644.  Burks stated that the labels had been mailed
to former Voorhies students who had moved on to Middle School.  AR 636.  Burks noted that the labels were unusual
because they were printed with the student’s first name, followed by their
middle and then followed by their last name.  AR 637, while the labels were generated using
the last name first.  AR 637.  In his deposition (AR 307, 429), Burks
testified that 35 people ran a label report produced in this unusual format.  AR 429.  At the hearing, Burks testified that there were
three people who ran labels using the same program: Chris Holloway (likely for
system testing purposes), a second person (whom Burks could not remember), and Cisneros.  AR 639.[6]  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Burks admitted that he could not say that Cisneros was the
person at the computer who generated these label reports.  AR 652.  Burks also admitted that it was possible that
the label reports were run prior to the dates of April 27, 2017 and May 18,
2017.  AR 655.  In other words, these label reports could have
been run by someone at any point prior to the parameters established by Burks.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15. 
Johnston believed that the labels from the Letter received by
former Voorhies parents matched the labels that were printed on April 27th
and May 18th.  AR 578.  However, Burks testified that someone could
run label reports but not print them on the same day.  AR 652. 
Hence, no one knows when the label reports were printed or who printed
the label reports.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15.
The Commission’s Decision contends that the EL Department
employees did not have one another’s logins or passwords.  Secretary Villalpando noted that it was not
common practice for employees to share login passwords, but she could not
recall if Cisneros ever provided her with her login password.  AR 668.  Villalpando never saw Cisneros run a label
report for Voorhies.  AR 683.  Thus, the exact identity of the individual
who created and printed the labels is not known with certainty.  The mere fact that reports were created using
Cisneros’ login information does not establish that she created and printed
said labels. Pet. Op. Br. at 15.
This is what is known about the label reports.  Cisneros does not dispute Burks testimony and
he testified that the labels were in Arial font, which is used by the
District’s SIS program for most of its labels. 
AR 89.  The labels used the Voorhies
parent names with first name, middle name, and then last name rather than the
usual last name first used in most label programs.  AR 89. 
The text in the letter suggested that the labels were created with the
2016-17 Voorhies enrollment information. 
AR 90.
SIS keeps a record of every time a label report is run,
including the date and time and user whose login was entered to run the
report.  AR 90. Burks identified
Holloway, Cisneros, and a third person as the only ones whose logins showed
that they ran the program that could have generated these labels.  AR 90. On April 27, 2017, someone used
Cisneros’ login to run these mailing labels. 
AR 90.  On May 18, 2017, someone
used the same login to run a schoolwide student address label report.  AR 90. 
This report only runs when the user specifies that the labels are to be
sent to parents of students at a particular school.   AR 90. 

            Burks
was very confident that the May 18 labels were used to send the letter to
Voorhies parents.   AR 91.  He acknowledged that generated label reports
can be saved and used to print labels at a later date.  AR 91. 
Thus, he acknowledged that label reports generated earlier than April 27
could have been used to mail the Letter. 
AR 91.  But this did not affect
his confidence level that Cisneros’ login and password was used on April 27 and
again on May 18 to create label reports, and that the May 18 login generated a
schoolwide student address label report. 
AR 91, 663.  
Consequently, the evidence that the label reports for the
Letter were generated using Cisneros’ login and password on April 27 and May 18
is strong but not without any doubt.  
So, the question becomes who had access to Cisneros’
computer to generate these label reports? 
The evidence on this issue was compelling.  All EL Department witnesses testified and said
that they had their own logins and passwords. 
AR 92.  Some of them testified,
without contradiction, to a policy prohibiting the sharing of login
information.  AR 92.  All of them said that Cisneros never shared
her login information with them, and they did not know anyone with whom she
shared it.  AR 92.  They also all said that they never used her
workstation or saw anyone else use it, and it was very uncommon and not
generally appreciated to use another employee’s computer.  AR 92.
Cisneros testified that she shared her EL Department
computer password with Icardo and Ferdinand. 
AR 856.  Villalpando also would
have had it.  AR 856.  IT also would have had it. AR 856.  This testimony is rebutted by Icardo and
Ferdinand, who denied receiving Cisneros’ password, and Villalpando, who
testified that she “honestly did not recall that she gave me that information.”  AR 668, 669, 692. 
Moreover, The EL Department employees all testified that
they had their own logins and passwords. 
AR 92.  Some of them testified,
without contradiction, to a policy prohibiting the sharing of login
information.  AR 92.  None knew of anyone with whom Cisneros shared
her password.  AR 92.  They all said that they never used her
workstation or saw anyone else use it, and it was very uncommon and not
generally appreciated to use another employee’s computer.  AR 92.
Thus, it is highly probable that the label reports were
generated using Cisneros’ login and password on Cisneros’ computer, and there
is no evidence that anyone had access to this login and password other than her
own contradicted testimony.   
 
b. The Post-June 8 Visits to the EL Department
Cisneros’ last day of work at the EL Department was June 8,
2017.  AR 544.  Maldonado testified that, in either June or
July, after she learned the coaching positions were eliminated, Maldonado saw
Cisneros printing letters in the EL Department offices on a couple of
occasions.  AR 733.  On one occasion she saw Cisneros with a
rolling cart.  AR 734.  Between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m., she then saw her
printing labels from her computer printer. 
AR 734.  At the same time,
Cisneros was making a large number of copies on the copier.  AR 734-35. 
She did not see the content of what Cisneros was printing and
copying.  AR 739.  Cisneros became upset that Maldonaldo was
there and asked why.  AR 735.  Cisneros acted like she was not expecting
anyone else to be there at the time.  AR
735.  Maldonado texted McMahan, the
program specialist, to let her know that Cisneros was in the office.  AR 739. 
She did not document the date and time she saw Cisneros because she was
so busy and did not think anything of the incident.  AR 739-40.
McMahan testified that, sometime approximately toward the
end of June or the beginning of July 2017, she saw Cisneros inside the EL
Department office.  AR 804.  Maldonado was with her.   AR 805. 
Cisneros was copying or printing something, but McMahon could not see
what it was.  AR 805.  She and Cisneros did not speak to each
other.  AR 805. 
Cisneros contends that McMahan and Maldonado were not
credible.  McMahon, an academic coach, was
not aware that secretaries ran label reports (AR 803), but Villalpando testified
that she did print labels.  AR 681.  Casallas confirmed that both Cisneros and the secretary
would run label reports.  AR 627.  While Maldonado claimed to have seen Cisneros
in the EL Department and that she texted McMahon when she saw Cisneros, the need
to text indicates that the two were not together.  Pet. Op. Br. at 16.  This directly contradicts McMahan, who stated
that Maldonado was with her.  Villalpando
also testified that she never saw Cisneros at the EL Department after June 8,
2017.  AR 681.  Pet. Op. Br. at 17.
This argument is rebutted by the fact that there were two
post-June 8 occasions when Cisneros was seen: once by Maldonado alone and a
second time when Maldonado and McMahon were together.  Both Maldonado’s testimony and McMahon’s
interview support this conclusion.  AR
278.  Additionally, McMahon’s testimony that
she was not aware that secretaries ran label reports, but Villalpando might
have (AR 803), does not affect her credibility.
Cisneros notes that she testified that she was in Mexico
from June 24, 2017 through July 8, 2017.  AR 881.  She was corroborated by a copy of her flight
information.  Pet. Op. Br. at 17.
True, but the flights only cover the June 24 to July 8
period and are not inconsistent with McMahan’s and Maldonado’s testimony that
they saw her in the EL Department on more than one occasion in either June or
July. 
The implication from the fact that Cisneros was in the EL
Department office after June 8 on more than one occasion printing labels and
making a large number of copies, and was upset at seeing Maldonaldo, is
suggestive that she was printing and copying the letter.  It is only suggestive, however, and the
Complainant did not directly prove that she printed the Letter.
 
c. The
Availability of the Envelopes
Cisneros argues that the Complainant failed to establish
that she took envelopes from the District. 
No witnesses saw her taking the hundreds of envelopes used to mail the
letters. Burks was not even sure of the location of the envelopes.  AR 658.  Villalpando also noted that any envelopes used
for label reports were available to all EL Department staff.  AR 683.  In other words, anyone could have addressed
these particular envelopes.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 18.
True, but the evidence concerning the envelopes concerned
only their availability.  All EL
Department and District staff had access to envelopes used to mail copies of the
Letter.  AR 683.  They were in an office cupboard, but the
cupboard was unlocked.  AR 683.  It is undisputed that they were in the
District building and available to anyone, including Cisneros.
 
d. Mailing the Letter
Cisneros argues that the evidence failed to show that she mailed
the Letter to parents of former Voorhies students.  McMahon incorrectly testified that she
“believed” the copies of the Letter were mailed from Ventura County.  AR 799. 
No fingerprints were recovered from the mailers, and one could identify
Cisneros mailing the Letter from Santa Barbara on November 22, 2017.  AR 589.  Nor could Cisneros’ presence in Santa Barbara
be traced to the exact date when the Letter was mailed.  Pet. Op. Br. at 18.
The copies of the Letter were
postmarked in Santa Barbara on November 22, 2017.  During Cisneros’ first interview on November
28, 2017, Johnston asked her about her whereabouts during Thanksgiving break.  AR 270.  Cisneros
said that she was visiting an uncle in Baja, California and stopped to visit a
sister in Ventura County on the day before Thanksgiving.  AR 272. 
She returned to Bakersfield on Saturday. 
AR 272.  At the hearing,
Johnston testified that Cisneros did not say that she was in Santa Barbara in
her first interview.  AR 541.  
During the District’s
investigation, McMahon produced pictures posted on Facebook showing that Cisneros
was at a landmark restaurant in Santa Barbara in November 2017.  AR 796, 798-99.  In a follow-up interview on December 6, 2017,
Cisneros first denied going to Santa
Barbara during Thanksgiving weekend, then retracted that statement and said
that she went to a medical clinic in Santa Barbara on November 20, 2017, the
Monday before Thanksgiving.  AR 279.
Cisneros testified that she had
planned to visit her uncle in Baja California the week of Thanksgiving.  AR 99.  
When that plan fell through, she visited her sister in Ventura instead.  AR 99. 
She arrived there on Sunday, November 19.  AR 99. 
On November 20, she left her children with her sister while she visited
a Santa Barbara medical clinic, then returned to Ventura.  AR 99. 
Cisneros testified that she then drove to Bakersfield on November 21 to
spend Thanksgiving with her husband.  AR
99.  
The court agrees with the
Commission that Cisneros’s testimony explains that she was in Santa Barbara for
a medical appointment on Monday, November 20, but does not explain why Facebook
pictures depict her entire family at a 
restaurant in Santa Barbara on that day. 
See AR 99.  The clear
inference is that Cisneros may well have been in Santa Barbara on November 22,
2017 and could have mailed the copies of the Letter.
 
3. Motive
Cisneros argues that the weight of
the evidence does not show her motive.  What
did she have to gain by writing and mailing copies of the Letter?  The decision to eliminate the academic coaches
position was made by the District, not Casallas, a fact of which Cisneros was
aware.  AR 730.  Casallas had been Cisneros’ supervisor at the
EL Department for three years.  Casallas
admitted to authoring excellent performance evaluations for Cisneros (AR 618),
and that he did not feel that Ms. Cisneros had any animosity toward him (AR 613).  Casallas claimed that Cisneros did not like
to be supervised, and that she was argumentative and had questionable honesty.  AR 607. As a result, Casallas withdrew a 2015
letter of recommendation for Cisneros after Cisneros changed the date of the
letter of recommendation.  AR 608.  However, no evidence was presented that Cisneros
altered the date of the letter of recommendation.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19.
“‘Clear and convincing’ evidence
requires a finding of high probability.”  In re Angelia P., (1981) 28 Cal.3d 908,
919.  Johnston and Casallas both believe
that Cisneros sent the letters because “if anyone was going to do something
like that, was probably going to be her.”  AR 614. Casallas’ mere belief that the culprit
must be Cisneros is not grounded in any reliable facts or evidence.  There is only speculation and that does not
meet the clear and convincing burden of proof required.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19-20.
In her interview, McMahan stated
that Cisneros was upset about losing her position.  AR 274.  
Maldonado also testified that Cisneros
alone was extremely upset and vocal at the elimination of her academic coach position
and blamed Casallas.  AR 731-32.  Maldonado added that, prior to the elimination
of her position, Cisneros was defiant towards Casallas; she frequently defied
his instructions and wanted to do the opposite, creating a hostile environment.
 AR
729-30.
In his interview, Johnston asked
Casallas if he could think of anyone responsible for sending the Letter and Casallas
named Cisneros and Solis.  AR 535. 
They were the only two that he could think of two who had motive.  AR
269.  Cisneros was upset when her
position was dissolved, and that she was returned to a classroom for the
2017-2018 school year.  AR 269.  
Valillapado also stated in her interview that Cisneros always questioned
Casallas’ authority and she did not want to substitute teach when there was a
shortage.  AR 276.  Cisneros did not react well when she was told
she was going back into the classroom for the 2017-2018 school year due to
restructuring.  AR 276.  
Casallas testified about the letter
of recommendation.  At the end of 2015,
Cisneros asked Casallas for a letter of recommendation for employment in the
school district her children attend.  AR
608.  He agreed to write it.  AR 608. 
In 2017, various smaller issues had made Casallas feel that the contents
of the letter were no longer valid.  AR
609.  He called Human Resources, who told
him that Cisneros had submitted a letter of recommendation from him just two
weeks earlier.  AR 609.  He had not done so.  AR 609-10. 
He checked the letter and found it was the same letter he had written
with the date changed.  AR 610.
As the Commission’s Decision notes,
Cisneros testified that in 2017 she wanted to use Casallas’ 2015 letter of
recommendation to apply for some jobs. 
AR 100-01.  Ms. Stout in Human
Resources suggested that Cisneros change the date from 2015 to 2017.  AR 101. 
She “was floored” when she learned on April 26, 2017 that Casallas
asserted that she had fraudulently written the letter.  AR 101. 
(This April 26 day that she was floored by Casallas’ accusation was one
day before her login was used to print label reports for Voorhies.  AR 101.) 

Thus, Cisneros was hostile towards Casallas
before her position was eliminated.  When
she found out, she was angry that she would have to go back to the classroom
and wrongly blamed Casallas.  He then floored
her by accusing her of fraud.  This is
plenty of motivation and she is the only EL Department member who had a motive
to harm Casallas.  
 
4. Cisneros Lacked
Credibility
The court agrees with the
Commission that Cisneros lacked credibility. 
Aside from the evidence about her misrepresentations about where she was
going or would be (AR 274, 670-3) and sending Villalpando a threatening text
(AR 674-5), she made an unauthorized alteration of the letter of recommendation
letter Casallas had written for her in 2015.  Cisneros admitted as much, and her Ms. Stout
suggested the alteration does not excuse its falsity.  
At the hearing, Cisneros denied
threatening Villalpando and claimed that she was absolutely lying.  AR 923.  She also testified that Johnston lied about
her first interview.  AR 919.  These contradictions do not support her
credibility.
She also was contradicted by other EL Department witnesses.  She told Johnston that she had given her
password to Ferdinand and Villalpando (AR 271) and at the hearing, claiming
that she provided her log-in credentials to Icardo, Ferdinand, and Villalpando.   Icardo and Ferdinand denied ever having her
login information and Villalpando could not recall if Cisneros ever
provided her with her login password.
 AR
856, 699-700, 692-93, 668.
Cisneros stated in her November 28 interview that, although she helped
send mass mailers for EL Department events, she did not prepare envelopes or
labels.  AR 271.  Villalpando prepared them because it required
use of the machines in the back of the office. 
AR 271.  Cisneros said that she never
received training on how to prepare those labels.  AR 271. 

McMahan contradicted her, stating in her interview that Cisneros often
sent letters to parents and prepared her own labels.  AR 274. 
Villalpando also stated that Cisneros prepared her own paperwork and was
good at running labels and printed her own. 
AR 272.  
Finally, Cisneros’ explanation that
she was in Santa Barbara for a medical appointment on Monday, November 20, was
contradicted by her Facebook pictures of her entire family at a restaurant in
Santa Barbara on that day.  
The Commission did not find Cisneros
credible, and the court does not either.
 
F. Conclusion
Petitioner Cisneros has not met her
burden of showing that the weight of the evidence does not support the
Commission’s Decision.  The Petition is
denied.  
The Commission’s counsel is ordered
to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it on Cisneros’ counsel for approval as
to form, wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if
there are objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along with a
declaration stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for January 17,
2024 at 1:30 p.m.
