  CASE NO.: 20STCV40733
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 21, 2023



 
On October 23, 2020, Plaintiff
Santos Novoa filed this action against Defendant American Honda Motor Co. Inc.,
arising from Plaintiff’s purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle from a non-party
dealership.
On
March 4, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration and stayed
this action pending the completion of arbitration.
On
June 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration.
Within
ten days of service of an order, a party may move for reconsideration based on new
facts, circumstances, or law.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th
1338, 1342.)  The moving party shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, what order or decisions were made,
and what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd .(a).)  “[T]he party seeking reconsideration must provide
not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce
that evidence at an earlier time.”  (Glade
v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457.) 
The legislative intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances
where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered
and some valid reason for not offering it earlier.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th
1494, 1500.)
The
Court entered its order granting Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration on March
4, 2022, and Defendant gave notice on March 9, 2022.  Accordingly, the ten-day period for Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration has long passed.
After
the ten-day period for a party’s motion, a court may, at any time and on its own
motion, enter a different order if the court determines that there has been a change
of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (c).)
This
Court had found that Defendant could compel arbitration despite not being a signatory
to the arbitration agreement based on equitable estoppel, relying on Felisilda
v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 495 (Felisilda).  Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of that order
due to the recent Court of Appeal opinion in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023)
89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (Ochoa).  The Ochoa
court determined that equitable estoppel did not apply because the plaintiffs failed
to show that their claims were founded in or intertwined with the sales contracts.  (Ochoa, supra, 89 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1332-1336.)  The court “disagree[d] with Felisilda that
‘the sales contract was the source of [FCA’s] warranties at the heart of this case.’”  (Id. at p. 1334.)  The Ochoa court also “disagree[d] with
the Felisilda court’s interpretation of the sale contract as broadly calling
for arbitration of claims ‘against third party nonsignatories.’”  (Ibid.)  The court instead read the language “including
any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract” as “a further
delineation of the subject matter of claims the purchasers and dealers agreed
to arbitrate.”  (Id. at pp. 1334-1335.)
“Once
a court grants the petition to compel arbitration and stays the action at law, the
action at law sits in the twilight zone of abatement with the trial court retaining
merely a vestigial jurisdiction over matters submitted to arbitration.  This vestigial jurisdiction over the action at
law consists solely of making the determination, upon conclusion of the arbitration
proceedings, of whether there was an award on the merits (in which case the action
at law should be dismissed because of the res judicata effects of the arbitration
award [citation]) or not (at which point the action at law may resume to determine
the rights of the parties).”  (Brock v.
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1790, 1796.)
Accordingly,
the Court does not appear to have jurisdiction to interfere in the arbitration proceedings
and order the case back to proceed in this court.  Even if the Court had authority, it would still
decline to exercise it here.  Felisilda
was the only binding authority directly on point at the time of the Court’s March
4, 2022 order.  Plaintiff could have appealed
that order, but he did not.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1294, subd. (a).)  Ochoa did not
overrule Felisilda, so this Court could still choose to either follow Felisilda
or instead adopt Ochoa’s reasoning. 
(Sarti v. Salt Creek Ltd. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1193 [“All
trial courts are bound by all published decisions of the Court of Appeal . . . Unlike
at least some federal intermediate appellate courts, though, there is no horizontal
stare decisis in the California Court of Appeal.”].)  Ochoa presents merely a conflict in law,
not a material change in law that makes reliance on Felisilda improper. 
The
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
