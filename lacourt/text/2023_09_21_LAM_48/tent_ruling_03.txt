[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION
  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 21, 2023



 
On April 25, 2022, Plaintiff
Javier Montes filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants SPS Technologies
LLC dba PB Fasteners (“SPS”) and Hector Pelayo (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging
(1) discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”);
(2) harassment in violation of FEHA; (3) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (4) failure
to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of FEHA; (5) failure to engage
in the interactive process in violation of FEHA; (6) failure to prevent discrimination
and retaliation in violation of FEHA; (7) declaratory judgment; and (8) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy.
On
March 16, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication.
At
the original June 1, 2023 hearing, the Court continued the hearing so Plaintiff
could oppose the motion and specific UMFs with additional evidence.
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendants’
request for judicial notice of the Complaint and the Court’s June 1, 2023 order
is denied as unnecessary.  These documents
are already part of the case’s record.
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
Defendants’
Objections to Plaintiff’s Supplemental Evidence are overruled.
DISCUSSION
On
June 1, 2023, the Court identified UMFs 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 64, 65, and
66 as setting forth a basis for additional discovery in the form of Zach Cheplak’s
deposition.
UMFs
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 relate to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for disability
discrimination.  According to Defendants,
Contreras investigated whether or not there were any open positions available that
would allow PB to provide the requested accommodations provided by Plaintiff, but
there were none.  (UMF 35.)  The company had recently laid off nearly half
their work force due to a reduced demand from their main customer in addition to
the COVID-19 pandemic.  (UMF 36.)  The company reduced the number of positions in
all departments including maintenance, manufacturing, administrative, and shipping
and receiving.  (UMF 37.)  Contreras inquired as to whether there may be
a position in the shipping and receiving department, as that department was the
least physical position and allows for employees to sit for the majority of their
shift, but no position existed given the reduction in force and the current economic
status of the company.  (UMF 38.)  There was no longer work available at the shipping
and receiving department.  (UMF 38.)  The number of employees assigned to the shipping
department was based on the workload and the volume of work.  (UMF 39.) 
Before the reduction in force, there were three people who worked in the
packing and shipping department; after the reduction in force, there was only one
person assigned to shipping.  (UMF 40.)  There was no available position in the shipping
and receiving department when Plaintiff submitted his work restrictions as there
was not a sufficient amount of work.  (UMF
41.)
Cheplak
testified that Defendants never decided to eliminate Plaintiff’s maintenance mechanic
position.  (Cheplak Depo. at p. 28.)  However, as set forth in the Court’s prior order,
it is undisputed that Plaintiff’s work restrictions prevented him from performing
the regular duties of the job.  (See UMF 9,
11-14, 30, 32, 34.)  Cheplak agreed that Plaintiff
would not have been able to perform his maintenance technician duties with his restrictions.  (Cheplak Depo. at p. 73; see Cheplak Depo. at
pp. 102-103, 153-158, 160-161.)  If Plaintiff’s
restrictions changed, he would need to provide a doctor’s note before the company
would have another conversation about where to place him.  (Cheplak Depo. at p. 74.)
Cheplak
also testified that Plaintiff would not have been part of the reduction in the workforce
in summer 2020 because he was on leave.  (Cheplak
Depo. at p. 85; see Cheplak Depo at p. 166.) 
When he was eligible to return to work, there were no available positions
for him, and that is why he was terminated. 
(Cheplak Depo. at pp. 85-86.)  Other
SPS branches were also experiencing downsizing, and there was no opportunity for
Plaintiff that fit his restrictions and lack of skills.  (Cheplak Depo. at pp. 88-89.)  Hector Pelayo advised that Plaintiff could not
work in a computer-based position doing maintenance purchasing because Plaintiff
was not competent with anything electronic or with computers.  (Cheplak Depo. at pp. 124-125, 142-143.)  Cheplak believed this because Pelayo had previously
attempted to have Plaintiff purchase equipment or tools online and he was not able
to do so because he was not familiar with how computers work.  (Cheplak Depo. at p. 126.)
Cheplak’s
deposition testimony is consistent with Defendants’ evidence and does not create
a triable issue of fact for UMFs 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41.
UMFs
64, 65, and 66 relate to Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages.  As the Court noted in its prior order, there is
no triable issue regarding any oppression, fraud, or malice because Defendants have
shown that Plaintiff’s underlying claims fail. 
Additionally, Plaintiff cites no testimony from Cheplak in response to these
UMFs.
Plaintiff’s
additional evidence from Cheplak’s deposition does not create a triable issue of
fact.  Accordingly, the Court incorporates
and fully adopts its prior analysis from the June 1, 2023 order.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.  Defendants
are ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
October 4, 2023 at 9:00 AM.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
