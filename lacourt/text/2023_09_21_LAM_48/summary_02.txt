And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the order granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff is seeking to reconsider the order based on a recent Court of Appeal opinion, Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which disagrees with the earlier decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is untimely and that the Court lacks jurisdiction to interfere in the arbitration proceedings. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff could have appealed the earlier order, but did not. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied, and the case will proceed with arbitration.
