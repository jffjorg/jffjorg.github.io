And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the order granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff is seeking to reconsider the order based on a recent Court of Appeal opinion, Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which disagrees with the earlier decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is untimely and that the Court lacks jurisdiction to interfere in the arbitration proceedings. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff could have appealed the earlier order, but did not. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied, and the case will proceed with arbitration.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. 

The Plaintiff initially filed a lawsuit against American Honda Motor Co. Inc. after purchasing a defective vehicle.  The Defendant moved to compel arbitration based on an agreement signed by the Plaintiff and a dealership. The Court previously granted this motion.

The Plaintiff now seeks to have the case heard in court, citing a recent Court of Appeal decision, *Ford Motor Warranty Cases*, which cast doubt on the ability to enforce arbitration agreements against non-signatories.  The judge, however, finds that *Ford Motor Warranty Cases* does not change the applicable law enough to warrant overturning the previous decision. The judge also states that the Court lacks jurisdiction to interfere with the arbitration proceedings.

Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order compelling arbitration. The motion was filed on June 8, 2023, citing a recent Court of Appeal opinion that disagreed with the court's previous ruling on the application of equitable estoppel. The court finds that the motion is untimely and that the plaintiff failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new evidence earlier. The court also notes that it lacks jurisdiction to interfere with the arbitration proceedings and that the recent Court of Appeal opinion does not constitute a material change in law that would warrant reconsideration.
