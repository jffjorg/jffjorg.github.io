**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. 

The Plaintiff initially filed a lawsuit against American Honda Motor Co. Inc. after purchasing a defective vehicle.  The Defendant moved to compel arbitration based on an agreement signed by the Plaintiff and a dealership. The Court previously granted this motion.

The Plaintiff now seeks to have the case heard in court, citing a recent Court of Appeal decision, *Ford Motor Warranty Cases*, which cast doubt on the ability to enforce arbitration agreements against non-signatories.  The judge, however, finds that *Ford Motor Warranty Cases* does not change the applicable law enough to warrant overturning the previous decision. The judge also states that the Court lacks jurisdiction to interfere with the arbitration proceedings.

Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order compelling arbitration. The motion was filed on June 8, 2023, citing a recent Court of Appeal opinion that disagreed with the court's previous ruling on the application of equitable estoppel. The court finds that the motion is untimely and that the plaintiff failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new evidence earlier. The court also notes that it lacks jurisdiction to interfere with the arbitration proceedings and that the recent Court of Appeal opinion does not constitute a material change in law that would warrant reconsideration.

## English Summary

The judge denies the Plaintiff's motion to reconsider the previous ruling compelling arbitration. 

The judge previously ruled that the Defendant could compel arbitration despite not being a signatory to the arbitration agreement, relying on a previous legal case, *Felisilda*. 

The Plaintiff now argues that a new legal case, *Ochoa*, undermines the *Felisilda* ruling. However, the judge finds that *Ochoa* does not change the legal landscape enough to warrant overturning the previous decision.

The judge notes that while *Ochoa* presents a conflict in legal interpretations, it does not directly overrule *Felisilda*.  The judge also points out that the Plaintiff had the opportunity to appeal the initial ruling but chose not to. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.

### English Text Summary
The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. The Plaintiff, Santos Novoa, had filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's order granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., had filed a motion to compel arbitration, which was granted by the Court on March 4, 2022. The Plaintiff now seeks reconsideration of that order based on a recent Court of Appeal opinion in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (Ochoa). However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is untimely and that the Court does not have jurisdiction to interfere in the arbitration proceedings. The Court also finds that the Ochoa opinion does not overrule the Felisilda opinion, which was the binding authority at the time of the Court's March 4, 2022 order. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
