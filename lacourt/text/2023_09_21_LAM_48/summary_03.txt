And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants, SPS Technologies LLC and Hector Pelayo, in the case filed by plaintiff Javier Montes alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The ruling is based on the evidence presented, which shows that the plaintiff's work restrictions prevented him from performing the regular duties of his job, and that the defendant reduced its workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced demand from its main customer. The ruling also finds that the plaintiff was terminated due to the lack of available positions that fit his restrictions and lack of skills. The court has previously analyzed the evidence and found that there is no triable issue of fact, and therefore grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
