## English Summary

The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented in this case and has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment. This means the Judge believes there are no genuine disputes of material fact and that the law favors the Defendants. 

The Judge found that Plaintiff's claims of discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) fail because the Defendants showed they had no suitable positions available for Plaintiff given his work restrictions. 

While Plaintiff argued that he deserved reasonable accommodations, the Judge found that the company had undergone significant layoffs due to economic difficulties and there were simply no positions that could accommodate Plaintiff's limitations.


The Judge also found insufficient evidence to support Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. 

Therefore, the Judge is granting Defendants' motion and recommending that Plaintiff's case be dismissed.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted. The plaintiff, Javier Montes, alleged that the defendants, SPS Technologies LLC dba PB Fasteners and Hector Pelayo, discriminated against him in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for his work restrictions. However, the judge has found that the defendants' evidence showed that the plaintiff's work restrictions prevented him from performing his job duties, and that the defendants did not eliminate the plaintiff's maintenance mechanic position. The judge has also found that there were no available positions for the plaintiff due to the defendants' reduction in workforce, and that the plaintiff was terminated due to the lack of available positions. As a result, the judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and ordered them to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
