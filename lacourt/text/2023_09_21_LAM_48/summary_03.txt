The ruling also finds that the plaintiff was terminated due to the lack of available positions that fit his restrictions and lack of skills. The court has previously analyzed the evidence and found that there is no triable issue of fact, and therefore grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

## English Summary

The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented in this case and has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment. This means the Judge believes there are no genuine disputes of material fact and that the law favors the Defendants. 

The Judge found that Plaintiff's claims of discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) fail because the Defendants showed they had no suitable positions available for Plaintiff given his work restrictions. 

While Plaintiff argued that he deserved reasonable accommodations, the Judge found that the company had undergone significant layoffs due to economic difficulties and there were simply no positions that could accommodate Plaintiff's limitations.


The Judge also found insufficient evidence to support Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. 

Therefore, the Judge is granting Defendants' motion and recommending that Plaintiff's case be dismissed.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.

However, the judge has found that the defendants' evidence showed that the plaintiff's work restrictions prevented him from performing his job duties, and that the defendants did not eliminate the plaintiff's maintenance mechanic position. The judge has also found that there were no available positions for the plaintiff due to the defendants' reduction in workforce, and that the plaintiff was terminated due to the lack of available positions. As a result, the judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and ordered them to submit a proposed judgment within five days.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Montes v. SPS Technologies LLC et al.

**Case Number:** 21STCV47068
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** 48

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Javier Montes
* **Defendants:** SPS Technologies LLC dba PB Fasteners (SPS) and Hector Pelayo

**Issues:**

* **Motion:** Defendants' motion for summary judgment (or summary adjudication) granted.

**Background:**

* Plaintiff alleges discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to provide reasonable accommodations, and wrongful termination against Defendants.
* Defendants argue Plaintiff's claims fail due to lack of evidence.
* The court previously continued a hearing to allow Plaintiff to oppose the motion with additional evidence.

**Key Facts & Arguments:**

* Plaintiff's work restrictions prevented him from performing his job duties as a maintenance technician.
* Defendants argue they explored potential alternative positions for Plaintiff but none were available due to company downsizing and economic hardship.
* Defendants presented evidence that Plaintiff was not qualified for alternative computer-based positions.
* Plaintiff's additional evidence from Zach Cheplak's deposition did not create a triable issue of fact.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* The court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment. 
* Plaintiff's claims are dismissed.
* Defendants are ordered to submit a proposed judgment.

**Next Steps:**

* A Non-Appearance Case Review is scheduled for October 4, 2023, to address the proposed judgment.


**English Summary:**

The judge ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motion for summary judgment, which essentially means the case is dismissed.  

The court found that the plaintiff's claims of discrimination and other workplace violations lacked sufficient evidence to proceed.  The judge specifically noted that the plaintiff's inability to perform his job duties due to work restrictions, combined with the defendants' evidence of a company downsizing and lack of available positions, led to the dismissal.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Javier Montes, had filed a first amended complaint alleging discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The defendants, SPS Technologies LLC dba PB Fasteners and Hector Pelayo, argued that they did not discriminate against Montes and that his work restrictions prevented him from performing his duties as a maintenance mechanic.

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by both sides and has determined that the undisputed material facts (UMFs) identified by the court do not create a triable issue of fact. The judge has also considered the deposition testimony of Zach Cheplak, a representative of the defendants, and has found that it is consistent with the defendants' evidence.

Based on this review, the judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and has ordered the defendants to submit a proposed judgment within five days.

### Summary

On April 25, 2022, Plaintiff Javier Montes filed a complaint against Defendants SPS Technologies LLC dba PB Fasteners and Hector Pelayo, alleging various violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and wrongful termination. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the court on September 21, 2023.

#### Background

* Plaintiff worked as a maintenance technician for Defendants.
* In 2020, Plaintiff submitted work restrictions due to a medical condition.
* Defendants investigated the possibility of accommodating Plaintiff's restrictions but found no available positions in the shipping and receiving department.
* The company had recently laid off nearly half its workforce due to reduced demand and the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Plaintiff was eventually terminated when he was unable to perform his regular duties.

#### Court's Ruling

* The court found no triable issue of fact regarding disability discrimination (UMFs 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41) as Defendants provided evidence that no appropriate positions were available due to the reduction in workforce.
* Cheplak's deposition testimony supports Defendants' position.
* The court denied Defendants' request for judicial notice of the Complaint and the Court's June 1, 2023 order as they are already part of the case's record.
* Defendants' objections to Plaintiff's supplemental evidence were overruled.
* The court found no triable issue of fact regarding punitive damages (UMFs 64, 65, 66) as Plaintiff's underlying claims fail and Plaintiff did not cite any relevant testimony from Cheplak.

#### Conclusion

The court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment and ordered them to submit a proposed judgment within five days. A Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for October 4, 2023, at 9:00 AM.
