Summary in English text:
The tentative ruling sustains the demurrers filed by the defendants, Ford Serviss, LLP, Collins|Ford, LLP, William H. Ford III, Claudia J. Serviss, and Michael D. Collins, and Beitchman & Zekian, P.C. and David P. Beitchman. The plaintiff, Franklin R. Fraley, Jr., filed a second amended complaint alleging conversion, intentional interference with contractual relationship, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and aiding and abetting fraudulent transfers. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred under the statute of limitations, as the statute began to run with the entry of judgment on the arbitration fee award on July 9, 2018, and the plaintiff did not file this action until January 22, 2020. The court also finds that the plaintiff cannot prove his claims without demonstrating that the defendants breached professional duties owed to him, and that the claims do not allege actual fraud.
