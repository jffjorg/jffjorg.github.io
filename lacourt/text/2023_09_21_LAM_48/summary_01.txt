The court also finds that the plaintiff cannot prove his claims without demonstrating that the defendants breached professional duties owed to him, and that the claims do not allege actual fraud.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendants, meaning that the case will likely be dismissed. The judge found that Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, as they were filed too late. The judge ruled that the actions of the Defendants related to the disbursement of settlement funds fall under the definition of "professional services" governed by California law, and therefore the statute of limitations for such claims applies.

The Plaintiff will have a chance to respond to the tentative ruling, but it appears unlikely that the case will proceed.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrers filed by the defendants and dismissing the action. The plaintiff, Franklin R. Fraley, Jr., filed a second amended complaint alleging conversion, intentional interference with contractual relationship, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and aiding and abetting fraudulent transfers. The defendants, Ford Serviss, et al., filed demurrers challenging the sufficiency of the complaint.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's claims arise from the disbursement of settlement proceeds and failure to pay plaintiff's fees, which are nonlegal services governed by an attorney's professional obligations. The judge has denied the requests for judicial notice and has sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling, written by Judge Thomas D. Long, sustains the defendants' demurrers without leave to amend and dismisses the case. The plaintiff, Franklin R. Fraley, Jr., had filed a second amended complaint against the defendants, including Ford Serviss, LLP and Beitchman & Zekian, P.C., alleging conversion, intentional interference with contractual relationship, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and aiding and abetting fraudulent transfers. The defendants had filed demurrers, which the court sustained, finding that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court determined that the statute of limitations began to run on July 9, 2018, and that the plaintiff did not file the action until January 22, 2020, which was after the deadline. The court also found that the plaintiff's claims arose from the disbursement of settlement proceeds and failure to pay attorney's fees, which were non-legal services governed by the defendants' professional obligations as attorneys. The court concluded that the plaintiff could not prove his claims without demonstrating that the defendants breached their professional duties, and that the action was therefore facially time-barred.

This tentative ruling sustains the demurrers of Ford Serviss, LLP, Collins|Ford, LLP, William H. Ford III, Claudia J. Serviss, Michael D. Collins, Beitchman & Zekian, P.C., and David P. Beitchman without leave to amend, dismissing the case. The ruling concludes that the action is time-barred due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for claims arising from the disbursement of settlement proceeds and failure to pay Plaintiff's fees pursuant to their attorney's liens, which are nonlegal services governed by an attorney's professional obligations. The exception for actual fraud does not apply to the fourth cause of action for "Aiding and Abetting Fraudulent Transfers" as it does not allege actual fraud. The statute of limitations began to run with the July 9, 2018 entry of judgment on the arbitration fee award, and Plaintiff did not file the action until January 22, 2020, missing the deadline.
