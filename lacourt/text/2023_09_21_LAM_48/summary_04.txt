The judge also noted that the parties' filings do not comply with electronic filing requirements, and warned that if the parties continue to file non-compliant documents, the court may strike the filings or issue sanctions. The judge set a deadline for the parties to submit on the tentative ruling, and indicated that if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
