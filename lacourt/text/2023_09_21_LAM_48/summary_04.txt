And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses filed by the plaintiff, The Law Firm of Fox and Fox. The motions were filed to compel defendant Miguel Arteaga to provide further responses to discovery. The judge found that the defendant's responses were incomplete or evasive in some cases, and granted the motions in part.

The judge ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses to requests for admission (RFA) Nos. 12, 15, and 17.1, and to produce documents in response to request for production of documents (RFP) Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The judge also ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses to RFP Nos. 4-14, 16-17, and 20, and to identify which documents correspond to each request.

The judge denied the motions in part, finding that the defendant's responses to RFA Nos. 2 and 15 were complete, and that the defendant did not have to produce any documents in response to RFP No. 3.

The judge also noted that the parties' filings do not comply with electronic filing requirements, and warned that if the parties continue to file non-compliant documents, the court may strike the filings or issue sanctions. The judge set a deadline for the parties to submit on the tentative ruling, and indicated that if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
