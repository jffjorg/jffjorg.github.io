And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a dispute between a plaintiff and a defendant, Boulevard Cadillac Buick GMC. The plaintiff claims that the defendant made false statements about a vehicle's condition before the plaintiff bought it, and that the vehicle ended up having transmission problems. The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the second and third causes of action, which means that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege fraud and negligent misrepresentation with sufficient specificity. Specifically, the complaint does not specify who made the allegedly false statements and when they were made, nor does it link the statements to the transmission problem. As a result, the complaint must be amended to address these deficiencies. The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike as moot in light of this ruling.
