  Case Number:  24STCV18530    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendants' demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud and third cause of action for negligent misrepresentation in the Plaintiff's complaint is sustained with leave to amend.   The complaint alleges that before the Plaintiff purchased the vehicle that is the subject of the complaint, Defendant Boulevard Cadillac Buick GMC told that Plaintiff that the vehicle had passed an 85-point inspection, was well taken care of, and had no mechanical problems.  According to the complaint, it turned out that the vehicle had transmission problems. The complaint fails to allege with specificity, as is required, who in particular made the statement/misrepresentation and when the statement/misrepresentation was made.  Further, the complaint fails to tie the statement/representation that the  vehicle had passed an 85-point inspection, was well taken care of, and had no mechanical problems to the transmission problem that is the thrust of the complaint.  In other words, the statement/representation that the vehicle had passed an 85-point inspection, was well taken care of, and had no mechanical problems is not necessarily false even if the vehicle had mechanical problems. The complaint must link one to the other.Defendants' motion to strike is denied as moot in light of the Court's ruling on the demurrer.
