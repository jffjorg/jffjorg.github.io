Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering three motions filed by the plaintiff to compel responses to discovery requests. The motions are related to document demands, interrogatories, and requests for admissions. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel has not received any responses to the discovery requests and has granted extensions to the defendant. The judge grants the motions, ordering the defendant to provide code-compliant responses without objection and deeming the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One, as admitted. The judge also considers imposing sanctions against the defendant and his counsel for failing to serve timely responses. The judge will hear argument on the merits of the motions and the payment of the additional filing fee.
