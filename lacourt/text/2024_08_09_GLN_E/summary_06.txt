And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to quash service of process, filed by the Defendant, Verjine Yesaian. The first motion, Motion 4249, was filed on May 17, 2024, and seeks to quash the proof of service filed with the Court on May 1, 2024. The second motion, Motion 1837, was filed on July 12, 2024, and seeks to quash the proof of service filed with the Court on July 9, 2024.

The Judge notes that Motion 4249 appears to be seeking to quash a proof of service that is no longer relevant, as a new proof of service was filed on July 9, 2024. The Judge also notes that Motion 1837 was filed late, as it was served on July 11, 2024, which is after the 16-day period required by law.

The Judge further notes that the Defendant's motion is borderline incomprehensible, as it lacks a supporting memorandum and fails to provide clear legal authority for its claims. The Judge also notes that the Defendant does not attempt to comply with the rules of court and fails to provide a clear explanation of its legal arguments.

Based on these findings, the Judge tentatively rules that Motion 4249 is moot and will be denied if not determined to be moot. The Judge also tentatively rules that Motion 1837 should be denied because it is not timely. The Judge will hear argument as to whether or not Motion 4249 is moot and will issue a final ruling after considering the arguments.
