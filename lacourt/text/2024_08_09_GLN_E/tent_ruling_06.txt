VERJINE YESAIAN
 
2-TENTATIVE RULINGS ON
MOTION TO 
Moving Party: Defendant, Verjine Yesaian 
Responding Party: No
Opposition by Plaintiff
[No Replies filed]
Preliminary
Matter
As a preliminary matter, two motions to quash
service of summons are on calendar for 8/9/2024. One motion ends with a Res ID
4249 (Motion 4249) and another motion ends with Res ID 1837 (Motion 1837).
Motion
4249
Proof of Service
Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): Ok

Proper Address: Uncertain – Defendant allegedly served this motion via U.S.
Mail. There are some discrepancies between the address that Defendant wrote
down on the proof of service for Plaintiff’s counsel, and the address that the
Court has on file on eCourt for Plaintiff’s counsel.
For example,
Defendant’s proof of service indicates that Plaintiff’s counsel was served by
U.S. Mail at 250 N Sunny Slope Rd 300, Brookfield WI 53005-4809.
However, on eCourt,
Plaintiff’s counsel’s address is listed as 250 N Sunnyslope Road, Suite 300,
Brookefield, Wisconsin, 53005.
As can be seen, Defendant’s
proof of service left out the first “e” in Brookefield according to eCourt.
Further, Defendant’s proof of service separated Sunnyslope into two words as
opposed to being one word as listed on eCourt.
Motion 1837
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC Rule
3.1300): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): No

Proper Address: Uncertain for the same reasons explained with respect to Motion
4249.
TENTATIVE
RULING
As a preliminary matter, the Court will hear
argument as to if Motion 4249 should be denied as moot. 
Motion 4249 was filed
on 5/17/2024. Defendant’s Motion 4249 does not indicate which proof of service
its motion seeks to quash service of summons. Presumably, Motion 4249 seeks to
quash the proof of service filed with the Court on 5/1/2024 with an alleged
substitute service date of 4/30/2024. The Court makes the assumption that
Motion 4249 is seeking to quash the proof of service filed on 5/1/2024 because
another proof of service of summons was filed with the Court on 7/9/2024 with a
substitute service date of 7/5/2024. Therefore, it doesn’t seem as if it would
make sense for Motion 4249 to be seeking to quash service of the proof of
service filed on 7/9/2024 (with a substitute service date of 7/5/2024) because
Motion 4249 was filed on 5/17/2024, which would precede the alleged service on
7/5/2024.  
Further, Motion 1837
appears as if it is directed at the proof of service filed with the Court on
7/9/2024. Motion 1837 was filed on 7/12/2024, which is after the proof of
service filed on 7/9/2024 with an alleged service date of 7/5/2024.
Further, Motion 1837
states, “Hearing was not held for the First Quash.”
Defendant appears to
be confused, because Defendant does not seem to realize that the hearing for
the first motion to quash was rescheduled. So it isn’t that the first motion to
quash was not held, it was that it was rescheduled to the instant hearing date.
Therefore, the parties
should be prepared to address if Motion 4249 is moot based on the filing of Motion
1837 that was filed after Motion 4249. 
Service
If Motion 4249 is denied as moot and the only
motion heard is Motion 1837, Motion 1837 does not appear to be timely, and this
motion should be denied.
“Unless otherwise
ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall
be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. The moving and
supporting papers served shall be a copy of the papers filed or to be filed
with the court. However, if the notice is served by mail, the required 16-day
period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by five calendar days if
the place of mailing and the place of address are within the State of
California, 10 calendar days if either the place of mailing or the place of
address is outside the State of California but within the United States[.]”
(CCP § 1005(b).)
Here, Motion 1837
alleges proof of service on July 11, 2024 by U.S. Mail at an address in
Wisconsin. The instant hearing is set for August 9, 2024. Sixteen court days
before August 9, 2024 is July 18, 2024; however, 10 calendar days must be added
because the place of mailing is outside the State of California. Therefore,
adding 10 calendar days appears to make it so that Motion 1837 had to have been
served by July 8, 2024. This motion was not allegedly served until July 11,
2024, thus it is late.
Not Moot
If Motion 4249 is not denied as moot, and
Motion 4249 is heard, Motion 4249 should be DENIED.
The Court notes that to
the extent that it is hearing Motion 4249, it is borderline indecipherable.
Defendant’s motion
stated:
COMES NOW
Verjine Yesaian, Defendant in the above-styled and numbered cause, and moves
the Court for an order quashing the process served in this action on Defendant
and vacating the return of service on the grounds that the process was not (e.g.,
issued or served) according to California code of Civil Procedure according
to the provisions of CCP 416.90- summons check box unclear if 416.90 or other.
This Motion is made and based on the declaration of Verjine Yesaian, and the
alleged proof of service.
(Mot. filed 5/17/2024 p. 1.)
“A party filing a motion, except for a motion listed in rule 3.1114,
must serve and file a supporting memorandum. The court may construe the absence
of a memorandum as an admission that the motion or special demurrer is not
meritorious and cause for its denial and, in the case of a demurrer, as a
waiver of all grounds not supported.” (CRC, Rule 3.1113(a).)
Further, under CRC, rule 3.1114(a):
Civil
motions, applications, and petitions filed on Judicial Council forms that do
not require a memorandum include the following:
(1)
 Application for appointment of guardian ad litem in a civil case;
(2)
 Application for an order extending time to serve pleading;
(3)
 Motion to be relieved as counsel;
(4)
 Motion filed in small claims case;
(5)
 Petition for change of name or gender;
(6)
 Petition for declaration of emancipation of minor;
(7)
 Petition for injunction prohibiting harassment;
(8)
 Petition for protective order to prevent elder or dependent adult abuse;
(9)
 Petition for order to prevent postsecondary school violence;
(10)
 Petition of employer for injunction prohibiting workplace violence;
(11)
 Petition for order prohibiting abuse (transitional housing);
(12)
 Petition to approve compromise of claim of a minor or a person with a
disability; and
(13)
 Petition for withdrawal of funds from blocked account.
(CRC, rule 3.1114(a).)
Here, Defendant did not file and serve a supporting memorandum, and
Defendant’s motion was not exempt under rule 3.1114(a).
“The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement
of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes,
cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (CRC, rule
3.1113(b).)
By not having a memorandum, Defendant’s motion is borderline
incomprehensible. 
“A summons may be served on a person not otherwise specified in this
article by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to such person
or to a person authorized by him to receive service of process.” (CCP §
416.90.)
Defendant makes no clear explanation as to what its argument is with
respect to 416.90.
Defendant also submits a declaration that states:
1.) I am
named as the defendant in this matter and reside at 831 East Orange Grove ave ,
in Burbank Ca. 
2.) I have
never been personally served with a copy of the summons and complaint in this
case to my place of residents mentioned above. I am informed and believe [sic]
that on or about May 3d, 2024, someone affixed some legal documents along with
a note which have included as exhibit (B) to the outside wall by the front door
of my residents mentioned above. I have never received a copy of the summons
and complaint in this case through the mail to my place of residents mentioned
at the above address. 
3.) I have
included copies of the summons and complaint that was attached to the wall by
the door of my residents mentioned above as exhibit (A).
4.) Except
as described above, I have no knowledge of the delivery to me of the summons
and complaint in this case. 
5.) The
proof of service filed by the plaintiff, which is attached as exhibit (A), does
not indicate whether he mailed the summons and a copy of the complaint, and, in
fact, does not indicate that the summons and the copy of the complaint were
even served, and all that was seen was a date on the summons without any
clarity of the checked box to which proof of service CCP 416, with no name of
the person receiving the summons. Rather, the proof of service filed with the
complaint identifies the served papers with only a date. 
6.) I
declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of California that
the forgoing is true and correct.
(Yesaian Decl. ¶¶ 1-6.)
Confusingly, while the Yesaian Declaration at ¶ 5 refers to the
attached Exhibit A, the attached Exhibit A in Defendant’s moving papers isn’t
even a proof of service. It is simply a summons, but there is no proof of
service. 
Most importantly, Defendant does not state what the legal standard is
for a motion to quash service of process, and how it satisfied the legal
standard required for quashing service of process.
Therefore if Motion 4249 is not deemed moot, then the Court will
likely deny Defendant’s motion to quash. Defendant does not attempt to comply
with CRC, rule 3.1113(a) or (b), and Defendant makes no argument using legal
authority as to how it satisfied the standard required in order to quash
service of process, whatever that standard may be.
Tentative Ruling
The Court will hear argument as to whether or
not Motion 4249 is moot. 
If Motion 4249 is not determined to be moot and is in fact heard,
Motion 4249 will be denied. 
Defendant’s Motion 4249 is borderline incomprehensible. Defendant does
not attempt to comply with CRC, rules 3.1113(a) or (b), and Defendant makes no
argument using legal authority as to how it satisfied the standard required to
quash service of process, whatever that standard may be.
Motion 1837 should also be denied because it is not timely under CCP §
1005(b).
Further, as the Court
also pointed out, there could potentially be an issue if both these motions
were served to the proper address.
