And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions to compel responses to discovery requests filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to serve responses without objections to the discovery requests, and is also seeking monetary sanctions against the defendant and his counsel for failure to timely respond to the discovery requests.

The motions were filed due to the defendant's failure to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, which were served on March 11, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel granted extensions for response, but the defendant still failed to serve timely responses.

The judge has granted the motions to compel responses to the discovery requests, and has deemed the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted. The judge has also ordered the defendant to pay monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $750.00 for each of the three motions.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's counsel is seeking additional sanctions in the amount of $2,250.00 for all three motions combined, based on an hourly rate of $450 and the time spent preparing the motions. The judge will hear argument on the issue of sanctions.

The plaintiff's counsel also requests an additional two hours preparing the reply brief, and one hour preparing for and attending the hearing on this matter.
