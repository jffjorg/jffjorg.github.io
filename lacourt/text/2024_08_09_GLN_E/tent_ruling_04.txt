Koppelman Declaration Opposition Papers: No Opposition Reply: Notice of Non-Opposition16/21 Day Lapse (CCP § 12c and § 1005(b)): OkProof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): OkCorrect Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, 1013b): OkLEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIESWithin 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)Further, if a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, “The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer” requirement.

(CCP § 2031.260(a).)If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer” requirement.

(CCP § 2033.280(b).)Further, “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2033.280(a).)“The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).) TENTATIVE RULING ALL MOTIONSServiceOn 7/19/2024, the instant three motion were supposed to be heard. The Court ultimately did not call them for hearing and continued them to 8/9/2024. However, in the Court’s tentative for 7/19/2024, the Court noted how there was a potential service problem with all three motions because the proofs of service for the motions did not indicate the email address that these motions were allegedly electronically served to.On 7/29/2024, Movant filed a supplemental declaration that addresses the Court’s prior proof of service problems that the Court explained in its tentative. The supplemental declaration filed on 7/29/2024 does in fact address the service problems that these motions faced.However, the Court notes that there is no proof of service for the supplemental declaration that states the supplemental declaration itself was served. There is a proof of service attached to the supplemental declaration that was allegedly served on 7/29/2024; however, this proof of service indicates that the Omnibus Declaration was served (a declaration pertaining to when the motions were initially filed). The proof of service filed on 7/29/2024 does not indicate that the supplemental declaration itself was served.The Court will hear argument.Four Motions, Not ThreePlaintiff lumps what should have been four motions into three motions.A motion must be brought separately as to each discovery method at issue. The instant three motions should have been filed as four separate motions and four filing fees paid. Plaintiff’s Motion 2 lumped compelling responses to Form and Special Interrogatories into one motion when it should have been filed as two separate motions, i.e., one motion for FROGs and one motion for SROGs. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.) If Plaintiff wants these four motions to be heard, they can pay the additional filing fee to the Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the additional filing fee before the hearing.Alternatively, Plaintiff is welcome to request the Court to advance and continue the instant hearings to a date that all four motions will be scheduled for; however, Plaintiff is warned that all motions must provide sufficient notice to Defendant. Further, Plaintiff would need to clarify which discovery method Motion 2 will pertain to on the future hearing date, i.e., will Motion 2 pertain to special interrogatories or form interrogatories. Presumably, the additional motion filed will clearly indicate what individual discovery method it pertains to, i.e. FROGs or SROGs.Movant filed a supplemental declaration on 7/29/2024 that stated that Plaintiff’s counsel expects that the additional filing fee will be paid approximately one week prior to the hearing date on 8/9/2024. The Court will hear argument as to if this filing fee was paid.If This Motion is Heard on the MeritsAs to the merits of these motions, On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff served his first set of Document Demands, SROGs, FROGs, and Requests for Admission. (Koppelman Decl. ¶ 3.) On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel spoke via phone with defense counsel, Joyce R. Dondanville, and sent her a meet and confer letter advising counsel that Defendant failed to issue timely responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests, and that Plaintiff requested code compliant responses without objections by May 10, 2024. (Koppelman Decl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s counsel granted another extension request to respond without objections by May 17, 2024. (See Koppelman Decl. ¶¶ 14-15.) As of the date of this filing [May 23, 2024], Plaintiff’s counsel has not received any responses to the discovery request. Therefore, Defendant did not provide responses within 30 days of service of the discovery, nor did Defendant provide responses by the extended deadline dates that Plaintiff granted to Defendant.Plaintiff’s Motions 1 and 2 are GRANTED and Defendant is ordered to provide code-compliant responses without objection.Plaintiff’s Motion 3 is GRANTED and the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted.Sanctions – Requests for Admission“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)Sanctions - Inspection DemandsIn relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states as follows:Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2031.300(c).) Sanctions – InterrogatoriesCCP § 2030.290 states in relevant part:The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Sanctions Ruling“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions against Defendant, Daniel Khoshnudyan, and his counsel of record, Gates, Gonter, Guy, Proudfoot & Muench, LLP, in the amount of $750.00 for each of the three motions filed. Plaintiff’s counsel requests a total of $2,250 for all three motions combined. This is based on an hourly rate of $450. It is also based on spending two hours preparing each of the three motions, resulting a total of six hours for all three motions combined. Plaintiff’s counsel also requests $61.65 in filing fees for each motion. (See Koppelman Decl. ¶ 19.) Plaintiff’s counsel also requests an additional two hours preparing the reply brief, and one hour preparing for and attending the hearing on this matter. (Koppelman Decl. ¶ 19.) The Court will hear argument as to sanctions. No Opposition was submitted, so the reply was simply a combined notice of non-opposition for all three motions.
