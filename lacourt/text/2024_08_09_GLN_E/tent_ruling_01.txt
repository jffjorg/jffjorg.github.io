[TENTATIVE RULING   - DEMURRER WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE]
RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant, Elvis Madatyan, moves the Court for an order sustaining his demurrer
to the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action in Plaintiffs’ SAC pursuant
to CCP § 430.10.
The
demurrer will be made and based upon this notice, the accompanying demurrer and
memorandum of points and authorities, the Declaration of Armen Shaghzo, and any
and all oral and documentary evidence that the Court may consider at the time
of the hearing on this matter.
BACKGROUND
An initial Complaint was
filed in this action on 9/19/2023. There was no demurrer hearing as to the
initial Complaint. 
The
FAC was filed on 2/2/2024.
On
May 3, 2024, this Court heard three demurrers to the FAC, and the Minute Order
noted that the Court took the matters under submission.
On
May 6, 2024, the Court ruled on the submitted matters.
On
May 22, 2024, the Minute Order for the Case Management Conference indicated
that the Court removed misnamed party Liana Yozalyan. Further, the 5-22-2024 Minute
Order indicated that “Discovery stay remains in place.”
On
6/4/2024, Plaintiffs filed their SAC.
The
instant action surrounds allegations that several Defendants plotted to
physically harm Plaintiff (Robert) because Robert discovered that Elda (not
presently sued because Elda is a debtor in bankruptcy) was embezzling money
from a business that Robert had substantial interests in.

Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel alleges that a meet and confer occurred, but a resolution
was not able to be met. (Shaghzo Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for
uncertainty, CCP § 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or
what counts or claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Defendant argues that the
fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action in the SAC did not allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.
Fifth Cause of Action – Loss of Consortium
The elements for loss of
consortium are: (1) a valid and lawful marriage between the plaintiff and the
person injured at the time of the injury; (2) a tortious injury to the
plaintiff’s spouse; (3) loss of consortium suffered by the plaintiff; and (4)
the loss was proximately caused by the defendant’s act. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 746, fn. 2.)
Here,
Defendant only attacks the element of proximate causation with respect to the
fifth cause of action.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs allege no facts that Elvis himself proximately caused a
tortious injury to Marina’s spouse Robert.
The
Court does not find Defendant’s argument availing because Defendant does not
support its argument with legal authority. Defendant appears to be arguing that
since Edgar was the one who shot Robert, Elvis cannot be held liable as to this
claim because Marina’s loss was not proximately caused by Elvis’s acts.
Defendant
overlooks that it is alleged that Elvis conspired and agreed to have Edgar
assault Robert by providing information to Elda that would facilitate Edgar’s
tracking the location of Robert so that Edgar could murder Robert. (See Compl.
¶ 38.) The Court notes that at ¶ 42 located under the fifth cause of action,
the SAC re-alleged and incorporated the allegations in prior paragraphs.
Defendant
argues that the SAC didn’t state when this discussion occurred and how it was
connected to the shooting of Robert. Defendant does not provide legal authority
that the level of specificity with respect to causation that Defendant argues
for is in fact required by the law.
Tentative Ruling – Fifth Cause of Action
Defendant’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED.
Sixth Cause of Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress
As stated in Yau v.
Santa Margarita Ford, Inc.:
“ ‘ “[T]o state a cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress a plaintiff must show: (1) outrageous conduct by the
defendant; (2) the defendant's intention of causing or reckless disregard of
the probability of causing emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff's suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct.” ’ [Citation.] ‘
“Conduct, to be ‘ “outrageous” ’ must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of
that usually tolerated in a civilized society.” ’ [Citation.] In order to
avoid a demurrer, the *161 plaintiff must allege with ‘great[ ]
specificity’ the acts which he or she believes are so extreme as to exceed all
bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community. [Citation.]” (Vasquez
v. Franklin Management Real Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th
819, 832, 166 Cal.Rptr.3d 242 (Vasquez ).)
(Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc. (2014)
229 Cal.App.4th 144, 160-61.)
Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs Robert and
Gregory do not plead the conduct with “great specificity” is availing. 
Here, Plaintiffs do not allege with specificity
the acts for each Defendant which they believe are so extreme as to exceed all
bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.
Plaintiffs’ ¶ 46 of the SAC simply refers to “In
doing the things alleged[.]” Thus, it is not clear what Plaintiffs are
referring to as the outrageous conduct by moving Defendant that caused Robert
and Gregory harm.
Further, ¶ 46 of the SAC, which is the first
paragraph of the sixth cause of action, did not re-allege or reincorporate
prior allegations of the SAC.
Plaintiffs, at the very least, did not allege
the first element of this cause of action.
Tentative Ruling – Sixth Cause of Action
Defendant’s demurrer to
the sixth cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend granted.
Seventh Cause of Action – Aiding and Abetting Assault and Battery
As stated in Stueve Bros. Farms, LLC:
“Liability may also be imposed on one who aids and abets the
commission of an intentional tort if the person (a) knows the other's conduct
constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement
to the other to so act or (b) gives substantial assistance to the other in
accomplishing a tortious result and the person's own conduct, separately
considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third person. [Citations.]” (Saunders
v. Superior Court, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th at p. 846, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d
438; accord, Casey v. U.S. Bank Nat. Assn. (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 1138, 1144, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 401.) “Despite some conceptual
similarities, civil liability for aiding and abetting the commission of a tort,
which has no overlaid requirement of an independent duty, differs fundamentally
from liability based on conspiracy to commit a tort. [Citations.] ‘
“[A]iding-abetting focuses on whether a defendant knowingly gave ‘substantial
assistance’ to someone who performed wrongful conduct, not on whether the
defendant agreed to join the wrongful conduct.” ’ ” (Berg & Berg
Enterprises, LLC v. Sherwood Partners, Inc., supra, 131
Cal.App.4th at p. 823, fn. 10, 32 Cal.Rptr.3d 325.)
(Stueve Bros. Farms, LLC v. Berger Kahn (2013)
222 Cal.App.4th 303, 324.)
As
a preliminary matter, Defendant does not state what elements must be alleged
for this cause of action.
However,
Defendant points out that the SAC’s allegations don’t allege that Defendant knowingly
gave substantial assistance. 
Here,
Defendant’s argument is availing, as the SAC does not in fact allege that
Defendant knowingly gave substantial assistance. The Opposition does not
address Defendant’s argument on this issue.
Tentative Ruling
Defendant’s demurrer to
the seventh cause of action for aiding and abetting assault and battery is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend granted.
