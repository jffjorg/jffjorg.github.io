Proper Address (CCP §1013, §1013a, §1013b): Yes/No – Defendant served this
demurrer to Plaintiff at email addresses that are not listed as Plaintiff’s
email address in the Court’s file. On eCourt, Plaintiff’s email address is
listed as office@margarianlaw.com; however, that email address was not served.
However, Plaintiff filed an Opposition, so it is clear that Plaintiff received
this demurrer.
Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., §430.41, subd. (a).)  “The parties
shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
moving party alleged it met and conferred. (Decl. Yang ¶12.)
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed a
Complaint on 10/06/2023. On 02/05/2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC). On 2/16/2024, the Court denied Defendant’s demurrer and motion
to strike directed at the original Complaint as moot based on the filing of the
FAC.
The
FAC alleged five causes of action for: (1) Fraud and Deceit; (2) Breach of
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Selling Automobile Above
Advertised Price; (4) Violation of Business & Professions Code §17200, et
seq.; (5) Violation of Business & Professions code §17500, et seq.; and (6)
Violation of California Consumer Legal Remedies Act.
On
4/12/2024, this Court heard Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC. The demurrer to
the first and second causes of action was sustained without leave to amend. The
demurrer to the third cause of action was sustained with leave to amend
granted. The demurrer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action was
overruled.
On
5/13/2024, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC).
The
SAC alleges four causes of action for: (1) Selling Automobile Above Advertised
Price, (2) Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200, et seq., (3)
Violation of Business & Professions code § 17500, et seq., and (4)
Violation of California Consumer Legal Remedies Act.
Defendant
now demurs to the first cause of action in the SAC.
The
instant action revolves around Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendant
advertised the subject vehicle for a price of $134,335.00 on its website;
however, the subject vehicle was leased to Plaintiff for $146,435.00.
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)

Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP § 430.10(f), is disfavored and will
only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably
respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or
denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him/her. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
First Cause of Action – Selling Automobile Above
Advertised Price
The
first cause of action in the SAC is labeled as “Selling Automobile Above
Advertised Price.”
In this cause of action, Plaintiff cites to several
subsections of the California Code of Regulations, California Vehicle Code, and
the Code of Federal Regulations. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of
Defendant leasing the subject vehicle above the advertised price, Defendant violated
Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 13,
§ 260.04(b), Cal. Veh. Code § 11713.1(b)€, and 16 C.F.R. §§ 238.0-238.4. (See
SAC  88.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to state a
cause of action for the first cause of action because Plaintiff lacks standing
to bring suit under each of the statutes that Plaintiff cited in the SAC.
As stated in Lu v. Hawaiian
Gardens Casino, Inc.:
A violation of a state statute does not
necessarily give rise to a private cause of action. (Vikco Ins.
Services, Inc. v. Ohio Indemnity Co. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 55, 62, 82
Cal.Rptr.2d 442 (Vikco ).) Instead, whether a party has a
right to sue depends on whether the Legislature has “manifested an intent to
create such a private cause of action” under the statute. (Moradi–Shalal
v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 305, 250
Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58 (Moradi–Shalal ) [no
legislative intent that Ins.Code, §§
790.03 & 790.09 create private cause of action against
insurer for bad faith refusal to settle claim]; Crusader Ins. Co. v.
Scottsdale Ins. Co. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 121, 131, 135, 62
Cal.Rptr.2d 620 (Crusader ) [no legislative intent
that Ins.Code, § 1763 gave admitted insurers private right to sue
surplus line brokers].) Such legislative intent, if any, is revealed through
the language of the statute and its legislative history. (See Moradi–Shalal,
supra, 46 Cal.3d at pp. 294–295, 250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58.)
A statute may contain “ ‘clear,
understandable, unmistakable terms,’ ” which strongly and directly indicate
that the Legislature intended to create a private cause of action. (Moradi–Shalal,
supra, 46 Cal.3d at p. 295, 250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58.) For
instance, the statute may expressly state that a person has or is liable for a
cause of action for a particular violation. (See, e.g., Civ.Code, §
51.9 [“A person is liable in a cause of action for sexual harassment” when
a plaintiff proves certain elements]; Health & Saf.Code, § 1285, subd.
(c) [“Any person who is detained in a health facility solely for the
nonpayment of a bill has a cause of action against the health facility for the
detention”].) Or, more commonly, a statute may refer to a remedy or means of
enforcing its substantive provisions, i.e., by way of an action.3 (See,
e.g., § 218 [“Nothing ***502 in this article shall limit the
right of any wage claimant to sue directly or through an assignee for any wages
or penalty due him under this article”]; Bus. & Prof.Code, §
17070 [“Any person ... may bring an action to enjoin and restrain any
violation of this chapter and, in addition thereto, for the recovery of
damages”]; **349 id., § 6175.4, subd. (a) [“A
client who suffers any damage as the result of a violation of this article by
any lawyer may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain one or
more of the following remedies”]; Civ.Code, § 1748.7, subd. (d) [“Any
person injured by a violation of this section may bring an action for the
recovery of damages, equitable relief, and reasonable attorney's fees and
costs”]; see Crusader, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at p. 136, 62
Cal.Rptr.2d 620 [listing other statutes expressly creating cause of
action].) If, however, a statute does not contain such obvious language, resort
to its legislative history is next in order. (Moradi–Shalal, supra, 46
Cal.3d at pp. 300–301, 250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58; see Crusader,
supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at pp. 133–134, 136, 62 Cal.Rptr.2d
620 [relying on principles of general statutory interpretation].)
(Lu v. Hawaiian Gardens Casino, Inc. (2010) 50
Cal.4th 592, 596-97.)
Defendant argues that nothing in the language of the
statutes that Plaintiff cited in the first cause of action refer to any
legislative intent to create a private cause of action or otherwise provides
for a remedy or means of enforcement by a private individual.
Here, the Court finds Defendant’s argument availing. 
In Opposition, Plaintiff doesn’t even attempt to address
Defendant’s argument that there is no private right of action for violations of
the statutes that Plaintiff cited in the SAC under its first cause of action.
Further, Plaintiff doesn’t attempt to address this argument by citing to
legislative intent, nor does Plaintiff attempt to point to language in the
statutes that directly indicate the legislature intended to create a private
cause of action.
If Plaintiff believes its citations to Toyota of
Visalia, Inc. v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 315 or Thomas
v. Wright (1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 921 address Defendant’s arguments, they do
not. Those cases have nothing to do with the instant scenario here and are
entirely inapposite.
Tentative Ruling First Cause of Action
Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action is
sustained. 
Defendant argued that there is no private right of
action for the violations of statutes that Plaintiff cited within its first
cause of action for “Selling Automobile Above Advertised Price.” Defendant
argued that nothing in the language of the statutes refer to any legislative
intent to create a private cause of action nor do they provide a remedy or
means of enforcement by a private individual. 
The Opposition did not attempt to argue anything
contrary to Defendant’s position, nor did Defendant try to cite legal authority
to the contrary of Defendant’s position. 
Further, upon the Court’s search on Westlaw in
attempts to find a cause of action for “Selling Automobile Above Advertised
Price,” the Court could not find such a cause of action.
The Defendant made several arguments to the effect
that the statutes cited by Plaintiff in the first cause of action pertained to
selling, not leasing. The Court will not address these arguments in light of its
previous discussion as to why it is sustaining the demurrer to the first cause
of action.
Additionally, Defendant makes arguments about the sham
pleading doctrine, but the Court is not clear as to what argument Defendant is
trying to make.
Leave to Amend
As
stated in Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th
1566, 1570-71:
If the complaint, liberally construed, can state
a cause of action, or if it is reasonably possible that the plaintiffs can cure
the complaint by amendment, the trial court should not sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend. (Heckendorn v. City of San Marino (1986) 42
Cal.3d 481, 486 [229 Cal.Rptr. 324, 723 P.2d 64].) The burden is on
the plaintiffs to establish the reasonable possibility that the defect is
curable. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) A
demurrer is properly sustained without leave to amend if it appears that under
applicable substantive law there is no reasonable possibility that *1571 an
amendment could remedy the defects. (Heckendorn v. City of San Marino, supra,
42 Cal.3d at p. 486.)
 
(Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993)
18 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1570-71.)
 
The Court will hear argument as to if leave to amend
should be granted.
Defendant requested judicial notice of Plaintiff’s
original Complaint dated October 6, 2023. The Court GRANTS judicial notice.

RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant Calstar Motors Inc. (hereinafter
“Defendant” or “Dealer”) will, and hereby does move, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 435 and 436 for an order striking the following portions of
Plaintiff Gagik Grigoryan’s (“Plaintiff”) operative Second Amended Complaint
(the “SAC”): 
1. All references to
Vehicle Code § 11713.19, 13 C.C.R. § 260.04, and 16 C.F.R. § 238.0-238.4 should
be stricken, including without limitation, the following: 
a. Page 16, paragraph
102, which reads in pertinent part: “Cal. Veh. Code § 11713.19, Cal. Code Regs.
Tit. 13, § 260.04, and 16 C.F.R. § 238.0-§ 238.4.” 
b. Page 17, paragraph
102, which reads in pertinent part: “Cal. Veh. Code § 11713.19(a)(1) states
that it is ‘unlawful and a violation of this code’ to ‘negotiate the terms of a
vehicle sale or lease contract and then add charges to the contract for any goods
or services without previously disclosing to the consumer the goods and
services to be added and obtaining the consumer’s consent.’ The extras have to
be disclosed to the consumer and the consumer has to consent in writing to
these extras.” 
c. Page 17, paragraph
102, which reads in pertinent part: “Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 13, § 260.04(b)
mandates that vehicles advertised by a dealer or lessor-retailer must be shown
and sold at the advertised price or below the advertised price irrespective of whether
or not the advertised price has been communicated to the purchaser/lessee.” 
d. Page 17, paragraph
102, which reads in pertinent part: “16 C.F.R. § 238.0-§ 238.4 prohibits bait
advertising and switches. Defendant committed bait advertising related to the
Subject Vehicle with purpose of switching Plaintiff from leasing the Subject
Vehicle at a higher price than advertised, because this was more advantageous
to Defendant.” 
e. Page 20, paragraph
108, which reads in pertinent part: “Cal. Veh. Code § 11713.19, Cal. Code Regs.
Tit. 13, § 260.04, 16 C.F.R. § 238.0-§ 238.4,”
This motion is based on
this Notice and the attached supporting Memorandum of Points and Authorities,
declaration of Katherine Yang in support thereof, the concurrently filed
Demurrer, all other papers on file in this Court, oral argument at the hearing
on this motion, and on any other evidence the Court deems appropriate.
Meet and
Confer
Before filing a motion
to strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be
reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike. If
an amended pleading is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again
with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a motion to strike
the amended pleading. (CCP §435.5(a).)
Here, Defendant’s
counsel alleged a meet and confer occurred but an agreement was unable to be
reached. (Yang Decl. ¶ 12.)
LEGAL
STANDARD – MOTION TO STRIKE
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).) The court may also strike
all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws
of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436(b).)  A motion to strike cannot be based upon the grounds that a
complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, but
instead is properly based on grounds of superfluous or abusive allegations, or
improprieties in form or procedure.  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008)
161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528-29.)   
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on
the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Code. Civ. Proc.
§ 437; Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010)
191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63 [“judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a
motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their
truth”].)   
Further, CCP §431.10(a)-(c) states as follows:
(a) A material
allegation in a pleading is one essential to the claim or defense and which
could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient as to
that claim or defense.
(b) An immaterial
allegation in a pleading is any of the following:
(1) An allegation
that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense.
(2) An allegation
that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or
defense.
(3) A demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint.
(c) An “immaterial
allegation” means “irrelevant matter” as that term is used in Section 436.
 
(CCP §431.10(a)-(c).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendant seeks to strike allegations that are all located in
the second cause of action. Defendant argues that the allegations it seeks to
strike are irrelevant and should be stricken.
 
The Court does not find this argument availing because
Defendant did not demur to the second cause of action. Defendant argues that
citations to the statutes cited in the second cause of action are inapplicable,
but Defendant does not demonstrate that those statutes are inapplicable. 
 
A motion to strike cannot be based upon the grounds that a complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, but instead is
properly based on grounds of superfluous or abusive allegations, or
improprieties in form or procedure.  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008)
161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528-29.) 
 
Whether or not the language that Defendant seeks to strike is
inapplicable, the Court would not know, as Defendant cites no legal authority
as to what is applicable to successfully allege the second cause
of action. Further, Defendant did not demur to the second cause of action.
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is DENIED in its entirety.
