On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff, Sophia Henry, filed this
action against Defendants Rob Bonta, acting as California Attorney General for
the State of California (“Bonta”), Ana M. Lasso, acting as Director of
Department of General Services Office of Risk and Insurance Management for
State of California (“Lasso”), the State of California, Employment Development
Department (EDD), and Paid Family Leave Office—Fresno (collectively,
“Defendants”), arising from the denial of Plaintiff’s Paid Family Leave claim.  Plaintiff is self-represented. 
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed two motions: (1) Motion
for An Order Establishing Admissions and for Sanctions, and (2) Motion for
Order Compelling Answers to Interrogatories and for Sanctions.  The motions are asserted against all
Defendants.
 
On March 8, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against the State of California, EDD, and Paid Family Leave Office – Fresno.
 
On March 26, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against Bonta and Lasso.  
 
            Given that
default has been entered against all defendants, Plaintiff’s motions are DENIED
as moot.  The court notes that the State
of California filed a declaration challenging proof of service as to all
Defendants.  An OSC re: Proof of Service
and a Case Management Conference are scheduled for May 3, 2024.  The court will hear from the parties. 
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.
