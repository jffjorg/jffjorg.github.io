[1] A failure to oppose a motion may
be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 8.54(c).)


[2] On April 29, 2024, Banks filed an
ex parte application which requested, in relevant part, that the court take
this motion to compel off-calendar because Banks has agreed to sit for
deposition, the appointment of a discovery referee, and to sharing equally in
the costs of the referee.  Banks further
requested that any sanctions request be denied. 
Because the parties did not stipulate to taking this motion off
calendar, the court denied Plaintiff’s request. 
 As to Banks’s further request
regarding sanctions, the court notes that Plaintiffs incurred costs in
attempting to take Banks’s deposition prior to the filing of this motion.   The court has found the motion is
meritorious, and further, that appointment of a referee is warranted given
Banks’s unwillingness to answer questions at her deposition.  The deposition was not completed, thus
necessitating this motion.  Sanctions are
therefore warranted.
