And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Gary Richard Carlin to set aside the default entry against him. Carlin's motion is granted, and the default entry is set aside. Carlin had claimed that the default was entered due to mistake, accident, surprise, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, as well as extrinsic fraud and extrinsic mistake. The judge found that Carlin had sufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for the entry of default, including the fact that his wife was seriously injured in June and he spent many days out of the office to care for her. The judge also found that Carlin was involved in an auto accident in August, which totaled his car. The judge concluded that Carlin was not merely "busy" and "forgot" about the lawsuit, but was faced with a series of traumatic experiences that directed his attention away from his place of work, where the Complaint was served. The judge granted Carlin's motion and ordered him to file his responsive pleading, which is deemed filed as of the date of this ruling.
