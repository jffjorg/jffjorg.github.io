 Hearing Date:  December 20, 2024



 
Defendant
Gary Richard Carlin’s motion to set aside the entry of default entered against
him by pro per Plaintiff Dawn Elizabeth Carbajal on September 9, 2024,
is granted.  Defendant is ordered to file
the responsive pleading attached to his motion, which is deemed filed as of the
date of this ruling.
 
Defendant
Gary Richard Carlin (“Carlin”) (“Moving Defendant”) moves for this Court to set
aside the default entered against him on September 9, 2024, by pro per Plaintiff Dawn Elizabeth
Carbajal on the grounds that default
was entered due to mistake, accident, surprise, inadvertence, and excusable neglect,
as well as extrinsic fraud and extrinsic mistake.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §473.)  
 
Background
          On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed her
operative Complaint against Carlin, Valentin Urgils (“Urgils”), and Reyna
Kramer (“Kramer”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging four causes of action.  (See Complaint.)
          On September 9, 2024, default was
entered against Carlin.  As of the date
of this hearing no Default Judgment has been entered in this matter.
On October
1, 2024, Carlin filed the instant motion. 
Plaintiff filed her opposition on October 28, 2024.  Defendant filed his reply on December 16,
2024.
 
Motion to Vacate/Set Aside Dismissal
The
law favors judgments on the merits. Thus, on a motion for relief from default,
“doubts must be resolved in favor of relief, with an order denying
relief scrutinized [on appeal] more carefully than an order granting it.”  (Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th
127, 134.)
The
trial court has broad discretion to vacate the judgment and/or the clerk’s
entry of default that preceded it.  However,
that discretion can be exercised only if the moving party establishes a proper
ground for relief, by the proper procedure, and within the proper time limits.  (See Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)
The
court is empowered to relieve a party or his legal representative “upon any
terms as may be just . . . from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (C.C.P.
§473(b).)
C.C.P.
§473(b) consists of two distinct parts: “a discretionary provision, which
applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies as of right.” (Minick
v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25-26; Bailey v. Citibank,
N.A. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 335, 348.)
The
reference to “judgment . . .  order or
other proceedings” allows relief both from default judgments and from the entry
of default that preceded it. It also includes any step taken in a case,
whether by the court or by one of the parties: “Anything done from the
commencement to the termination is a proceeding.” (Zellerino v. Brown
(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1105.)
Evidence
that a defendant was seriously ill, or feeble, or unable
to understand that he was being served with process, is sufficient to
justify discretionary relief under § 473(b). Such evidence shows
“excusable neglect” in allowing default to occur.  (See Kesselman v. Kesselman (1963)
212 Cal.App.2d 196, 207-208.)
Carlin’s
counsel declares on information and belief that, “Gwyn Carlin, the elderly wife
of [Carlin] . . . was seriously injured in June losing the usage of her left
arm for an extended period of time. Gary Carlin spent many days a week out of
the office in June, July and August to care for his wife, including but not
limited to doctor’s visits, hospital visits, therapy, meals, etc.”  (Decl. of Deveraux ¶3.)  Carlin’s counsel declares on information and
belief that “in addition to Mr. Carlin’s care to his wife, that both were recently
involved in an auto accident that totaled their vehicle in August.”  (Decl. of Deveraux ¶4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares on information
and belief that these two intervening incidents in Carlin’s life is the reason
for the mistake, accident, surprise, inadvertence and excusable neglect, as
well as extrinsic fraud and extrinsic mistake. 
(Decl. of Deveraux ¶5.) 
Carlin
sufficiently demonstrates a reasonable excuse for the entry of default, based
on the fact that his attorney’s declaration states Carlin spent many days a
week out of the office in June, July and August.  Substituted service was effected on Carlin at
his place of work on June 27, 2024. 
(9/9/24 Proof of Substituted Service.) 
Here, Carlin was distracted by caring for his seriously injured wife for
over three months, and then was involved in a car accident in August, which
totaled his car.  Carlin was not merely
“busy” and “forgot” about the lawsuit; Carlin was faced with a series of
traumatic experiences that directed his attention away from his place of work,
where the Complaint was served.
Plaintiff’s
opposition, and, specifically, the exhibits attached to her declaration, do not
establish that Carlin had actual knowledge of his having been served with a
summons and complaint.  At most, standing
alone, the emails establish that Plaintiff was seeking some sort of relief from
Carlin, but they make no reference to suit having been filed.  The Notice of Ruling concerns a September 24,
2024 Case Management Conference, conducted after default had been entered.  It cannot be said to establish that Carlin
was aware of having been served with the instant suit prior to default having been
entered on September 9, 2024.  
Accordingly,
Carlin’s motion is granted.   The entry
of default against Carlin entered on September 9, 2024, is set aside. Carlin
attaches his responsive pleading to this motion.  (Motion, Exh. A.)  Carlin may separately file his general denial.
 
Conclusion
Carlin’s
motion to set aside the entry of default entered on September 9, 2024, is granted.

Carlin
may separately file his responsive pleading, which is deemed filed as of the
date of this ruling.
Moving Party to give notice.
