Meet and Confer
A motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Moving Defendant’s counsel’s declaration stated that she exchanged
correspondence with Plaintiff’s counsel via Microsoft Teams regarding the
instant motion, and Plaintiff and Moving Defendant were unable to reach an
agreement.  (See Decl. of Eaton
¶10.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration substantially complies with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Accordingly, the Court will consider Moving
Defendant’s motion.
 
Background
On June 21, 2024, Moving Defendant
served a notice for the deposition of Plaintiff Sampson set for July 26, 2024,
to take place in person in Los Angeles, California.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶2, Exh. A.)  Having received no objection to the
deposition notice, Moving Defendant’s counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel, Jacob
Partiyeli (“Partiyeli”), on July 23, 2024, via email to confirm he would be
producing Plaintiff Sampson for his deposition on July 26, 2024.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
responded on July 24, 2024, stating that he mailed objections to the deposition
notice.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶3.)  That
same day, Moving Defendant’s counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel that they had
not received objections to the deposition notice and requested that Plaintiff’s
counsel provide the objections via electronic mail for review.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶3.)  Moving Defendant received no
response from Plaintiff’s counsel and no objections, so Moving Defendant
cancelled Plaintiff’s deposition.  (Decl.
of Eaton ¶3.)
On October 10, 2024, Moving Defendant
served via electronic mail its notice of deposition of Plaintiff Sampson with
Request for Production of Documents (“RFP”) for October 25, 2024.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶4.)  On October 23, 2024, Moving Defendant’s
counsel received Plaintiff’s objection to the notice of deposition stating
Plaintiff would not appear at his deposition. 
(Decl. of Eaton ¶5, Exh. D.)
On October 23, 2024, Moving Defendant’s
counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel via email requesting dates of availability
in November in order to reschedule the deposition of Plaintiff Sampson; Moving
Defendant’s counsel did not receive a response.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶6.)  On October 24, 2024, Moving Defendant’s
counsel again emailed Plaintiff’s counsel attempting to obtain available dates
in November for Plaintiff Sampson’s deposition. 
(Decl. of Eaton ¶6.)   Plaintiff’s counsel responded, stating he
would not be available until early January, but failed to provide any dates.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶6.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel informed
Plaintiff’s counsel that they would need to take Plaintiff’s deposition prior
to January 2025 and informed him that should he fail to provide earlier dates, Moving
Defendant’s counsel would re-notice Plaintiff’s deposition for November 7th,
2024.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶6, Exh. E.)  Plaintiff’s counsel refused to provide
earlier dates.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶6, Exh.
E.)
On October 25, 2024, Moving Defendant’s
counsel served all counsel via electronic mail with its Amended Notice of
Deposition of Plaintiff Sampson with RFP scheduling Plaintiff Sampson’s
deposition in this case for November 7, 2024. 
(Decl. of Eaton ¶7.)
Plaintiff did not object to the notice
and did not appear for the deposition; a notice of non-appearance was
taken.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶8, Exh. G.)  
Moving Defendant filed the instant
motion on December 11, 2024.  Plaintiff
filed his opposition on December 16, 2024. 
Moving Defendant filed its reply on December 17, 2024.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part,
“[t]he service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to
require any deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent
part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          The
Court grants Moving Defendant’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders
Plaintiff Sampson to appear
for deposition and produce documents and things within ten (10) days of this
Court’s ruling.  Plaintiff was properly served with a
deposition notice and failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition.
          Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s motion is granted.
 
Sanctions
C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1) states, “If a
motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the Court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”
Moving Defendant requests sanctions in
the amount of $2,793.00 against Plaintiff Sampson and his counsel of record,
jointly and severally.
The Court grants Moving Defendant’s
request for sanctions in the amount of $2,793.00 calculated as follows:
 ([7.6
hours x $335.00/hour] + [4 hours x 335.00/hour]/2 motions) = $1,943
$850.00 in court reporter fees + $1,943
= $2,793.00
Moving Defendant’s request for sanctions
against Plaintiff and his Counsel of record, jointly and severally, is granted
in the amount of $2,793.00, payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s motion to compel is granted.  Plaintiff Sampson is to appear for deposition
with 10 days of this ruling.
