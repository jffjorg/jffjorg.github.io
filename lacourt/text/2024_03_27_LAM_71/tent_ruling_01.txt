Plaintiff  produced documents on or around October 28, 2021, December 3, 2021, April 8,  2022, and February 29, 2024, which were uploaded to the Disco Ediscovery  platform database for this matter.  (Decl.  of Taran ¶5.)  In total, the database  reflects that Contractor produced 36,381 documents, many of which are  photographs of the construction at the Project.  (Decl. of Taran ¶5.)  On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel  produced a USB drive, which contained the same documents as produced by  Plaintiff on February 29, 2024, via a drop box link.  (Decl. of Taran ¶5.)

MSL Electric produced 2,324 documents, 700 of which are entirely “new”  documents.  (Decl. of Taran ¶6.)  ABP discovered many “new” documents,  like communications between Contractor and Doreck Construction and MSL  Electric, which were responsive to multiple requests that Plaintiff stated it  would produce responsive documents in response to.  (Decl. of Taran ¶6.) Plaintiff’s  employee and person most knowledgeable (“PMK”), James Walsh, testified on March  12, 2024, that Plaintiff’s foreman kept daily diaries/field log notes, which were  plugged into a software called Built to Win on an iPad. (Decl. of Taran ¶7, Exh.  5.)  Plaintiff failed to produce a single  daily report relating to the project.   (Decl. of Taran ¶7.) ABP  filed the instant motion on March 20, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on March 25,  2024.  As of the date of this hearing no  reply has been filed. Plaintiff objects to ABP’s motion as  untimely filed and served 12 days past the filing deadline.  Plaintiff further objects on the basis ABP  failed to meet and confer on this motion.   The Court in its discretion will consider ABP’s motion.  Further, there is no requirement to meet and  confer on a motion to compel compliance; all that has to be shown is the  responding party’s failure to comply as agreed.   (C.C.P. §2031.320(a).)   Legal  Standard If a  party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or  sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240 [required  statement of compliance] and thereafter fails to permit the inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s statement of  compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.  (See C.C.P. §2031.320(a); Standon  Co. v. Superior Court (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 902 [“a party may seek to  compel ‘compliance’ with the demand if ‘a party filing a response . . . under  subdivision (f) thereafter fails to permit the inspection in accordance with  that party’s statement of compliance.’ No time limit is placed on such a motion.”],  internal citations omitted.)   Discussion ABP’s  motion to compel Plaintiff’s compliance with its statement of compliance in the  RFPs is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.320(a).  Plaintiff is ordered to comply with its  statement of compliance within 15 days of this ruling.   Sanctions C.C.P.  §2031.320(b) provides, “Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a  motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that the one subject  to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” ABP  requests sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500.00.  ABP’s counsel, David A. Taran declares his  hourly rate is $645.00 and he spent 1 hour meeting and conferring and reviewing  this motion.  (Decl. of Taran ¶12.)  Taran declares his associate, Leeran  Abukasis’ hourly rate is $495.00 and he spent over 7 hours preparing the  instant motion.  (Decl. of Taran  ¶12.)  Taran declares he anticipates  another three hours reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and appearing  for the hearing on this motion. ABP  is not entitled to fees incurred while meeting and conferring or on anticipated  fees.  As such, the Court grants ABP  sanctions against Plaintiff and its counsel of record as follows: (3  hours x $495 = $1,485.00.)           Accordingly, ABP is granted reduced  sanctions in the amount of $1,485.00, against Plaintiff and its counsel of  record, payable within 15 days.   Conclusion ABP’s  motion to compel compliance is granted.   Plaintiff is ordered to comply with its statement of compliance within  15 days. ABP’s  request for sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $1,485.00, against  Plaintiff and its counsel of record, payable within 15 days. Moving  Party to give notice.   2.      Motion  to Compel Further- RFA Background ABP  served Plaintiff with its Requests for Admission (Set Two) (“RFA”) on February  6, 2024.  (Decl. of Abukasis ¶3, Exh. 4.) ABP  filed the instant motion on March 14, 2024. Plaintiff filed its opposition on March 25,  2024.  As of the date of this hearing no  reply has been filed.   Legal  Standard A  propounding party may move to compel further responses to requests for  admission under C.C.P. §2033.290 if it believes the responses to requests for  admission are deficient or that any objections to the requests are not well  taken.  (See C.C.P. §2033.290(a).)   Discussion           ABP’s motion to compel further  responses to its RFA 2 is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.290(a).  Plaintiff is ordered to provide  Code-compliant responses without objections within 15 days of this ruling.   Sanctions C.C.P.  §2033.290(d) provides, “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further  response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of  the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P.  §2033.290(d).) ABP’s  motion indicates it seeks $11,781.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff, including  time spent meeting and conferring and anticipated hours, which are not hours  reasonably incurred or compensable.  (See  Decl. of Abukasis ¶6.) The  Court calculates sanctions in the reduced amount of $4,950.00 as follows: (10  hours x $495.00/hour = $4,950.00.) Accordingly,  ABP is granted reduced sanctions in the amount of $4,950.00, against Plaintiff  and its counsel of record, payable within 15 days.   Conclusion ABP’s  motion to compel further responses to RFA 2 is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide  Code-compliant responses without objections within 15 days of this ruling. ABP’s  request for sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $4,950.00, against  Plaintiff and its counsel of record, payable within 15 days. Moving  Party to give notice.   3.      Motion  to Compel Further- FROG ABP’s  motion compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to its FROG is denied, as  it was served on March 7, 2024.    Sanctions In  light of the Court’s ruling on the motion, APB’s request for sanctions is  denied.   Conclusion APB’s  motion compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to its FROG is denied. APB’s request  for sanctions is denied. Moving  Party to give notice.   4.      Motion  for Sanctions Discussion C.C.P.  §2023.010 provides as follows: Misuses of the discovery  process include, but are not limited to, the following: (a)  Persisting, over objection and without  substantial justification, in an attempt to obtain information or materials  that are outside the scope of permissible discovery. (b)  Using a discovery method in a manner that  does not comply with its specified procedures. (c)  Employing a discovery method in a manner or  to an extent that causes unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression,  or undue burden and expense. (d)  Failing to respond or to submit to an  authorized method of discovery. (e)  Making, without substantial justification,  an unmeritorious objection to discovery. (f)   Making an evasive response to discovery. (g)  Disobeying a court order to provide  discovery. (h)  Making or opposing, unsuccessfully and  without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery. (i)    Failing to confer in person, by telephone,  or by letter with an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith  attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning discovery, if the section  governing a particular discovery motion requires the filing of a declaration  stating facts showing that an attempt at informal resolution has been made.   (C.C.P.  §2023.010.)           Here, there exists a case management  order (“CMO”), which Plaintiff has disobeyed in violation of C.C.P.  §2023.010(g).  Plaintiff has failed to  comply with the specified procedures set forth in the CMO in violation of C.C.P.  §2023.010(b).  Plaintiff has failed to  submit to, and respond in accordance with, the requirements of the CMO in  violation of C.C.P. §2023.010(d) and has made unmeritorious objections and  evasive responses in violation of C.C.P. §§2023.010(e)-(f).           Accordingly, monetary sanctions are  warranted pursuant to C.C.P. §§2023.010(b), (d), (g), (e)-(f).  In light of this Court granting monetary  sanctions, there is no reason to believe evidentiary sanctions are necessary,  as monetary sanctions should serve as a sufficient deterrent to avoid future  violations.           ABP requests monetary sanctions in the  amount of $7,662.50.  The Court finds  this amount to be excessive and calculates sanctions below:           ($645/hour x 4 hours = $2,580.00)           Accordingly, ABP’s request for  monetary sanctions is granted against Plaintiff and its counsel of record in  the reduced amount of $2,580.00, payable within 15 days.   ABP’s  request for evidentiary sanctions is denied.    Conclusion ABP’s  request for monetary sanctions is granted against Plaintiff and its counsel of  record in the reduced amount of $2,580.00, payable within 15 days.  ABP’s  request for evidentiary sanctions is denied. Moving  Party to give notice.   Dated:   March _____, 2024
