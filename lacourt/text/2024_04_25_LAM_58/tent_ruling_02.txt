[1]           Although
the first cause of action is labeled a single cause of action, this claim consists
of separate causes of action arising from separate discrimination liability
based on disability, race, and sex. The same is true for the second cause of
action for harassment. Thus, the demurrer will treat these claims as separate
claims. 


[2]           Plaintiff’s
citation to Cheu v. Red Sun, 2021 Cal. Super. LEXIS 53401 – Orange
County Superior Court decision – is improper and non-binding. 


[3]           Formerly
known as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (“DFEH”).
