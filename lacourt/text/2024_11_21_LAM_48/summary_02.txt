And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the unopposed motions to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Simon Cvijanovic and Marjan Fathi, filed by their attorney, Zhana Azizz, Esq. The motions were filed due to an impasse between the plaintiffs and counsel, which has created a breakdown in their relationship. The judge has determined that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The proposed orders do not include the plaintiffs' current or last known addresses and telephone numbers, and the date and time of the Final Status Conference. The judge has ordered the attorney to provide this information at the hearing or the motions will be denied. The motions are granted subject to the provision of this information, and are effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed orders on the parties.
