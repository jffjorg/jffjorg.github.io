[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO COMPEL
  DISCOVERY; GRANTING MOTIONS TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED; GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48

On
April 2, 2024, Plaintiff Trevor Phillips filed this action against Defendants Yeezy
LLC, Kayne West aka Ye, and Donda Academy Inc.
Now
pending before the Court are several discovery motions and a motion to relieve Defendants’
counsel.
MOTIONS TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
AND TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED
On
May 17, 2024, Plaintiff served Request for Production of Documents (Set One), Form
Interrogatories – Employment (Set One), and Requests for Admission Nos. 1-43 on
Defendants Yeezy LLC and Donda Academy Inc. 
Defendants never served responses.
On
October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and to deem the RFAs
admitted.  Each motion includes a request
for sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendants
filed no oppositions to these motions and did not serve timely responses.  It does not appear that Defendants served substantially
compliant responses prior to the hearing.
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.
Defendant
Yeezy LLC is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, to Request
for Production of Documents (Set One) and Form Interrogatories – Employment (Set
One) within 30 days.
Defendant
Donda Academy Inc. is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections,
to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and Form Interrogatories – Employment
(Set One) within 30 days.
The
Requests for Admission Nos. 1-43 are deemed admitted by both Defendants Yeezy LLC
and Donda Academy Inc.
The
requests for sanctions are GRANTED.
Defendant
Yeezy LLC is ordered to pay total sanctions of $3,000.00 to Plaintiff within 30
days.
Defendant
Donda Academy Inc. is ordered to pay total sanctions of $3,000.00 to Plaintiff within
30 days.
The
sanctions are imposed against Defendants only and not counsel because, as explained
in counsel’s motion to be relieved, Defendants’ counsel could not provide discovery
responses because Defendants refuse to speak with him.
MOTION
TO RELIEVE COUNSEL
Brian
Brumfield (counsel of record for Defendants Yeezy LLC, Kayne West aka Ye, and Donda
Academy Inc.) seeks to be relieved as counsel. 
Counsel’s declaration states that Defendants terminated the attorney-client
relationship on June 21, 2024, will not speak with counsel, and refuse to pay counsel.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been set, and there is no prejudice
to Defendants.
The
proposed order no longer contains the next upcoming hearing dates.  The Court will correct this information before
signing the order.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED, effective upon filing a proof of service
showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Yeezy LLC, Kayne
West aka Ye, Donda Academy Inc., and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Yeezy LLC and Donda Academy Inc. is scheduled for ______________
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
