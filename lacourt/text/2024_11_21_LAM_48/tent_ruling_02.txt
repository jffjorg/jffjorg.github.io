  CASE NO.: 21STCV25928
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 21, 2024



 
Zhana
Azizz, Esq. (FKA Zhana Aivazi), counsel of record for Plaintiffs Simon Cvijanovic
and Marjan Fathi, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that Plaintiffs and
counsel are at an impasse as to how to proceed on the matter and it has created
a breakdown between Plaintiffs and counsel.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until April 28, 2025, and there is
no prejudice to Plaintiffs.
The
proposed orders do not include Plaintiffs’ current or last known addresses and telephone
numbers.  Counsel must provide this information
at the hearing or the motions will be denied.
The
proposed orders also do not include the date and time of the Final Status Conference.  The Court will add this information before signing
the orders.
Subject
to the provision of Plaintiffs’ current or last known addresses and telephone numbers,
the unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof
of service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Simon
Cvijanovic, Marjan Fathi, and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
