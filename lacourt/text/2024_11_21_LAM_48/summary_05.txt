And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants several motions: motions to compel discovery, motions to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted, and a motion to relieve counsel. The plaintiff, Trevor Phillips, filed this action against defendants Yeezy LLC, Kayne West aka Ye, and Donda Academy Inc. on April 2, 2024.

The plaintiff served discovery requests on May 17, 2024, but the defendants failed to respond. The plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and to deem the RFAs admitted on October 22, 2024. The motions were granted, and the defendants were ordered to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The RFAs were deemed admitted by both defendants. The plaintiff was granted sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00.

The defendants' counsel, Brian Brumfield, sought to be relieved as counsel due to the termination of the attorney-client relationship on June 21, 2024. The court granted the motion, effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed order and this order on the defendants. However, the court noted that a corporation cannot represent itself in court and scheduled an order to show cause for the failure to retain new counsel for the defendants.

The court ordered the defendants to pay the sanctions within 30 days and scheduled an order to show cause for the failure to retain new counsel. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
