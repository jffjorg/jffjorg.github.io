```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion to strike the complaint. The defendant argued that her statements were protected under the anti-SLAPP statute because they were made in connection with a public issue, specifically the film industry. However, the judge found that the defendant's statements were not made in the context of an ongoing controversy, dispute, or discussion about the public issue, but rather were made in the context of a private business dispute with the plaintiffs. The judge also found that the defendant's transmission of the demand letter to the media was not protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. As a result, the anti-SLAPP motion is denied, and the plaintiffs may proceed with their claims.
