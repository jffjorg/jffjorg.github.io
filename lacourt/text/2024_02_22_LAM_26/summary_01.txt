Significant Statements:
- "The Court may take judicial notice of court records, (See Evid. Code, ยง 452(d))."
- "An attorney's testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records or billing statements, and there is no requirement that such records or statements be offered in evidence."
- "The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally 'begins with the "lodestar," i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . .'."
- "The fact that block billing occurred is itself not enough to warrant a reduction. However, as noted above, the instant action was slightly overstaffed with many hours claimed on interoffice communications that would have been unnecessary had only a few attorneys been working on the action."
- "The claimed time on the instant motion is excessive. Plaintiff's Counsel claims to have spent 16 hours drafting the instant motion at $525 per hour and claims an additional $5,500.00 in drafting a reply, appearing at the hearing, and opposing the motion to tax. This is clearly unreasonable."
