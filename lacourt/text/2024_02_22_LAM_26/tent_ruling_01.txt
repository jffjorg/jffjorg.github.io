[TENTATIVE] order RE:
PLAINTIFFS’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs
 



 
Procedural
Background
On July 16, 2020, Plaintiff Raul Gutierrez (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. (“Defendant”) arising out of
the lease of a 2018 KIA Optima.  
On February 3, 2021, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint against Defendant asserting six causes of action for (1) Violation of
Civil Code § 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(b); (3) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Express Written
Warranty – Civil Code §§ 1791.2(a), 1794; (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of
Merchantability; and (6) Fraud by Omission. 
On August 26, 2021, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the
third cause of action and struck the references to “class vehicles” and “class
vehicle drivers” without leave to amend. 
(Order 8/26/21.)  On April 27,
2023, Plaintiff dismissed the sixth cause of action.  
After a jury trial, on June 1, 2023, a verdict was entered in favor of
Plaintiff.  On September 12, 2023,
Judgment was entered pursuant to the jury verdict in favor of Plaintiff.
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for attorneys’
fees.  On February 7, 2024, Defendant
filed an opposition.  On February 14,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.

 
Evidentiary
Objections
            Defendant
and Plaintiff have submitted various evidentiary objections to the declarations
in support of and in opposition to the instant motion.  However, these objections are unnecessary
because the Court, when reviewing the evidence is presumed to ignore material
it knows is incompetent, irrelevant, or inadmissible.  (In re Marriage
of Davenport (2011) 194 Cal. App. 4th 1507, 1526.)  Courts are
presumed to know and apply the correct statutory and case law and to be able to
distinguish admissible from inadmissible evidence, relevant from irrelevant
facts, and to recognize those facts which properly may be considered in the
judicial decision-making process.  (People v. Coddington (2000) 23
Cal.4th 529, 644.)  Moreover, there is no
statutory basis for evidentiary objections in connection with the instant
motion.
 
Request

            In conjunction with the moving
papers, Plaintiff requests that the court take judicial notice of:

            As the Court may take judicial
notice of court records, (See Evid. Code, § 452(d)), Plaintiff’s unopposed
request for judicial notice is granted. 
However, the Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of
assertions within those court records. (See
Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust
Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)
 
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A), attorney fees
are allowable as costs when authorized by contract or statute and may be
awarded upon a noticed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (c)(5). 
In determining
what fees are reasonable, California courts apply the “lodestar” approach.
(See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310,
1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “[t]he
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided.” (Ibid.) 
Relevant factors include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
 
Discussion
Right to Recover
A prevailing
buyer in an action under the Song-Beverly Act “shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, §
1794(d).)  “[W]hen ‘prevailing party’ is
undefined by the statute, ‘a court may base its attorney fees decision on a pragmatic
definition of the extent to which each party has realized its litigation
objectives, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise. [Citations.] In
assessing litigation success, Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th
863, 877, ... instructs: ‘[C]ourts should respect substance rather than form,
and to this extent should be guided by “equitable considerations.”’”  (MacQuiddy v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2015)
233 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1048.)
            Here, Plaintiff prevailed on his
remaining claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  (Minute Order 6/1/23; Judgment 9/12/23.)  As the prevailing party, pursuant to Civil
Code section 1794, Plaintiff is plainly entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs.
 
Reasonableness of Attorneys’ Fees 
Plaintiff seeks
attorney fees and costs totaling $373,558.04, consisting of $232,715.00 in
attorneys’ fees, a 1.35 lodestar multiplier (i.e., $81,450.25), $53,892.79 in
costs and expenses, and an anticipated $5,500.00 in attorneys’ fees in
reviewing the opposition, drafting a reply, attending the hearing on this
motion, and opposing Defendant’s pending motion to tax costs.
The trial court
has broad authority to determine the amount of a reasonable fee. (PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The determination of
what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate . . . .’” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[T]he lodestar is the basic
fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the
court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award….”  (Ibid.) In setting the hourly rate for a fee award,
courts are entitled to consider the “fees customarily charged by that attorney
and others in the community for similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info.
Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per
hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus.
(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  
The party
seeking fees bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.
(CCP § 1033.5(c)(5).) In addition, the party seeking fees has the burden of
documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton
v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires
competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino
v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) 
An attorney's testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient
evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed
time records or billing statements, and there is no requirement that such
records or statements be offered in evidence. (Steiny & Co., Inc. v.
California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) 
The court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)

67.) Rangel billed at an hourly rate of $285 per hour in 2022 and spent a total

(Shahim Decl. ¶ 68, Exh. 17.)
            Based
on the stated experience of each respective attorney, prevailing rates of
similar experienced attorneys, and the Court’s own experience, the Court finds
the hourly rates are reasonable. 
However, the number of attorneys working on the instant action –
fourteen attorneys and two law clerks – is clearly excessive. “Plainly, it is
appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable
determination that a routine, non-complex case was overstaffed to a degree that
significant inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.”  (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019)
41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)  Here, the
instant action did not involve any complicated issues.  Rather, the instant action was simple and
routine.
            Moreover,
as noted by Defendant in opposition, Plaintiff’s Counsel engaged in block
billing.  “Block billing occurs when ‘a
block of time [is assigned] to multiple tasks rather than itemizing the time
spent on each task.’ [Citation.]”  (Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 279.)  The instant billing record is ripe with block
billing.  Nearly every entry includes
multiple tasks claimed.  (See e.g., Shahim Decl.,
Exh. 17, [“Phone call with OPC re Ex Parte hearing; phone call with client re ----;
prepare for and attend continued Ex Parte hearing; wait 08:30AM until 11:30AM -
Court told us to return at 1:30PM; wait 1:30PM until 2:40PM for case to be
called; draft hearing outcome memo”].) 
When block billing occurs, the “[t]rial courts retain discretion to
penalize block billing when the practice prevents them from discerning which
tasks are compensable and which are not.” 
(Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 972, 1010.)  Accordingly, the
fact that block billing occurred is itself not enough to warrant a
reduction.  However, as noted above, the
instant action was slightly overstaffed with many hours claimed on interoffice
communications that would have been unnecessary had only a few attorneys been
working on the action.  Further, there
are many administrative tasks that are included in the block billing, such as
sending notes to the client file.  Thus,
some reduction in time is warranted due to the block billing as the block
billing prevents the time from being properly divided from unnecessary and
unreasonable time spent in interoffice communications due to overstaffing and
reasonable time spent working on the instant action.
Further, in
light of Plaintiff’s Counsel’s firm’s expertise in lemon law matters and in
light of the availability of templates from other lemon law actions that Plaintiff’s
Counsel’s firm has handled in the past, propounding discovery is a routine
matter that should have required only a fraction of the hours that Plaintiff’s
Counsel billed and should not have required numerous hours by partners and
senior attorneys at the highest hourly rate to complete.  (See Shahian Decl., Exh. 17.)  For
example, Plaintiff’s counsel claims 15.5 hours merely reviewing NHTSA documents
that are applicable to the same make and model as Plaintiff’s vehicles and --
in light of Plaintiff’s Counsel claimed experience -- would be well known to Plaintiff’s
Counsel.  (See Shahian Decl., Exh. 17.) 
Moreover, an experienced attorney billed this time at a high hourly rate
of $495 per hour.  
Finally, the
claimed time on the instant motion is excessive.  Plaintiff’s Counsel claims to have spent 16
hours drafting the instant motion at $525 per hour and claims an additional $5,500.00
in drafting a reply, appearing at the hearing, and opposing the motion to tax.  (Motion at p.15:24-26.)  This is clearly unreasonable.  The instant motion is a template of near
identical motions brought by this counsel before this department.  The motion attaches dozens of extraneous
exhibits of questionable relevance which likely required some time to
gather.  Further, given the expertise of Plaintiff’s
Counsel, such a number of hours devoted to a simple and straightforward motion
is excessive.  However, the instant
action involved years of litigation, multiple demurrers, a summary adjudication
motion, and a seven-day trial.  Considering
all of these factors a slight reduction is warranted.
Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of
the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and
reasonable amount of attorney’s fees incurred is $214,032.00.
 
Lodestar Enhancement
Plaintiff requests a lodestar enhancement multiplier of 1.35 in light
of the contingent risk, the substantial delay in payment, preclusion of other
work, the skill displayed in presenting the issues, and the outcome
achieved.  
On the issue of whether to apply a multiplier, the California Supreme
Court has given clear guidance for the trial courts to follow.
Of course, the trial court is not required to
include a fee enhancement to the basic lodestar figure for contingent risk,
exceptional skill, or other factors, although it retains discretion to do so in
the appropriate case; moreover, the party seeking a fee enhancement bears the
burden of proof. In each case, the trial court should consider whether, and to
what extent, the attorney and client have been able to mitigate the risk of
nonpayment, e.g., because the client has agreed to pay some portion of the
lodestar amount regardless of outcome. It should also consider the degree to
which the relevant market compensates for contingency risk, extraordinary
skill, or other factors under Serrano III. We emphasize that when
determining the appropriate enhancement, a trial court should not consider
these factors to the extent they are already encompassed within the lodestar.
The factor of extraordinary skill, in particular, appears susceptible to improper
double counting; for the most part, the difficulty of a legal question and the
quality of representation are already encompassed in the lodestar. A more
difficult legal question typically requires more attorney hours, and a more
skillful and experienced attorney will command a higher hourly rate.
(Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at pp.1138–1139.)
Here, many of these factors Plaintiff raises have already been
addressed in the calculations of the hours worked and hourly rate above.  Therefore, the court finds that an
enhancement multiplier is not appropriate for this case.
 
Costs
            As to costs, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs which
Defendant has challenged in part through a motion to tax.  Accordingly, as there is a pending motion to
tax costs, the Court declines to address the claimed cost in the instant
motion.
 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Raul
Gutierrez’s motion for attorneys’ fees is GRANTED in the total amount of
$214,032.00.
Moving Party is to give notice and file
proof of service of such.
