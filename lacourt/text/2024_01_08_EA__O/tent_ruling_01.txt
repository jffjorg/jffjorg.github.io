Background[2]
 
This case
arises from an unpaid debt.

I.               
Motion
to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party to a
suit may challenge the court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him or
her by filing a motion to quash service of summons. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10,
subd. (a).) “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been
proper service of process.” (See Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
 
Discussion

 
Defendant
argues that he was not served via substituted service on his wife because (i)
the general description describes most middle-aged females of Asian descent and
(ii) his wife was absent from the country on the day of service on May 8, 2008.
(Motion p. 4.)
 
As a registered
process server effectuated service, the return of a registered process
server establishes a rebuttable presumption of the facts stated in the return.
(Opp. p. 4, citing Evid. Code § 647.) Effectively, Defendant has the burden to
prove otherwise. 
 
The court finds Defendant did not meet his burden
for the following four (4) reasons.
 
First, the wife’ declaration does not
provide her height, weight, or hair color but merely focuses on one differing
factor: age. She states in 2008 she was 33 years old despite the POS
description that someone 40-45 years of age was served. But age is not a
feature that is patently ascertainable with accuracy. 
 
Second, by Defendant’s own admission,
the description of his wife was somewhat accurate. (See Motion p.
4:14-15 [“The proof of service describes a woman similar [], but not terribly
accurate in the description of the individual.”], italics added.) There is
no requirement that the description on a POS be precise and exact. 
 
Third, Defendant and his wife do not conclusively
state that Tina was in Taiwan. Rather, they state that she is “often
absent from the country.” (Motion p. 4, italics added; see also Mei Ting Lee
Decl., P5 [“I would have been absent from the country.”], italics
added.) Absent a plane ticket indicating that on May 3, 2008 she was in
Taiwan/out of the country, Defendant has not produced evidence. 
 
All in all, though mindful of the
public policy strongly favors granting relief,
the irrefutable evidence and case docket, when read in their totality, draw
into question the credibility and veracity of Defendant’s declaration and his
wife’s declaration that POS was improper. (See Hodge Sheet Metal
Products v. Palm Springs Riviera Hotel (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 653, 658 [“The
weighing of the veracity of the affidavit was in the province of the trial
court.”].)
 
Therefore, as
Defendant has not produced evidence to refute the presumption of proper service,
his challenge to the court’s jurisdiction is unmeritorious. 
 
Waiver of
Jurisdiction 
 
Fourth, even if the foregoing was not true
(i.e., service was improper), the motion would be denied on another ground:
waiver. (Opp. p. 5.) 
 
A general
appearance occurs when a party, either directly or through counsel,
participates in an action in some manner that recognizes the court's authority
to proceed. It does not require any formal or technical act. (Opp. p. 5, citing
Mansour v. Superior Court (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1750, 1756.) “A general
appearance by a party is equivalent to personal service of summons on such
party.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 410.50 (a).)
 
Here, as
explained by Plaintiff’s opposition, Defendant has appeared and submitted to
debtor’s examination(s). Indeed, a review of August 8, 2022 transcript provides
that debtor Defendant was stipulating to provide certain documents. (See
Opp. to Protective Order, Ex. J, p. 58 of 75 of PDF:15-17.) Accordingly,
Defendant did not appear at the hearing or other hearings for the sole
purpose of making a special appearance (i.e., to object to the court's jurisdiction). (See  Serrano v Stefan Merli Plastering Co., Inc., supra, 162
CA4th at 1029 [If a defendant raises any issue other than
jurisdiction or asks for any relief that can only be granted on the assumption
that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant, then the defendant's
appearance in general]; see also  Alioto
Fish co. v. Alioto (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1669 [for discussion on general
appearance with respect to a fee order and a receive order].) 
 
Conclusion
 
By indicating an intent to submit to the court's
jurisdiction, Defendant made a general appearance, consequently waiving any objection to defects in service. Based on the foregoing, the motion to
quash is DENIED. 
 
II.             
Protective
Order 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Cal. Code of
Civ. Pro. 708.200 provides “in any proceeding under this article, the court
may, on motion of the person to be examined or on its own motion, make such
protective orders as justice may require.
 
Discussion
 
There are two
items subject to this motion. 
 
The first is
regarding “All accounting, source documentation and work papers concerning real
property known as 3723 Mustang Drive, Ontario, CA 91761.” 
 
The second is
regarding the tax returns.[4]

 
i.                
The Real Property 
 
According to
Defendant and his wife, that real property was acquired in interest in real
property via her inheritance (an inter-familial transfer from Tina’s mother to
Tina). The real property was not purchased via community property, paid for via
community property, nor is encumbered by community property debt. (Motion pp.
4-5.) Thus, as the real property is not community real property, it is not
subject for examination to satisfy Defendant’s debt. 
 
The court finds that the evidence and Defendant’s own
statements show otherwise. 
 
First, despite Defendant’s contention that
“Plaintiff will simply have no evidence to present to this Court to support its
claim that this is community real property” (Motion p. 5:4-5), Plaintiff
does provide evidence, and a compelling one: Defendant himself,
under the penalty of perjury, stated that the real property is his.
 
Indeed,
turning to Plaintiff’s evidence, in Defendant’s second bankruptcy action (USBC
Case No. 6:23-bk-11808-RR) filed on April 28, 2023 he identified in his
Voluntary Petition for Bankruptcy that he owned the real property and claimed
it as an asset. (Opp. p. 5, see also Opp., Ex. I, p. 47 of 75 of PDF.) What is
more, that very same page indicates that only Defendant has interest in
the real property. Specifically, the form states that even though the property
is “Debtor's spouse separate property that was inherited from her family in
September 12, 2019,” that the Debtor claims 40% interest as community property
as debtor made payments for the mortgages from 2019 to 2023.
 
To the extent
Defendant attempts to rebut the evidence, it is disingenuous as he merely states
his bankruptcy counsel filled out the form.[5]

 
To the extent
that Defendant avers that the loan referenced is a home equity line of credit
(HELOC) such that Defendant did not acquire an interest in the property,
that argument misses the mark because the HELOC—which effectively is a second
mortgage as they are liens behind a first mortgage—encumbered the property.
(Reply pp. 3-4, citing to In re Marriage of Marsden (1982) 130
Cal.App.3d 426.) 
 
That said, as the issue of the HELOC was raised in
Reply, the court may allow for supplemental briefing on the issue (i.e.,
whether encumbrance on the real property transfers an interest to Defendant).
The determination of whether Defendant has any interest in the real property is
of import because, as noted by Defendant, CCP section 720.150 precludes the
sale of the real property of a third party (here, Tina). 
 
 
 
 
 
ii.              
Tax Returns[6]
 
At the outset, it is somewhat unclear as to Defendant’s argument with
respect to the tax returns. 
 
On the one hand, Defendant avers that his tax returns are
privileged (Motion p. 4:6-7), suggesting they are not subject to the ORAP.
Defendant also avers that Plaintiff is not entitled to Tina/third-party’s tax
returns (Motion p. 5:14-15). On the other hand, Defendant contends that he does
not dispute the right to examine third parties, but merely the relevance
of the intended examination. (Reply p. 5:12-14.) 
 
Here, all
arguments are moot as on August 8, 2022, this court already ordered Defendant
to produce the certain tax returns and tax information sought from the
third-party accountants.

 
Even if this
court previously did not make such a ruling, it would now as Defendant’s tax
returns and tax work papers maintained by his accountants are property of the
debtor and thus discoverable under CCP sections 708.120, which entitles a
judgment creditor to examine a third person who has “possession or control of
property in which the judgment debtor has an interest.” The privilege for
income tax returns is not absolute. Of pertinence, the privilege will not be upheld when “public policy greater than that of the confidentiality
of tax returns is involved.” (Opp. citing Li v. Yan (2016) 247
CA4th 56, 67.) Specifically, the policy being to
prevent fraud against creditors. (Id. at p. 68.) And here, Plaintiff has
attempted to collect upon its judgment for 15 years. 
 
Conclusion
 
All in all,
the docket demonstrates a calculated attempt to
obstruct enforcement of valid orders. If the court were to grant any of the
motions, they will have, in effect, undermine the policy of the law
favors the enforcement of judgments. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion for a protective order is DENIED.
