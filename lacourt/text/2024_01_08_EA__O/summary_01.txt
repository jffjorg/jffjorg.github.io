Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the defendant, Scott Lee, and his wife, Mei Ting Lee (Tina). The motions filed were a motion to quash service of summons and a motion for a protective order.

The judge denied the motion to quash service of summons, finding that the defendant did not meet his burden to prove that the service of summons was improper. The judge also found that the defendant waived any objections to personal jurisdiction by appearing at the ORAP.

The judge also denied the motion for a protective order, finding that the discovery sought by the plaintiff was relevant to the proceedings and that the defendant did not have a valid basis for seeking a protective order.

The judge imposed monetary sanctions of $1,050 on the defendant for his failure to comply with the court's orders.

The judge also found that the defendant's attempts to obstruct the enforcement of the judgment were calculated and that the court would not grant any relief that would undermine the policy of the law favoring the enforcement of judgments.
