And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the matter. The court finds that the defendant has no substantial justification for filing a motion for a protective order and therefore grants the plaintiff's request for a monetary sanction in the amount of $1,225. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain documents.

The court notes that the defendant has waived personal jurisdiction and has failed to provide tax information as ordered. The court finds that the defendant's bankruptcy counsel likely included the residence in the bankruptcy schedule as a good faith extension of the law, but this does not excuse the defendant's failure to provide tax information.

The court also rules that the subpoenas do not seek the tax returns of Tina, but rather seek tax information related to the defendant's assets. The court notes that a judgment creditor may seek third-party discovery in aid of enforcement of a judgment, regardless of whether the judgment debtor's assets are in the possession of the third party or the third party is indebted to the judgment debtor.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions and judicial notice, and denies the defendant's motion for a protective order.
