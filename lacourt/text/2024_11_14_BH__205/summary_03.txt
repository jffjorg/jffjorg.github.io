And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' special motion to strike the plaintiff's claims. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claims arise from their petitioning activities and that the plaintiff has not shown that his claims have merit because they are barred by the litigation privilege and also by collateral estoppel and res judicata.

The judge denied the defendants' special motion to strike, finding that the motion was untimely because it could have been brought against the original complaint, which contained virtually identical allegations as the amended complaint. The judge also found that the defendants' argument that their motion was timely because it was filed within 60 days of the amended complaint was incorrect, and that the defendants' failure to address the point that their motion could have been brought against the original complaint was a failure to address a critical issue.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the request was not made in a separate motion and that the plaintiff failed to provide the defendants with a 21-day safe harbor period.
