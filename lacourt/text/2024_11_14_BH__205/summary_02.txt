And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Mostafa Baboli for relief from mistake and request for leave to file a cross-complaint. The motion is denied. The case involves a dispute over trade secrets and alleged misappropriation of Plaintiff Network Experts' computer sales, consulting, and IT services. Baboli, who was employed by Plaintiff, formed his own IT services company and allegedly poached Plaintiff's clients. The Plaintiff claims that Baboli misappropriated its trade secrets and borrowed $9,540, which he failed to repay. The Judge notes that Baboli's motion is untimely and fails to meet the requirements of California Civil Procedure Code section 1008. Even if the motion were timely, the Judge concludes that Baboli has not set forth any new law or facts that would justify a reconsideration of the Court's prior ruling. The Judge also denies Baboli's request for relief from mistake, finding that Baboli's counsel's mistake was not excusable and that Baboli engaged in bad faith and forum shopping.
