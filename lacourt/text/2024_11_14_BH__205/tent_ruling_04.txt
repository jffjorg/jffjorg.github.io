 Case Number:  24SMCV01821    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   REGAL MOTORS, LLC,    Plaintiff, v.  JERRY WILTSIE, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCV01821     Hearing Date:  November 14, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO    TAX COSTS         BACKGROUND This action involves a dispute over a car.  Plaintiff Regal Motors, LLC owns a 2013 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophe (the “Car”).  (Compl. ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff claims it gave Defendant Jerry Witsie “conditional permission” to possess the Car.  (Id.)  And when Plaintiff demanded the return of the Car, Defendant refused.  (Id. ¶6.)  Defendant maintains the Car was a gift.   This action ensued.  The operative complaint alleges two claims for (1) claim and delivery, and (2) conversion.   Defendant specially appeared and filed a motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction or alternatively to stay action for forum non conveniens.  This Court granted Defendant’s motion and entered judgment in favor of Defendant.  Defendant filed a memorandum of costs seeking filing and motion fees of $435 and electronic filing or service fees of $108.37. This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs.  Plaintiff argues that the filing and motion fees Defendant seeks are vague, ambiguous and not supported by any documentation or otherwise itemized to show that they are legitimate and related to the litigation, and therefore they should be taxed down to zero.  Plaintiff also argues that the electronic filing and service fees lack itemization and documentary proof, and Defendant incurred these costs “unnecessarily as he could have used a more reasonably priced filing service.”  Therefore, Plaintiff claims these costs should also be reduced to zero.   LEGAL STANDARD Generally, a “prevailing party” is entitled to costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.).  “A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of mailing of the¿notice of entry of judgment… The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.) The losing party may contest the costs that a prevailing party seeks.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1034(a).)  The challenging party has the burden of demonstrating that those costs are unreasonable or unnecessary. (Adams v. Ford Motor Co.,¿(2011) 199 Cal. App. 4th 1475, 1486; 612¿South LLC v. Laconic Limited Partnership, (2010) 184 Cal. App. 4th 1270, 1285.)  Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5 sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5.)  “Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §1033.5(c)(2); Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)  A “properly verified memorandum of costs is considered prima facie evidence that the costs listed in the memorandum were necessarily incurred.”  (Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308; see also Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)   This puts the burden on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  If items are properly objected to, they are put in issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) The memorandum of costs need not contain invoices, billings, or statements.  (Bach, 215 Cal.App.3d at 308; see also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(a)(1) (only verification required).) “Documentation must be submitted only when a party dissatisfied with the costs claimed in the memorandum challenges them by filing a motion to tax costs.”  (Bach, 215 Cal.App.3d at 308.)     DISCUSSION Defendant timely filed a verified Summary and a Worksheet setting forth Defendant’s claimed costs which is prima facie evidence that those costs were reasonable and necessary to the conduct of this litigation. Therefore, it is Plaintiff’s burden to show that those costs are not properly chargeable or are unreasonable. Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden.  Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(1) includes filing fees as an allowable cost.  Pursuant to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Civil Fee Schedule, the fee for each party to file an “Answer or Other First Paper” is $435.00. (Gov. Code, §§ 70611, 70602.5, and 70602.6.)  In this case, Defendant filed a Motion to Quash for Lack of Jurisdiction in response to the Complaint and paid the required $435.00 filing fee for the Motion.  (Ex. A to Gregor Decl.)  Therefore, the $435.00 filing fee requested by Defendant is authorized by statute and was reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and should be awarded to Defendant.  Plaintiff argues at page 3, line 17 of its Motion to Tax Costs that Defendant’s filing fee is “deemed waived.” However, Plaintiff provides no facts or authority to support its position that the filing fee is waived. In fact, that fee was not waived.  Defendant paid it.  Thus, Defendant is entitled to recover the filing fee.   Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(14) includes fees for electronic filing or service through an electronic service provider as an allowable cost if the Court requires electronic filing or service. The First Amended General Order of the Los Angeles Superior Court dated May 3, 2019, states at section 2(b) that “Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2.253(b), represented litigants are required to electronically file documents with the Court through an approved EFSP.” As Defendant was represented by counsel, all documents filed this action were required to be e-filed through an approved provider, which includes OneLegal, thus making the fees requested by Defendant recoverable.  Item 14 on page 4 of the Worksheet, sets forth in detail the date, the document filed and served, and the cost charged by OneLegal for the filing.  (Ex. B to Gregor Decl.)  As e-filing through an approved EFSP is required by the Court as set forth above, the charges incurred are authorized by statute and were reasonably necessary to the litigation.  Defendant attests the fees charged by OneLegal are consistent with other electronic service providers in California. Therefore, this cost item should also be awarded to Defendant, as the prevailing party. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs.     IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: November 14, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
