And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by REGAL MOTORS, LLC (Plaintiff) to tax the costs claimed by JERRY WILTSIE, et al. (Defendant) for filing and motion fees, and electronic filing or service fees. The judge finds that Defendant's verified summary and worksheet setting forth the claimed costs are prima facie evidence that those costs were reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. Therefore, it is Plaintiff's burden to show that those costs are not properly chargeable or are unreasonable.

The judge rules that the $435 filing fee paid by Defendant is authorized by statute and was reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The judge also finds that the electronic filing or service fees charged by OneLegal are authorized by statute and were reasonably necessary to the litigation.

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion to tax costs and awards Defendant the claimed costs.
