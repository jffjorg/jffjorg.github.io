Curiously, Defendant’s motion did not include statute of limitations as an
argument for why the fourth cause of action has no merit.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  Although Defendant successfully defeated
Plaintiffs’ motion by raising a triable issue about when the statute of limitations
began to run (and thus whether its defense might have merit), the start of the
limitations period may not actually be a triable issue if presented in a different
procedural posture.  Indeed Defendant
might have been entitled to summary adjudication of the claim on the settlement
agreement based on the statute of limitations defense had it brought such a
motion.  Instead, Defendant moved for
summary adjudication of this cause of action only on the grounds that “any such
agreement was void, unenforceable, and rescinded by Federal due to Plaintiffs’
fraud.”  (See Defendant Notice of
Motion.)  “Only the grounds specified in
the notice of motion may be considered by the trial court.  [Citation.] 
This rule has been held to be especially true in the case of motions for
summary adjudication of issues.”  (Gonzales
v. Superior Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1545.)
