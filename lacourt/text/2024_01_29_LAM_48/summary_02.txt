And here is the English text summary:

The Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action did not include a statute of limitations defense, despite raising a triable issue about when the statute of limitations began to run. The Judge notes that if the Defendant had brought a motion for summary adjudication based on the statute of limitations defense, it may have been entitled to summary adjudication of the claim. Instead, the Defendant's motion was limited to arguing that the settlement agreement was void, unenforceable, and rescinded due to the Plaintiff's fraud. The Judge rules that only the grounds specified in the notice of motion may be considered by the trial court, and that this rule is especially true in the case of motions for summary adjudication of issues.
