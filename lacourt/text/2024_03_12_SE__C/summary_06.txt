And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a lemon law action brought by Juana Rodriguez Mendoza and Jose Alba Rodriguez against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant did not disclose and actively concealed defects in their 2023 Honda HR-V, and that this constitutes a violation of the Song-Beverly Act and fraudulent inducement. The Defendant demurred to the second cause of action, alleging that the economic loss rule bars the claim. The Court has ruled that this is not the case, citing precedent from Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828. The Court has also denied the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the Complaint sufficiently pleads malicious conduct by concealment. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days, and the Plaintiffs are granted notice.
