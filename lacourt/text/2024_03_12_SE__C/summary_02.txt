And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this wrongful death action case. The defendant, Southern California Permanente Medical Group, argued that it was not negligent in its medical care and treatment of the decedent, Jesse L. Thompson, and that there was no triable issue of material fact. However, the plaintiff, Eunice Thompson, submitted expert testimony from Dr. Randy Feldman that the care provided by the defendant was below the standard of care, and that the decedent's death was caused or contributed to by the defendant's negligence. The judge found that this contrary expert testimony raised a triable issue of material fact, and therefore denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
