Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a demurrer to a Second Cause of Action for Fraudulent Inducement, alleging that American Honda Motor Co., Inc. concealed defects in a 2019 Honda Odyssey and induced Lorena Quiroz to purchase the vehicle. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the economic loss rule does not bar the claim. The judge has also denied a motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the First Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads malicious conduct by concealment. The judge's ruling is based on persuasive authority, including a recent Court of Appeal decision, Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022), and California Civil Code provisions. The case will proceed to the next stage, with a new deadline for the defendant to file and serve an answer.
