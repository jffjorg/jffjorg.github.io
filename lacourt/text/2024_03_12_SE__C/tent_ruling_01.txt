Background 
On June 9, 2022, Plaintiff National Group Construction
& Management, Inc. filed a Complaint against Defendants Iglesia De Cristo
Ministerios Llamada Final, Inc. ("Iglesia"), Ariel Mayorga, Humberto
Espinola, Edwin Lopez, and Does 1-50 stating causes of action for breach of
fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, fraudulent
concealment, aiding and abetting fraud and fraudulent concealment, negligent
misrepresentation, aiding and abetting negligent misrepresentation, negligence,
civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, unfair competition in violation of Bus.
& Prof. Code sec. 17200, violation of the Trade Secret Act (Civ. Code sec.
3426 et seq.), and declaratory relief.
Legal Standard 
Where there has been no timely response to requests for
admissions, a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
section 2023.010).”  The court “shall”
grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
Discussion 
Defendant moves to deem its
Request for Admissions, Set One, admitted as to Plaintiff.
Defendant is entitled to an
order deeming its Request for Admissions admitted. Defendant supports its
claims with a declaration from Counsel. On June 26, 2023,
Defendant served Requests for Admissions, Set No. 1 (the “RFA”), on Plaintiff.
Responses to the RFA were due 30 days later plus five days for postal service.
At the August 18, 2023 case management conference, Plaintiff’s counsel represented
Plaintiff would respond to the discovery requests. (Friedman Decl., ¶ 3,
Buchanan Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Plaintiff failed to respond by the deadline and did not
provide subsequent responses. (Buchanan Decl., ¶ 7.)
Because
Plaintiff has not sent verified responses to Defendant’s Request for
Admissions, Defendant’s motion is granted. The genuineness of any documents and
the truth of any matters specified in Defendant’s motion is
admitted.   
 
Sanctions

Sanctions
with respect to motions to deem requests for admissions admitted are mandatory
if a party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed failed to
serve a timely response to the request for admission. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2033.280(c).) Here, sanctions are mandatory because Plaintiff failed to serve
timely responses to Defendant’s RFAs.  
Defendant
seeks $7,117.65 in sanctions for Mr. Friedman spending 7.3 hours researching
and preparing this motion and 3.5 hours reviewing any discovery responses prior
to the hearing date, reviewing the opposition, drafting the reply, and
appearing at the hearing at $360.00 and Mr. Buchanan’s 4.5 hours reviewing and
filing materials and 1.9 hours reviewing the discovery responses that Plaintiff
serves after service, reviewing any opposition and reply at $495.00. 
Using
the lodestar method, the Court finds that due to simplicity of the motion, lack
of opposition and thus no need for reply, and that Defendant would be
responsible for reviewing the discovery responses regardless of result of this
motion that reduced sanctions are warranted. Therefore, the Court awards
reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,395.00 (2 hours for Mr. Friedman
preparing the instant motion and .5 hours appearing at the hearing at $360.00
and Mr. Buchanan’s reviewing the motion for 1 hour at $495.00.) Plus, the
$60.00 in filing fees.
