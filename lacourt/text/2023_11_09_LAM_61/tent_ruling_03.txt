The Discovery House, LLC’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED.
 
Defendants to provide notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL ARBITRATION
On petition of a
party to an arbitration agreement to arbitrate a controversy, a court must
order the petitioner and respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it
determines the arbitration agreement exists, unless (1) the petitioner has
waived its right to arbitrate; (2) grounds exist for the revocation of the
agreement; or (3) “[a] party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a
pending court action or special proceeding with a third party, arising out of
the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a
possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) 
 
“[T]he party moving
to compel arbitration bears the burden of establishing the existence of a valid
agreement to arbitrate, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of
proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.
The role of the trial court is to sit as a trier of fact, weighing any
affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, together with oral
testimony received at the court's discretion, to reach a determination on the
issue of arbitrability.” (Hotels Nevada
v. L.A. Pacific Center, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758.)
 
Defendant The
Discovery House LLC (Defendant) presents an arbitration agreement executed by
Plaintiff William Jenkins. (Peirano Decl. Exh. A.) The agreement contains a
class action waiver and applies to “any dispute regarding employee’s
employment.” (Ibid.) Plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition.
 
There being an
arbitration agreement applicable to the present controversy, the motion is
therefore GRANTED.
