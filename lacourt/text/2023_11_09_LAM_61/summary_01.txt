And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Gergis Ghobrial, has moved to compel deposition answers and document production from the defendant, Lydia Iwasaki. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's counsel instructed the deponent not to answer certain questions, which is improper, and that no documents were produced. The court finds that the deponent's responses were proper, as the questions asked for privileged information. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown that documents are being withheld. Therefore, the motion is denied.
