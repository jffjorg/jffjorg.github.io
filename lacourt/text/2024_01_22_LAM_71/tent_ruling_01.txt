Petitioner
Cynthia Randall, Trustee of the Joyce Cecile Victorian 2005 Trust’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted
in the total amount of $28,962.37.
 
Petitioner Cynthia Randall, Trustee of
the Joyce Cecile Victorian 2005 Trust (“Randall”) (“Petitioner”) moves for an
order awarding her attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $28,962.37
against Respondent
Sheldon McKinzie (“McKinzie”) (“Respondent”) as the prevailing party on her
Petition to Cancel Mechanics’ Lien.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; CRC,
Rule 3.1702; Civ. Code §8488(c); C.C.P. §§1032, 1033.5.)  Petitioner seeks to recover $28,221.25 in
attorneys’ fees and expenses and $741.12 in costs.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Evidentiary Objections
Petitioner’s 1/12/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Jason J. Sancen (“Sancen”) is sustained as to
Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
 
Background
Petitioner is the owner of
real property located at 2619 South Mansfield Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90016
(“Property”).  (Petition ¶5.)  On November 1, 2022, Respondent recorded a
claim of Mechanics’ Lien against the Property. (Petition ¶6, Exh. 1.)  Respondent’s Mechanics’ Lien demanded the sum
of $40,000 and stated that the work furnished by Respondent at the Property was
“Project Consultant / Manager.”  (Petition
¶6, Exh. 1.)  
On February 21, 2023,
Petitioner gave Respondent notice under Civil Code §8482 demanding that
Respondent execute and record a release of the Mechanics’ Lien.  (Petition ¶10, Exh. 2.)  Respondent failed to execute a release of the
Mechanics’ Lien.  (Petition ¶11.)  On April 19, 2023, Petitioner filed a
verified Petition to Cancel Mechanics’ Lien seeking an order that the Property
be released from the Mechanics’ Lien recorded by Respondent under Civil Code §8480.

On July 3, 2023, this Court
heard Petitioner’s unopposed Petition to Cancel Mechanics’ Lien and granted
Petitioner’s request for an order to release Respondent’s Mechanics’ Lien on
the Property.  On July 26, 2023, this
Court issued its signed order on the Petition to release the Mechanics’ Lien on
the Property, stating that “Petitioner is the prevailing party on the Petition
entitled to [an] award of Petitioner’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs
against Respondent.”  (7/26/23 Ruling at
¶7.)  On July 26, 2023, Petitioner also
filed her memorandum of costs.
On
September 7, 2023, Petitioner filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Respondent filed his opposition on January 3,
2024.  Petitioner filed her reply on January
12, 2024.
 
Discussion
C.C.P. §1032 provides, in part, that
“except as otherwise provided by statue, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”  (C.C.P. §1032(b); see also Santisas v.
Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.App.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. of California v.
Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.App.4th 1103, 1108.)  The litigation costs that the prevailing party
may recover includes attorneys’ fees when recovery of such fees is authorized
by contract, law, or statute.  (C.C.P.
§1033.5(a)(10).)
An award of attorneys’ fees on a
petition to cancel a mechanics’ lien if the claimant has not commenced a
lawsuit to foreclose said lien within the time required in Civil Code §8460 is
governed by Civil Code §8488(c), which provides that “[t]he prevailing party is
entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees.”
Here, this Court granted Petitioner’s
request for an order to release Respondent’s Mechanics’ Lien on the Property.  Petitioner is the undisputed prevailing party
as she has successfully obtained an order to release the Mechanics’ Lien.  Further, this Court’s July 26, 2023, order
states that “Petitioner is the prevailing party on the Petition entitled to
[an] award of Petitioner’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs against
Respondent.”
Therefore, Petitioner is the prevailing
party in this action and is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Petitioner’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates for attorneys who worked on this
case: (1) Kirk Pearson ($600.00/hour); (2) Shelby Daws ($335.00/hour); (3) Timothy
Mahar Jr. ($475.00/hour); (4) Taylor Hubbard ($395/hour); and (5) Ryan Davies
($535/hour).  (Decl. of Daws ¶14.)  Petitioner has sufficiently demonstrated her
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Daws
¶¶14-20.)
Respondent does
not challenge Petitioner’s counsel’s hourly rates as unreasonable, and the
Court finds Petitioner’s counsel’s rates to be reasonable and do not warrant a
reduction.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Petitioner’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Petitioner’s
fee recovery is based on 59.9 hours Petitioner’s counsel spent to release the
Mechanic’s Lien from the property, and an additional 4.6 hours preparing the
instant motion and supporting declaration, anticipated fees for reviewing
Respondent’s opposition, preparing a reply, and attending the hearing on the
matter.  (Motion, pg. 9; Decl. of Daws ¶¶11,
13.)  The fees incurred are reasonable,
as captured in the billing records submitted to this Court.  (Decl. of Daws ¶8, Exhs. 5-14.)  Petitioner’s counsel’s billing records
reflect the actual time and clear descriptions of services performed in
connection with litigating this case.  (Decl.
of Daws ¶8, Exhs. 5-14.)   Although the submission of such detailed time
records is not necessary under California law, if submitted, such records “are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”  (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
Respondent
argues Petitioner failed to properly support her request for attorneys’ fees
with documents evidencing the need for charging excessive fees given the lack
of complexity in this case.  (Opposition,
pg. 7.)  Respondent fails to object to
Petitioner’s billed fees with specificity to challenge the fees as unrelated,
unreasonable, duplicative, or excessive. 
General arguments that time spent is excessive is an insufficient
challenge on a fee motion.  (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 562.)
Accordingly,
Petitioner’s billed hours were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation and were reasonable in amount.
 
Costs
CRC,
Rule 3.1700(b)(1) provides “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must
be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically,
the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6(a)(4).”  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)
“After
the time has passed for a motion to strike or tax costs or for determination of
that motion, the clerk must immediately enter the costs on the judgment.”  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(4).)
Petitioner
filed a memorandum of costs on July 26, 2023. 
Pursuant to CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(4), the time to file a motion to strike
or tax costs has passed; therefore, the clerk must enter the costs on the
judgment.
Accordingly,
Petitioner’s request for $741.12 in costs is granted.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Petitioner’s motion
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the total amount of $28,962.37, comprised of Petitioner’s
costs in the amount of $741.12, fees in the amount of $23,311.00, and expenses
in the amount of $4,910.25.
