And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Betty Chu to Plaintiff Yan Xiong's Complaint. The court sustains Chu's demurrer to the first, second, and eighth causes of action with ten (10) days leave to amend. The court sustains Chu's demurrer without leave to amend as to the third and fourth causes of action. The case involves a commercial landlord-tenant dispute over a sublease agreement and alleged breaches of contract, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and wrongful eviction. The court finds that Xiong's Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, and harassment/retaliation. The court also finds that Xiong's wrongful eviction claim is based on the same alleged breaches and therefore fails to state a claim.
