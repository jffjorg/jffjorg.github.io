And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion for stay of action pending resolution of the appeals on the constitutionality of the AB 218 exemption. The court finds that the pending appeals have sufficient public importance and may impact the outcome of the case. The court also considers the potential impacts of a published opinion from the First Appellate District. The court stays the action, setting an OSC re: Appeal(s) for 90-120 days from the hearing date. The court will consider further continuing the stay or setting new hearing dates for further consideration of the judgment on the pleadings. The currently set trial for July 29, 2024, is vacated, and the court takes the motion for judgment on the pleadings off-calendar.
