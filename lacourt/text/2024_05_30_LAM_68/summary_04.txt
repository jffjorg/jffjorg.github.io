The court has ruled on the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Carlos Valdez, against the defendant, ASB Watermarke Owner, LLC, A Delaware Corporation.

The court has sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to re-file a revised complaint that addresses the deficiencies identified by the court. The court has also noted that the plaintiff's allegations lack support for the identified causes of action, and that the third cause of action, "source of income discrimination," is not supported by any basis of authority. The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint and has scheduled a concurrent case management conference.
