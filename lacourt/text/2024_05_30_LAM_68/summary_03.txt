And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion by the Defendant/Cross-Complainant, 1041 Wall Street, Inc., to compel responses to the Request for Production of Documents served on Cross-Defendant Abdul Ahmed. The Defendant/Cross-Complainant represents that the requests were served on June 15, 2023, but no responses were received. Cross-Defendant Abdul Ahmed filed an opposition, arguing that the motion was filed too late, and that the parties failed to meet and confer beforehand. The Judge finds that the late responses were served as to the admissions and form interrogatories, but no document production occurred. The Judge orders Cross-Defendant Abdul Ahmed to serve verified responses to the request for production of documents (set one) without objections within 15 days. The Judge also imposes sanctions in the amount of $1,000, payable in 30 days, jointly against the responding party and counsel.
