SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
September 10, 2022, plaintiff Carlos Valdez moved into an apartment building
owned and/or managed by defendants ASB Watermarke Owner, LLC, A Delaware
Corporation, with the assistance of a Section 8 voucher. Plaintiff provided a
security deposit and a September 10, 2022, was scheduled. Plaintiff maintains Defendant
improperly represented Plaintiff’s qualification for the rental via acceptance
of the Section 8 certificate, and/or a promise to submit the required paperwork
with the relevant compliance agency(ies). According to Plaintiff, both parties
maintain the other was responsible for establishing compliance and
participation into the Section 8 program. Apparently, no payments were made,
and Plaintiff was subsequently residing in an unaffordable unit, thereby
leading to an unlawful detainer action (23STUD02401).
 
On
June 16, 2023, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed complaint for Negligent
Misrepresentation. On July 21, 2023, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a first
amended complaint for Negligent Misrepresentation, Intentional Infliction of
Mental Distress, and Source of Income Discrimination. On January 22, 2024, the
court granted the unopposed motion to quash service brought by ASB Watermarke
Owner, LLC, A Delaware Corporation. 
 
RULING: Sustained with
Leave to Amend.
Defendant ASB Watermarke Owner, LLC, A Delaware Corporation
(ASB), submits a demurrer to the first amended complaint. Defendant moves on
grounds of failure to state facts. Plaintiff in opposition contends the
operative complaint articulates all causes of action. ASB in reply reiterates
the lack of supporting facts in both the operative complaint, and sufficient
legal argument in opposition. ASB also challenges the introduction of extrinsic
information in the opposition. 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a
demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of
law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson
Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our
liberal pleading rules, where the complaint contains substantive factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave
to amend.]
 
Plaintiff appears in pro per. The court is not required to
extend special treatment to such parties. (Gamet
v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284–1285.) The court
reviews the case under the same standards as a represented party, including
equal review under the law with an understanding regarding certain ignorance of
legal procedure expected of a licensed attorney. (Petrosyan
v. Prince Corp. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th
587, 594.) 
 
Plaintiff lists three causes of action in the caption for Negligent
Misrepresentation, Intentional Infliction of Mental Distress, and Source of
Income Discrimination. The court quotes the entirety of the body of the
complaint following the introductory paragraph identifying the parties. 
 
“Plaintiff moved into a unit at ASB Watermarke Tower on
September 10, 2022, under a Section 8 voucher thanks to The. Los Angeles
Department of Mental Health (LADMH) after being homeless for over a year. The
application was submitted on August 4th 2022 over one month prior to the move
in date which was September 10th, 2022. 
 
“Fast forward to September 27th, 2022, Plaintiff contacted
HACLA (Housing Authority) to follow up on the status on the security deposit of
his reimbursement. HACLA confirmed that they had no record of his move-in,
deposit or the required documents that are required to approve payments to a
building. 
 
“Immediately frantic and stressed-out Plaintiff confronted
Defendant, they just made him feel that this was his responsibility and through
intimidation given his lack of knowledge Plaintiff believed them. Plaintiff
started reaching out to HACLA, MCC, APLA and even Mayor Bass's representative
after - reaching out for help. 
 
“Defendant negligent misrepresentation made Plaintiff rely
that everything was in order. 'Defendant confirmed to Plaintiff that all
documents had been submitted to housing via email on Aug 21, 2022 (20 days
prior to move in). Defendant brought Plaintiff in on August 28th to sign the
lease by both Plaintiff and Defendants. They request Plaintiff move-in funds
and accepted them. 
 
“But the most reckless misrepresentation was giving the
Plaintiff keys to an apartment that they knew he could not afford without the
voucher. With little to no regards to the damages Plaintiff would face due to
their reckless business practices. Note that in two occasion Defendant confirm
that all documents would be process in two different email and on different
dates. 
 
“Defendant has resulted to “Intentional Infliction of Mental
Distress” as of July 19th 20123 by requesting Defendants own Unlawful Detainer
trial against Plaintiff (23STUD02401) to be moved to September from original
date set back on June 8 2023. On Trial Day July 19, 2023.
“Despite Defendant emailing Plaintiff all morning aski
@lamnff to take a settlement or Defendant would “marke ready” (sic) once they
arrived to court. [Defendant] knows that the new date will result in added debt
which will affect [Plaintiff]. Mainly because of last week all outstanding rent
charges of over $29,249 were fully paid. –[Defendant] is retaliating and is not
acting in good faith.
 
“Defendant is using Plaintiffs mental health history to
pressure him to move out since Defendant now has all of Plaintiff evidence
provided for the Unlawful Detainer filed against Plaintiff (Case# 23STUD02401)”
 
The court first notes the failure to separately identify
each and every cause of action identified in the caption within the body of the
complaint. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.112.) The court sustains the demurrer
on this basis. 
 
Even considering the substance of the claims, the
court finds the allegations lack support for any and all of the identified
subject causes of action in the caption. (Potter
v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993)
6 Cal.4th 965, 1001; Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th
370, 407; Shamsian v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 967, 983; Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 173–174; Visions Sports,
Inc. v. Soren/McAdam/Bartells (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 303, 309–310; Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 385, 390; (Yau v.
Santa Margarita Ford, Inc. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144, 160–161.) The court
finds no cited basis of authority for the third cause of action listed as
“source of income discrimination,” and declines to speculate as to a potential
basis of the claim on behalf of Plaintiff.
 
The demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. Plaintiff may not add any new causes of action
without leave of court, but may articulate additional facts in order to support
the challenged claims. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any new causes of action added without leave of court
may be subject to a motion to strike. The court reminds Plaintiff to separately
identify each and every relied upon cause of action within the complaint.
 
The court will concurrently hold the Case Management
Conference.
