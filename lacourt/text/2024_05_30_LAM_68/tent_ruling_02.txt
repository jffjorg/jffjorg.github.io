Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
February 26, 2018, Plaintiff Melrose Quality Pain Relief, Inc. and Defendant
1041 Wall Street, Inc. entered into a contract identified as the “Option to
Purchase License Agreement.” The agreement provided 1041 Wall Street the right
to purchase a certain interest in a marijuana business owned by Melrose Quality
Pain Relief, Inc. The agreement includes a certain payment schedule for the 12
month option period. 
 
Plaintiff
maintains that Defendant Robert Cazarin paid the $100,000 initial deposit, but
defaulted on either three or five of the $45,000 monthly installments. 
 
On
February 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Fraud, Breach
of Fiduciary Duty, Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage, and
Violation of California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof Code§
17200, et seq. On April 4, 2022Robert Cazarin and 1401 Wall Street answered,
and filed a cross-complaint against Abdul Ahmed and Melrose Quality Pain
Relief, Inc. for Fraud, Breach of Contract, and Recission. The cross-complaint
alleges Cross-Defendants misrepresented their licensing status for legal
participation in the marijuana industry. 
 
Cross-Defendants
answered the cross-complaint on October 26, 2022. On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed Donta Foreman and Robert Cazarin without prejudice. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant,
1041 Wall Street, Inc. move to compel responses to Request for Production of
Documents (set one) served on Cross-Defendant Abdul Ahmed. 1041 Wall Street,
Inc. represents service of the identified discovery on June 15, 2023. [Declarations
of Scott Lee and Motions, Ex. A.] According to Plaintiff, at the time of the
filing of the motion, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 8.] 
 
Abdul
Ahmed in a three (3) court day/six calendar day late filed opposition maintains
Ahmed is an improper party to the action, moving party failed to meet and
confer, represents a written agreement somehow undermining the subject
discovery, and late responses were ultimately served. Counsel requests the
court refrain from sanctions, due to personal circumstances.
 
1041
Wall Street, Inc. in reply denies any improper conduct in filing the motion,
denies any written agreement foregoing the right to propound the subject
discovery, denies any necessity to meet and confer prior to filing a motion to
compel initial responses, and denies any justification against imposing
sanctions. 
 
1041
Wall Street, Inc. concedes that late responses were served as to the admissions
and form interrogatories, but maintains no document production occurred. Per
the notice of moving party, the court took the concurrently filed motions to
compel responses to form interrogatories and motion to deem admissions admitted
off-calendar. The motion for production of documents remains on calendar, and
the opposition lacks any proof of service of actual documents in compliance
with the requests. The motion is therefore granted. Cross-Defendant Abdul Ahmed
is ordered to serve verified responses to request for production of documents
(set one) without objections within 15 days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a-b).)
 
Sanctions in the amount of $1,000, which represents the statutory
minimum required for request for production of documents. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050,
subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (c).) Sanctions payable in 30 days and imposed
jointly against responding party and counsel.
 
Trial set for October 21, 2024.
 
1041 Wall
Street, Inc. to give notice.
