And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is in response to defendants Vahid Zand and Niyousha Eternadieh's motions to set aside default/default judgment. The case is a construction defect case, where plaintiff Lyuda Ksenych alleges that the defendants breached the contract by failing to complete the work on time. The work was supposed to be completed in two months, but the defendants took nearly 16 months. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants damaged flooring, expensive stone, and cabinets during the installation process.

The defendants argue that they did not file a responsive pleading because they had an understanding with plaintiff's prior counsel that they would be dismissed from the complaint. The court finds that the defendants' motion is procedurally defective, but that discretionary relief is warranted. The court concludes that the defendants' failure to file a responsive pleading was due to excusable neglect, based on plaintiff's prior counsel's representation that plaintiff would dismiss the claims against the defendants.

The court grants the motions to set aside default, citing the policy of having every case tried on its merits and the strong policy against a party who attempts to take advantage of the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect of their adversary.
