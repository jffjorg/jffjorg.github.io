And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the plaintiff, Quincy Smith, and the defendants, Imani Halley a.k.a. Imani Manny Halley and True to the Game Productions, Inc. The settlement agreement, executed on August 22, 2022, provides for the payment of $250,000.00 by the defendants to the plaintiff.

The court has also granted the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees and costs in the total amount of $5,080.00. The court reduced the amount of the fees and costs due to excessive billing hours.

The defendants' arguments that the payment of the outstanding balance of $35,000.00 plus $5,000.00 towards the plaintiff's accrued attorney's fees and costs will moot the motion, and that the motion violates CCP § 1008, were not persuasive. The court finds that a promise to pay does not moot the motion, and that CCP § 1008 does not apply in this case.

The court's ruling is based on the language of the settlement agreement, which provides that the settlement will be enforceable under CCP § 664.6, and that a party seeking enforcement will be entitled to attorney's fees.
