Moving Party: Plaintiff Quincy
Smith 
Responding Party: Defendants Imani
Halley a.k.a. Imani Manny Halley (“Halley”) and True to the Game Productions,
Inc
 
T/R:     
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AND ENTER JUDGMENT IS GRANTED. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
AND COSTS IS GRANTED IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $5,080.00.
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit
on the tentative, please email the courtroom at¿SMCdept54@lacourt.org¿with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:30 am on the day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the motion, opposition, and
reply.
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (CCP § 664.6.)  
            
            Plaintiff moves to enforce the
settlement agreement executed by Plaintiff and Defendants Imani Halley a.k.a
Imani Manny Halley and True to the Game Productions, Inc. on August 22, 2022. The
agreement provides that Defendants would pay Plaintiff $250,000.00. The parties
agreed that the settlement would be enforceable under CCP § 664.6, and a party
seeking enforcement would be entitled to attorney’s fees. 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that
this matter will be moot because they will pay the outstanding balance of $35,000.00
in full plus $5,000 towards Plaintiff’s accrued attorney’s fees and costs. They
also argue that the motion violates CCP § 1008 because it was taken off
calendar on April 19, 2024, and Plaintiff failed to renew it until May 1, 2024.
Neither argument is persuasive. Defendants fail to provide any evidence that
they have made the payments; a promise to pay does not moot the motion. And CCP
§ 1008 does not apply; the earlier motion was taken off calendar.   
The Court takes no issue with counsel’s
billing rates, but the number of billable hours for the two motions is excessive.
The Court reduces the attorneys’ fees and costs to a total of $5,080.00.
