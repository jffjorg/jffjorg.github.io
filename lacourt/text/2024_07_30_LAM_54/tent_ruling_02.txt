The Court considers the
moving papers.  No opposition has been
received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing an attorney to
withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation when the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—for example, counsel
cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation.  (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; see California Rule of
Professional Conduct 3-700.)  
 
Steven S. Vahidi of Vahidi Law Group, counsel of record
for Defendant David Raymond Steckel, seeks to withdraw from representation of
Defendant.  Counsel states the
attorney-client relationship has broken down. 
Trial is set for July 21, 2025; no prejudice will result from counsel’s
withdrawal.  Counsel has complied with
CRC 3.1362.
 
The Court finds good
cause for counsel’s withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.
