 
This is an
action regarding the sale of a 1964 Ferrari 275 GTB Shortnose Speciale (the Car
or Ferrari). On
August 30, 2023, following trial, the Court entered Judgment awarding Alpine
Group (Alpine) specific performance of the Sale Agreement under which Alpine purchased
a 1964 Ferrari 275 GTB Prototype (Ferrari) from Gooding & Company, Inc. for
$5,175,000.
 
Plaintiffs Alpine now moves for an award of attorneys’ fees
and costs in the amount of $2,943,834.75
against Gooding & Company, Inc. (Gooding) and Falcon Woods, LLC (Falcon
Woods) jointly and severally. Both Gooding and Falcon Woods filed oppositions
to the motion. 
 
Gooding also moves for attorney fees in the amount of
$844,986.00 plus any fees incurred in connection with opposition and reply,
against Falcon Woods. Falcon Woods filed an opposition to this motion. 
 
Alpine’s motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced
amount of $2,471,005.86. 
 
Gooding’s motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the
reduced amount of $798,500.69. 
 
Evidentiary Issues:
 
Alpine’s objections to the declaration of Jardini are ruled
as follows: Nos. 1-102 are overruled.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general
rule, the parties to a lawsuit must bear their own attorney’s fees. (Cassim
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 806.) 
 
Exceptions
to the general rule are where attorney’s fees are specifically provided by
statute or where the parties have expressly agreed to an award of attorney’s
fees. Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides that “ ‘[e]xcept as
attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties....’ “ “Code of Civil Procedure section 1021
does not independently authorize the recovery of attorney's fees.” (Santisas
v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 607, fn. 4.) Rather, it recognizes and
codifies the general rule that attorney’s fees may be recovered only when they
are authorized by a statute or provided for by the parties’ agreement. (Ibid.)
 
Civil Code
section 1717 controls the recovery of attorney fees where the action is “on a
contract” containing an attorney's fees provision. (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd.
(a).) It provides: 
 
“(a) In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney's fees in addition to other costs.” (Ibid.)
 
Discussion

 
Procedural Issue:
 
In its motion for attorney fees, Gooding requests that the
Court order that the attorney fees owed to Gooding and Alpine be paid out of
the $5.175 million that Alpine was ordered to pay Gooding to hold in trust.
Gooding notes that the combined fees of Gooding and Alpine are less than $5.175
million. 
 
            Alpine does not object to Gooding’s
proposal that the attorney’s fees awarded to Alpine and Gooding and Gooding’s
commission be paid from the funds now held in trust by Gooding. Additionally, Alpine
requests that the funds presently held in trust by Gooding should be used to
pay the parties’ costs.[1]

 
            Falcon Woods also does not object to
Gooding’s request that all attorney fee awards and the $175,000 commission
should be paid out of the $5.175 million currently held by Gooding pursuant to
the Court’s judgment, with the remainder remitted to Falcon Woods.
 
Alpine’s Motion for Attorney Fees:
 
Alpine moves for attorney fees in the total amount of
$2,943,834.75 against Gooding and Falcon Woods, jointly and severally, pursuant
to its Post-Auction Sale Agreement – Buyer (Sale Agreement). These attorney
fees encompass the fees incurred by both Dentons US LLP (Dentons) – Alpine’s
initial counsel in this case – and Glaser Weil Fink Howard Jordan and Shapiro,
LLP (Glaser Weil) – Alpine’s successor counsel.
 
            In opposition, Falcon Woods argues Alpine’s
fee request is so outrageous that the Court would be justified in denying it
outright. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137 [“A fee request
that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the
trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether”] [italics
added].) In the alternative, Falcon Woods argues that the fees must be
significantly reduced to a fee amount not exceeding $125,840.06 (or $573,850.63
less than the amount sought by Gooding in its Motion for Attorney Fees). 
 
            In its brief response to Alpine’s
motion, Gooding also argues that Alpine’s fees are unreasonable. 
 
Hourly Rates: 
 
            In assessing the reasonableness of
hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity
with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied [citations], and affidavits from
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437; see¿Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable
hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors…[including] the level
of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the
litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability of the case” ’
”].)¿
 
Alpine submits the declarations of Leah Bruno and Peter
Bransten in support of the hourly rates for the Dentons and Glaser Weil
attorneys and paralegals. Specifically, the hourly rates of the Dentons
attorneys ranged from $550 to $920 for partners and $270 to $710 for
associates. (Bruno Decl., ¶¶ 53-88.) In 2022, the hourly rates of the Glaser
Weil attorneys who worked on the case were $1400 for Attorney Glaser – a
partner – $800 for Attorney Peter Bransten – an Of Counsel – and $575 for
Olivia Weiss – an associate; in 2023, these Glaser Weil rates increased to
$1500, $900, and $675, respectively. (Bransten Decl., ¶ 27.) Alpine argues that
these hourly rates are consistent with the hourly rates of attorneys at similar
firms. (Bransten Decl., ¶¶ 33-39, Exs. D-I.)
 
In opposition, Falcon Woods argues that Glaser Weil’s hourly
rates are excessive. Falcon Woods contends that the combined blended rate
charged is an “astronomical” average rate of $808.83/hour, for attorneys and
non-attorneys alike, which is especially inappropriate given the non-complex
nature of the litigation. (Jardini Decl., ¶ 63.) As such, Falcon argues Glaser
Weil’s rates should be reduced to match Dentons’ rates, which results in a
$272,639 reduction from the gross billed amount. (Jardini Decl., ¶ 74.)
 
The Glaser Weil firm’s rates are high, particularly lead
counsel’s. However, the Court cannot find they are unreasonable. (Bransten
Decl., ¶ 28.) Based on the Court's familiarity with the current local market,
and Alpine’s evidence of the experience and skills of its attorneys – Glaser
Weil’s requested rates per hour are reasonable.
 
Hours Incurred:
 
            In arguing the attorney fee hours
incurred were reasonable, Alpine recounts the entire procedural history of the
case, which Alpine contends demonstrates the extensive litigation required in
this case, justifying the hours sought. (Mot., 13:14-19:2.) 
 
            Based on the evidence submitted by Alpine,
the Dentons attorneys and staff performed a total of 2,956.1 hours of work in
this matter for total billings of $1,807,838.50. (Bruno Decl., ¶ 92, Ex. A.)
The Glaser Weil attorneys and staff performed a total of 1,404.50 hours of work
in this matter for total billings of $1,135,996.25. (Bransten Decl., ¶ 32, Ex.
C.)
 
            Falcon Woods argues that the amount
of reasonable fees awarded to Gooding should serve as a starting point for
Alpine’s fees.
 
1.    
Apportionment
for Non-Contract Claims:
 
            In its Second Amended Complaint,
Alpine alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, tortious breach of
contract, civil conspiracy, and inducement of breach of contract. Alpine
prevailed on the breach of contract claim only. 
 
            “Section 1717 is the applicable statute when
determining whether and how attorney's fees should be awarded under a
contract.” (Sears v. Baccaglio, supra, 60 Cal.App.4th at p. 1157, 70
Cal.Rptr.2d 769.) Civil Code section 1717 “covers only contract actions,
where the theory of the case is breach of contract, and where the contract sued
upon itself specifically provides for an award of attorney fees incurred to
enforce that contract.” (Xuereb v. Marcus & Millichap, Ins.
(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 154, disapproved on other
grounds by Santisas v. Goodin, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 614, fn. 8, 71
Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399, as recognized by Damian v. Tamondong
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1115, 1127, fn. 13, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 262.)
 
            Nonetheless, Alpine argues that
“[w]here the issues associated with the cause of action on which a plaintiff
prevails are common to other causes of action on which the plaintiff is not
entitled to fees, apportionment of the fees would be improper. (Mot. 19:25-27
[citing Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 129-30.)
Further, “[a]pportionment is not required when the claims for relief are so
intertwined that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the
attorney’s time into compensable and noncompensable units.” (Bell v. Vista
Unified School District (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 687.)
 
            Here, Alpine contends that all the causes
of action shared the same factual issues: “whether Falcon Woods gave Gooding
actual and/or ostensible authority to sell the Ferrari; whether Alpine
purchased the Ferrari under the Sale Agreement; whether Gooding and Falcon
Woods breached the Sale Agreement, and whether Gooding and Falcon Woods
defendants had a defense to liability based on the Terms and Conditions of Sale
incorporated into the Sale Agreement.” (Mot., 20:14-18.) 
 
            In opposition, Falcon Woods argues
that Alpine has misstated the law. When, as here, the fee-shifting provision
allows the recovery of only fees incurred litigating contract issues, the court
should apportion the fees “even where the issues are connected, related or
intertwined.” (El Escorial
Owners' Assn v. DLC Plastering, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1365; see also Shadoan v. World Sav. & Loan Ass’n
(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 97, 109 [recognizing apportionment as the “best solution”
even though the compensable and non-compensable issues were identical]; Heppler
v. J.M. Peters Co. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1297 [trial court abused its
discretion in failing to apportion to account for time spent on non-compensable
issues].)
 
            Moreover, Falcon Woods argues that the
tort and contract claims can be apportioned. First, Alpine incurred fees
opposing Gooding’s demurrer to its claims for conversion and civil conspiracy
in its First Amended Complaint. Falcon Woods argues all the fees incurred in
responding to Gooding’s demurrer are properly apportioned to the
non-compensable tort claims, totaling $13,347.69.
(Jardini Decl., ¶ 98.) 
 
            Second, Alpine also incurred fees in
opposing Falcon Woods’ demurrer to the FAC. Falcon Woods acknowledges that the
demurrer included the contract claims, but argues that a majority of its
argument section was devoted the non-contract issues; Falcon Woods calculated
these non-recoverable fees to be $21,989.31. 
 
            Third, Falcon Woods contends that
the costs incurred in seeking leave to file a SAC and to oppose the demurrer
that followed should be struck. Falcon Woods notes that Alpine’s SAC, filed in
2019, sought three substantive changes with respect to tort causes of action; thus, the demurer to these tort claims
must also be non-recoverable. The total amount in this category is $71,321.
(See Jardini Decl., ¶ 98.)
 
            Fourth, Falcon Woods moved for
summary adjudication of Alpine’s second (breach of the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing), third (conversion), and fourth (civil conspiracy) causes of
action.
Alpine’s opposition to the motion
for summary adjudication addressed the contract claim (good faith and fair
dealing) separately from the remaining (non-contract) claims. Falcon Woods
estimates that forty percent of the work on that opposition is apportioned to
the non-contract issues. (Jardini Decl. ¶ 95.) Thus, the fees should be reduced
further by $29,992.20.
 
            After Alpine amended to add an
inducement of breach claim as a fifth cause of action, Falcon Woods moved for
summary adjudication of that claim as well as the request for punitive damages.
Falcon Woods contends all fees incurred in opposing that motion – $56,953.50 –
are non-recoverable. (See Jardini Decl. ¶¶ 96–97.)
 
            Finally, Glaser Weil
incurred $14,553.43 for simply reviewing the non-compensable motions for
summary adjudication related to the tort claims, which should also be excluded.
 
            In reply, Alpine contends that the
Sale Agreement encompassed the tort claims alleged by Alpine. (Reply 4:5-6.)
However, Alpine provides no analysis of this issue in the reply, and, as noted
in the prior sentence, failed to raise the issue entirely in the moving papers,
arguing only that apportionment was not proper here where the contract
and tort claims involved a common core of facts.
 
            Falcon Woods is correct that a court may apportion fees even where
the issues are connected, related or intertwined. (El Escorial Owners' Assn
v. DLC Plastering, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1365.) However, the
Court need not apportion fees where claims are so intertwined that separation
of time is “impracticable, if not impossible” to achieve. (Abdallah v.
United Sav. Bank (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1101, 1111.)
 
            Here, however, the opposition persuasively
demonstrates that it is not impractical to apportion at least some portion of
the tort and contract claims. Thus, while most of the fees are related to
issues that were “inextricably intertwined” and impractical to
apportion, the challenges identified by Falcon Woods in its opposition to
specific tort claims can be apportioned. 
 
            Thus, Alpine’s attorney fees will be
reduced by $208,157.13 ($13,347.69 + $21,989.31 + $71,321 + $29,992.20 + $56,953.50
+ 14,553.43). 
 
Falcon Woods also seeks an across the board percentage
apportionment of a 25% reduction of Dentons’ time and a 20% reduction of Glaser
Weil’s time to “reflect[] the appropriate apportionment of the remainder of
their billed amounts to account for time spent on non-contract issues.” (Opp.,
20:19-22 [Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 100-105.) This request is arbitrary and runs afoul
of the “inextricably intertwined” nature of the litigation that renders such
wholesale apportionment unfair and impractical. 
 
(1.)
 Frivolous procedural maneuvers:
 
            Falcon Woods also argues Alpine
engaged in baseless litigation tactics and should not be able to recover the
fees incurred in doing so.  
 
            Falcons specifically identifies the Alpine’s
motion for summary adjudication that was heard two months after a similar
motion was heard and denied because the Court found there was a triable issue
of material fact in dispute. Approximately $167,261.00 fees
were incurred in bringing this motion that was “destined” to fail following the
Court’s prior ruling. Alpine also incurred another $81,378 preparing writ
petitions challenging the interlocutory denial of its motions. (Jardini Decl. ¶
86.)   According to Falcon Woods, attorney
fees should be reduced by a further $248,639 for these baseless motions.
 
            Additionally,
Alpine sought to amend the complaint for a third time; this time to add Falcon
Woods’ beneficial owner, Michael Mak, as a defendant. After the Court denied
the motion for leave to amend, Alpine filed an equally unsuccessful writ
petition challenging the Court’s interlocutory decision. The total cost for
this procedural maneuver was $117,054.50. 
 
            Here,
Falcon Woods conflates unsuccessful with frivolous. Unsuccessful motions are
still recoverable and not necessarily unreasonable. (City of Sacramento v.
Drew (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 1287, 1303 [“Litigation often involves a
succession of attacks upon an opponent’s case; indeed, the final ground of
resolution may only become clear after a series of unsuccessful attacks.
Compensation is ordinarily warranted even for unsuccessful forays.”].)
Moreover, the Court cannot say that the motion for leave to amend was an
unnecessary or unreasonable procedural effort.
 
            Alpine’s
Reply notes that the Court’s prior summary judgment ruling on Falcon Woods’ and
Gooding’s motions did not foreclose Alpine’s later motion seeking adjudication
on the limited issue that Gooding and Falcon Woods owed it a contractual duty
to deliver possession and title to the Ferrari to Alpine. (Bransten Reply
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.)
 
Legal Overstaffing and Overbilling: 
 
            Falcon Woods also argues that fees
should be reduced to address “overstaffing.” Specifically, Falcon Woods notes that Alpine used the services of 21
timekeepers. (Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 50–51.) Notably, Falcon Woods cites the fact
that the Dentons timekeepers made 19 appearances with two or more attorneys (at
motions, status conferences, depositions, and mediations), but the lack of
complexity of the case did not warrant multiple attorneys attending court
hearings or depositions (Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 131-132.) Thus, according to Falcon
Woods, reasonable staffing would have reduced Dentons’ billed amount by
$253,097 and Glaser Weil’s billed amount by $136,320 for overstaffing, and
$52,552.25 for duplicative time incurred. (Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 58, 61, 133.) 
 
However, the opposition does nothing more than indicate that
multiple attorneys were used in this case. That is, Falcon Woods suggests a per
se rule that two attorneys at a hearing is inherently duplicative and must be
reduced, but this is not the law. Unlike the challenge for overhead billing and
clerical billing, Falcon Woods provides no specific evidence of instances of inappropriate
overstaffing or duplication.  
 
            Falcon Woods also challenges the
fees incurred for the Dentons attorney’s travel fees. For example, Falcon Woods
notes that the Dentons attorneys from the Chicago office billed for many trips
to Los Angeles, even though Dentons has a Los Angeles office, and attorneys
from that office were billing on the matter. (Jardini Decl., ¶ 134; see Rey
v. Madera Unified School Dist. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1241 [recovery
of higher rates for out-of-town counsel requires sufficient showing that hiring
local counsel was impracticable].)
 
            This challenge, which is not
addressed on reply, is well taken. Alpine’s fees will be reduced by $98,552 for
unnecessary travel.
 
            Falcon Woods also challenged the
amount of fees incurred from interoffice communications. Specifically, Falcon Woods contends that, for this
non-complex matter, conferencing should be 5% or lower of the total hours
worked, yet Dentons and Glaser billed for conferencing at a much higher rate.
It contends that Alpine’s fees should be reduced by $190,494. (Jardini Decl., ¶
135.) There is some merit to this argument. The billing records show numerous
entries for “team calls” and different billing entries for presumably the same
call. (See e.g., Entry 10/17/2023.) However, the 5% ceiling is arbitrary.  Communications among multiple timekeepers can
enhance efficiency. A certain amount of interoffice communication is reasonable
and necessary. Based on its experience with such litigation, the Court will
reduce fees by $80,000. 
 
Billing Increments:
 
            Next, Falcon Woods argues that the
appropriate minimum billing increment is one-tenth of an hour, citing State Bar
Arbitration Advisory 2016-02, Analysis of Potential Bill Padding and Other
Billing Issues (Bill Padding Advisory). Nonetheless, Glaser Weil attorneys
engaged in a billing increment practice of quarter-hour increments, thereby inflating
their fees. According to Falcon Woods, this billing method reduces accuracy and
has been proven to highly inflate billing because every task or entry must be
at least .25 of an hour, or 15 minutes. (Jardini Decl. ¶ 161.) 
 
Falcon Woods requests a reduction of .15 hours for each
entry to account for the overbilling caused by this billing practice—resulting
in a total reduction of $123,751. (Jardini Decl. ¶ 161.)
 
Whether best practices or not, nothing prevents Alpine’s attorneys
from using a 15-minute inquiry billing system. It is arbitrary to find that
such increments warrant a wholesale reduction of fees; instead, the burden
remains on Falcon Woods to show that specific billing entries were excessive
for the tasks identified.
 
Vague Description Entries:
 
            Falcon Woods challenges the vague
billing entries used by Alpine’s timekeepers. For example, Dentons’ timekeepers
used vague billing descriptions—such as “strategy,” “various correspondence,”
“research,” and “mediation issues.” (Jardini Decl., ¶ 147.) Falcon Woods argues
that Alpine’s fees should be reduced by $190,916.62 to address these vague
entries. (Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 147–153.)
 
Vague entries obscure a court’s ability to assess the
reasonableness of a fee request, justifying a reduction of the fees. (See e.g.,
Maughan v. Google Technology (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1251
[affirming trial court’s reduction of fees and costs from $112,288 to $23,000,
in part because the time sheets submitted were “somewhat vague in their
descriptions of what precisely defense counsel was doing for the claimed amount
of time”].) 
 
There are a number of Alpine’s counsel’s billing entries that
would benefit from greater detail in the description. But the billing entries
are not so vague as to preclude determining their reasonableness. In any case,
attorney bills are not even required to be produced on a motion for attorney
fees. The Court can generally understand the nature of the work described in
the context of the litigation. 
 
Fees Incurred Preparing for Trial:
 
Citing Clemens v. New York
Central Mutual Fire Insurance Company (3d Cir. 2018) 903 F.3d 396, Falcon
Woods argues that Alpine also
excessively billed on various tasks, most notably for trial preparation and in
preparing the attorney fees motion. (See e.g., id. At 401-403 [calling 562
hours a “staggering” and “outrageous” number of hours billed for preparing for
a 4-day trial.].) Here, for the 4-day trial, Alpine’s counsel billed 673 hours,
which Falcon Woods notes is almost 4 times the number of hours billed by
Gooding for the same trial. (Jardini Decl. ¶¶ 121–123.) Notably, this
approximates to about four months of work for four days of trial. Falcon
request that the time on trial preparation for Alpine’s counsel be reduced by
at least 300 hours or $242,559.
 
Trial preparation is always the costliest and most high
stakes time in a case.  All parties were
aware of that when they chose to try the matter rather than settle it.  The Court declines to reduce the hours or
fees for Alpine’s trial preparation.
 
Fees Incurred on this Motion:
 
            Alpine’s current and former counsel
purportedly billed roughly $130,000 for 157 hours on its fees motion. (Jardini
Decl., ¶¶ 106–118.) While the attorney fee motion certainly represents a
substantial sum of money and logically would seem to require a large number of
hours to address, the two are not directly correlated. 
 
            In fact, the motion – while time
consuming to address Falcon Woods’ numerous objections – is not a legally
complicated attorney fees motion. There is no dispute over the prevailing party,
and rather the matter turns mostly on the reasonableness of the fees – which
neither the moving papers nor the reply spend an inordinate amount of detail
addressing. 
 
            The fees sought in connection to the
motion for attorney fees must be reduced by $65,000.
 
Non-chargeable Overhead costs:
 
Falcon Woods also seeks to reduce fees incurred on
clerical/overhead work. 
 
California authority permits a trial
court to disallow attorney rates for clerical work. (See Save Our Uniquely
Rural Community Environment v. County of San Bernardino (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 1179, 1186-1187 [the trial court “could reasonably have determined
that billing at partner rates for” “some work that appears ... to be clerical”
was “excessive”].) 
 
Falcon Woods identifies numerous billing entries for
clerical/overhead work. (Jardini Decl. ¶¶ 136–143 [Examples of Overhead].) The
reply does not address the challenge to these fees. If Alpine wished to recover
[s]ecretarial
[or] paralegal” rates, Alpine should have claimed the work properly. (See Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 280 [“It is the
obligation of the party (and attorney) seeking the fee award ‘to prune the fee
request to comply with the law,’ and the party (and attorney) cannot ‘transfer
that responsibility onto the trial court.’ ”].) Attorney’s fees must be reduced by $21,119.76 for clerical
services. 
 
Total Reductions: 
 
            The Court grants Alpine’s motion for
attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $2,471,005.86.

Gooding’s Motion for Attorney Fees: 
 
Gooding seeks attorneys’ fees in the amount of $844,986.
Falcon Woods opposes the motion.
 
Gooding argues it is entitled to reasonable fees pursuant to
the indemnification provision and the attorney fee provision in the Consignment
Agreement between Gooding and Falcon Woods. Specifically, after trial, the
Court found in favor of Alpine on its claim that it was entitled to specific
performance on the sale of the Ferrari from Gooding. In reaching this
conclusion, the Court found that as a result of Falcon Woods’s conduct in
agreeing to lower the reserve price on the vehicle in question and then
reneging on that agreement, Gooding was entitled to indemnification and defense
from Falcon Woods. In its statement of decision, the Court held: “To the extent
Gooding is liable to Alpine, Falcon Woods must indemnify Gooding, including for
attorney’s fees”
(Statement of Decision, p. 20.)
 
            In opposition, Falcon Woods does not
dispute that Gooding is entitled to attorney fees. Instead, the opposition – which
consists of less than a page of analysis – argues that Gooding’s fee request
should be reduced to a total of $699,690.69.
 
            In challenging the amount of the
fees, Falcon Woods argues that fees must be reduced to account for overstaffing
and overuse of partner time billing (as opposed to attorneys with lower billing
rates). Falcon Woods notes that Gooding utilized 13 timekeepers but relied
primarily on partner billing (77%). Falcon Woods argues the Court must reduce fees
to reflect a reasonable apportionment of lower level tasks to lower-rate
timekeepers; as such, Gooding’s fees should be reduced by $84,499. (Jardini
Decl., ¶ 79.)
 
            In response Gooding argues that
Falcon Woods fails to provide legal authority that limits a law firm’s
discretion in how it staffs its firm and how it manages the work assignments to
the attorneys in a firm. Here, it was not unreasonable for two attorneys to
handle nearly all the work, with a third attorney assisting at trial. Further,
the reply notes that neither Falcon Woods, nor its expert identify any specific
tasks that they contend should have been performed by a more junior attorney. 
 
            The Court has reviewed the billing
records and has identified multiple entries that suggest a junior attorney
would have been capable of handling a specific task. (Ledal Decl., Ex. A [See e.g.,
Billing Entries 1/20/19-1/23/19]; see also 5/2019, 8/8/19, 8/20/19-8/21/19].)
However, as argued by Gooding, it is not appropriate for the Court to micromanage
a law firm’s staffing decisions. Nonetheless, given the use of partners with
expertise worthy of $900 an hour rate, the Court finds that many of these tasks
could have been completed more efficiently, suggesting overbilling by Gooding.
Thus, the Court will reduce fees by $20,000 on this ground. 
 
            Further, Falcon Woods argues
Gooding’s fees must be further reduced by $46,311 for the timekeeping entries
which were impermissibly vague, specifically as to Attorney Meyer. (See Jardini
Decl., ¶¶ 154-155 Ex. Examples of Vague Billing schedule [e.g., “attention to
discovery request” 4/22/2019].) These entries are impermissibly vague and make
it difficult to ascertain the reasonableness of the hours incurred because the
Court is unable to determine even the general nature of the work conducted. The
Court will reduce fees by $12,000. 
 
            Finally, Falcon Woods argues that
Gooding’s counsel billed over $14,485.31 for overhead/clerical work. (Jardini
Decl., ¶¶ 144-146.) As demonstrated by the example of clerical billing in the
Jardini declaration, this ground is well taken.
 
Total Reductions: 
 
            The Court grants Gooding’s motion
for attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $798,500.69.
