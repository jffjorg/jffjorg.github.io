Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court may amend a judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor, and thereby make the additional judgment debtor liable on the judgment. To prevail on the motion, the judgment creditor must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the parties to be added as judgment debtors had control of the underlying litigation and were virtually represented in that proceeding; that there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the entity and the owners no longer exist; and that an inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated as those of the entity alone.

In this case, Plaintiff Emiliano Calemzuk moves to amend the judgment to add Alejandro Corral as an additional Judgment Debtor. Judgment was entered against the sole defendant, Corral 360 Inc., and in favor of Plaintiff, on January 28, 2022, for the principal amount of $58,540.00. Mr. Corral is allegedly the principal of Corral 360 Inc., and Plaintiff argues that Corral 360 is merely a shell corporation that has been suspended for years, intended to solely benefit its principal Alex Corral, and thus Mr. Corral should be liable for the judgment.

The Court finds that Mr. Corral is the sole officer, director, and agent of service of process for Corral 360 Inc., and that Mr. Corral guided Corral 360's defense of this litigation. The Court also notes that Plaintiff has attempted to collect against Corral 360 via certain post-judgment collection methods and certain post-judgment discovery, but no responsive documents, particularly corporate records, were ever produced. Mr. Corral has told counsel that no corporate records exist for production, and Mr. Corral has also stated there are no corporate bank accounts or assets to disclose (or pursue).

Based on the evidence presented, the Court concludes that Mr. Corral is the alter ego of Corral 360 Inc. The Court finds that Mr. Corral used Corral 360 as a shell for his personal business and did not adhere to corporate formalities. The record shows that Corral 360 lacks sufficient capitalization, and it would be inequitable to allow Mr. Corral to avoid liability through his use of a corporate shell, Corral 360.

Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED, and Alejandro Corral is added as an additional Judgment Debtor.
