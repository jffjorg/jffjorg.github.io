Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for determination of good faith settlement in a lawsuit. The motion was filed by defendants Pico & Pico, Attorneys at Law and Jasmine Pico, seeking a determination that a settlement of $229,528.10 with plaintiffs Cynthia D. Finerty and RSH Properties I LLC was made in good faith. The motion is uncontested, and the court finds that the settlement was made in good faith based on the evaluation of the Tech-Bilt factors, which include a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the amount paid in settlement, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. The court grants the motion and finds that the settlement was made in good faith.
