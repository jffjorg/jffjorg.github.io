And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The case arises from an employment dispute, and the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging pregnancy discrimination, disability discrimination, and other claims. The defendants claim that an arbitration agreement was signed electronically, but the plaintiff denies signing the agreement and claims she physically signed the onboarding paperwork. The defendants have not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the authenticity of the electronic signature, and the court finds that they have not met their burden of proof.
