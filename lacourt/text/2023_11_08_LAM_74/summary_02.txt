And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by ExtraSensory Software, Inc. and its representatives to seal certain documents related to a dispute over alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The judge is applying California Rules of Court to determine whether the documents should be sealed. The judge finds that the court records are presumed to be open to the public, but that an overriding interest in preserving trade secrets exists. However, the judge concludes that the motion is overly broad and does not specify the portions of the documents that reveal trade secrets. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to seal without prejudice.
