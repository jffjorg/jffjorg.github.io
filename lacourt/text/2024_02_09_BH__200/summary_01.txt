And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendants to exclude evidence of a decision issued by the Santa Monica Rent Control Board in 2016. The defendants argue that the decision should be excluded from evidence and that collateral estoppel should not apply. The judge has denied the motion, finding that there is no basis to reconsider the previous rulings on the matter. The judge has also denied the defendants' request to reconsider the application of collateral estoppel. The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer on proposed jury instructions for the application of collateral estoppel and to submit a joint statement on the instructions. The judge will hold a hearing on April 24, 2024, to determine the final instructions.
