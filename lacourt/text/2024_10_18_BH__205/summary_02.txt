Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of ALLEN ASHKENAZI v. DREWELLA SELAN MCLENNON, et al. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident on July 25, 2023, in which the plaintiff was injured while crossing a street. The plaintiff has propounded several sets of discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demands for production, and has requested that the defendant respond to them by certain dates. The defendant has failed to timely respond to these requests, and the plaintiff has filed motions to compel the defendant to respond.

The judge has determined that the defendant's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests was unreasonable and has imposed sanctions on the defendant and its counsel's law firm. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $1,561.50 in sanctions for the defendant's failure to timely respond to the form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and $1,934.50 in sanctions for the defendant's failure to timely respond to the document demands.

The judge has also awarded the plaintiff $4,619 in sanctions for the defendant's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests and for the defendant's abuse of the discovery process. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motions to compel as moot, as the defendant has finally responded to the discovery requests.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions and has ordered the defendant and its counsel's law firm to pay the plaintiff's costs and expenses in the amount of $4,619. The judge has also ordered the defendant and its counsel's law firm to pay the plaintiff's attorney fees in the amount of $1,561.50.
