And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to refer all discovery in the case to a discovery referee is granted, in part. The court will only refer issues involving the "official information privilege" contained in Evidence Code § 1040. This decision is based on the fact that the "official information privilege" is a qualified, limited privilege that only applies to requests under the Public Records Act, and therefore requires an in camera review to determine whether it bars disclosure of documents in discovery. The court believes that an independent referee is best suited to conduct this review, and that it would be prejudicial to delay the case while the court conducts the review. The parties are instructed to meet and confer and select a referee, and to prepare a proposed order for the court's signature.
