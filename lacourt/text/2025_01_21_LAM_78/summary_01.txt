And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to initial discovery and to deem requests for admission admitted. The plaintiff initiated this action against multiple defendants in June 2024 and served discovery requests on defendant 650 S Spring Owner LLC's counsel in August 2024. The defendants argue that the service was improper because the counsel, David Bernardoni, did not have authority to accept service on behalf of the defendant at the time of service. The judge disagrees, finding that an email from Bernardoni to the plaintiff's counsel informing him of his representation of the defendant is not an "appearance" within the meaning of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1014. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motions are denied, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
