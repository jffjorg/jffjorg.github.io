  - "The burden therefore shifts to Plaintiff to establish the probable validity of Plaintiff's claim."
  - "Plaintiff fails to make even a minimal showing of facts that would support a judgment Plaintiff’s favor for either the violation of privacy or negligent supervision, and thus fails to meet their burden on the Anti-SLAPP second step."
```

English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' special motion to strike (Anti-SLAPP motion) and finds that they are the prevailing party, entitled to attorneys' fees and costs under CCP § 425.16. The defendants argue that their Anti-SLAPP motion is protected under CCP § 425.16(e)(2), which protects communications made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body. The court finds that the defendants' filing of the arbitration award was a protected activity under CCP § 425.16(e)(2). The plaintiff fails to make a minimal prima facie showing of a probability of success on the merits and therefore fails to meet their burden for the second prong of the Anti-SLAPP analysis. The court also finds that the defendants are protected by the litigation privilege, which applies without regard to motives, morals, ethics, or intent.
