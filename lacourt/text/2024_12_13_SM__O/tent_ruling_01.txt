DeSantis,  James A. McFaul, Doug Gillie; Dunn DeSantis Walt & Kendrick LLP  RESP.  PARTY:         Plaintiff Lisa M.  Iulianelli   TENTATIVE  RULING             Defendants  Kevin V. DeSantis, James A. McFaul, Doug Gillie, and Dunn DeSantis Walt &  Kendrick LLPs’ SLAPP Motion is GRANTED as to find the Defendants are the  prevailing party on the SLAPP motion thus entitled to attorneys’ fees and  costs. Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint dismissing Defendants while  the Defendants’ SLAPP motion to the original complaint was pending. Defendants  are the prevailing party on the SLAPP motion, and are entitled to attorneys’  fees and costs pursuant to CCP 425.16.  Defendants  are ordered to bring a separate motion for attorney’s fees.               Defendants  RJN is GRANTED as to the existence of articles, court documents, and the  administrative ruling documents, but not to the “truth of the hearsay  statements in the documents.” (In re Vicks (2013) 56 Cal.4th 274, 314.)   REASONING             A  “prevailing defendant” on a special motion to strike is “entitled to recover  that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” (§ 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) The  purpose of this provision is to provide the SLAPP defendant financial relief  from the plaintiff’s meritless lawsuit. (Liu v. Moore (1999) 69  Cal.App.4th 745, 750 (Liu).) A defendant who is only partially  successful will generally be considered to have prevailed, but not if “the  results of the motion were so insignificant that [he or she] did not achieve  any practical benefit from bringing the motion.” (Mann v. Quality Old Time  Service, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 340.) Whether a partially  successful defendant achieved sufficient benefit to be a “prevailing party” is  left to the discretion of the trial court and reviewed accordingly. (Ibid.)                 When  a plaintiff dismisses his or her complaint while the defendant’s special motion  to strike is pending, courts agree they retain jurisdiction to award fees and  costs. (See, e.g., Coltrain v. Shewalter (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 94, 107 (Coltrain);  Liu, supra,  69 Cal.App.4th at p. 752; Tourgeman v. Nelson & Kennard (2014) 222  Cal.App.4th 1447, 1456 (Tourgeman).) This is because permitting an  eleventh-hour dismissal to eliminate financial liability would undermine the  deterrent purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute. (See Liu, at pp. 750–751.) As  set forth in Coltrain, a plaintiff’s dismissal gives rise to the  presumption that the defendant prevailed. (Coltrain, supra, 66  Cal.App.4th at p. 107.)                A  trial court must consider the merits of the filed special motion to strike and  ascertain whether the defendant is a “prevailing defendant” on that basis, just  as it would have if the complaint had not been dismissed. (See, e.g., Tourgeman,  supra, 222 Cal.App.4th at p. 1458.)                Defendants  Kevin V. DeSantis, James A. McFaul, Doug Gillie; Dunn DeSantis Walt &  Kendrick LLP (collectively “DDWK”) filed their anti-SLAPP motion as to  Plaintiff Lisa M. Iulianelli (“Plaintiff”) initial Complaint on 7-25-24. On 9-9-24  Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint dismissing DDWK from the complaint  while the SLAPP motion was pending. Even though DDWK is no a longer party to  the complaint, the Court still retains jurisdiction as to the award of attorneys’  fees and costs for the prevailing party. To determine the prevailing party, the  Court must utilize the two-step analysis for anti-SLAPP motions.      I.             Anti-SLAPP  Analysis               “Litigation  of an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step process. First, the moving  defendant bears the burden of establishing that the challenged allegations or  claims arise from protected activity in which the defendant has engaged.   Second, for each claim that does arise from protected activity, the plaintiff  must show the claim has “at least ‘minimal merit.  If the plaintiff cannot  make this showing, the court will strike the claim.” (Bonni v. St.  Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1009 [discussing where moving  party seeks to strike an entire cause of action alleging multiple factual  bases, court does not determine whether 1st step is met based on  “gravamen” test; but rather must determine whether each factual bases supplies  the element of claim or merely provides context].)       a.      1st Step of Analysis – Defendants’  Burden               “[C]ourts  are to consider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions by the  defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for  liability.  The defendant’s burden is to identify what acts each  challenged claim rests on and to show how those acts are protected under a  statutorily defined category of protected activity.”  (Bonni,  supra, 11 Cal.5th at 1009.)                “The  moving defendant must show that the challenged claim or claims arise from the  defendant's constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights.  A  defendant need only make a prima facie showing at this stage.”  (Ojjeh  v. Brown (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035–1036.)  A defendant has the  “burden of identifying all allegations of protected activity” on the first  prong of SLAPP. (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th  924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the  act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories  spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut  (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)                   Plaintiff alleges two causes of action against  DDWK for (1) Violation of Privacy and (1) Negligent Supervision. DDWK argue that  both the Violation of Privacy and Negligent Supervision claims are based on attaching  the Arbitration Award to the Anti-SLAPP motion DDWK filed in the separate Iulianelli  Superior Court Case No. 23SMCV00356 (the “Underlying Iulianelli Action”). (Motion,  pp. 12–14.)  DDWK argues the filing of  the motion in the underlying Iulianelli Action is based on protected activity  under CCP §425.16(e)(2).  CCP §425.16(e)(2) protects communications “made  in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,  executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by  law.”                  DDWK  identifies their protected behavior as the filing of the Underlying Iulianelli  Action which included the arbitration award at issue as an exhibit.  Plaintiff  relies on the filing of the Underlying Iulianelli Action by DDWK to satisfy the  essential elements of both the Violation of Privacy and Negligent Supervision  claims. (See Compl., ¶¶ 4, 28, 87-88, 91, 94, 96, 98.) This litigation activity  was made in connection with the Underlying Iulianelli Action. Such litigation  activity qualifies as protected conduct under CCP §425.16(e)(2). (Bergstein  v. Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 793, 811  [granting Anti-SLAPP on because all conduct considered “litigation  activities”]; Optional Capital, Inc. v. Akin Gump Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 95,  113-115 [attorneys’ alleged assisting with misappropriation of settlement funds  protected activity because it arose out of representation of client in the  underlying litigation that led to settlement]               DDWK  establishes that Plaintiff’s complaint arises from protected conduct under CCP  §425.16(e)(2), thus DDWK satisfies its burden on the first step for the  Anti-SLAPP motion.  The burden therefore shifts to Plaintiff to establish  the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim.    b.      2nd Step of Analysis ­–Plaintiff’s  Burden               Once  defendant demonstrates that a cause of action arises from protected conduct,  the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient  and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a  favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is  credited.  (See Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82,  88-89.)  “Precisely because the statute (1) permits early intervention in  lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that implicate free speech  concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct discovery, the plaintiff's burden  of establishing a probability of prevailing is not high: We do not weigh  credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence. Instead, we accept  as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant's  evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff's submission as a matter  of law.  Only a cause of action that lacks ‘even minimal merit'  constitutes SLAPP.”  (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Gradient Analytics, Inc. (2007)  151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699.)               “The  second prong of the statute deals with whether the plaintiff has “demonstrated  a probability of prevailing on the claim.  Under section 425.16,  subdivision (b)(2), the superior court, in making these determinations,  considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the  facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ For purposes of an  anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by  both sides, but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the  evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to accept as true the evidence  favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need only establish that his or  her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP.  With  these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause of action under the  anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal merit.”  (Ralphs  Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)               The  “probability of prevailing” is tested by the same standard governing a motion  for summary judgment, nonsuit, or directed verdict.  Thus, in opposing a  SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's burden to make a prima facie showing of facts  that would support a judgment in plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads  Investors, L.P. v. Federal National Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th  757, 785; Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a  “summary-judgment-like procedure”].)                    Plaintiff fails  to make even a minimal showing of facts that would support a judgment  Plaintiff’s favor for either the violation of privacy or negligent supervision,  and thus fails to meet their burden on the Anti-SLAPP second step.  Additionally, Plaintiff filed a FAC dismissing DDWK from the complaint, thus giving  “rise to the presumption that the defendant prevailed.” (Coltrain, supra,  66 Cal.App.4th at p. 107.)               Further,  DDWK is protected by the litigation privilege. The filing of the motion in the  underlying action was a “publication” made in a judicial proceeding, to achieve  an object of litigation, with a clear connection to the action. Even if DDWK’s  motives for filing the award were with malicious intent, as alleged by the  Plaintiff, the litigation privilege would still apply in this situation. “[I]t  is now well established that the litigation privilege applies without regard to  motives, morals, ethics or intent. The litigation privilege is simply a test of  connectedness or logical relationship to litigation. [Citation.]” (Feldman  v. 1100 Park Lane Associates (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1490.)                Thus, Plaintiff  fails to make a minimal prima facie showing of a probability of success on the  merits and therefore fails to meet the plaintiff’s burden for the second prong  of the Anti-SLAPP analysis.                DDWK is the  prevailing party on the SLAPP motion and thus entitled to attorneys’ fees  pursuant to CCP § 425.16.
