And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted all motions, effective upon serving the court's order relieving counsel. The motions were filed by defense counsel seeking to be relieved as counsel due to the clients' breach of the attorney-fee agreement. The clients failed to honor the payment obligation under the fee agreement, despite repeated requests by counsel. The judge found that the failure to make payments under the retainer agreement is proper grounds to allow an attorney to withdraw as counsel. The judge also noted that the matter has settled, indicating little if any prejudice by granting the motions. The defense counsel has complied with all California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 and has appropriately served the plaintiff and defendants.
