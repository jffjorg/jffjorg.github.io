[1] And Cascade does not
provide authority otherwise. 
 


[2] Regarding the prior
dig ticket, in Reply, Cascade argues the SAC deliberately omits facts about
whether the utility lines were marked and whether Cascade followed those marks
such that Plaintiff has engaged in artful pleading. (Reply p. 2.) First, this
argument is untimely as it suggests sham pleading. Second, it is improper as it
attempts to insert Cascade’s version of events, which again is improper on a
demurrer. Third, the argument is unpersuasive as the basis for the demurrer
as to the original complaint and the FAC were that insufficient facts were
alleged as to what Cascade did, meaning that Plaintiff could not have omitted
facts in its SAC when they were not even initially provided. 
 


[3] Cascade cites to the
Rutter Group, Civil Procedure Before Trial, Section 7:4.1(a) for its
proposition that a general demurrer is appropriate to “force plaintiff to
clarify particular elements of the cause of action involved, placing defendant
in a better position to satisfy its burden on the summary judgment.” (Reply p.
3:21-26.) However, the facts here are not “vague or ambiguous” to make it
difficult for Cascade to ascertain Plaintiff’s claims.
 


[4] A plaintiff is only required to plead ultimate facts
and need not plead evidentiary facts supporting the allegations of the ultimate
facts. (Birke v. Oakwood Worldwide (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1540,
1548-1549.)
