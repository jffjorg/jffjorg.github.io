And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Cascade's demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth amended complaint, which alleges negligence and other claims against Cascade, Stearns, Conrad and Schmidt, Consulting Engineers, Inc., and Utiliquest, LLC. The plaintiff alleges that Cascade was negligent in its excavation work at or near the plaintiff's electric facilities, causing damage to the facilities. Cascade argues that the complaint does not meet the proper pleading standard and attempts to make factual determinations on a demurrer. The judge has found that the complaint does meet the proper pleading standard and has overruled the demurrer in its entirety. The judge notes that the plaintiff does not need to provide all facts at the pleading stage, only that the ultimate facts are pled to support each claim. The judge has also found that Cascade's arguments about proximate causation and the expiration of the Underground Service Alert ticket are improper and exceed the scope of a demurrer.
