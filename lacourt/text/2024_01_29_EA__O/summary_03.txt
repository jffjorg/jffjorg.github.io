And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by Cascade, the defendant, and has reviewed the arguments presented by both parties. Cascade argues that the plaintiff has engaged in "artful pleading" by omitting facts in the amended complaint (SAC) about whether utility lines were marked and whether Cascade followed those marks. The judge finds this argument to be untimely, improper, and unpersuasive. The judge notes that the demurrer was filed to force the plaintiff to clarify the cause of action, but the facts presented are not vague or ambiguous. The judge references a relevant law from Birke v. Oakwood Worldwide (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1548-1549, which states that a plaintiff is only required to plead ultimate facts and need not plead evidentiary facts supporting those allegations. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the demurrer will be denied.
