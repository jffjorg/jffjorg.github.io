Sachs v. American
Gonzo Food Co., LLC 21SMCV01464
Hearing Date December
5, 2023
Motion for
Approval of PAGA Settlement (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiff Sachs brought
this PAGA action for wage and hour violations, including withholding tips, failing
to pay minimum wage, regular wages and overtime wages, failure to provide meal
and rest breaks, failing to accurately record hours worked, failing to pay all
wages owed at termination and failing to provide accurate wage statements. The
parties executed a settlement agreement on October 6, 2023. 
 
The prevailing
employee in a PAGA action is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
Lab. Code §2699(a). After fees and costs, the remainder of a PAGA award is to
be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the State labor and workforce
development agency, and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees. Lab. Code
§2699(i). A PAGA settlement must be approved by the superior court before it is
effective and submitted to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) at
the same time it is submitted to the court. Lab. Code §2699(l)(2). 
 
While the statute
provides no standard for approval of a PAGA settlement, courts recently held approval
under §2699(l)(2) is appropriate if the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and
adequate.” Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 75-76.
This requires the court to consider any objections filed by the LWDA. Id. pgs.
78-79.  
 
The parties agreed
to a settlement of $57,000, with plaintiff’s counsel to receive 40% of the
gross payment for fees, totaling $22,800, in addition to $1,006 in costs.
$8,950 will be paid to ILYM Group for services as settlement administrator. The
remaining funds are to be split 75/25 as provided in the statute, with
$18,182.70 going to the State and $6,060.90 going to the aggrieved employees,
to be distributed on a pro rata basis based on the number of eligible pay
periods worked by each employee. This distribution complies with the statutory requirements.
 
Sachs must provide
evidence, such as proof of service, that the proposed settlement was submitted
to the LWDA, as required by Lab. Code §2699(l)(2). The settlement cannot be approved
until it has been submitted to the agency. CONTINUED for plaintiff to provide
proof of submission to the LWDA.
