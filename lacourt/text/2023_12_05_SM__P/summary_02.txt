English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a court case between Pourmola and the City of Los Angeles. The case relates to a sewer line overflow that damaged Pourmola's property. The Judge is considering the City's motion for summary judgment on three claims: nuisance, trespass, and negligence/dangerous condition.

The Judge rules in favor of the City on the nuisance claim, finding that Pourmola has not established a triable issue of fact. The Judge also rules that the City is not liable for trespass under California Government Code §815.6, as the statute does not impose a mandatory duty on the City.

However, the Judge denies the City's motion for summary judgment on the negligence/dangerous condition claim, finding that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether the City had adequate notice of a dangerous condition and failed to properly remedy it. The Judge notes that the City was aware of roots in the sewer line that created a risk of overflow prior to the flooding at Pourmola's property, which is sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact.
