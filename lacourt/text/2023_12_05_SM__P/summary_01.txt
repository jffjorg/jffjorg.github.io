And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement between Sachs and American Gonzo Food Co., LLC. The parties executed a settlement agreement on October 6, 2023, for $57,000, with 40% of the gross payment going to plaintiff's counsel for fees, totaling $22,800, and $1,006 in costs. The remaining funds will be distributed 75/25 as required by statute, with $18,182.70 going to the State and $6,060.90 going to the aggrieved employees. The settlement complies with the statutory requirements. However, the court notes that Sachs must provide evidence that the proposed settlement was submitted to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) as required by Labor Code §2699(l)(2). The settlement cannot be approved until it has been submitted to the agency. The court will continue the hearing until Sachs provides proof of submission to the LWDA.
