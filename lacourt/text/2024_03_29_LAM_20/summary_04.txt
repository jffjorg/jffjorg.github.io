And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Roy Lee and RL Films2, Inc., have moved to compel the production of documents from the plaintiffs, John P. Middleton and John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC. The motion is based on the defendants' requests for production of documents, which were served on the plaintiffs. The court has already entered an order related to the discovery of documents, which requires the plaintiffs to produce all documents related to communications and damages by November 27, 2023. The order also states that the plaintiffs will be precluded from introducing any documents that have not been produced to the defendants at trial, with the exception of documents obtained through third parties not in the plaintiffs' control.

The court finds that the parties have already stipulated to evidentiary sanctions, and therefore, there is no need to compel production of the documents. The court denies the motion and declines to award monetary sanctions. The court instructs the moving parties to give notice and encourages counsel to submit their objections electronically rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
