And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) and has denied the motion. PMA argued that it did not owe decedent a duty to train on servicing split rim wheels and tires, and that it only provided general safety training classes to dockworkers. However, the court found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether PMA undertook an obligation to provide training to dockworkers, including decedent. The court also found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether PMA's alleged failure to train decedent was a breach of its duty to train.

The court also denied PMA's motion for summary judgment as to the twenty-second cause of action for loss of consortium, finding that the loss of consortium claim fails because the underlying negligence claims against PMA fail.

The court's denial of PMA's motion for summary judgment is based on the fact that there are triable issues of fact as to whether PMA undertook an obligation to provide training to dockworkers, including decedent, and as to whether PMA's alleged failure to train decedent was a breach of its duty to train.
