And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiff, Dayvonna Smith, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Annalusa Mastoianni-Johnson. The plaintiff's counsel has filed a declaration, but the judge is concerned that the counsel lacks personal knowledge of the facts giving rise to liability, such as the plaintiff's failure to receive rest and meal breaks, unpaid wages, and overtime work without compensation. As a result, the judge is advancing and continuing the OSC (Order to Show Cause) hearing from January 26, 2024, to February 13, 2024. The judge is ordering the plaintiff's counsel to file a declaration from the plaintiff with sufficient information to support the request for entry of default judgment by February 5, 2024. The court clerk will serve this order on the plaintiff's counsel, and no further notice is required.
