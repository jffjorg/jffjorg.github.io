 Case Number:  23STCV27311    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  39 Teresita
Mahayag Teichmann v. Farivar Gouhari, et al., Case No. 23STCV27311
 
The
Court ruled on Defendants’ ex parte application in chambers: 
 
On
January 25, 2024, Defendants filed an ex parte application to shorten time to
hear a motion for a protective order.  Plaintiff’s counsel noticed the
deposition of a third-party, Omid Hashemi, for January 29, 2024. 
Defendants’ counsel asks the Court to hear the motion before this deposition
because Plaintiff’s counsel noticed the deposition for a date when Defendants’
counsel is in trial in San Diego and therefore unavailable.
 
The
ex parte application is denied.  As an initial matter, the Court currently
is in trial in Arturo Garzon v. Completely Concrete Structures, Case Number
20STCV49104 and does not have availability to hear the motion on the morning of
January 29, 2024.  More important, the Court should not have to resolve
routine discovery matters such as this one.  The Court expects the parties
to act in a professional manner and work collaboratively on scheduling
depositions.  The Court orders the parties to review the Los Angeles
County Superior Court’s guidelines on civility, which may be found on the
Court’s website.
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.      
Defendants’ ex parte application is denied.  
 
2.      
The Court advances Defendants’ motion for a protective order from April 4,
2024, to March 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Court will hear the motion at
the case management conference.
 
3.      
Defendants’ counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
