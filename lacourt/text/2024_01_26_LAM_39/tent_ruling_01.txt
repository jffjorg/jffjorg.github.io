Wembe v. Target Stores, et al., Case No. 21STCV35634
 
The
Court ruled on Plaintiff’s ex parte application in chambers:
 
Plaintiff
seeks an order to continue the deposition deadlines of certain witnesses and to
compel Defendant to provide witness contact information for former
employees.  Ex parte applications are reserved for exigent situations, and
the relief sought by Plaintiff is better addressed through a noticed
motion.  Therefore, the Court shall treat Plaintiff’s ex parte application
as a noticed motion, which shall be heard on February 15, 2024, at 8:30
a.m.  The opposition and reply brief shall be due based upon statutory
deadlines.  Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide notice and file proof of
such with the Court.
