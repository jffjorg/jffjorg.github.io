The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the trial date. The court grants the application and vacates the previously scheduled final status conference and trial dates. Instead, the court will hold a trial setting conference on February 5, 2024, to discuss potential new trial dates and whether to adjust the expert and discovery deadlines. The parties are required to be prepared to discuss these issues at the conference, and any disputes will be resolved at that time.
