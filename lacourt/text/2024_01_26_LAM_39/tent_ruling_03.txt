 Case Number:  23STCV01236    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  39 Dayvonna
Smith v. Annalusa Mastoianni-Johnson, et al., Case No. 23STCV01236
 
Plaintiff
has sought entry of a default judgment based solely on the declaration of
counsel, who lacks personal knowledge concerning the facts giving rise to
liability (e.g., Plaintiff’s failure to receive rest and meal breaks, the
amount of Plaintiff’s unpaid wages, Plaintiff having worked six days per week
with overtime each day without receiving appropriate compensation, etc.) 
Therefore, the Court advances and continues the OSC hearing from January 26,
2024, to February 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Court orders Plaintiff’s
counsel to file a declaration from his client with sufficient information to
support the request for entry of default judgment on or before February 5,
2024.  The Court’s clerk shall serve this order upon Plaintiff’s counsel. 
Further notice is not required.
