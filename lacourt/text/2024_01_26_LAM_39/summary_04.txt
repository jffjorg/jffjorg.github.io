And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' ex parte application to shorten the time to hear a motion for a protective order. The defendants had requested to have the motion heard on January 29, 2024, but the judge is unavailable due to being in trial in another case. The judge also expressed its frustration with the dispute over scheduling of depositions and expects the parties to act in a professional manner and work collaboratively on scheduling depositions. The judge has ordered the parties to review the Los Angeles County Superior Court's guidelines on civility and has advanced the defendants' motion for a protective order to March 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., to be heard at the case management conference.
