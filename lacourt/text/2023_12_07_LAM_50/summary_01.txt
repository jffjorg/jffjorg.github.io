Significant Statements:

Based on my review of the record in this case and consultation with prior counsel, at no point did Defendant agree to extend that deadline to any other date, including July 17, 2023, nor did Plaintiff seek an extension of that deadline from the Court." (Ryan Decl., ¶ 3)
* "Plaintiff's Motion is timely as the parties agreed to extend the deadline for filing the instant Motion to July 17, 2023. This agreement was accurately documented by Plaintiff's attorney, Ms. Freeze in her July 9, 2023 email to Defendant's counsel, requesting an extension from July 17 to August 1, 2023." (Reply at p. 3:26-4:2)
* "At no point during that call, or at any other time while I was counsel for Defendant, did I or anyone from my office agree to extend that deadline to any date other than July 7, 2023, including July 17, 2023, nor did Plaintiff seek an extension of that deadline from the Court."
