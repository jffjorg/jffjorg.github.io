significant_statements:
  - "The anti-SLAPP statute is a mechanism through which complaints that arise from the exercise of free speech rights can be evaluated at an early stage of the litigation process and resolved expeditiously."
  - "A tenant's complaint against a landlord filed after the service of a notice of termination and the filing of a complaint for unlawful detainer does not arise from those particular activities if the gravamen of the tenant's complaint challenges the decision to terminate the tenancy or other conduct in connection with the termination apart from the service of a notice of termination or filing of an unlawful detainer complaint."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint is denied, and that the burden does not shift to the plaintiff to establish that there is a probability of prevailing on the claims. The judge also denied the defendants' request for attorney's fees and costs.
