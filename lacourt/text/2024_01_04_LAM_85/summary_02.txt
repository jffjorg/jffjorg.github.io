And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the vaccination policy adopted by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The judge notes that the District's opposition brief exceeded the 15-page limit and had 11-point footnotes that violated the 12-point type requirement. The judge also addresses Knopke's requests for judicial notice, denying three of his requests and granting one. The judge reviews the vaccination policy and determines that it complies with the authorizing law and is a valid condition of employment. The judge also addresses Knopke's arguments related to the Fourth Amendment and public policy, concluding that the District's termination of Knopke's employment was proper. Overall, the judge's ruling suggests that the vaccination policy is valid and that Knopke's termination was justified.
