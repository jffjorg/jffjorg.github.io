Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23STCV24593
* Hearing Date: January 4, 2024
* Department: 85

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Kevin Coronado
* Defendant: Yireh Holdings, Marvin Rodriguez

**Facts**

* Yireh Holdings borrowed $180,000 from Kevin Coronado in December 2021 to purchase two properties.
* The loan was secured by a note and a deed of trust.
* Yireh Holdings has not made any payments on the loan and has sold one of the properties.
* Coronado is seeking a right to attach order to secure the loan.

**Issues**

* Whether Coronado has a claim based on a contract and on which attachment may be based.
* Whether the amount due is fixed and readily ascertainable.
* Whether Coronado has a probability of success on the merits.
* Whether the attachment is sought for a proper purpose.

**Holdings**

* A claim has "probable validity" where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will recover on that claim.
* An attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising from agreement, statute, or other rule of law.
* If the claim was originally so secured but the security has become valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the claim, the amount to be secured by the attachment shall not exceed the lesser of the amount of the decrease or the difference between the value of the security and the amount then owing on the claim.

**Ruling**

* The application for a right to attach order is denied because Coronado's security interest in the Pueblo Property is still in place and the value of the property may exceed the amount owed on the loan.

**Conclusion**

* Coronado has not shown that Yireh Holdings did not sign a deed of trust as required by the note, nor has he shown that such a deed of trust would not sufficiently secure the loan.
* As a result, Coronado has not demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.
* The attachment is not sought for a proper purpose.
