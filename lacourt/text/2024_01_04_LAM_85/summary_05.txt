And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the application for a writ of possession and turnover order in favor of Ally Bank against Ryan Patrick Davis Henderson. The writ is granted because Ally has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the Vehicle, a 2018 Infiniti Q50, and has satisfied the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court has also ordered the defendant to transfer possession of the Vehicle to the plaintiff.

The Vehicle is currently at one of the defendant's addresses, and the levying officer may enter private residences at those addresses to take possession of the Vehicle. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $1,181.48 before the writ is issued.

The court has waived the requirement for the plaintiff to show that the Vehicle is not located at the defendant's addresses, as the plaintiff has presented evidence that the Vehicle is likely to be located at one of those addresses.
