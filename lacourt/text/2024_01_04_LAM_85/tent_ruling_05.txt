 Case Number:  23STLC05084    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ally Bank v. Ryan
Patrick Davis Henderson, 23STLC05084
 
Tentative decision on application
for a writ of possession: granted



 
            
            Plaintiff
Ally Bank (“Ally”) seeks a writ of possession against Defendant Ryan Patrick
Davis Henderson (“Henderson”) to recover a 2018 Infiniti Q50, VIN JN1EV7AP5JM352676
(“Vehicle”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Ally filed the Complaint against Defendant Henderson on July 28, 2023, alleging
(1) claim and delivery and (2) money on a contract.  The Complaint alleges as follows.
            Henderson
entered into a written Contract in which Ally’s assignor would finance the purchase
of the Vehicle, which was collateral.  At
all relevant times, Ally has been the holder of a first priority security
interest in the Vehicle.  The Certificate
of Title from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) reflects
Ally’s interest.  The Contract
gives Ally the right to take and have immediate possession of the
Vehicle after default.  
            Henderson
breached the Contract on October 28, 2022, by failing to make the $418.24 monthly
installment due.  He has since failed to make
the regular monthly payments of $473.39 due thereafter.  The balance due and owing is $21,134.26.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle have
failed.
            Ally
seeks recovery and a pretrial writ of possession for the Vehicle, a temporary
restraining order enjoining Henderson from transferring possession of the
Vehicle, and $21,134.26 in damages less proceeds from Ally’s
resale of the Vehicle.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings 
            On
November 10, 2023, Ally served Henderson with the Complaint, Summons, and
moving papers by substitute service, effective November 20, 2023.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific
description of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the
property according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and
belief.  If the property, or some part of
it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession,
a showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On March 15, 2021, Henderson
and Ally’s assignor, CarMax Auto Superstores California, LLC (“CarMax”),
entered into a written Contract for purchase of the Vehicle.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Henderson would then make 72 installments of $473.39
from April 28, 2021 thereafter.  Singleton
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  In the event of
default for failure to pay, CarMax had the right to assess a 5% late charge if
ten days have passed since a payment’s due date, accelerate the amount owed,
and repossess the Vehicle.  Singleton
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  
            CarMax
also assigned all of its rights under the Contract to Ally.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The Certificate of Title from the DMV
reflects Ally’s interest in the Vehicle as a lienholder.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  
            Henderson
breached the Agreement on October 28, 2022 when he failed to pay $418.24.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  He has since failed to make the regular
monthly payments of $473.39 due thereafter. 
Singleton Decl., ¶6.  As of July
20, 2023, the balance due and owing is $21,134.26.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle have
failed.  Singleton Decl., ¶8.  
            The
J.D. Power report for July 20, 2023 lists the Vehicle’s wholesale value as $17,525
and retail value as $21,725.  Singleton
Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  
            The
Contract lists Henderson’s address as 5655 Heatherdale Dr., Los Angeles, CA
90043.  Singleton Decl., ¶10, Ex. A.  Henderson also lives at 4710 W. 12th St., Los
Angeles, CA 90019.  Singleton Decl.,
¶10.  Ally believes the Vehicle is
currently at one of these addresses.  Singleton
Decl., ¶10.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Ally seeks a writ of possession and turnover order against Henderson for the Vehicle.
 
            1.
Breach of Agreement
            The
Contract required Henderson to make 72 monthly installments of $473.39 for the
Vehicle.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex.
A.  Any late payment would incur a 5%
late charge and entitle the assignor to accelerate the amount owed and
repossess the Vehicle.  Singleton Decl.,
¶5, Ex. A.  CarMax assigned all of its
rights under the Contract to Ally. 
Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The
Certificate of Title from the DMV reflects Ally’s interest in the Vehicle as a
lienholder.  Singleton Decl., ¶5,
Ex. B.  
            In seeking a writ of possession, the supporting declaration
must be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same). 
            Ally
presents conclusory evidence that the balance due is $21,134.26.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  Ally fails to support this conclusion with a
payment history or calculation that these are the amounts owed.  As Henderson has not opposed, the court will
not deny the application for lack of sufficient evidence. 
 
            2.
Undertaking 
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  
            The
Vehicle’s retail value is estimated to be $21,725.  Singleton Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  The balance Henderson owes is $21,134.26.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  Because the difference is $21,725 - $21,134.26
= $590.74, Henderson’s interest in the Vehicle is $590.74.  The undertaking will be $590.74 x 2 = $1,181.48.
 
            3.
Redelivery
            When
an undertaking is required, the defendant may prevent the plaintiff from taking
possession by filing an undertaking in an amount equal to either the amount of
the plaintiff’s undertaking (CCP
§515.020(a)) or the amount determined by the court under CCP section 515.010(b).  The redelivery bond will be the
amount owed of $21,725.
 
            4.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
Contract shows Henderson’s address as 5655 Heatherdale Dr., Los Angeles, CA
90043.  Singleton Decl., ¶10, Ex. A.  This is a probable location of the Vehicle
and Ally can obtain a writ to enter a private residence at this address.  
            Ally
also asserts Henderson lives at 4710 W. 12th St., Los Angeles, CA 90019, and
the Vehicle may be there.  Singleton
Decl., ¶10.  The Contract does not list
this address, and Ally fails to provide documents to support this evidence.  Singleton Decl., Ex. A.  Because no opposition is on file, this defect
is waived.   
 
            5.
Turnover Order
            The
court may issue a turnover order directing the defendant to transfer possession
of the property to the plaintiff (See
Mandatory Form CD-120).  The order must
notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject him or her to contempt
of court.  CCP §512.070.  The turnover remedy is not issued in lieu of
a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff with a less expensive
means of obtaining possession.  See Edwards, supra, 230
Cal.App.3d at 178.  
            Ally
requests a turnover order compelling Henderson to transfer possession of the
Vehicle.  Mem. at 3.  The request for a turnover order is granted.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle is
granted.  Ally has not filed a proposed order
for writ of possession and must do so within two court days of this hearing on
the proper Judicial Council form or it will be waived.  No writ shall issue until Ally posts a $1,181.48
undertaking.  The redelivery bond shall
be the amount owed of $21,725.  The
levying officer may enter private residences at 4710 W. 12th St., Los Angeles,
CA 90019, and 5655 Heatherdale Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90043.  The officer may also enter any commercial or
public address.
