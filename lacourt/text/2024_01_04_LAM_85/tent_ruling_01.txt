  Case Number:  22STCP04432    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  85 
Jason Knopke v. Commission on Professional
Competence, 
22STCP04432

Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate: denied




 
            
            Petitioner Jason Knopke (“Knopke”) seeks
a writ of mandate compelling Respondent Commission on Professional
Competence (“CPC”) to reverse its decision affirming Real
Party-in-Interest Los Angeles Unified School District’s (“LAUSD” or “District”)
termination of his employment.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,[1]
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
Knopke filed the Petition against the CPC on December 6, 2022.  The operative pleading is the Second Amended
Petition (“SAP”), alleging administrative mandamus.  Knopke filed an initial version of the SAP on
May 18, 2023, and an “operative” version on June 14, 2023.  The SAP alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Knopke
was an LAUSD music teacher at Peary Middle School (“Peary”).  On August 13, 2021, LAUSD employees Ileana M.
Dávalos (“Dávalos”), Kristen Murphy (“Murphy”), and Karla Gould (“Gould”) distributed
an Interoffice Memo (“Memo”) to LAUSD employees with the subject line “COVID-19
Vaccination Requirement for Employees and Other Adults Working at District
Facilities.”  The Memo included a requirement
requiring all employees to vaccinate for COVID-19 by October 15, 2021 unless
they obtained a medical or religious accommodation, both of which were subject
to conditions.  
            The
vaccination policy was unofficial and LAUSD’s Board of Education (“Board”) never
adopted it through resolution as required by Education Code[2] section
35160.  
            Knopke
notified LAUSD that the vaccination policy violated his constitutional rights.  He also asserted that he had a right to
refuse vaccination based on the Protection of Human Subjects in Medical
Experimentation Act (“Protection Act”) (Health & Safety Code (“H&S
Code”) section 24170 et. seq.), which makes it unlawful to pressure an
individual to take part in a human medical experiment.  All medical procedures and treatments are
“human medical experiments” designated by the formula “N-1” (a single subject).  
            LAUSD
granted Knopke a religious accommodation and offered four alternatives.  Three required him to either go on leave or
resign, which were not valid accommodations. 
The fourth was to teach subjects outside his credential area via an
online independent studies program at City of City of Angels.  Because Knopke did not have the necessary
credentials, this assignment would violate the Education Code.  He also knew it would short-change the
students taking the advanced classes that the District would make him teach.
            LAUSD
dismissed Knopke from his employment for refusal to either vaccinate or accept
the accommodation.  The District’s First
Amended Accusation listed the causes of dismissal as evident unfitness for
service under section 44932(a)(6), persistent violation of, or refusal to obey,
the school laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the
government of the public schools under section 44932(a)(8), and willful refusal
to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause under section 44939.  
Knopke timely requested a hearing.  The Board never officially adopted the vaccination
policy, and it is null and void.  However,
Knopke’s union-appointed lawyer threatened to withdraw as counsel rather than
raise this argument or invoke the Protection Act.  Knopke raised these arguments in his written
objections to his dismissal.
LAUSD never presented any evidence at the hearing that it
obtained a short-term waiver pursuant to section 44225(m)(1), or other waiver
under 5 CCR section 80120, that would allow Knopke to lawfully teach outside
his credential’s authorization.  
After the hearing, the CPC affirmed LAUSD’s decision to
terminate Knopke’s employment for failure to comply with the vaccination policy.  
             Knopke seeks mandamus directing the CPC to
reverse its decision and order LAUSD to reinstate Knopke to his prior position
and make him whole, including attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            No
proof of service is on file for the Petition or FAP.
            On
February 7, 2023, the CPC filed notice that it will not be an active
participant in the proceeding unless the court so orders or a party requests an
award of attorney’s fees or costs against it.
            On
April 12, 2023, Knopke served LAUSD with the SAP.
            On
April 13, 2023, the court sustained LAUSD’s demurrer to the FAP with leave to
amend.
            On
May 18, 2023, Knopke filed the SAP.
            On
June 14, 2023, Knopke filed the operative SAP.
            On
July 14, 2023, LAUSD filed and served its Answer to the SAP.
 
            B.
Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974)
11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  The decision
reached in a dismissal or suspension proceeding initiated pursuant to section
44934 or 44934.1 may, on petition of either the governing board or the
employee, be reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the same manner
as a decision made by a hearing officer under Chapter 5 (commencing with
Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.   §44945.
            CCP section 1094.5 does not in its
face specify which cases are subject to independent review, leaving that issue
to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of City
of Angels, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811. 
In cases reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right
the trial court exercises independent judgment on the evidence. Bixby v.
Pierno, (“Bixby”) (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143; see CCP §1094.5(c).  Courts
apply independent judgment in reviewing administrative decisions in teacher
dismissal matters.  §44945; Pittsburg
Unified School Dist. v. Commission on Professional Competence, (1983) 146
Cal.App.3d 964, 976. 
            Under the independent judgment standard,
“the trial court not only examines the administrative record for errors of law
but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a
limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143. 
The court must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and
make its own credibility determinations. 
Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of
Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868.  In short, the court substitutes its judgment
for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when, why, and the
credibility of witnesses.  Guymon v.
Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
            “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with the
agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51;
Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            The
agency’s decision must be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at
the hearing.  Board of Medical Quality
Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga, supra, 11
Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  Implicit in CCP section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the
analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 115.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative
decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691. 
            
            C.
Governing Law[3]
            1. U.S. Constitution
            The
right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects
against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.  U.S. Const., Amend. IV.  No warrants shall issue but upon probable
cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.  Id.
            The
enumeration of certain rights in the United States Constitution shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.  U.S. Const., Amend. IX.  
The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states or
to the people.  U.S. Const., Amend.
X.  
            No
state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States, or deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law.  U.S. Const., Amend. XIV.  No state shall deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 
Id.
 
            2.
Board Authority
            The
governing board of any school district may initiate and carry on any program or
activity, or may otherwise act in any manner, which is not in conflict with, inconsistent
with, or preempted by any law and which is not in conflict with the purposes
for which school districts are established. 
§35160.
 
            3.
Teacher Credentials
            Authorization
for teaching credentials is of four basic kinds.  “Single subject instruction” means the
practice of assignment of teachers and students to specified subject matter
courses.  §44256(a)(1).  The holder of such credentials may have a
subject appear on the credential as an authorization to teach this subject after
20 semester hours of coursework or ten semester hours of upper division or
graduate coursework approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (“CTC”)
at a regionally accredited institution of higher education.  Id. 

The CTC may establish and implement alternative requirements
for additional authorizations to the single subject credential on the basis of
specialized needs.  Id.  A special secondary teaching credential means
one issued on the basis of at least a baccalaureate degree, a student teaching
requirement, and 24 semester units of coursework in the subject specialty of
the credential.  Id.
            A
valid teaching credential issued by the State Board of Education (“State
Board”) or the CTC, based on a bachelor’s degree, student teaching, and special
fitness to perform, shall be deemed qualifying for assignment as a teacher in, inter
alia, necessary small high schools, alternative schools, and independent
study.  §44865(d), (f), (k).  The assignment of a teacher to such a
position shall be made only with the consent of the teacher.  §44865.
 
            4. Independent Study
            Independent study courses are taught
under the general supervision of certificated employees who hold the
appropriate subject matter credentials pursuant to Section 44300, 44865, or 47605(l).  §51749.5(a)(3).  They are to be annually certified by local
educational agency governing board or body resolution to be of the same rigor,
educational quality, and intellectual challenge substantially equivalent to
in-person instruction and equivalent classroom-based courses, and shall be
aligned to all relevant local and state content standards.  §51749.5(a)(4)(A).
 
            5.
The Protection Act
            The
Protection Act (H&S Code section 24170 et. seq.) reflects the
legislative finding that although medical experimentation on human subjects is
vital for the benefit of mankind, such experimentation shall be undertaken with
due respect to the preciousness of human life and the right of individuals to
determine what is done to their own bodies. 
H&S Code §24171.  
            A
“medical experiment” includes (a) severance, penetration, or damaging of
tissues of a human subject or the use of a drug or device, electromagnetic
radiation, heat or cold, or a biological substance or organism, in or upon a
human subject in the practice or research of medicine in a manner not
reasonably related to maintaining or improving the health of the subject or
otherwise directly benefiting the subject; (b) investigational use of a drug or
device as defined in H&S Code sections 111590 and 111595; and (c) withholding
medical treatment for any purpose other than maintenance or improvement of the
health of the subject.  H&S Code §24174.
            The
Nuremberg Code of Ethics in Medical Research was developed after the trial of
Nazi war criminals for unethical use of persons in medical experiments.  H&S Code §24171(a).  The Declaration of Helsinki then established
recommendations guiding doctors in experimentation involving human subjects.  Id. 
However, neither was codified by law and are not enforceable.  H&S Code §24171(b).  Because medical experimentation must be done
in such a way as to protect the rights of the human subjects involved, the Legislature
intends to provide minimum statutory protection with regard to human
experimentation and provide penalties for those who violate such provisions.  H&S Code §24171(c).
            An
experimental subject’s bill of rights is a list of the rights of a subject in a
medical experiment, written in a language in which the subject is fluent.  H&S Code §24172.  This includes instruction that consent to
participate in the medical experiment may be withdrawn at any time, and the
subject may discontinue participation in the medical experiment without
prejudice.  H&S Code §24172(h).  The subject must then have the opportunity to
decide to consent or not to consent to a medical experiment without the
intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, coercion, or undue
influence on the subject’s decision. 
H&S Code §24172(j).
 
6. Teacher Dismissal 
            In
a permanent teacher dismissal, a school district must establish (1) that the
individual charge is sustained by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) that if
the charge is sustained, it related to a specific cause as set forth under
section 44932; and (3) after determining which charges and causes have been
proved, whether it renders the teacher “unfit to teach” so as to merit
dismissal.  California Teachers’ Assn.
v. State of California, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 327; Morrison v. State Board
of Education, (“Morrison”) (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 220.
A permanent employee shall not be dismissed except for, inter alia: evident unfitness for
service and persistent violation of or refusal to obey rules.  §44932(a)(6), (8).  
            
            a. Evident Unfitness for Service
            Evident unfitness for service under section
44932(a)(6) means “clearly not fit, not adapted to or unsuitable for teaching,
ordinarily by reason of temperamental defects or inadequacies.’”  Woodland Joint Unified School District v.
Comm’n on Prof. Comp., (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1444.  Conduct constituting evident unfitness for
service will often constitute unprofessional conduct.  Id. at 1445.  
 



            b.
Persistent Violation of Rules
            Pursuant to section 44932(a)(8), a
permanent teacher is subject to dismissal for “[p]ersistent violation of or
refusal to obey the school laws of the state or reasonable regulations
prescribed for the government of the public schools by the State Board or by
the governing board of the school district employing him or her.”  The violation must be persistent or
“motivated by an attitude of continuous subordination.”  Governing Board of the Oakdale Union
School District v. Seaman, (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77, 81-82.  Cause for discipline may be based on the
violation of school rules, including those requiring the timely submission of
lesson plans and policies against excessive absenteeism.  San Dieguito Union High School District v.
Commission on Professional Competence, (“San Dieguito”) (1982) 135
Cal.App.3d 288, 287-88.  
                        
            c. Unfit to Teach        
A finding of misconduct is not alone enough to dismiss; that
misconduct also must render the teacher unfit to teach.  San Dieguito, supra, 135
Cal.App.3d at 284-85.  The conclusion of
unfitness must be based upon an objective standard as articulated in Morrison.  Ibid. 
            In
Morrison, the California Supreme Court articulated factors to consider
in whether a credentialed employee’s misconduct renders him unfit for service
as a teacher.  Those factors are: (a)
likelihood that the conduct at issue may have adversely affected
students/fellow teachers; (b) degree of such adversity anticipated; (c)
proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct; (d) type of teaching
certificate held by the party involved; (e) extenuating or aggravating
circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct; (f) likelihood of recurrence of
the questioned conduct; (g) praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of motives
resulting in the conduct; (h) extent to which disciplinary action may inflict
an adverse impact or chilling effect upon constitutional rights of the teacher
involved or other teachers.  Id.
at 229-30.  Not every Morrison
factor must be considered; a trier of fact may consider all of the factors that
are relevant to the respective case.  Ibid.;
West Valley-Mission College v. Concepcion, (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1766.
 
d. Suspension
Upon the filing of written
charges in proceedings initiated under section 44934, if they charge a
permanent employee of the school district with, inter alia, willful
refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed
by reasonable rules and regulations of the employing school district, the
governing board of the school district may, if it deems that action necessary,
immediately suspend the employee from his or her duties.  §§ 44939(a)-(b).  It shall then give notice to him or her of
his or her suspension, and that 30 days after service of the notice of
dismissal, he or she will be dismissed, unless he or she demands a hearing.
§44939(b).
 
D. Statement
of Facts
            1.
Background
            Knopke
possesses a clear subject teaching credential in music and an administrative
services credential.  AR 628, 727.  Knopke began work as a music teacher at Peary
in 2007.  AR 727.  He received a rating of “Meets Standard
Performance” on every evaluation from 2007 to 2020.  AR 767-68, 773-74, 776-77, 779-80, 783-84,
801.
            Knopke
taught his music class remotely while LAUSD was shut down during the COVID-19
pandemic from March 2020 through February or March 2021.  AR 727.  He then returned to in-person teaching from
March through August 2021.  AR 727.
 
            2.
The August 13, 2021 Memo 
            On
August 13, 2021, LAUSD issued the Memo to all its employees.  AR 522. 
The Memo stated that, as part of efforts to provide the safest possible
environment in which to learn and work, all LAUSD employees would be required to
be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by October 15, 2021.  AR 522. 
The vaccination requirement was a condition of continued employment.  AR 522.
            The Memo outlined a process
for an employee to seek accommodation of a medical disability or sincerely held
religious belief.  AR 522, 526.  The Memo attached an application for reasonable
accommodation from the District COVID-19 Vaccine Policy.  AR 528. 
After an employee filed the application, LAUSD would determine if the employee
could not be vaccinated due to disability or a sincerely held religious belief.  AR 526. 
If so, it would determine whether it could provide an accommodation so that
the unvaccinated employee would not pose a danger to the
health and safety of others at the employee’s worksite.  AR 526. 
The accommodation process would determine if the employee could still
perform the essential functions of that position.   AR
526.  Because essential
functions vary by job class, the process would be case-by-case and may result
in different results for different employees. 
AR 526.  
If workplace accommodations could not reduce
the risk the employee posed to acceptable levels, LAUSD could exclude the
employee from physically entering the workplace. 
AR 526.  LAUSD
and employee would then determine if there were any available benefit time or leave
provisions.  AR 526.  An employee’s failure to comply with the
vaccination requirement or provide the appropriate qualifying accommodation documentation
could result in disciplinary action, placement on unpaid leave, or separation from
service.  AR 526.
            On
August 26 and 27, 2021, LAUSD sent all employees notice of the vaccination
requirement through Blackboard Connect (“Blackboard”), which is its internal electronic
message system.  AR 529-30.
 
            3.
The Reminders
            On
September 8, 2021, the District reminded, via Blackboard, those employees who had
not yet provided proof of vaccination that they must receive the final vaccine
by October 1 to be fully vaccinated by the deadline of October 15, 2021.  AR 531-32.  All employees and non-employee adults
providing services at District facilities must be fully vaccinated by the
deadline.  AR 532.  In a section entitled Reasonable
Accommodations, the reminder identified full vaccination as an “essential job
function” from which no one was exempt. 
AR 532.  Failure to provide
documentation of the vaccination by then could result in disciplinary action, placement
on unpaid leave, and/or separation from service.  AR 533.
            The
September 8 message reiterated that, where feasible, LAUSD would reasonably
accommodate employees who wish to continue working without full vaccination due
to a documented disability or sincerely held religious belief.  AR 532. 
Such accommodations would not include working at the facility without
full vaccination.  AR 532.  LAUSD would engage in the interactive process
to determine if it could accommodate the employee.  AR 532. 

            LAUSD
acknowledged that, although rare, some positions avail themselves of the
ability to remote work as a reasonable accommodation.  AR 532. 
The interactive process would consider the availability and feasibility
of remote work, but LAUSD would not offer it if the position’s essential duties
require physical presence at a facility. 
AR 532.  If a workplace
accommodation could not reduce the risk to health and safety to an acceptable
level, the employee could be excluded from physically entering the workplace.  AR 532.
            On
September 15, 2021, LAUSD sent employees another reminder of the vaccination
requirement via Blackboard.  AR 533-35.  The reminder set a September 24, 2021
deadline to apply for an accommodation. 
AR 534.  It stated that no one is
exempt from the vaccination requirement, and while LAUSD would reasonably
accommodate employees with a documented disability or sincerely held religious
belief, that would not include permission to continue to work at a District
facility without full vaccination.  AR
535.  The reminder outlined a remote work
option with LAUSD’s online independent study program through City of Angels.  AR 535. 
Even if a teacher who was not fully vaccinated by the deadline received
a reasonable accommodation, the teacher would not be allowed to teach at any
site other than City of Angels.  AR 535.
            The September 15
email reiterated that if an alternative accommodation was not available, LAUSD
and the employee at issue would determine if there are any available benefit
time/leave provisions, such as use of the employee’s personal necessity,
vacation, or unpaid leave.  AR 535.  This would also include illness leave if the
accommodation request was due to medical reasons.  AR 535.
            Between September
and October 2021, LAUSD issued five more reminders with language identical to
the September 15 message.  AR 541-42,
547, 551-52, 554-56, 558-60.
 
            4.
Knopke’s Application
            In
August 2021, Knopke applied for accommodation based on a sincerely held religious
belief.  AR 606.  In an accompanying letter, Knopke argued that
use of a vaccine that could damage his body more than COVID-19 itself was antithetical
to his faith.  AR 607.  
            Knopke
also noted his whole family contracted COVID-19 but has since fully
recovered.  AR 608.  His natural immunity from the infection made
him an asset to LAUSD because he was not afraid to come in to work like some of
his colleagues.  AR 608.  Knopke included a note from his doctor confirming
that Knopke had been infected but has since recovered.  AR 609. 
            On
August 28, 2021, Knopke emailed LAUSD a letter from his pastor stating that Knopke’s
religious convictions were sincere.  AR
611-12.
            On
September 19, 2021, Naomi Suenaka (“Suenaka”) emailed Knopke on behalf of the Sincerely
Held Religious Belief Committee, approving his accommodation request pending an
available position in City of Angels for the 2021-2022 school year.  AR 613. 
Suenaka informed Knopke that Human Resources would contact him directly for
a City of Angels assignment.  AR
613.  If no positions were available by
October 15, Knopke could use any applicable benefit time to ensure his
payment.  AR 613.
            On
September 21, 2021, Knopke emailed LAUSD to ask for information on next
steps.  AR 617.  He also asked LAUSD to confirm that the
reasonable accommodation was a position with City of Angels and that he could
not enter a “district facility.”  AR 617.  Three days later, Knopke emailed his school principal,
Christina Green (“Green”), and asked her to meet about the next step in the
accommodation process.  AR 618.  
            Knopke also emailed
LAUSD Director of Arts Education Steven J. McCarthy (“McCarthy”) and noted that
there was no guarantee that City of Angels would retain him as one of its
teachers.  AR 620-21.  He asked if City of Angels planned to hire a Visual
and Performing Arts (“VAPA”) Coordinator to oversee the various VAPA teachers
it would receive.  AR 621.  McCarthy replied that City of Angels did not
plan to hire a VAPA Coordinator, adding that all City of Angels teachers teach
many subjects, and that Knopke should remember that this would be temporary due
to the pandemic.  AR 620.
            On
September 27 and 28, 2021, Knopke emailed LAUSD to again ask about the next
step in the reasonable accommodation process. 
AR 622-23.  On September 28, Michelle
Palomares responded on behalf of Organizational Effectiveness Director Maria
Sotomayor (“Sotomayor”).  AR 624.  She informed Knopke that a position at City
of Angels was available for him from October 5, 2021.  AR 624. 
If Knopke accepted the position, he should inform his principal and fill
out the Google form linked in the email. 
AR 624.  He would then receive
additional information about his assignment which would be in effect for the
remainder of the school year.  AR
624.  The email warned Knopke that he
would have to fully vaccinate by October 15 if he refused the assignment and
chose to stay at his current worksite. 
AR 624.
            On
October 11, 2021, Knopke notified his union representative Woodrow Curry
(“Curry”) that he would not accept the accommodation.  AR 625. 
Instead of working at City of Angels, he would exhaust his full sick
days and half days of leave.  AR 625.
 
            4.
The NOUA and Suspension
            On October 20, 2021,
District Administrator Jose Posada (“Posada”) and District Field Director
Jeanette Stevens (“Stevens”) met with Knopke and union representative Curry.  See AR 730.  Knopke received a Notice of Unsatisfactory
Act (“NOUA”) for evident unfitness for service under section 44932(a)(6),
unprofessional conduct under section 44932(a)(2), a physical or mental
condition rendering him unfit to instruct or associate with children under
section 44932(a)(7), willful refusal to perform regular assignments without
reasonable cause under section 44939, and persistent violation of or refusal to
obey the school laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed by the State
Board or the Board under section 44932(a)(8). 
AR 499-500.  The regulations at
issue included the Employee Code of Ethics, the LAUSD Human Resources Class
Description for a Secondary Teacher, and the August 13, 2021 Memo.  AR 500. 
            Based on these
violations, a LAUSD administrator recommended a 15-day suspension and dismissal
from LAUSD service.  AR 499.  Posada and Stevens issued a Notice of
Suspension (“NOS”) for 15 days based on the same allegations.  AR 505-06.
            Knopke later asserted
that he believed this meeting was a part of an interactive process to identify
a reasonable accommodation other than at City of Angels.  See AR 731.  He told Posada and Stevens during this
meeting that he had recovered from COVID-19 and was willing to test twice a
week if he could teach on campus.  See
AR 731.  Posada responded “thank you
but we are not doctors.”  See AR
731.
            Knopke also told
Posada and Stevens that he would be teaching outside of his credentials if he accepted
the position at City of Angels.  See AR
731.  City of Angels’ teachers teach
multiple subjects, but Knopke only held a single subject credential in music.  See AR 731.  Knopke later testified this caught Stevens
off-guard, but Stevens then reassured Knopke that his credential would allow
him to teach at City of Angels.  See AR
731.  Curry advised Knopke to contact
LAUSD Administrator Michael Thompson (“Thompson”) with questions about teaching
outside of his credentials.  See AR
731.  
            After the meeting,
Stevens sent Knopke copies of the NOUA and NOS and asked him to acknowledge
receipt.  AR 491-92.  Knopke replied that he understood those
documents to be LAUSD’s position and he was signing them without waiving his
right to seek religious exemption and accommodation, or to seek legal redress
for wrongful denial thereof.  AR 491.
            On October 21, 2021,
Knopke emailed Stevens that he would not sign the NOS until the LAUSD removed “libelous
errors” from the causes of action which were professionally and personally
inaccurate.  AR 489.  LAUSD was “bearing false witness” against him
in violation of “God’s 9th Commandment.” 
AR 489.  In support of his suggestion
that he stay at Peary and test for COVID-19 twice a week, Knopke argued there
was no difference between vaccination and natural immunity from a previous
infection.  AR 490.  He sent links to four of 15 studies Daniel
Horrowitz cited in a Blaze.com article to show that natural immunity is more
robust than immunity via vaccination.  AR
489.
 
            5. Post-Suspension
Communications
            Also on October 21,
2021, Knopke attempted to email Thompson to ask what subject area he would
teach if he accepted the City of Angels position.  AR 493-94. 
He relayed assertions from City of Angels teachers that they must teach
various subjects no matter what their credential area is.  AR 493-94. 
Knopke never received a response after the email was forwarded to the
correct Michael Thompson.  AR 493.
            On October 26, 2021,
Knopke emailed Lisa Fassett (“Fassett”) of the California Department of
Education (“DOE”) to ask three questions. 
AR 626-627.  He first asked Fassett
to confirm whether he needed to have credentials to teach specific subjects in
a K-12 public school.  AR 627.  He then asked if the subject matter
competence requirement prohibits him from teaching subjects like Math, English,
Science, History, or P.E. until he receives supplementary subject area
authorization.  AR 627.  Finally, he asked in what other scenario could
he legally teach those subjects.  AR 627.
            In response, Fassett
confirmed that the Every Student Succeeds Act requires teachers to be fully
credentialed in the subject and grade level they are going to teach.  AR 626. 
Fassett also confirmed Knopke’s understanding of supplemental
authorizations requirements.  AR 626.  However, when there is a shortage of teachers
in certain subject areas, the Local Education Agency may have a teacher with a
special permit or temporary certificate teach those classes.  AR 626. 
Fassett advised Knopke to contact LAUSD for more information.  AR 626.
 
            6. The Dismissal
            On November 2, 2021,
LAUSD notified Knopke of a virtual meeting on November 9 to discuss his possible
dismissal and immediate suspension.  AR
484.  This would be Knopke’s opportunity
to explain why he should not be suspended immediately and dismissed 30 days
later based on the charges in the NOUA. 
AR 484.  Knopke could also submit
a written response.  AR 484.
            After the meeting,
an LAUSD administrator would recommend whether the Board should proceed with
the recommended dismissal.  AR 484.  If it did, the dismissal would take effect
after 30 days’ written notice unless Knopke exercised his rights under section
44939.  AR 484.  Knopke would also be suspended without pay
until one of those two things occurred. 
AR 484.  
            Knopke, Stevens,
Knopke’s union representative Jill Marucut, and LAUSD administrator Carlen
Powell (“Powell”) attended the meeting on November 9, 2021.  AR 
734.  In an email to Powell later
that day, Knopke acknowledged Stevens’ assertion at the meeting that Knopke
would be credentialed for his teaching assignment at City of Angels if he
accepted it.  AR 487.  Although Knopke believed her, Knopke believed
that this statement contradicted readily available information on the CTC
website.  AR 487. 
            Knopke again
asserted that the charges against him were “libelous.”  AR 487. 
Because all currently available vaccines were still under Emergency Use
Authorization, a mandate requiring the use of those vaccines was illegal.  AR 487. 
Imposing disciplinary action based on an illegal mandate was unlawful.  AR 487.
            He argued that LAUSD
does not have a right to treat students, faculty and employees differently
based on vaccination status.  AR
487.  It discriminated against employees
with sincerely held religious beliefs when it segregated them to City of Angels
for the rest of the school year.  AR
487.   That assignment was not a
reasonable accommodation.  AR 487.
            Finally, Knopke
argued that a vaccination mandate violates H&S Code section 24172(j)’s
prohibition on medical experimentation without consent free from force, fraud,
deceit, duress, coercion, or undue influence. 
AR 487.
            On November 15,
2021, Powell notified Knopke that he would recommend that the Board dismiss
Knopke from District employment.  AR 495-96.
 
            On November 23,
2021, LAUSD Chief of Employee Support and Labor Relations filed a Statement of
Charges against Knopke.  AR 288,
296.  The Statement of Charges requested
Knopke’s continued suspension without pay and dismissal based on evident
unfitness for service under section 44932(a)(6), a physical or mental condition
rendering him unfit to instruct or associate with children under section 44932(a)(7),
persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the state or
reasonable regulations prescribed by the State Board or the Board under section
44932(a)(8), and willful refusal to perform regular assignments without
reasonable cause under section 44939.  AR
288.
            On December 7, 2021,
the Board informed Knopke that it had decided at a closed meeting that day to
terminate his employment.  AR 297.  The termination would take effect 30 days
after service of the notice unless he demanded a hearing pursuant to sections 44930
through 44988.  AR 297.
 
            7. The Administrative
Hearing
            On December 15,
2021, Knopke requested a hearing to contest the Statement of Charges.  AR 345. 

            On March 3, 2022, LAUSD
filed and served the First Amended Accusation (“FAA”), which removed the cause
of action based on a physical or mental condition rendering Knopke unfit to instruct
or associate with children under section 44932(a)(7).  AR 438-39.
            The CPC heard the
matter on June 1 and 2, 2022.  AR
719.  The pertinent testimony is from LAUSD
Assistant Chief Human Resources Officer Gifty Beets (“Beets”).  AR 808-09. 
Beets’ duties include managing all LAUSD discipline.  AR 810. 
She has a staff of human resources representatives and field directors
for this purpose.  AR 810.  She also provides contractual guidance to
implement collective bargaining agreements, develop and create policy, and
provide guidance, information, and support to senior leaders as they do the
same.  AR 810-11.
            The vaccination policy
came from Murphy, Chief Human Resources Officer Dávalos, and Personnel
Commission Director Gould.  AR 815.  Its purpose was to inform employees of what
they needed to do to comply with the vaccination policy or request accommodation.  AR 815.
            Beets testified that if Knopke had
accepted the offered position at City of Angels, he would have been
credentialed to teach it.  AR 825-26.  Teachers with valid teaching credentials can
teach at City of Angels because they have teaching flexibility and LAUSD
provides the professional development necessary to prepare those teachers for
their assignment at City of Angels.  AR
826.  Beets disagreed with Knopke’s
assertion that this contradicted the CTC website.  AR 826. 
LAUSD can allow teachers to be the supporting teacher on record for City
of Angels’ independent study program.  AR
826-27.
            Beets did not know
if City of Angels offered music classes. 
AR 831.  LAUSD did not consider
allowing Knopke to virtually teach music as an accommodation.  AR 832-33. 
Because students were no longer remote, all teacher assignments at physical
schools were in-person.  AR 832.          
LAUSD has a reasonable accommodation appeal committee.  AR 852. 
If LAUSD determines it cannot accommodate an employee, the employee may
request appeal committee review.  AR
852.  The interactive process includes a
chance to explain to the appeal committee why the employee’s disability or
religious beliefs would prevent them from working at an LAUSD facility.  AR 852. 
Although LAUSD approved an accommodation, Knopke could have discussed
other options with the appeal committee after he rejected the offered accommodation,
and they would have continued the interactive process.  AR 852-53. 
Beets did not know if anyone told Knopke about this option.  AR 853.
 
            8. Decision
            On September 7,
2022, the CPC issued a decision upholding the termination of Knopke’s
employment with LAUSD.  AR 719-62.
            
            a. Factual
Findings
            On August 13, 2021, LAUSD
issued the COVID-19 vaccination policy to all employees.  AR 722. 
The vaccination policy stated that all employees must be fully
vaccinated by October 15, 2021.  The
policy allowed employees to seek a reasonable accommodation based on a
disability or sincerely held religious belief. 
AR 723.  It warned that failure to
comply may result in disciplinary action, placement on leave, or
termination.  AR 724.  LAUSD sent copies of the vaccination policy
through Blackboard on August 26 and 27, 2021. 
AR 724.  
            A September 8
message clarified that no one would be exempt from the vaccination requirement.  AR 724. 
Every employee and non-employee adult providing services at LAUSD
facilities must be fully vaccinated by the October 15 deadline.  AR 724. 
Permissible accommodation would not include working at any LAUSD
facility without full vaccination.  AR
724-25.  If a workplace accommodation
could not reduce the risk to others’ health and safety to an acceptable level,
the employee could be excluded from physically entering the workplace.  AR 725. 
A September 15, 2021 Blackboard message added that teachers who requests
accommodation may receive an assignment at City of Angels, the District’s
online independent study program.  AR
725-26.
            By October 11, 2021,
Knopke chose to decline the City of Angels assignment offered by the District as
an accommodation.  AR 730.  Based on a conversation with Principal Green
earlier that month, Knopke believed that he could use his sick days for leave.  AR 730. 
However, the vaccination policy stated that LAUSD and the employee collectively
would determine what benefit time/leave provisions were available, such as use
of “the employee’s illness leave (if due to medical reasons)”.  AR 730. 
The use of illness leave was only an option when the employee applied
for a medical condition accommodation. 
AR 730.  At a second meeting in
October, Principal Green told Knopke that he could only use personal necessity
days, not sick days, to cover any leave. 
AR 730.
            By October 15, 2021,
Knopke had refused the City of Angels assignment and was still
unvaccinated.  AR 730.  The vaccination policy therefore prohibited
him from working at a District facility. 
AR 730.
            At the appeal hearing,
Beets testified that LAUSD developed the vaccination policy based on guidance
from physicians, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”),
California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”), and the Los Angeles County
Department of Health (“LACDH”).  AR
735-36.  Its purpose was to maintain
in-person schooling, ensure the safety of students and teachers, and minimize
the circulation of the COVID-19 virus. 
AR 736.  LAUSD did not expect
those with sincerely held religious beliefs to vaccinate, but the vaccination policy
did not allow any unvaccinated employees to work at a LAUSD facility.  AR 736.
            Beets also testified
that any teacher with a valid credential may teach at City of Angels without
violating the CTC’s credentialing rules. 
AR 736.  City of Angels is LAUSD’s
100% online independent studies program. 
AR 736.  LAUSD provides professional
development so that teachers assigned to City of Angels can learn how to conduct
the independent study program.  AR
736.  Employees who were not offered a City
of Angels assignment were offered use of unpaid leave.  AR 736. 

            LAUSD did not
consider allowing Knopke to teach his music class virtually.  AR 736-37. 
Peary students had returned to campus to receive in-person instruction.  AR 737. 
The reassignment to City of Angels was voluntary, but Knopke violated
the vaccination policy when he rejected it and demanded to work at a LAUSD
facility unvaccinated.  AR 737.
            Knopke testified that
LAUSD’s interactive process for finding a reasonable accommodation felt more
akin to a “my way or the highway” approach. 
AR 738.  He would have been
amenable to a City of Angels teaching position if he could have taught just music
classes.  AR 738.  He believed that teaching multiple subjects
would be unethical and cheat his students. 
AR 738.  
            Knopke testified that
he relied on Fassett’s email when he formed the belief that his credential
would not allow him to teach multiple subjects at City of Angels.  AR 738. 
When cross-examined, he admitted that the email did not reference any
credentialing problems that would arise if he taught at City of Angels.  AR 738. 
He also did not present any evidence to show he would have been teaching
outside of his credentials if he accepted the City of Angels assignment.  AR 738.
 
            (1). Policy
Violation
            Knopke was approved
for a reasonable accommodation based on sincerely held religious beliefs.  AR 739. 
When Sotomayor offered him the City of Angels assignment on September
28, 2021, she emphasized that Knopke must vaccinate by October 15 if he refused
the accommodation.  AR 739.  Knopke testified that he understood unvaccinated
employees could not work at Peary or other facilities after October 15.  AR 739. 
He knew or should have known his offer to take COVID-19 tests twice a
week violated the vaccination policy.  AR
739.
            Knopke sought an
appointment as City of Angels’ VAPA Coordinator but learned no such opening
existed.  AR 739.  He sought to use his sick time until he
learned that he could not.  AR 739.  He knew or should have known that he could
either accept the City of Angels reassignment or violate the vaccination policy
by rejecting the reassignment while unvaccinated.  AR 739-40. 
            Knopke rejected the
assignment because he believed he could not teach multiple subjects due to his single
subject credential.  AR 740.  This belief was unfounded and based on pure
speculation.  AR 740.  When he sought Fassett’s advice, she did not
suggest he could not teach at City of Angels with his credentials.  AR 740.  Knopke presented no evidence that the CTC prohibited
him from teaching at City of Angels with his single-subject credential.  AR 740. 
Stevens expressly told him he could teach at City of Angels without
violating any credentialing rules and regulations.  AR 740.
 
            (2). Character
Evidence
            Fellow teacher Kevin
Walker (“Walker”) described Knopke as a firm but fair teacher beloved by his
students.  AR 740.  Walker also applied for and received an accommodation.  AR 740-741.  Like Knopke, Green had misinformed Walker about
the right to use medical leave until he learned from another source it was only
available to those with medical issues. 
AR 741.  Walker had a multiple
subject credential and felt comfortable teaching multiple subjects at City of
Angels.  AR 741.  
            A parent testified
Knopke provided a very friendly, safe, and welcoming environment.  AR 741. 
She was impressed with his students’ flawless performance during
concerts after taking his class.  AR 741.
            Walker and the
parent submitted character reference letters consistent with their
testimony.  AR 741.
 
            b. Legal
Conclusions
            (1). Evident Unfitness
for Service
            LAUSD contended that
Knopke’s refusal to accept the reassignment demonstrated unreasonableness.  AR 742. 
This unreasonableness and his inability to adhere to the vaccination policy
could not be remedied and rendered him unfit for service as a LAUSD teacher
under section 44932(a)(6).  AR 742. 
            The decision analyzed
Knopke’s wrongful conduct under the Morrison factors.  AR 759.  For the likelihood that his conduct may
adversely affect students or fellow teachers, his refusal to accept the City of
Angels assignment kept him from working and affected his students.  AR 759-60. 
The degree of harm was significant because his students were deprived of
his presence as a teacher.  AR 760.  The conduct was recent, less than a year
before the decision.  AR 760.  The likelihood of recurrence was high insofar
as Knopke had not indicated that he is now willing to vaccinate or teach at City
of Angels.  AR 760.
            Discipline
would not have a chilling effect on the constitutional rights of Knopke or
other teachers.  AR 760-61.  Knopke had a sincerely held religious belief against
vaccination, but LAUSD recognized that belief when it offered the City of
Angels assignment as a reasonable accommodation.  AR 760-61.  No evidence suggested this accommodation violated
his religious beliefs, but he still refused it. 
AR 761.  Walker held a similar
belief but accepted reassignment and did not face discipline.  AR 761. 
Knopke’s discipline did not penalize his beliefs; it penalized his
refusal to comply with the vaccination policy. 
AR 761.  The constitutional rights
of Knopke and other teachers were not involved in this case.  AR 761.
            The
relevant factors demonstrate that Knopke is unfit for
service as an LAUSD teacher.  AR 761.  The question then becomes whether the
unfitness is “evident.”  AR 743.  This issue concerns whether the offensive conduct
is caused by a defect in temperament or fixed character trait.  AR 743. 
Knopke was unreasonable when he refused the City of Angels reassignment
and violated the vaccination policy.  AR
743.  However, he had no prior instance
of similarly failing to comply with LAUSD policies.  AR 743.  The record also reflects he is a well-loved,
effective teacher whose job performance met the LAUSD’s performance standards
throughout his tenure. AR 743.  He still
has the proper temperament to be a teacher. 
AR 743.  
            Knopke’s refusal to
comply with the vaccination policy does not arise to the level of a defect in temperament
or a fixed character trait.  AR 743.  LAUSD failed to establish by a preponderance
of the evidence that Knopke is evidently unfit for service.  AR 743.
 
            (2). Persistent
Violation of School Laws
            Employees are
subject to dismissal for persistent violations of, or refusal to obey, the
school laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the
government of the public schools by the State Board or the Board.  §44932(a)(8).  AR 743.  
            Knopke argued that
LAUSD bears the burden of proving that the regulations at issue were
reasonable.  AR 744.  The CPC rejected this argument.  AR 744. 
Courts should give substantial deference to the decisions of local
school districts and boards within the scope of their broad discretion, and
should intervene only in clear cases of abuse of discretion.  AR 744. 
Knopke bore the burden of showing the vaccination policy conflicted with,
or was preempted, by any law or conflicted with the purposes for which school
districts are established.  AR 744.
            Beets testified that
LAUSD developed the vaccination policy in consultation with physicians, the
CDC, the CDPH, and LACDH.  AR 744.  The purpose was to allow for in-person
instruction while protecting the health and safety of students and LAUSD
employees and while minimizing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus.  AR 744. 
Knopke presented no evidence that the vaccination policy contravened any
law or LAUSD’s purposes as a school district. 
AR 745.
            Knopke asserted that
LAUSD failed to engage in the interactive process as the vaccination policy
describes.  AR 745.  Knopke misrepresents the interactive process,
which is derived from employment discrimination laws.  AR 745. 
Government Code section 12940 prohibits employers from failing to
reasonably accommodate a person’s religious practices.  AR 745. 
The employer cannot terminate or discriminate against an employee unless
it demonstrates that it has explored any available and reasonable alternative
means of accommodating the religious belief or observance.  AR 745. 
The “interactive process” is simply the process in which employees and
employers determine whether accommodation is possible.  AR 745.
            LAUSD accommodated
Knopke when it offered the City of Angels reassignment.  AR 745. 
Knopke thought it was not a reasonable accommodation because he would be
required to teach outside of his credentials, but this concern was speculative.  AR 745. 
Neither the CTC nor the DOE sent him any response prohibiting him from
teaching at City of Angels.  AR 745.  Stevens’ advice at the October 20 and
November 9, 2021 meetings suggests that Knopke could have taught at City of
Angels with his single subject credential without any issues.  AR 745. 
Walker and Beets’ testimony at the hearing confirmed as much.  AR 745. 
There is also no evidence that teaching at City of Angels would have
violated Knopke’s religious beliefs.  AR
745-46.  
            Knopke’s proposed
accommodations included allowing him to teach at Peary with testing twice a
week, using his sick time, being a VAPA coordinator, or teaching only music at City
of Angels.  AR 746.  These options would have either violated the vaccination
policy or required the District to create job positions which did not exist.  AR 746. 
As a result, LAUSD properly engaged in the interactive process and its offered
accommodation of an assignment at City of Angels was reasonable.  AR 746.
            Knopke argued that his
refusal to vaccinate was a single violation and not “persistent”.  AR 746. 
The CPC found this argument unpersuasive.  AR 746. 
Cases like Oakdale Union School District v. Seaman (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d
77, 82, and Midway School District v. Griffeath, (1946) 29 Cal.2d 133, hold
that a long period of school rule violation is indicative of continual
insubordination unless the teacher is unaware of the rules due to lack of
contact with the school district or other factors.  AR 747-48. 
            Knopke knew about
the vaccination policy because he admitted he received LAUSD’s messages about it
throughout September and October 2021. 
AR 748.  He remained in contact
with LAUSD representatives throughout the interactive process.  AR 748. 
McCarthy told him City of Angels was not hiring a VAPA coordinator.  AR 749.  Principal Green clarified that Knopke could
not use sick time.  AR 749.  Sotomayor warned Knopke that he would need to
be vaccinated to continue working at Peary if he rejected the City of Angels
assignment.  AR 749.  Knopke could not reasonably assume that LAUSD
found any of his proposed accommodations acceptable.  AR 749. 

            Knopke remained in
violation of the vaccination policy after the October 15, 2021 vaccination
deadline.  AR 749.  This reflected an attitude of insubordination
and constitutes a persistent, continual course of conduct.  AR 749. 
Because the vaccination policy sought to maintain in-person instruction and
protect students and staff, Knopke’s actions also could seriously affect the
discipline in a school, impair its efficiency, and teach children lessons they
should not learn. AR 749.
            LAUSD demonstrated that
Knopke persistently violated or refused to obey reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of public schools under section
44932(a)(8).  AR 749-50.
 
            (3). Willful
Refusal to Perform Regular Assignment
            Section 44932 says a
permanent employee “shall not be dismissed except for” one of the 11 causes of
action listed thereunder.  AR 751.  That language means the list is
exclusive.  AR 751.  
            LAUSD cited Knopke’s
willful refusal to perform his regular assignment under section 44939(b) as an
additional cause of action for dismissal. 
AR 750.  Section 44939 authorizes
a school district’s governing board to suspend an employee based on willful
refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause, but this
provision only applies to suspension proceedings initiated pursuant to section
44934, which in turn applies to proceedings based on charges as specified in section
44932 or 44933.  AR 751.  Employees are subject to immediate suspension
without pay under section 44939 only if charged with dismissal under section
44932.  AR 751-52.  Dismissal and immediate suspension also have
different procedural requirements and these differences demonstrate that section
44939 does not create a separate category of causes for dismissal.  AR 753.
            LAUSD cited Fontana
Unified School District v. Burman, (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 208, 215-16 to assert that
section 44939 establishes a separate and independent ground for dismissal.  AR 753-54. 
The quoted section from this case does not support the District’s argument.  AR 754. 
It demonstrates that a school district can only choose between
suspension and dismissal if the ground for dismissal under section 44932 also fits
into the narrower list of grounds for immediate suspension under section 44939.  AR 754.
            LAUSD could seek
suspension, but not dismissal, based on Knopke’s willful refusal to perform
regular assignments.  AR 755.  Knopke asserted that he did not willfully
refuse a “regular assignment” because his assignment to City of Angels was
voluntary.  AR 758.  It was, but Sotomayor warned him that he must
be vaccinated to work at Peary.   AR
758.  His regular assignment was either to
teach students remotely at City of Angels or onsite at Peary.  AR 758. 
He refused to teach at City of Angels or to vaccinate so that he could
teach at Peary.  AR 758.  LAUSD established that Knopke willfully
refused to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause and was
properly suspended.  AR 758.
 
            (4). Conclusion
            The CPC concluded
that the Morrison factors show that Knopke is unfit to teach, and he is terminated
from employment with the District.  AR 761-62.
 
            E.
Analysis
Petitioner Knopke contends that (a) the District’s vaccination policy was
not created in compliance with section 35160 and is void, (b) the vaccination
policy is equivalent to an illegal human experiment and is void, (c) LAUSD did
not provide him a reasonable accommodation, and (d) his termination was wholly
arbitrary and violated both Knopke’s due process rights and public policy.
Some of Knopke’s issues are made improperly without first exhausting his
administrative remedies at the CPC hearing and others are waived because they
are made for the first time in Knopke’s reply. 
None is well taken.
 
1. Was the Vaccination Policy Adopted
Pursuant to Law?
Knopke argues that the court’s task is to decide if LAUSD’s vaccine
mandate met the statutory scheme for adopting a legally enforceable policy that
allowed his lawful dismissal.[4]  The statute the District must follow is
section 35160, which gives public school district boards the power to adopt
policies and regulations necessary to operate schools for the purpose for which
they are intended.[5]  Whether
an agency has stayed within the boundaries set by the statutory scheme
“present[s] questions of law for the court.” Poverty Resistance Center v. Hart, (“Poverty”) (1989)
213 Cal.App.3d 295, 305 (regulations must be consistent with authorizing
statute and necessary to  effectuate its
purpose).  Pet. Op. Br. at 2-3.
Knopke contends that the statutory scheme considered in Poverty required counties to set
levels of general relief, but only by adopting regulations consistent with the
State-prescribed statutory scheme and reasonably necessary to carry it out.  Id.
at 304.  The statutory scheme in Poverty
matches the scheme in section 35160, which authorizes local school
district’s boards, acting as agents of the State, to set up local policies and
regulations for each district, but only by adopting regulations and policies
not in conflict with any law.  As in Poverty,
if a governing board’s policies fail to comply with statutory mandates, then
any resulting decision based on such failure must be set aside.  See id. at 299.  Pet. Op. Br. at 3.
Knopke queries: Did LAUSD comply with section 35160’s statutory
limitations so as to adopt a valid vaccine policy, which it then used to
dismiss Knopke?   He answers no.  The August 13 Memo was not adopted by the
Board, a clear violation of section 35160. 
The subsequent Board adoption by resolution of a vaccination policy also
failed to comply with section 35160 because it was “in conflict with or
inconsistent with, or preempted by,” multiple laws that require freely given
and informed consent from participants in human medical experiments.  Pet. Op. Br. at 4.
Knopke notes that the CPC concluded that the District’s policy mandating
that employees be vaccinated or be treated differently than vaccinated
employees did not impact the employees’ constitutional rights: “[T]he
constitutional rights of Respondent or other teachers are not invoked in this
case.”   AR 761.  This conclusion, however, was based on the CPC’s
erroneous conclusion that the Memo’s vaccination policy was a valid rule or
regulation, and it was not.  Pet. Op. Br. at 7-8.
As a general rule, a court will not issue a writ of mandate
unless a petitioner first exhausts its available administrative remedies.  See, e.g., Alta Loma School
Dist. v. San Bernardino County Com. On School Dist. Reorganization, (1981)
124 Cal.App.3d 542, 554.  Under this
rule, an administrative remedy is exhausted only upon termination of all
available, non-duplicative administrative review procedures.  Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector
Control Dist. v. California Public Employment Relations Bd., (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1072, 1080.  The exhaustion
doctrine has been described as “a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the
courts.”  Abelleira v. District Court
of Appeal, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 291-93.
The exhaustion doctrine includes issue exhaustion as well as
exhaustion of administrative remedies. 
The agency must be given the opportunity to reach a reasoned and final
conclusion on each and every issue upon which it has jurisdiction to act before
it is raised in a judicial forum.  Hill
RHF Housing Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles, (2021), 12 Cal.5th 458,
479 (citation omitted).  “Exhaustion
requires ‘a full presentation to the administrative agency upon all issues of
the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.’”  City of San Jose v. Operating Engineers
Local Union No. 3, (“City of San Jose”) (2010) 49 Cal.4th
597, 609 (citations omitted).  “The
exhaustion doctrine contemplates that the real issues in controversy be
presented to the administrative body, which must be given the opportunity to
apply its special expertise to correct any errors and reach a final decision,
thereby saving the already overworked courts from intervening into an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.”  Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court,
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391. 
The exact issue raised in the lawsuit must have been presented to the
administrative agency.  Tahoe Vista
Concerned Citizens v. County of Placer, (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th
577, 594.  Otherwise, a litigant could
present narrow arguments or even omit them before the final administrative
authority in hopes of obtaining a more favorable decision from a trial court.  Id.
Knopke failed to
exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the District’s compliance
with section 35160.  Knopke failed
to raise this issue before the CPC and it need not be considered by the court.  
The argument also fails on its merits.  As the District points out, Knopke admits
that the Board did adopt the vaccination policy (Pet. Op. Br. at 5, n. 6) and
contends that the adoption was untimely. 
Knopke fails to show when the Board adopted the vaccination policy or
how the timing of the adoption affected him. 
As he points out, the adopted policy is not in the record.  See Id.  Most probably the Board’s adoption of the
policy is not in the record because he never contested the policy’s validity.  Thus, Knopke fails to show that the
vaccination policy not properly adopted by the Board in violation of section
35160.[6]
Both sides also argue matters not at issue or irrelevant to
the validity of the vaccination policy under section 35160.  The District argues that there can be no
reasonable dispute that COVID-19 was a pandemic that has caused unprecedented
measures worldwide.  Local governments
have been given wide latitude to impose vaccination requirements to protect its
community. See Jacobson v. Massachusetts, (“Jacobson”) (1905)
197 U.S. 11, 27 (“[A] community has the right to protect itself against an
epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.”) The California
Supreme Court has added that “[v]accination, then, being the most effective
method known of preventing the spread of the disease referred to, it was for
the legislature to determine whether [it should be required], and we think it
was justified in deeming it a necessary and salutary burden to impose upon that
general class.”  Abeel v. Clark,
(1890) 84 Cal. 226, 230.  Opp. at 14.
The District adds that the CPC decision acknowledged Beets’
testimony that the vaccination policy was based upon the guidance of various
doctors and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDPH, and LACDPH.  AR 744. 
Beets testified that the policy was adopted to protect students from the
spread of COVID-19 and to allow the District to provide in-person instruction.  AR 744. 
The CPC noted that Knopke “presented no evidence that the COVID-19
vaccination policy contravened any law or the District’s purposes as a school
district.”  AR 745.  Opp. at 14-15.
Knopke describes the District’s point as an impassioned
defense of mandating vaccination, but with no citations to applicable
authority.  Saying that a pandemic caused
"unprecented (sic.) measures worldwide" does not take the
place of a precedential, constitutionally sound, legal basis for mandating intramuscular
injections of mRNA, an entirely new and experimental way of allegedly inducing
immunity to COVID-19.  The policy forced
tenured employees to be injected with an entirely new compound that was not a
traditional vaccine but instead contained mRNA, to induce immunity by causing
the body to manufacture the spike protein, which is the infectious agent
itself.  Calling this injection a
vaccination did not mean that it was the same vaccination discussed in earlier
vaccine cases.  Traditional vaccination
involves subcutaneous, not intramuscular, introduction of the killed or weakened
infectious agent, traditionally with no adjuvants to increase the level of
inflammatory response.   In defense of
the mandated COVID injection, District cites two ancient (from a scientific perspective) vaccination cases, Jacobson, supra, 197 U.S. at
27 and Abeel v. Clark, supra,
84 Cal. at 230, and both cases are unpersuasive.  Reply at 5.
The court agrees with Knopke that the District’s need for a
vaccination policy to address the COVID pandemic is not at issue in deciding whether
the vaccination policy was lawfully adopted. 
The court also agrees that Jacobson is probably overly
deferential to agency decisions with respect to COVID restrictions, a point
which a member of the Supreme Court indicated in another COVID case.  However, Knopke’s reference to the COVID vaccination’s
nature and origin, and purported distinction from traditional vaccines, is
factually unsupported and irrelevant.[7]
Knopke fails to show that the District’s vaccination policy
was invalid because not adopted pursuant to section 35160.
 
2. Was the Vaccination Requirement a Medical Experimentation?
Knopke argues that the District’s vaccination policy conflicts with (1)
the Nuremberg Code as codified in H&S Code sections 24170 et seq.,
(2) Article 7 of the ICCPR, another iteration of the Nuremberg Code, (3) the U.S.
Constitution’s Preamble and the Ninth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments showing
that the People never surrendered the unenumerated right to make personal
health care decisions to the States or federal government; and (4) the Fourth
Amendment right to be secure in one’s person, free from warrantless seizures.[8]
Article 7 of the ICCPR, as the “supreme law of the land,” overrides any
conflicting provisions in other laws, such as California’s attempted adaption
of a moderated version of the Nuremberg Code in its now outdated H&S Code
chapter known as the Protection Act.  H&S
Code §24170, added by Stats. 1978, Ch. 360.  The Protection Act, adopted before Congress
ratified the ICCPR in 1992, is outdated when it states that “Neither the
Nuremberg Code nor the Declaration of Helsinki are codified under law and are,
therefore, unenforceable.”  H&S Code
§24171(b).  The Protection Act then
states that the Legislature’s intent is to provide citizens with “minimum
statutory protection.”   Id.  In contrast, Article 7 unambiguously states
that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without
his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.”  (emphasis added).  Free consent means free from coercion, undue
influence, fraud, misrepresentation, deceit, etc.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8-9.
While the Protection Act goes into detail about experimentation and
consent, somewhat obscuring the basic protection being provided of the right to
consent or refuse to consent, Article 7 is less restrictive.  It does not define what constitutes “human
medical or scientific experimentation.” 
Thus, it applies to any medical or scientific experimentation, including
self-experimentation and experiments in which the sample set, the “N”, equals
one human being.  So, under both the Protection  Act and the ICCPR, any demand that even one
person be injected with anything, without freely given consent, is a human
medical experiment and unlawful.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8-9. 
Knopke suggests that he exhausted his administrative
remedies on the medical experimentation issue. 
He first notes that the CPC concluded, in addressing the Morrison
factor whether discipline could adversely impact or chill
constitution rights, that:  "the constitutional rights of Respondent
or other teachers are not involved in this case." AR 761.  Knope argues that he clearly raised the legal
and constitutional issues presented in the SAP through his written objections
to LAUSD’s vaccine mandate and never abandoned them.  See AR 487-88 (emails from Knopke to
District employees referencing consent under H&S Code section 24172 and the
U.S. Constitution’s Preamble and the Ninth, Tenth and Fourteenth Amendments as
the basis for his right to refuse to be vaccinated).  Knopke admits that his attorney failed to
argue these issues at the CPC hearing but contends that the CPC nonetheless saw
them in the record and rejected them. 
This makes judicial review appropriate, particularly “when…the asserted
error fundamentally affects the validity of the judgment…or issues of public
policy are at issue….” County of
Orange v. Ivansco, (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 328, 331, n. 2.
As Knopke admits, the medical experimentation issue was not exhausted
before the CPC.   It is
inadequate to argue that the record before the CPC had issues previously raised
to the District.  See City
of San Jose, supra, 49 Cal.4th at 609.  The exact issue raised in the lawsuit
must have been presented to the administrative agency.  Tahoe Vista Concerned Citizens v. County
of Placer, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at 594.  Otherwise, a litigant could present narrow
arguments or even omit them before the final administrative authority in hopes
of obtaining a more favorable decision from a trial court.  Id.[9]  Knopke failed to exhaust the medical experimentation issue.
Nor does Knopke fare better on the merits.  The court agrees with the District
that Knopke is arguing that its vaccination policy is equivalent to a human
medical experiment.  Yet, Knopke has not
provided any evidence that the District’s policy is a medical experiment.  The court has declined to judicially notice the ICCPR,
and the District’s vaccination policy does not fit in any of the Protection Act’s
definitions of medical experiment.  See H&S Code §24174.  Opp. at 15.
Knopke replies that the restrictive meaning of "human
experimentation" in H&S Code section 24171 was clearly intended to
apply to formal studies using subjects, conducted by an investigator or
research institute, which require written, informed consent and various
disclosures.  Yet, human medical
experiments can be conducted informally, and without any of these legal
niceties.  The Nazis conducted human
medical experiments in concentration camps. 
The U.S. government also has conducted medical experiments over the
years -- e.g., the USPHS Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee.  Any time that anyone engages in any medical
procedure, not knowing for certain what the outcome will be, a human medical
experiment is being conducted.  This is a
matter of common sense and logic.  Reply
at 6.
Knopke’s definition is over-inclusive.  There are risks in any medical
procedure.  It is up to a person’s
physician to identify and explain the risks to his patient and obtain informed
consent.  That risk does not make every vaccination
a medical experiment.  Knopke fails to
cite any evidence that the COVID vaccination meets any definition of human
experimentation, whether in the Protection Act or any other law governing
LAUSD.
Knopke also fails to show that the District’s vaccination
requirement is a coerced consent.  Under
the Protection Act (and ICCPR), a person has an inherent right to decide what will
be done to his or her body.  H&S Code
§24171.  However, no one has an inherent
right to teach in a public school.  See
Board of Education v. Swan,
(1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 554, overruled on other grounds, Bekiaris
v. Board of Education, (1972) 6 Cal.3d 575. 
The District’s vaccination policy placed a condition of employment on
working at a school site in an in-person setting.  This is distinct from the notion that the District
forced unwanted medical procedures on its employees.  Moreover, the policy provided reasonable
accommodations that would have allowed Knopke to continue teaching unvaccinated
at City of Angels, which he refused.  Opp.
at 15-16.  This is not a coerced consent.
 
3. Knopke Was Offered a Reasonable Accommodation
It is undisputed
that Knopke requested an accommodation to the vaccination policy based upon his
sincerely held religious belief, the District accepted his application for a
sincerely held religious belief accommodation and offered him an accommodation
to teach at City of Angels, and he refused this accommodation.  
A “single subject instruction”
means the practice of assignment of teachers and students to specified subject
matter courses.  §44256(a)(1).  The CTC may establish and implement
alternative requirements for additional authorizations to the single subject
credential on the basis of specialized needs. 
Id.  A special secondary
teaching credential means one issued on the basis of at least a baccalaureate
degree, a student teaching requirement, and 24 semester units of coursework in
the subject specialty of the credential. 
Id.
            A
valid teaching credential issued by the State Board or the CTC, based on a
bachelor’s degree, student teaching, and special fitness to perform, shall be
deemed qualifying for assignment as a teacher in, inter alia,
independent study.  §44865(d), (f),
(k).  The assignment of a teacher to such
a position shall be made only with the consent of the teacher.  §44865.
District’s Assistant Chief Human Resource Officer Beets testified that the District may allow
teachers to be the supporting teacher on record for the City of Angels
independent study program.  If
Knopke had accepted the offered position at City of Angels, he would have been
credentialed to teach it.  AR
825-26.  Teachers with valid teaching
credentials can teach at City of Angels because they have teaching flexibility
and LAUSD provides the professional development necessary to prepare those
teachers for their assignments at City of Angels.  AR 826. 
Beets disagreed with Knopke’s assertion that this position contradicted
the CTC website.  AR 826.  LAUSD can allow teachers to be the supporting
teacher on record for City of Angels’ independent study program.  AR 826-27.
Knopke argues that the
accommodation he was given required him to violate the law and was per se
unreasonable.  He relies on the fact that
section 44256(a)(1) provides that, even in the case of specialized need, a
special secondary teaching credential will only be issued on the basis of at
least a baccalaureate degree, a student teaching requirement, and 24 semester
units of coursework in the subject specialty of the credential.  There is no exception for independent study
teachers.  School district governing
boards are required to annually certify that independent study courses are
substantially equivalent in rigor, educational quality, and intellectual
challenge as in-person instruction and equivalent classroom-based courses.  Independent study program “[c]ourses are
taught under the general supervision of certificated employees who hold the
appropriate subject matter credential….” 
§51749(a)(3).  Pet. Op. Br. at 9-11.
Knopke contends that District’s
Assistant Chief Human Resource Officer Beets’ opinions that “teachers with a
valid credential could teach at City of City of Angels because they had
teaching flexibility” (AR 826) and that “the District is permitted to allow
teachers to be the supporting teacher on record for our City of City of Angels
independent study program” (AR 827) are mere conclusions without legal support.
 As shown by her job description and
employment, Beets had no expertise in laws related to what a credentialed
teacher could legally accept as an accommodation.  This is especially true compared to the job
of DOE employee Fassett.     Pet. Op. Br. at 9-10.
Beets’ testimony showed that the
accommodation offered to Knopke was based on the District’s clear expectation
that he would teach any subject the District wanted, regardless of his actual
credential, because it was an “independent study program” and section 44256’s
restrictions did not apply.  Knopke would
have accepted the assignment at City of Angels if he could have taught only
music classes -- i.e., subjects within his credential.  AR 738.  
Beets testified that she didn’t even know if music was offered at
City of Angels (AR 831), indicating that the District expected Knopke to teach
outside his credential area.  Pet. Op. Br. at
11.
Knopke has not shown that the District is wrong in
interpreting section 44865 to mean that Knopke could teach an independent study
assignment at City of Angels.  The CPC’s
finding to this effect is supported by Beets’ testimony and also by the fact
that, at a November 9, 2021 meeting, District Field Director
Stevens confirmed to Knopke that
he would have been credentialed to teach at City of Angels.  AR 487; see AR 734.  
Knopke relies heavily on DOE employee Fassett, who did not
testify but did respond to an email from Knope.  On October 26, 2021, Knopke emailed Fassett to
ask three questions: (1) whether he needed to have credentials to teach
specific subjects in a K-12 public school; (2) whether the subject matter
competence requirement prohibits him from teaching subjects like Math, English,
Science, History, or P.E. until he receives supplementary subject area
authorization; and (3) in what other scenario could he legally teach those
subjects?  AR 627.
 In her response, Fassett confirmed that teachers
must be fully credentialed in the subject and grade level they are going to
teach.  AR 626.  Fassett also confirmed Knopke’s understanding
of supplemental authorizations requirements. 
AR 626.  She noted, however, when
there is a shortage of teachers in certain subject areas, the Local Education
Agency may have a teacher with a special permit or temporary certificate teach
those classes.  AR 626.  Fassett advised Knopke to contact LAUSD for
more information.  AR 626.
It is unclear,
but suspicious, why Knopke did not specifically ask Fassett whether he could
teach in an independent study program as an accommodation to the District’s
vaccination requirement.  In any event,
Fassett’s answer clearly indicated that there are circumstances when a district
may have a teacher with a special permit or certificate teach outside their credential.  Her email, therefore, indirectly supports the
District’s position that the City of Angels position would have been lawful.
Apart from the
validity of the City of Angels position, Knopke’s moving papers fail to address
the fact that no other accommodation was available.  The vaccination requirement was a condition
of continued employment.  AR 522.  After an employee received approval of his or
her application for accommodation, LAUSD would determine whether it could
provide an accommodation in which the employee could still perform the
essential functions of that position and not pose a danger to the health and safety of others at the employee’s worksite.  AR 526. 
Because essential functions vary by job class,
the determination would be case-by-case and may result in different results for
different employees.  AR 526.  If workplace accommodations could not reduce
the risk the employee posed to acceptable levels, LAUSD could exclude the
employee from physically entering the workplace. 
AR 526.  LAUSD
and the employee would then determine if there were any available benefit time
or leave provisions.  AR 526.  
            On
September 8, 2021, LAUSD’s reminder identified full vaccination as an
“essential job function” from which no one was exempt.  AR 532. 
The reminder reiterated that, where feasible, LAUSD would reasonably
accommodate employees who wish to continue working without full vaccination due
to a documented disability or sincerely held religious belief.  AR 532. 
Such accommodations would not include working at the facility without
full vaccination.  AR 532.  LAUSD acknowledged that, although rare, some
positions avail themselves of the ability to remote work as a reasonable
accommodation.  AR 532.  The interactive process would consider the
availability and feasibility of remote work, but LAUSD would not offer it if
the position’s essential duties require physical presence at a facility.  AR 532. 

            On
September 15, 2021, LAUSD’s reminder stated that no one is exempt from the
vaccination requirement, and while LAUSD would reasonably accommodate employees
with a documented disability or sincerely held religious belief, that would
not include permission to continue to work at a District facility without full
vaccination.  AR 535.  The reminder outlined a remote work option
with LAUSD’s online independent study program through City of Angels.  AR 535. 
Even if a teacher who was not fully vaccinated by the deadline
received a reasonable accommodation, the teacher would not be allowed to teach
at any site other than City of Angels. 
AR 535.
            On
September 28, Michelle Palomares informed Knopke that a position at City of
Angels was available for him beginning October 5, 2021.  AR 624. 
The email warned Knopke that he would have to fully vaccinate by October
15 if he refused the assignment and chose to stay at his current worksite.  AR 624.
In sum, the
vaccination policy made clear that vaccination was a condition of employment,
no one was exempt from it, and that Knopke could not be physically present on a
school site unvaccinated.  The only
accommodation available for him was a remote work option with the City of
Angels independent study program.  Knopke
refused that assignment.  Because Knopke
refused the only possible reasonable accommodation, the District properly
terminated him. 
In reply, Knopke argues that a lawful accommodation
apparently existed in which he would teach only music and band remotely and the
District failed to discuss such accommodation with him.  All teachers have a legal right to refuse to
consent to "Independent Study” assignments.  §88465. 
Knopke obviously wanted to teach band and music and could have done so
remotely; he had successfully taught band and music remotely for the previous
school year.  Reply at 2.
During cross-examination, Beets was asked: “Was there any
consideration given to allowing Mr. Knopke to teach music virtually?”  In response, she gave a clearly false
explanation why music, of all the subjects taught via the City of Angels
program, could not be taught remotely. 
Beets claimed: “At this time, the District was in person.  So no longer, our students were no longer
remote, so all of our teachers that were at schools were in person and there
were only in-person assignments available at our school sites.”  Beets was questioned further: “Was there any
consideration given to let him teach music virtually as an accommodation?”  Beets was forced to admit: “No, not through
the process that Mr. Knopke went through.” 
 AR 831-33.  Reply at 1-3.
Knopke argues that Beet’s explanation was nonsense.  Not all District school sites offered only in
person instruction; City of Angels itself was providing remote
instruction.   Knopke’s ability to teach music and band
remotely had already been demonstrated. 
Beets admitted that she did not know what had happened to the music
program at Knopke’s own school, Peary.  Given
that he had been teaching music remotely there that school year, why couldn’t
he simply have continued to teach music there remotely as an accommodation?  Reply at 3.
The short answer is that there is nothing wrong with Beets’
explanation.  While teachers (including
Knopke) previously taught remotely during the COVID crisis, by October 2021 students
were back to attending school physically and teachers were expected to do the
same.  Knopke could not teach onsite
unvaccinated.  Nor could he teach music
remotely to students physically at school. 
The only way he could continue teaching remotely was through the City of
Angels independent study program.
Knopke also argues that there was a religious accommodation
appeals committee to which he could have internally appealed the failure to
provide him with a suitable accommodation – if the existence of such a
committee had been made known to him.  AR
851-53.  Nothing in the record shows that
he was told that he could internally appeal the accommodation decision.  Reply at 3.
Again, this is an issue not raised to the CPC and therefore
not exhausted.  See City
of San Jose, supra, 49 Cal.4th at 609.  It also is raised for the first time
in reply.  See Regency, supra,
31 Cal.App.4th at 1333.  The argument
is waived.  Nor does Knopke point to any
evidence that he was unaware of the accommodation appeals committee or what
other accommodation should have been made available besides teaching music
remotely to students physically as school.
The CPC correctly
found that the District offered a reasonable accommodation to Knopke which he
refused.  The District was not obligated
to do more.
 
4. The CPC’s Decision Did Not Violate the Fourteenth Amendment
Knopke notes
that tenured public school teachers have a property interest in their jobs, and
therefore have a constitutional right to due process of law.  U.S. Const. Amend. XIV; Board of Regents v. Roth, (1972) 408
U.S. 564, 577.  As a result, tenured teachers
cannot be deprived of their employment in the absence of notice of the
dismissal and the charges against them, an explanation of the employers’
evidence, and an opportunity for a fair and meaningful hearing.  Cleveland
Board of Education v. Loudermill, (“Loudermill”) (1985) 470
U. S. 532.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
While Loudermill did not hold that the decision
in such cases must be based on facts and law, the nature of what is “fair” under
due process must also mean that no one can be deprived of life, liberty or
property in the absence of both evidence and law, which is exactly what
happened to Knopke.  See, e.g., Schwarre v.
Board of Bar Examiners, (“Schwarre”) (1960) 353 U.S. 232,
246-47 (evidence insufficient to rationally justify findings related to a
litigant’s right to practice law violates due process).  Pet. Op.
Br. at 12.
Knopke was
deprived of his reputation, career and means of support despite both the
absence of substantial evidence of unfitness or incompetence as a teacher, and
the absence of applicable law due to a null and void policy.  His simple action of lawfully declining an
unwanted medical procedure was turned into insulting assertions of statutorily worded
accusations that bore little resemblance to what he had actually done; the
exercise of his lawful rights was contorted into evident unfitness for service
(§44932(a)(6)) and persistent violation of, or refusal to obey, school laws
(§44932(a)(8)), while his rejection of the accommodation that required him to
break the law became “willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable
cause, as described by reasonable rules and regulations of the employing
district” (§44939).  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
Knopke argues
(Pet. Op. Br. at 12-13) that his experience
is similar to the petitioner in Schwarre, supra, 353 U.S. at 246-47. 
Schwarre had gone to law school and passed the New Mexico bar exam, but
New Mexico refused to admit him to practice on the ground of bad moral
character, based on events that had occurred 20 years earlier, when he
used aliases and had been an erratic member of the Communist Party.  Even
though the two most recent decades of his life showed good moral character, the
New Mexico Board of Bar Examiners denied him the opportunity to take the bar to
try to gain admission to the practice of law, finding he had bad moral
character.  The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld
the denial of his license.  Id. at
238.  Reversing, the high court concluded
that this decision violated equal protection and due process because the
evidence did not have a sufficient rational connection to Schwarre’s fitness or
capacity to practice law.  Id. at
246-47.   
Knopke
contends that the CPC’s decision was based its erroneous finding that the District
adopted a valid vaccination policy (AR 712), an erroneous conclusion that no
constitutional rights were involved, and considerations that offend the
dictates of reason and due process -- to wit, that a tenured and competent
teacher can be fired for refusing to break the law or for refusing to agree to
be a human guinea pig.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.            
Knopke’s due
process argument is unfounded.  Again, the
issue was never raised at his CPC hearing and he failed to exhaust the issue.  See City of San Jose, supra,
49 Cal.4th at 609.  Moreover,
Knopke was not fired for refusing to break the law or to be a human guinea
pig.  He was terminated because LAUSD
implemented a vaccination policy as a condition of employment, he was offered a
reasonable accommodation to the policy, and he refused it.  Therefore, he could not remain a District
employee.
The District is correct that it holds broad discretion to
implement policies that serve its obligation to protect the health and safety
of its students and employees.  Dawson v. East Side Union High School Dist., (1994) 28 Cal. App. 4th 998, 1017–18.  Knopke’s circumstance is distinct from Schwarre, where there was no
rational connection to his current fitness to practice law, as the evidence and
the CPC’s findings demonstrate that Knopke violated the District’s vaccination policy
at the time of his dismissal.  Opp. at
17-18.
Knopke replies
that the evidence, not the lapse of time, was the determinative issue in
Schwarre.  When Schwarre applied
to take the bar, the evidence did not establish that he was still a
communist.  Here, the record shows that Knopke
was an employee improperly accused and targeted for dismissal.  Reply at 8.
Communist Party cases such as Schwarre are somewhat sui
generis and therefore distinguishable. 
The point is that vaccination was a condition of employment which Knopke
did not meet.  Rather, he refused a reasonable
accommodation and could not work for the District in any other capacity.  As a result, he persistently refused to obey
a school policy.  §44932(a)(8).  AR 749-50.  Knopke has failed to demonstrate a
violation of due process.[10]
 
F. Conclusion
The SAP is denied. 
The District’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve
it on Knopke’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service for
any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit the
proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the existence/non-existence
of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re:
judgment is set for February 15, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
