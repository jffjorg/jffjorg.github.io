And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to require the plaintiff to file an undertaking. The defendant sought to require the plaintiff, who resides outside of California, to file an undertaking to secure an award of costs and attorney's fees. To obtain an order requiring an undertaking, the defendant must show that the plaintiff resides out of the state and that there is a reasonable possibility of the defendant prevailing in the action. The defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to show a reasonable possibility of prevailing, and therefore did not meet its burden of proof under the statute. The court also notes that the defendant did not provide a basis for the requested undertaking in the amount of $35,000, and that the plaintiff's counsel stated that the plaintiff is unable to furnish an undertaking due to financial hardship, but did not provide supporting evidence.
