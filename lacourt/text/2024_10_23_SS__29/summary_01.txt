The judge grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Reza Askari, M.D. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that Defendant Askari met the standard of care when treating Plaintiff Diana Staben during her prenatal appointments and C-Section procedure. The judge ruled that Defendant Askari presented sufficient evidence to show that he did not breach the standard of care and that his treatment did not cause or contribute to Plaintiff's injuries. The judge concluded that there is no triable issue of material fact and that Defendant Askari is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
