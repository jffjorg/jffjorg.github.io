And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion of True Blue, Inc. and PeopleReady, Inc. to deem Defendant Rodolfo Aguilar to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission. The motion was filed in response to Aguilar's failure to provide a timely verified response to the requests for admission. The judge has ordered Aguilar to be deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission, served in this action by True Blue, Inc. and PeopleReady, Inc. The court has also noted that Aguilar's failure to provide a timely response waives all objections and that the moving parties do not seek monetary sanctions.
