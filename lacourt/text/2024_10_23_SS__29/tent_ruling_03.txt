v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
23STCV11589
Defendant’s Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer
 
Tentative
 
The
motion is granted.
 
Background
On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff Christopher
James filed a complaint against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Metro”), City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles,
California Department of Transportation, State of California, MV
Transportation, Inc., John Doe, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of
action for motor vehicle and general negligence, arising out of a collision
that occurred on June 8, 2022 between Plaintiff’s vehicle and a bus operated by
a Metro employee.
On May 31, 2024, Metro filed an
answer.
On June 24, 2024, MV
Transportation filed an answer.
On September 26,
2024, Metro filed this motion for leave to file an amended answer.  Plaintiff
filed an opposition on October 10, and Metro filed an untimely reply on October
17.  
 
On filing, the
case was assigned a trial date of November 19, 2024.  On the stipulation of the parties submitted
October 4, 2024, the trial date was continued to April 11, 2025.
 
Legal Standard
 
California Code
of Civil Procedure section¿473, subdivision¿(a)(1) provides, in relevant part:
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper,
allow a party¿to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the
name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a
mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for
answer or demurrer.¿ The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to
the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”¿ 
 
“This discretion
should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy
favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”¿¿(Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿
Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended
pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion
to strike are premature.¿ The court, however, does have discretion to deny
leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of
action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by further
amendment.¿¿(See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281¿(overruled on other grounds by¿Kransco¿v. American
Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿ 
“[I]t is an abuse of discretion to
deny leave to amend where the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by
the amendment.” (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739,
759-761.) Prejudice exists where the amendment would require delaying the
trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation
such as an increased burden of discovery. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
Under¿California
Rules of Court¿Rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading shall (1) include
a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any,
and where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any,¿and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.¿ 
 
Under¿California
Rule of Court¿Rule 3.1324(b), a separate declaration must accompany the motion
and must specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is
necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4)¿the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.¿ 
  
Discussion
Defendant Metro seeks a court
order permitting it to file an Amended Answer to add an affirmative defense
under Civil Code section 3333.4, which precludes an uninsured plaintiff from
recovering non-economic damages under certain circumstances. On July 31, 2024,
after receiving Plaintiff’s discovery responses, Metro learned that facts to
support this new affirmative defense.
Metro has complied with CRC Rule
3.1324 by including a copy of the proposed Amended Answer and indicating what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading.  (Rubin
Decl., Exh. J.)  Metro also explains that it discovered the applicability
of this additional defense after receiving Plaintiff’s discovery responses in
July 2024. This is sufficient to explain why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and why it was not made earlier. 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues he would
be prejudiced by the amendment and that Defendant delayed.
Although it is true “a court may deny a good amendment in proper
form where there is unwarranted delay in presenting it,” it remains the case
that “where there is no prejudice to the adverse party, it may be an abuse of
discretion to deny leave to amend.” (Fair v. Bakhtiari (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1147; see
also Kittredge Sports co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048; Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761; Thompson Pacific
Construction, Inc. v. City of Sunnyvale (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 525, 545.)
 
Unfair prejudice may arise, for example, where the party unduly
delayed in seeking leave to amend, and the amendment will require a trial
continuance and a reopening of discovery on the eve of trial.  (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 488 (“Where the trial
date is set, the jury is about to be impaneled, counsel, the parties, the trial
court, and the witnesses have blocked the time, and the only way to avoid
prejudice to the opposing party is to continue the trial date to allow further
discovery, refusal of leave to amend cannot be an abuse of discretion”).) 

The Court has considered
the evidence and argument from both sides and finds that Plaintiff would not
suffer any unfair prejudice from the requested relief.  Although trial was initially set for November
2024, the Court recently continued the trial date to April
11, 2025.  Plaintiff will have adequate
time to prepare his case in light of the newly added affirmative defense.
Further, Defendant was appeared only in May and sought the relief four months
later, obtained the new information on July 31, and filed this motion less than
two months later; there has been, on these facts, no unreasonable delay, and
certainly no prejudicial delay, by Metro.
In view of the
well-established liberality with
which amendments are to be allowed, the motion is granted.

The Court GRANTS
Metro’s motion for leave to file an amended answer.
 
The Court GRANTS
Metro LEAVE to file the Amended Answer attached to the moving papers within 5
days of the hearing.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
