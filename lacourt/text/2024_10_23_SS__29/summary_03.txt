Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (Metro) motion for leave to file an amended answer. Metro seeks to add an affirmative defense under California Civil Code section 3333.4, which precludes an uninsured plaintiff from recovering non-economic damages under certain circumstances. The Judge found that Metro complied with the California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324 by including a copy of the proposed amended answer and indicating what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading. The Judge also found that Metro discovered the applicability of this additional defense after receiving the Plaintiff's discovery responses and that there was no unreasonable delay in seeking leave to amend. Although the Plaintiff argued that the amendment would be prejudicial, the Judge found that the Plaintiff would not suffer any unfair prejudice from the requested relief, as the trial date had been continued to April 11, 2025, and the Plaintiff would have adequate time to prepare his case in light of the newly added affirmative defense.
