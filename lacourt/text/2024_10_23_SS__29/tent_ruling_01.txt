Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
 
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Askari
moves for summary judgment on the grounds that he met the standard of care when
treating Plaintiff Diana Staben and was not a substantial factor in causing
Plaintiffs’ injuries. 
 
Plaintiffs’
claims against Askari arise from three prenatal appointments, on January 18,
25, and February 8, 2021, and a C-Section procedure on February 20, 2021. (Defendant’s
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“DSUMF”), Nos. 5 & 15.) For each of
the prenatal appointments, Plaintiff Diana did not present a need for immediate
medical attention. (DSUMF, Nos. 8, 11, & 14.) Plaintiff Diana’s c-section
procedural was uneventful, with no complications. (DSUMF, No. 16.) 
 
In a medical
negligence action, a plaintiff must establish the following elements: “(1) the
duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other
members of [the] profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that
duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the
resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the
professional’s negligence.” (Galvez v. Frields (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th
1410, 1420; Simmons v. West Covina Medical Clinic (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d
696, 701-02.) “Both the standard of care and defendants’ breach must normally
be established by expert testimony in a medical malpractice case.” (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008), 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
A medical
professional breaches the duty of professional care by failing to act in
accordance with the prevailing industry standard of care. (See Folk v. Kilk
(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 176, 186.) “The standard of care against which the acts of
a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of
experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be
proved by their testimony …, unless the conduct required by the particular
circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.’” (Landeros v.
Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 410.) 
 
A defendant
moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must “present
evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it
was more likely than not that their treatment fell below the standard of care.”
(Johnson v. Super. Ct. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.) “When a
defendant moves for summary judgment and supports [the] motion with expert
declarations that [their] conduct fell within the community standard of care,
[the defendant] is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes
forward with conflicting expert evidence.” (Munro v. Regents of University
of California (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.) An expert declaration,
if uncontradicted, is conclusive proof as to the prevailing standard of care
and the propriety of the particular conduct of the health care provider. (Starr
v. Mooslin (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.)
 
Here, Defendant
Askari presents the declaration of James A. Macer, M.D., who is specializes in
the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology and has been board certified since 1985.
(Macer Decl., ¶ 1.) Dr. Macer is familiar with the standard of care in the
medical profession that applies to physicians within the community. (Id.,
¶ 4.) 
 
Dr. Macer
has reviewed Plaintiff’s medical records. (Id., ¶ 3.) Based upon that
review, Dr. Macer opines that Defendant Askari acted at all relevant times
within the standard of care related to his care and treatment of Plaintiff. (Id.,
¶ 8.) Dr. Macer also opines that no action or inaction by Askari caused or
contributed to the injuries of which Plaintiffs’ complain. (Ibid.) 
 
Dr. Macer’s
opinion testimony is “evidence which, if uncontradicted, would constitute a
preponderance of evidence that an essential element of the plaintiff’s case
cannot be established.” (Kids’ Universe v. In2Labs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th
870, 879.) The expert opinion testimony of Dr. Macer is evidence that Defendant
Askari complied with his duties under California law and the standard of care
for a reasonably careful medical professional under similar circumstances. 
 
With this
evidence, Defendant Askari has satisfied the initial burden of showing that one
or more elements of the causes of action in the complaint cannot be
established. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This shifts the burden to
Plaintiffs to show that there is a triable issue of one or more material facts
as to the causes of action. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiffs
have not filed an opposition, and thus, have not met their burden.
 
Accordingly,
the Defendant Askari’s motion for summary judgment is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment of Defendant Reza Askari, M.D.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
