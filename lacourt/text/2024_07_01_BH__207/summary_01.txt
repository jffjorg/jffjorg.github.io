And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' Application for a writ of attachment against the Defendants My Philanthropies and Bruce Majeski. The Plaintiffs are seeking to attach the property of these two Defendants based on a breach of contract claim. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not established the probable validity of their breach of contract claim, as they have not provided sufficient evidence to support their allegations. The Court also notes that the Plaintiffs have not served notice of the application and hearing on all the Defendants, but since the remaining Defendants are in default, no notice is required. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs' application is denied without prejudice, and they are required to give notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
