The ruling finds that the First Amended Complaint fails to allege any adverse employment action, and fails to plead what protected activity the plaintiff engaged in that would have triggered an adverse employment action. The ruling also finds that the motion to strike is warranted because the alleged facts do not support conclusions of malice, fraud or oppression.
