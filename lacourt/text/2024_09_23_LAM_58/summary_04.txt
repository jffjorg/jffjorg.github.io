And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to disqualify counsel Scott Whitman from representing Plaintiff Lisa Whitman in this matter. The motion was brought by Defendants Lisa de Moraes and Thomas K. Britt, who argued that Whitman should be disqualified due to his potential witness status and his relationship with Plaintiff. The judge found that the Defendants failed to offer evidence to overcome the exception in Rule 3.7 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct, which allows an attorney to serve as both advocate and witness if the client has provided informed written consent. The judge also found that the Defendants failed to offer any legal justification for extending disqualification to all pretrial activities. As a result, the motion to disqualify Whitman was denied, and he will continue to represent Plaintiff in this matter.
