MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV00394

 
Motion filed: 6/28/23, 12/5/23
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Steffanie Stelnick (“Counsel”)
CLIENT: Plaintiff Napa Industries, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Counsel as attorney
of record for Plaintiff. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted.
 
On 9/27/23, at a previous hearing
on the instant motion, the Court found that “it does not appear that Counsel
served NPI Debt Fund with this motion and the accompanying papers. The motion
is continued to allow for service on this party. All other statutory
requirements for the motion have been satisfied.” (9/27/23 Min. Order, p. 2.)
 
On 12/5/23, Counsel filed an
updated proof of service stating that the instant motion and accompanying
papers were served on counsel for NPI Debt Fund.
 
Accordingly, the statutory
requirements for the motion have been satisfied, and Counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED.
