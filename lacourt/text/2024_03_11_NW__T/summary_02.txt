And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment, but only as to the element of duty. The court finds that there is no triable issue of fact as to whether the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition. The defendant argued that the defect was trivial and that the plaintiff failed to present facts to show that the defendant had knowledge of the defect. The court finds that the defendant presented sufficient evidence to show that the defect was trivial, and that the plaintiff's evidence of the horizontal gap between the slabs and the overgrown foliage does not create a triable issue of fact.

The court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that there is a triable issue of fact as to causation. The issue of causation is moot due to the court's finding that the defendant had no knowledge of the dangerous condition.

The defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted as to the duty element, and the case will proceed to trial on the issue of damages.
