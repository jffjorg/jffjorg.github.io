Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Salomon Melchor's Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admission, Set One. The motion was defective because the Notice of the Motion failed to state the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order. Additionally, the Notice cited an inapplicable authority and requested an order that contradicts the substantive request in the motion. The judge also denied Defendant's request for monetary sanctions because the motion was denied on the ground of defective notice.
