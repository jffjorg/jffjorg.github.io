Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23CHCV03054

 
Motion
filed: 7/24/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company 
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Plaintiff Larry Brent to serve verified responses, without
objection, to Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Request
for Production of Documents, Set One. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract by the
insurer defendant. Plaintiff Larry Brent (“Plaintiff” or “Brent”) alleges that
Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Defendant” or “State
Farm”) refused to compensate him for damages to his insured vehicle, despite a
valid policy being in place during the March 7, 2022, incident that caused
damages to his vehicle, in breach of the agreed-upon insurance policy between
the parties. (Compl. ¶¶ 7-12.)
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against
Defendant State Farm and Does 1 to 25, alleging the following causes of action:
(1) Breach of Contract, (2) Tortious Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, and (3) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On January 4, 2024, the Department F51 Court sustained State
Farm’s Demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action and granted its motion
to strike references to punitive damages. Plaintiff was granted 30-day leave to
amend. (1/4/24 Minute Order.) Subsequently, no amendments were filed by Plaintiff,
and State Farm filed its Answer to the Complaint on February 8, 2024.
 
On July 24, 2024, State Farm filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (the “Motion”).
 
            No
Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to
Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
Defendant State Farm’s
counsel, Robert Kubler (“Kubler”), attests that on April 29, 2024, Plaintiff Brent
was served with the first set of Requests for Production of Documents (“RFP”) by
U.S. mail. (Kubler Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”)  This
service established that responses were due on June 3, 2024, including five-day
extension applicable to the service method. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.260, 1013.)
No responses were received by June 5, 2024. (Kubler Decl. ¶ 6.) Kubler then
sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, Thomas M. Bundy (“Bundy”), requesting
responses to be served within 7 days. (Ibid.) However, as of June 25,
2024, State Farm had not received any responses to the RFP. (Kubler Decl. ¶ 8.)
Based on the above
records, the Court determines that Plaintiff Brent failed to serve a timely
response, thereby waiving any objection to the requests, including those based
on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a).
Nevertheless, under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion,
may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220,
2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
Here, Plaintiff Brent did
not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move separately for relief
from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record indicating any responses have
been subsequently served by Brent prior to the hearing. Consequently, the Court
finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
Based on the foregoing,
the Court GRANTS the unopposed Motion.
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Larry Brent’s Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Larry Brent is ordered to serve verified response, without objection, to the
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, within 20 days.
 
Moving party to give notice.
