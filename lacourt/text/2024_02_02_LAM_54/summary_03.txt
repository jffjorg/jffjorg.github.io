And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions to quash service of summons, filed by Cosentino Group, S.A. and Stylenquaza LLC, defendants in a lawsuit brought by Rodolfo Garcia-Rosas and Alma Delia Llamas. The motions argue that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendants and that service of summons was defective.

The court finds that service of summons on Cosentino Group, S.A. was proper, as it was made on their Vice President in British Columbia, Canada, in compliance with Canadian law. The court also finds that the court has personal jurisdiction over Cosentino Group, S.A. because it markets itself as the main entity that controls its stone manufacturing and distribution, and Plaintiff is entitled to learn the nature and extent of Defendant's involvement with its stone manufacturing and distribution through jurisdictional discovery.

The court also finds that Stylenquaza LLC's motion to quash service of summons is moot, as Plaintiff has since re-served Defendant with summons and complaint. The court agrees that there is no evidence of purposeful availment by Stylenquaza LLC, and Defendant's contacts with California are insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.

The motions are continued to May 10, 2024, to allow for jurisdictional discovery. Plaintiff may file supplemental briefs by April 26, 2024, and each defendant may file a supplemental brief by May 3, 2024.
