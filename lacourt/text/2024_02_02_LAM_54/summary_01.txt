And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has moved to enforce a subpoena served on Regal Repair, a third-party company, for documents and deposition testimony related to repairs on a vehicle involved in an accident. The plaintiff, William Cinnamon III, opposes the subpoena, arguing that it seeks private financial documents that are irrelevant to the action. However, the court finds that the documents showing damage and repairs to the vehicle are plainly relevant and outweigh any privacy interests. Therefore, the defendant's motion to enforce the subpoena is granted, and Regal Repair is ordered to appear for deposition and produce documents within 10 days of notice of the ruling.
