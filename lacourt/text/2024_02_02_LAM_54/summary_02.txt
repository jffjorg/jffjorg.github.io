And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents from the defendants. The defendants had objected to the requests, claiming they were overbroad, irrelevant, and violated their privacy rights. However, the judge found that the requests seek information relevant to the plaintiffs' case and that the defendants' privacy rights are outweighed by the need for discovery. The judge has ordered the defendants to serve further responses to the subject discovery within 20 days of notice of the ruling. The judge has also declined to award sanctions against the defendants, finding that they had made good faith efforts to supplement their production.
