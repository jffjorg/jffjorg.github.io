And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Element436 Condominium Association versus Helen Pae and Moon B. Pae, Trustees of the 2021 Pae Family Trust. The defendants moved for an order enforcing a stipulation dated March 9, 2023, which required the plaintiff to pay Celco Construction Services, Inc. to remediate water and mold damage in the defendants' condominium unit. The court initially granted the motion on January 2, 2024, but continued the motion to February 2, 2024, after argument. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion, asserting that the remediation was complete as of December 2023 and that the motion was not necessary. The court has now denied the motion as moot, as the remediation is complete. The court has also denied the request for attorney's fees, as the issues in the motion could have been resolved without court intervention.
