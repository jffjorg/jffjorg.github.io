T/R:     THE MOTION TO ENFORCE STIPULATION IS
DENIED AS MOOT.
 
THE REQUEST FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES IS
DENIED.
 
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition and reply.
 
Defendants move for an order enforcing
the parties’ March 9, 2023 stipulation. The stipulation requires Plaintiff, the
condominium association, to pay Celco Construction Services, Inc. to remediate
water and mold damage in Defendants’ condominium unit. The Court tentatively
granted this motion on January 2, 2024, but after argument continued the motion
to February 2, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff has filed an opposition to
the motion showing that remediation was complete as of December 2023. Plaintiff
asserts this motion was not necessary as the parties were in productive
discussions to resolve the issues before the motion was filed and the
remediation was complete before the date of the initial hearing on this motion.
As the remediation is complete, the
motion is DENIED as moot. The Court declines to award attorney’s fees as the
issues in the motion could have been resolved without Court intervention.
