And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in a lemon law case brought by Plaintiff Elsy Hernandez. The case involves allegations of breach of express and implied warranties under the Song-Beverly Act. The Judge found that the Defendant failed to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The Defendant had submitted warranties containing arbitration language, but the Judge sustained the Plaintiff's objections to the warranties, finding that they lacked foundation and authentication. The Judge also noted that the warranties appeared to have been created after the Plaintiff purchased the vehicle, and that the Defendant did not present any evidence demonstrating that the Plaintiff signed or accepted the arbitration agreements. As a result, the Judge denied the motion to compel arbitration and ordered the Defendant to file an answer or responsive pleading within 10 court days.
