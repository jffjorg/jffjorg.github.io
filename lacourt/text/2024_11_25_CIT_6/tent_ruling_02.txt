   [1] The Court’s reference to the warranties as attached to the declaration of Ali  Ameripour here is only for purposes of determining whether the FAA or CAA  governs this motion to compel arbitration. As noted above, the Court sustained  Plaintiff’s objection to these warranties for lack of foundation and  authentication, and the Court’s ruling remains the same in that regard.
