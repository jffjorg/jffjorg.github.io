And here is the text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses a motion for the release of funds and turnover of funds to the creditor, brought by Fred Tucker, Trustee of the Zula Tucker Living Trust. The Trustee is seeking to recover $55,980.11, which was levied on funds belonging to the defendant, Elizabeth C. Knight, as a result of a writ of execution. The court is concerned about the procedural status of the garnished funds, as the claim of exemption was never ruled upon due to the defendant's bankruptcy filing. The court is also unclear about whether notice of the motion should have been served on the defendant/debtor. As a result, the court is ordering a hearing on the claim of exemption and the motion for release of funds, and requiring the Trustee to give written notice to both Justus Knight, Jr. and Elizabeth C. Knight (or her lawful representative) of the hearings.
