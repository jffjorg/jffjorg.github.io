Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Anna Michelle Rofsky and General Motors LLC. The plaintiff had filed a motion to have her requests for admission deemed admitted and sought sanctions for General Motors' untimely response. The judge denied the motion to deem the requests for admission admitted as moot, since General Motors had served its late responses. However, the judge granted sanctions in the amount of $375, payable to the plaintiff within 20 days of the order. The judge also suggested that the parties meet and confer to determine if a subsequent motion is necessary.
