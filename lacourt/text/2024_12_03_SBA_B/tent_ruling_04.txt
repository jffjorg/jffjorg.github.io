RULING
See Order at end.
BACKGROUND
On January 20, 2015, plaintiff Zula
Tucker Living Trust dated September 15, 2006, filed a complaint against
defendant Elizabeth C. Knight for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) fraud.  The complaint alleges that Plaintiff
Zula Tucker Living Trust Dated September 15, 2006, on two occasions loaned
defendant the total sum of $125,000.  Defendant
failed to pay her obligation.  (Complaint,
¶¶ 5-6.)
On July
17, 2015, plaintiff obtained a default judgment in the amount of $160,902.56.  (Judgment by Default 7-17-15.)  On June 27, 2018, plaintiff obtained a writ
of execution in the amount of $160,902.56. 
(Writ of Execution 6-27-18.)
On June 11, 2020, plaintiff obtained another
writ of execution in the amount of $140,820.07. 
.  (Writ of Execution 6-11-20.)  The Memorandum of Garnishee shows that
$55,980.11 was recovered on the writ.  Justus
Knight Jr., son of defendant/debtor, filed a third party claim on the levied
amount of $55,980.11.  On July 7, 2020
and plaintiff/creditor filed a notice of opposition to claim.  The hearing on the claim was set for October
5, 2020.  On October 2, 2020 debtor
Elizabeth Knight filed a Notice of Stay resulting from her October 2, 2020
bankruptcy filing.  (Notice of Stay
10-2-20.)  As a result, the October 5,
2020 hearing on the claim was continued for a Status Conference.
Fred Tucker notes by reference to the
PACER docket that the Elizabeth Knight bankruptcy case was closed on June 7, 2024.  (Exhibit E.)
Before the court is Fred
Tucker’s, Trustee of plaintiff, motion for the release of funds and turn over
funds to plaintiff/creditor.  Notice of
this Motion was served on Claimant Justus Knight, Jr. at 3853 Cameron Glen
Drive, Parris, CA 92571 by first class mail on November 7, 2024.  The motion is unopposed.
DISCUSSION
Fred Tucker, Trustee of plaintiff,
requests an order to turn over funds belonging to defendant/judgment debtor in
the amount of $55,980.11.  According to
the notice of motion, the grounds for the request are as follows: 
Judgment was entered
on July 17, 2017, for $160,902.56. 
Thereafter, an execution was issued to the County Los Angeles Sheriff
Department.  The Los Angeles County
Sheriff levied on funds belonging to the judgment debtor on deposit at Bank of
America, in the amount of $55,980.11, in excess of the statutorily exempt.  The levy was made at Bank of America on June
24, 2020.[1]
 
There is no supporting memorandum of
points and authorities.  Instead, the
document filed on November 14, 2024, which is described as notice of motion for
the release of funds and turn over funds to creditor, merely contains a factual
summary and conclusion.  A party filing a
motion must serve and file a supporting memorandum that “contain[s] a
statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.” 
C.R.C., Rule 3.1113 (a), (b).
In this case, the procedural status of the garnished funds is
unclear.  The Claim of Exemption originally
set to be heard on October 5, 2020 was never ruled upon due to the bankruptcy.  It appears that it is appropriate to resolve
that claim.
Further, the motion raises other procedural
concerns that should be addressed.  The
proof of service shows that notice of motion was served on only defendant’s/debtor’s
son, Justus Knight, Jr.  It is unclear if
notice should also have been served on either judgment debtor Elizabeth C.
Knight, or a representative of her estate. 
(The motion states that plaintiff/creditor recently learned that
defendant/debtor is recently deceased (Motion pg. 4:16), but there is no
further information or evidence.)  Also, the
proof of service contains a typo regarding the spelling of the city Perris.
In light of the Court’s concerns
regarding the procedure, the Court makes the following Order.
ORDER 
1. 
The Motion is continued to December 27, 2024 at 8:30 in Department B of
this Court.
2. 
The Claim of Exemption originally calendared for hearing October 5, 2020
is ordered set on calendar for hearing on December 27, 2024 at 8:30 in
Department B of this Court.
3. 
Judgment Creditor Fred Tucker shall give written notice to both Justus
Knight, Jr. and Elizabeth C. Knight (or her lawful representative) no later
than December 6, 2024 of these two hearings. 
He must serve a notice of motion and copies of all supporting papers for
his motion.  He need not serve a copy of
the papers previously filed in connection with the October 5, 2020 hearing on
the claim of exemption.
4. 
In the event that Judgment Creditor believes that notice is not
necessary for Elizabeth C. Knight, he may file a memorandum of points and
authorities providing the factual and/or legal basis for that position.  That memorandum shall be filed no later than
December 15, 2024 and served on all other parties.
5. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
