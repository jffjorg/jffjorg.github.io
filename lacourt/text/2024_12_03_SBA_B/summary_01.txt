```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the parties' submissions and has denied the plaintiff's motion for the appointment of a receiver. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a receiver is necessary to manage and oversee the affairs and liquidation of WCL. While the plaintiff has alleged that WCL is in a state of dissolution and that the defendants are engaging in self-dealing practices, the court finds that the plaintiff's evidence is conclusory and does not support the appointment of a receiver. The court notes that the defendants have presented a more compelling factual statement demonstrating that a receiver is not justified. The motion is therefore denied.
