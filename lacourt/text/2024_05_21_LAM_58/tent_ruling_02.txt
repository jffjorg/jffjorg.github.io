Background
 
This action arises from an alleged
breach of contract concerning rental obligations. On January 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs Chaehoon Song and Booyeon Song (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Leslie Wall, Lonnie Wall, and W2K Properties, LLC (“W2K”)
(collectively “Defendants”) alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of
Contract; and (2) Fraud/Intentional Torts. 
 
On February 28, 2022, Defendant W2K
filed an Answer to the Complaint. On February 28, 2022, Defendant Lonnie Wall
filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On April 7, 2022, Defendant Lonnie
Wall filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On May 24, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a motion
to compel responses to discovery from Defendants W2K and Lonnie Wall. 
 
On June 24, 2022, Defendant Leslie
Wall filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On July 29, 2022, after hearing, the
Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel discovery responses and ordered
Defendants W2K and Lonnie Wall to serve code-compliant responses without
objections by August 12, 2022, and to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiffs in
the amount of $4,000.00 by August 31, 2022. (07/29/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On September 8, 2022, Plaintiff
Chaehoon Song filed a motion to compel Defendant Leslie Wall’s responses to written
interrogatories. 
 
On November 3, 2022, the Court
granted Plaintiff Chaehoon Song’s motion to compel responses to written
interrogatories and Defendant Leslie Wall was ordered to provide code-compliant
responses to Plaintiff Chaehoon Song, without objections, by November 28, 2022.
(11/03/22 Minute Order.) The Court also ordered Defendant Leslie Wall to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff Chaehoon Song in the amount of $700.00 by
November 28, 2022. (11/03/22 Minute Order.) 
 
Plaintiff Chaehoon Song thereafter
filed a motion for terminating sanctions which, after hearing, was granted by
the Court on January 5, 2023. (01/05/23 Minute order.) The Court found that
Defendants failed to comply with the Court’s previous orders from July 29, 2022
and November 3, 2022. (01/05/23 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court found that
there was no good faith compliance by Defendants because “Defendants filed a
declaration indicating that they have complied” but the declarations of
Defendants contained no attachments. (01/05/23 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court
imposed terminating sanctions by striking Defendants’ answers and entering
default against Defendants. (01/05/23 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court also
ordered sanctions in the amount of $2,000.00, jointly and severally, against
each defendant “and attorney Gary Saunders, in addition to the previously
ordered sanctions. The total amount due is $6,700.00 (includes the previous
sanctions). Sanctions are due payable to Law Offices of Alexander Geiman by
01/31/2023.” (01/05/23 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.)
 
On July 14, 2023, default judgment
was entered against Defendants and in favor of Plaintiffs. 
 
On January 10, 2024, Defendants moved
to set aside/vacate default judgment. Plaintiffs opposed such motion. 
 
On February 21, 2024, after hearing
oral argument, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to set aside default
judgment. (02/21/24 Minute Order.) The Court, however, ordered Defendants’
counsel to pay attorneys’ fees and costs in the sum of $6,500.00 to Plaintiffs
on or before March 1, 2024. (02/21/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court vacated
the default and default judgment entered against Defendants. (02/21/24 Minute
Order at p. 6.) 
 
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
and served the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions, or in the Alternative,
Motion to Compel Discovery and Request for Sanctions. Plaintiffs request an
order striking the answers of Defendants, an order reinstating the defaults
against all Defendants and reinstatement of the previously entered judgment
against all Defendants, and an order imposing sanctions against Defendants and
their counsel in the amount of $13,000.00, representing $6,500.00 unpaid from
the prior order and $6,500.00 for the instant motion. Alternatively, Plaintiffs
request an order compelling Defendants to respond to discovery propounded upon
them without objection fully and completely and for sanctions in the amount of
$13,000.00.
 
Defendants filed no opposition to the
motion for terminating sanctions. Notice of the motion was served on their
attorney. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing, which was May 8, 2024. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005(b).) Because the instant motion is unopposed, an inference
is created “that the motion is meritorious.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Legal Standard
 
“The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.”  (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “Discovery
sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Ibid.) “[C]ontinuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.) Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.)
A trial court has broad discretion to impose discovery sanctions, but two facts
are generally a prerequisite to the imposition of nonmonetary sanctions.  (Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery
sanctions are requested against a party, there must be a failure to comply with
a court order and the failure must be willful. (Ibid.) A terminating sanction may be imposed by “[a]n order
striking out the pleadings of the or parts of pleadings of any party engaging
in misuse of the discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d)(1).) A terminating sanction may also be imposed by “[a]n order rendering a
judgment by default against that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d)(4).) 
 
“A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly.” (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.) A trial court’s order
to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was arbitrary,
capricious, or whimsical.”  (Ibid.) “[W]here a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.) Trial courts
have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery
orders.  (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377,
390.)  
 
California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) A misuse of the discovery process is when a
party disobeys a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (g).) A misuse of the discovery process also occurs when a
party fails “to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) A court has discretion to fix the
amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC
v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
Discussion
 
Appropriateness of Imposing Terminating Sanctions 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Alexander Gelman
(“Gelman”), provides a declaration in support of the motion. Mr. Gelman states that
his office served proper discovery to all Defendants, which included requests
for production, interrogatories, and special interrogatories. (Gelman Decl., ¶
2; Exh. A.) The Court ordered full discovery responses on July 29, 2022.
(Gelman Decl., ¶ 3.) Mr. Gelman states that no documents have ever been
provided by Defendants or their counsel. (Gelman Decl., ¶ 5.) Even after the
Court vacated the default and default judgment against Defendants, no response
was received. (Gelman Decl., ¶ 6.) Defendants have also not paid the required
$6,500.00 in sanctions by March 1, 2024. (Gelman Decl., ¶ 7.) For the present
motion, Plaintiffs request $6,500.00 in sanctions. (Gelman Decl., ¶ 7.) Counsel
states that his hourly rate is $375.00 per hour, and he spent over 20 hours
preparing the instant motion, reviewing the court file, and the contents
thereof. (Gelman Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
Based on the declaration of counsel,
Defendants have failed to respond to discovery despite court orders compelling
Defendants to respond to discovery. Defendants have also failed to pay
sanctions as ordered by this Court. The Court finds that Defendants have failed
to comply with a court order pertaining to discovery and that such failure was
willful. Defendants have not responded to the instant motion and, therefore,
Defendants have provided no basis for their failure to respond to discovery. 
 
Defendants have failed to comply with
the Court’s previous orders. The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for
terminating sanctions and strikes Defendants’ answers and enters default against
Defendants. While the Court acknowledges that default judgment was previously
entered against Defendants, Plaintiffs provides no legal authority for the
Court to reinstate a previously entered default judgment pursuant to a motion
for terminating sanctions. Plaintiffs may file a default judgment package on a
date that will be established at the hearing.  
 
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. The Court orders that monetary sanctions as to
the instant motion in the reasonable amount of $3,000.00 be paid by Defendants
and their counsel, Gary Saunders, jointly and severally, in addition to the
previously ordered sanctions of $6,500.00 that have not been paid as required
by the Court’s February 21, 2024 order. Thus, total monetary sanctions in the
amount of $9,500.00 are to be paid to Law Offices of Alexander Gelman on or
before June 21, 2024. 
 
Plaintiffs’ request to compel
Defendants to respond to discovery is MOOT given that the Court has imposed
terminating sanctions against Defendants. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for terminating sanctions and
strikes Defendants’ answers and enters default against Defendants. Plaintiffs
may file a default judgment packet to request entry of default judgment against
Defendants. 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions
is GRANTED IN PART. Monetary sanctions in the amount of $9,500.00 are to be
paid to Law Offices of Alexander Geiman, by Defendants and their counsel of
record, Gary Saunders, jointly and severally, no later than June 21, 2024.
 
Plaintiffs’ request to compel Defendants
to respond to discovery is MOOT given that the Court has imposed terminating
sanctions against Defendants.
