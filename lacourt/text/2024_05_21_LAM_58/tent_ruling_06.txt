Background
 
This is a civil

Jr. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Open Text Corporation
(“Defendant”) for Violation of California Invasion of Privacy (“CIPA”) – Penal
Code section 638.51. 
 
Defendant moves for an order
granting the admission of James V. Garvey to appear on its behalf pro hac vice.

 
The Court grants the application.

application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the
State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of a $50.00

of California, employed in the state, or regularly engage in substantial
business, professional, or other activities in the state.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
