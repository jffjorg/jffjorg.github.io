Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ORDER within five (5) days to Client and parties.  DISCUSSIONOn October 25, 2023, this Court continued the matter to allow the parties to correct the deficiencies. Additionally, the discovery motions that were scheduled for 10/27 and 12/1 were continued to 12/28. The Court did not adopt its tentative ruling denying the motion due to the hearing date being too close to the upcoming motions.On October 30, 2023, Counsel for Plaintiff filed 3 updated documents: a new order to be relieved as counsel, notice regarding the rescheduled dates for the three discovery motions, and a declaration regarding proof of service. In these documents, counsel attached proof of service, which indicated that Plaintiff as well as Defendant have been served via mail.Based on new documents submitted, the Court finds that good cause exists to allow counsel to withdraw. In the Declaration it indicates that there has been an “irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that stands in way of effective representation.” The proofs of services attached indicate that all parties have been served with the most updated forms.
