The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel plaintiff's responses to supplemental interrogatories is granted. The plaintiff, Armando Ruiz Carlos, is ordered to serve responses, without objections, to the defendant's supplemental requests within 20 days of the issuance of this order. The request for sanctions is denied. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to provide responses to the defendant's supplemental requests, despite being contacted by the defendant's counsel. According to California Code of Procedure section 2023.290(a), a party waives objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response. The judge declines to award sanctions as the motion is unopposed.
