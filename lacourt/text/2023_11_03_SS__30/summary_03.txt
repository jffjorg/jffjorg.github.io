And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to their supplemental request for production of documents. The plaintiff was ordered to serve verified responses without objection within 20 days of the issuance of the order. The judge denied the request for sanctions, as the plaintiff had already served responses after the motion was filed. The judge noted that the defendants are entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff to serve a complete response without objection, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a). The plaintiff had argued that the motion was moot because they intended to provide supplemental responses, but the judge did not accept this argument.
