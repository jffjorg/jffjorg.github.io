And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the case, 23STCV10857, was mistakenly filed as a Personal Injury matter. The Judge orders the case to be referred to the Master Calendar Department, Department 1, to determine whether the case should be reassigned to an Independent Calendar Court. As a result, the hearings scheduled for November 3, 2023, and November 8, 2023, are vacated and may be reset by the receiving court. The Judicial Assistant is directed to give notice to the Plaintiff, who must then notify all parties of record.
