And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer, which means that the Defendant's motion to dismiss the case is granted, with leave to amend the complaint within 20 days. The motion to strike is denied. The ruling addresses two causes of action: intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege a cause of action for IIED, as the complaint lacks specific facts about the conduct, intention, and emotional distress. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged a cause of action for NIED, as the complaint lacks a specific description of the injury-producing event and the emotional distress suffered. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs' complaint is uncertain, as it does not specify which cause of action corresponds to which plaintiff. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint, giving the Plaintiffs an opportunity to cure the defects.
