COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
Defendants
  Demurrer To First Amended Complaint



[THE FOLLOWING IS A
TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
I. BACKGROUND
This is a landlord-tenant dispute. On August 25,
2019, plaintiff Pejman Kohansedgh (“Plaintiff”), the landlord of a certain residential
real property (the “Property”) entered a lease (the “Lease”) and a guaranty to
the Lease with defendants Gonzalo Lizama (“Gonzalo”), Yasmina Monjaraz
(“Yasmina”), Santiago Monjaraz (“Santiago”), and Yesenia Cayetano (“Yesenia”
and, together with Gonzalo, Yasmina, and Santiago, “Defendants”). (Opposition
p. 2.) In June 2023, Defendants ceased rent payments but remained in possession
of the Property. (Ibid.)
 
On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed an unlawful
detainer complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendants. On January 12, 2024,
Santiago filed a demurrer to the Complaint, and five days later, Yesenia did
the same. On February 9, 2024, both demurrers were sustained with leave to
amend.
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended
complaint (the “FAC”).
 
On March 27, 2024,
Gonzalo and Yasmina filed a demurrer to the FAC (the “Gonzalo/Yasmina
Demurrer”), and two days later, Santiago and Yesenia did the same (the
“Santiago/Yesenia Demurrer” and, together with the Gonzalo/Yasmina Demurrer,
the “Demurrers”).
 
On April 12, 2024,
Plaintiff opposed both Demurrers.
 
II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
 

The Meet and Confer Requirement

 
California Code of Civil Procedure
§¿430.41, subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith
before the filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections
raised in the demurrer. Further,  
 
The demurring party shall
file and serve with the demurrer a declaration stating either of the following: 
 
A.             
The means by which the
demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject
to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the
objections raised in the demurrer. 
 
B.              
That the party who filed
the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer
request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good
faith. 
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
 
We note that Defendants
do not include any declaration stating either that the meet and confer
requirement has been met or that Parties were unable to meet this requirement,
as required by California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.41, subdivision (a)(3).
We therefore remind Defendants of their obligation to meet and confer with Plaintiff
in good faith prior to the filing of a demurrer. 
 

Timeliness of Filings

 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.40,
subdivision (a), a demurrer to a complaint should be filed within 30 days after
service of the complaint. 
 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure
§¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at least 16 court days
before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should be filed at least
nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any oppositions should
be filed at least five court days before the set hearing. Judges have
discretion as to whether to consider or strike an untimely demurrer or
pleading. (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253,
281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 193, 196 (disapproved on other
grounds by Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6
Cal.3d 176).)
 
The FAC attaches a proof of service
indicating that Defendants were served with the FAC on February 12, 2024. Both
the Gonzalo/Yasmina Demurrer and the Santiago/Yesenia Demurrer are therefore
untimely as both were filed more than 30 days after February 12, 2024.
Plaintiff’s opposition to both Demurrers is also untimely. We nonetheless
consider both Demurrers and Plaintiff’s opposition thereto.
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
As a
general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A complaint is
sufficient if it contains “[a] statement of
the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise
language.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.10, subd. (a)(1).) Under this
standard, a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550.)
 

The Gonzalo/Yasmina Demurrer

 
Gonzalo and Yasmina demur to the FAC on the grounds that (1) the FAC is
uncertain as to whether Plaintiff is the “owner” or the “landlord and trustee
with power of attorney” of the Property, (2) the FAC is uncertain as to whether
this is a limited or unlimited jurisdiction case, and (3) the Lease limits
recovery of attorneys’ fees to $500 but the FAC’s prayer for relief includes a
request for “reasonable attorney fees.” (Demurrer p. 1.)
 
Demurrers “for uncertainty are disfavored, and are granted
only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3, internal quotations omitted; accord Lickiss v.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Chen v. Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811,
822, quoting Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.) A¿demurrer¿on the ground that the complaint is
ambiguous,¿uncertain, and¿unintelligible, cannot be sustained unless all of
these imperfections exist. (Kraner v. Halsey (1889) 82 Cal. 209,
211–12.) Not “every ambiguity in a complaint will justify a trial court in
sustaining a special¿demurrer.” (Merlino v. West Coast Macaroni Mfg. Co.
(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 106, 108.) “A special¿demurrer¿should not be sustained if
the allegations are sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues
that must be met, even if the allegations of the complaint may not be as clear
and as detailed as might be desired. Moreover, a¿demurrer¿for uncertainty will
not lie as to even¿uncertain¿and ambiguous allegations, if such allegations
refer to immaterial matters.” (Ibid.) 
 
Gonzalo and Yasmina argue that Plaintiff’s status as either
“owner” or “landlord and trustee with power of attorney” is important to their
ability to determine if he has standing to sue. (Demurrer p. 3.) If Plaintiff
is a trustee and not the owner, they contend, then he must sue in his capacity
as trustee. (Ibid.)
 
“As a general rule, the trustee is the real party in interest
with standing to sue and defend on the trust's behalf.” (Estate of Bowles
(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 684, 691.) When a party mistakenly identifies itself as
a trustee but has standing only as an individual, courts will disregard the
trustee label as merely descriptive. (Graham v. Lenzi (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 248, 254.) We apply the same principle here and find that the
absence of the descriptive label of trustee does not deprive a party of
standing.
 
Plaintiff contends that he “wears several ‘hats’ vis-á-vis
the [Property]” and that he is owner, landlord, and trustee with power of
attorney but that this is “of trifling concern.” (Opposition p. 7.) Because
Plaintiff’s failure to label himself a trustee does not deprive him of
standing, we agree that he would have standing whether he were owner or
landlord and trustee with power of attorney. Thus, we find that this
uncertainty refers to immaterial matters and should not be the basis of a
demurrer.
 
Gonzalo and Yasmina additionally argue that the FAC’s reclassification
of the instant action as a limited case creates uncertainty because it remains
in an unlimited court. (Demurrer pp. 3–4.) However, the classification of the
action as either limited or unlimited does not affect the allegations of the
FAC, which remain sufficient to “apprise the defendant of the issues that must
be met” and so should not be the basis for sustaining a demurrer for
uncertainty.
 
Finally, Gonzalo and Yasmina argue that the FAC’s checkmark
in the box indicating that Plaintiff requests “reasonable attorney fees”
contradicts the Lease, which limits such recovery to $500. We do not find these
statements to be contradictory, as reasonable attorneys’ fees in this case may
be $500, and additionally find that any uncertainty this does create refers to
immaterial maters that should not be the basis of a demurrer.
 
Accordingly, this court OVERRULES the Gonzalo/Yasmina
Demurrer.
 

The Santiago/Yesenia Demurrer

 
Santiago and Yesenia demur to the FAC on the grounds that because they
are guarantors of the Lease and not tenants under the Lease, the copy of the
Lease attached to the FAC contradicts the FAC and because possession of the
Property is not at issue in their case, Plaintiff cannot prevail on an unlawful
detainer action against them. (Demurrer pp. 1–3.) Plaintiff disputes that
Santiago and Yesenia are not tenants. (Opposition p. 9.)
 
We agree with Santiago and Yesenia that the Lease indicates they are not
tenants entitled to possession of the Property as the Lease includes only
Gonzalo and Yasmina in its definition of “Tenants.” (FAC p. 5.) The guaranty
attached to the Lease appears to have been mistakenly signed by Defendants on
the wrong lines but clearly indicates that two of Defendants are guaranteeing
the other two Defendants’ performance under the Lease and that only two of the
Defendants, not all of them, are tenants entitled to possession of the Property.
(FAC p. 9.)
 
“Unlawful detainer is
a remedy available to a landlord against a tenant who breaches a lease and is
intended and designed to provide an expeditious remedy for the recovery
of possession of real property.” (Castaic Studios, LLC v.
Wonderland Studios LLC (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 209, 215.) “The remedy is
available in only three situations: to a lessor against a lessee for unlawfully
holding over or for breach of a lease; to an owner against an employee, agent,
or licensee whose relationship has terminated; and to a purchaser at an
execution sale, a sale by foreclosure, or a sale under a power of sale in a
mortgage or deed of trust against the former owner and possessor.” (Greene
v. Municipal Court (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 446, 450.)
“[U]nlawful detainer actions are limited to right
of possession and not other claims, even if related to the property.”
(Castaic Studios, LLC v. Wonderland Studios LLC, supra at 216,
describing Larson v. City and County of San Francisco (2011)
192 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1297.)
 
The FAC fails to
state a cause of action in unlawful detainer against Santiago and Yesenia
because it does not allege a situation to which the remedy of unlawful detainer
applies. Santiago and Yesenia, being guarantors of the Lease and not tenants
have no claim to possession of the Property. They are not lessees under the
Lease.
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show
the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.; Lewis
v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) “If there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it
is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada
Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) “If the plaintiff has not had
an opportunity to amend the complaint in response to the demurrer, leave to
amend is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness, unless the complaint shows
on its face that it is incapable of amendment.” (City of Stockton v.
Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.)
 
We do not see any reasonable possibility that Plaintiff could
make an amendment that would cure Santiago’s and Yesenia’s status as
non-tenants so that an unlawful detainer action could be maintained against
them.
 
Accordingly, this
court SUSTAINS the Santiago/Yesenia Demurrer without leave to amend.
