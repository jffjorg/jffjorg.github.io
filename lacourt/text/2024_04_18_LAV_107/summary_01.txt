And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has written a tentative ruling in a case between Pejman Kohansedgh (the landlord) and Gonzalo Lizama, Yesenia Cayetano, Santiago Monjaraz, and Yasmina Monjaraz (the tenants and guarantors). The judge has addressed the demurrers filed by Gonzalo and Yasmina, and Santiago and Yesenia, challenging the complaint filed by the landlord.

The judge has found that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action for an unlawful detainer against Gonzalo and Yasmina, and has overruled their demurrer. The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by Santiago and Yesenia, finding that they have no claim to possession of the property and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for an unlawful detainer against them. The judge has also reminded the parties of their obligation to meet and confer in good faith before filing a demurrer.
