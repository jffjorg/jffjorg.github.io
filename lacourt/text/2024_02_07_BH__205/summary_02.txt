And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Carmen Aguilar to vacate an order dismissing her personal injury case against Bluestone Lane Coffee. The case was dismissed because plaintiff's counsel failed to appear for an Order to Show Cause (OSC) on June 9, 2023, despite being calendared by his assistant. Plaintiff's counsel has filed a sworn affidavit explaining the mistake was due to a calendaring error and not part of a larger pattern of carelessness. The judge has determined that mandatory relief is available under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) because the dismissal was procedurally equivalent to a default, and the failure to appear was not part of a larger pattern of carelessness. The judge grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and reinstates the case, setting a case management conference for February 27, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
