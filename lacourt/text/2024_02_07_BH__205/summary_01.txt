And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to file a first amended answer by the defendants. The defendants are seeking to add an affirmative defense of failure to mitigate. The judge has reviewed the recently taken depositions of the real estate agents and has concluded that the delay in seeking amendment is not unreasonable. The judge has also found that there is no prejudice to the plaintiffs as a result of the amendment. Therefore, the judge is granting the motion for leave to file a first amended answer. The defendants are to file their proposed first amended answer within 10 days of this order.
