 Case Number:  20STCV40767    Hearing Date:   December 1, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 12/01/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 20STCV40767 ORLANDUS ANDERSON, et al. vs ACCESS SERVICES, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Orlandus Anderson, Age 40 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  The petition filed on September 27, 2023 is denied for the following reasons: ¿ Petitioner filed the petition utilizing an outdated form MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2011]. Petitioner must use MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2021].    Petitioner Linda Gable (“Gable”) provides that she is the parent, guardian ad litem, and conservator for Claimant Orlandus Anderson (“Claimant”). However, the Court is unable to locate any order appointing Gable as the guardian ad litem or conservator.   Further, the Court is unclear as to the full settlement amount this action settled for, and the amount allocated to Claimant. Item 11 is pertinent to the amount being paid specifically to Claimant, which Petitioner provides as $35,000. However, with $4,555 in attorney’s fees and $544.05 in costs to be deducted from Claimant’s share of the proceeds, the proposed net balance of $7,895.95 does not track if the amount apportioned to Claimant is actually in the amount of $35,000. Further confusing the matter is Item 17(a), which is intended to be the gross amount of proceeds prior to any deductions for expenses and fees. Petitioner provides on Item 17(a) that the gross proceeds is $7,895.  Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
