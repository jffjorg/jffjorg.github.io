And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from February 14, 2024 to November 11, 2024 or a date thereafter. The defendant seeks to continue the trial date to allow it to file a motion for summary judgment, but the judge finds that the defendant has not established good cause for the continuance. The judge notes that the defendant's counsel may be unavailable for the current trial date, but this is not sufficient to justify a continuance. The judge also finds that the defendant's motion for summary judgment has not been timely filed, and therefore, the defendant has not established good cause for continuing the trial date. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to submit to the tentative ruling or appear at the hearing.
