And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor and has issued a tentative ruling. The petition seeks approval of a settlement agreement between the parties, in which the Claimant, Janet Giovanna Paredes Giraldo, will receive $1 million. The settlement funds will be allocated as follows: $300,158.11 for medical expenses, $333,333.33 for attorneys' fees, and $14,055.91 for costs. The net balance of $352,452.65 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity.

The Court finds the settlement and attorneys' fees fair and reasonable. However, the Court denies the petition due to a lack of supporting evidence for the medical expenses. The Court requests that the Petitioner provide supporting documentation, such as invoices or medical records, to justify the allocation of $300,158.11 for medical expenses.

The Petitioner must file a new petition, curing the defects, at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date. The Court also orders the moving party to give notice.
