 Case Number:  22STCV11963    Hearing Date:   December 1, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 12/01/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 22STCV11963 JANET GIOVANNA PAREDES GIRALDO, et al. v. CARLOS SOLIS, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Janet Giovanna Paredes Giraldo, Age 41 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $1 million, with the entire $1 million being apportioned to Janet Giovanna Paredes Giraldo (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $300,158.11 will be used for medical expenses, $333,333.33 for attorneys’ fees, and $14,055.91 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $352,452.65 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  The Court has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds the attorneys’ fees fair and reasonable, because the Court is satisfied with the attorney declaration justifying 33.33% of Claimant’s settlement.     However, the Court denies the petition filed on September 14, 2023 for the following reason:  This is a wrongful death action, wherein Domingo Gaspar Paredes (“Decedent”) suffered fatal injuries after falling down two stories. Claimant, an adult with a disability, is the daughter of Decedent, who suffered emotional distress from the loss of her father.   Although not specifically stated, the Court surmises that a portion of the settlement proceeds allocated to Claimant is to pay for Decedent’s medical expenses, as Claimant did not undergo any medical treatment related to the action. However, Petitioner provides no copies of any medical records, and it is unclear from the petition who actually incurred the $300,158.11 in medical expenses. Petitioner is requested to provide supporting evidence of the medical expenses, such as invoices or other documentation, for the Court to determine that this allocation is supported and reasonable.   Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
