And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of a pending action of a minor, filed by Linda Gable on behalf of her son, Orlandus Anderson. The court finds that the petition contains several defects, including the use of an outdated form (MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2011]) and the inability to locate the order appointing Gable as guardian ad litem or conservator. Additionally, the court is unclear about the full settlement amount and the amount allocated to Claimant, citing inconsistencies in the petition. The court orders Gable to reserve a new date and file a new petition, curing the above-noted defects, at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
