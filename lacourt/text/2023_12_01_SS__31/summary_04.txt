And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the City of Downey's unopposed motion for an order disbursing the interpleaded funds in the amount of $100,000. The City had filed a complaint in interpleader against itself and Robert Linares, alleging that both parties claim the right to the insurance policy arising from an automobile collision. The City had previously filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, determining that the City is entitled to the full $100,000. The Court has resolved the conflicting claims to the funds in the City's favor, and there remains no further triable issues. The City's motion is granted, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
