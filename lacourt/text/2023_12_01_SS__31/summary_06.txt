Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the City of Los Angeles, et al. The plaintiff seeks to add a cause of action for dangerous condition of public property under Government Code § 835, which was not included in the original complaint. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that it was not the defendant's responsibility to instruct the plaintiff on how to state a claim and that the proposed FAC adds a request for attorney's fees not included in the original complaint.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion, agreeing that judicial policy favors granting amendments and that the defendant's only argument in terms of prejudice is that it will need to re-file its motion for summary judgment, which is a non-issue since the plaintiff has agreed to strike the request for attorney's fees. The judge also orders the plaintiff to pay the filing costs incurred by the defendant in filing the summary judgment motion made moot by the late amendment.

The judge notes that the parties should meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, the party should send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
