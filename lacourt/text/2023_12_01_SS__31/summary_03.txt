Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the expedited petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Jordyn Ellison. The petition sought approval of a settlement agreement for $12,500, with $2,500 allocated to Jordyn. However, the Court found several defects in the petition and attachments, including inconsistencies and lack of required documents. Specifically, the Court noted that the claim of the minor was subject to a pending action, and that certain expenses were not accounted for or deducted from the claimant's share of proceeds. The Court also requested information about the attorney's relationship with another party involved in the matter and the name and address of the parent of the minor. The petition was denied, and the petitioner is ordered to file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
