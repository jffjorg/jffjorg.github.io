(024 Management), Defendant JW Brands  LLC (JW Brands) and Plaintiffs Chris Lacroix (Lacroix) and Martin Willerford  (Willerford) (collectively, Plaintiffs).   Plaintiffs allege that in or about 2020, Plaintiffs and Defendants  entered a written agreement whereby Defendants hired Plaintiffs to operate a  division of its business, Plaintiffs would provide services, pricing and terms,  and Defendants would pay for said products.   Plaintiffs further allege that they provided a loan of startup capital  to Defendants.  Plaintiffs allege that  Defendants breached the agreement by preventing Plaintiffs from providing  services and refusing to return the startup loan funds.     On 1/10/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against 024  Management, JW Brands, Michael Wayman (Wayman), Tim McCandless (McCandless) and  Derek Markstein (Markstein) for: (1) Fraud,  (2) Breach of Written Contract, (3) Quantum Meruit, (4)  Account Stated and (5) Open Book Account.   On 10/4/22, JW Brands and Markstein filed separate answers to the  complaint.  On 10/10/22, default was  entered against 024 Management and on 10/11/22, default was entered against  McCandless and Wayman.    JW Brands and Markstein contend that in or about February  2020, 024 Management, McCandless and Wayman brought a business deal to them  whereby it was proposed that Plaintiffs would operate a division of the  business and 024 Management, McCandless and Wayman would pay for said services.  JW Brands and Markstein contend they never  had contact with Plaintiffs and were informed by 024 Management, McCandless and  Wayman that the proposed business deal with Plaintiffs was never consummated,  the contract was never signed by all parties and, therefore, the business deal  fell through.  JW Brands and Markstein  contend that it was not until Plaintiffs filed this action against them that  they became aware, through discovery, that 024 Management, McCandless and  Wayman had accepted $75,000 from Plaintiffs. Therefore, on 7/18/23, JW Brands and Markstein filed and  served this motion seeking an order granting JW Brands and Markstein leave to  file a cross-complaint against 024 Management, McCandless and Wayman.  No opposition to the motion has been  filed.     ANALYSIS   A party may file a permissive cross-complaint against a  party who has not filed the complaint or cross-complaint against that party at  any time before the court has set a trial date.   See CCP 428.10; CCP 428.50(a), (b).  If the foregoing time constraint is not met,  the party seeking to file such a cross-complaint must obtain leave of  court.  CCP 428.50(c).  Leave to file a late permissive  cross-complaint is within the trial court’s discretion.  Crocker National Bank (1990) 221 CA3d  852, 864.     Allowing the filing of the proposed cross-complaint will  be in the interests of justice and judicial economy as it will allow all issues  related to the facts and circumstances raised in Plaintiffs’ complaint to be  resolved on one action.  See City  of Hanford (1989) 208 CA3d 580, 587.   Further, no opposition to the relief requested has been filed.     CONCLUSION   The motion is filed.   JW Brands and Markstein are ordered to separately file the  cross-complaint which is attached to the Ovando declaration as Exhibit A.
