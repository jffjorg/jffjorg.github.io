And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the petitioners, granting relief from the Government Code 945.4. The petitioners, who were minors at the time, had filed late claims with the County of Los Angeles after initially filing with the wrong government entity. The judge found that the petitioners had acted reasonably in filing their claims late and that there was no evidence of carelessness or prejudice to the respondent. The judge relied on Government Code 946.6(c)(2), which provides relief from claims presentation requirements when a minor is involved, and on prior case law that favors granting relief to petitioners in similar situations.
