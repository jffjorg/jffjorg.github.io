And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against 024 Management Services, Inc., Tim McCandless, and Michael Wayman. The cross-complaint is filed by JW Brands, LLC and Derek Markstein, who are defendants in the original lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Chris Lacroix and Martin Willerford, who alleged that the defendants breached a written agreement and fraudulently induced them to provide startup capital.

JW Brands and Markstein claim that they never had contact with the plaintiffs and were informed by 024 Management, McCandless, and Wayman that the proposed business deal with the plaintiffs was never consummated. They also claim that they only became aware of the alleged agreement and the $75,000 payment through discovery in the original lawsuit.

The Judge found that allowing the filing of the cross-complaint would be in the interests of justice and judicial economy, as it would allow all issues related to the facts and circumstances raised in the original complaint to be resolved in one action. The Judge also noted that no opposition to the relief requested was filed.
