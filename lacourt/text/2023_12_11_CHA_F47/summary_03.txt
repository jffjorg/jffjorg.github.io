And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants Stewart Silver and Oceans 11 RV Park, LLC dba Cali Lake RV Resort (collectively, "defendants") against plaintiff Peter Farkas's First Amended Complaint. The demurrer challenges the entire complaint, alleging that it is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled as to causes of action 1 (breach of implied warranty of habitability), 2 (negligence), and 6 (violation of Bane Act), and sustained with 30 days leave to amend as to causes of action 3 (negligent hiring), 4 (intentional infliction of emotional distress), 5 (negligent infliction of emotional distress), and 7 (private nuisance).

The judge found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support claims for breach of implied warranty of habitability and negligence, and that the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently outrageous to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the judge found that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support claims for negligent hiring, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and private nuisance.
