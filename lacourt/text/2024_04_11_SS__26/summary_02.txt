And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The court has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint is sustained in its entirety, meaning that the allegations made by the plaintiff are insufficient to support the claims of fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract. The court has also denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's demurrer. The court has ruled that the plaintiff's claims are not sufficient to state a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract, and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support these claims.
