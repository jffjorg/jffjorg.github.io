Clifford Johnson v. RAR2 – Villa Marina Center
CA SPE, et al.MOTIONS TO COMPEL
(CCP §§ 2023.010, 2023.030, and 2030.290.)
Background
            On August
7, 2023, Clifford Johnson filed a Complaint against several defendants, all
either owners or lessors of real property, for violation of the Unruh Civil
Rights Act. Plaintiff alleges that on May 6, 2023, Plaintiff experienced
difficulty with accessing the public accommodations the defendants allegedly
provide. (Complaint, ¶ 4-6.) The motions now before the Court are:
 
1.     
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Pizzarito Inc.’s Answers
to Special Interrogatories
2.     
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel RAR2 – Villa Marina Center
CA SPE’s Answers to Special Interrogatories
(hereinafter, the Motions)
 
            Both
Defendant Pizzarito Inc. (Pizzarito), and RAR2 – Villa Marina Center CA SPE’s
(RAR2) oppose the respective motions aimed at them. No reply was filed.  
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
            If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, unless
“[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290, subds.
(a)(1), (a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a
party does not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-906.)
 
Analysis
            Plaintiff provides the Declaration of Morse Mehrban
(Mehrban Decl.) for both Motions. The declaration states that on December 1,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served Special Interrogatories (Set 1) on both
Pizzarito and RAR2. (Mehrban Decl., ¶ 3.) Although Plaintiff’s counsel followed
up with an email on January 16, 2024, well after the 30-day deadline, no
responses were ever received. (Mehrban Decl., ¶ 3.) Defense counsel for both
Pizzarito and RAR2 argues that he informed Plaintiff’s counsel he was in trial.
However, the initial discovery was propounded on December 1, 2023, the instant
Motions were not filed until February 27, 2024. Defense counsel fails to
explain why no responses were served in the 3 months since the initial
discovery was propounded. Therefore, the Motions are granted, and sanctions
warranted. Plaintiff’s counsel provides the following calculations”
 
·        
Counsel’s hourly rate is $500 per hour
·        
Counsel states that he spent 1 hour per Motion
 
Accordingly, the Court
will impose a monetary sanction of $500 each on Pizzarito and RAR2.
 
Conclusion
 
            Both the
Motion to Compel Pizzarito Inc.’s Answers to Special Interrogatories and the
Motion to Compel RAR2 – Villa Marina Center CA SPE’s Answers to Special
Interrogatories are GRANTED. Monetary sanctions in the amount of
$500 each will be imposed on Defendants Pizzarito, Inc and RAR2 – Villa Marina
Center CA SPE, Inc. and be awarded to Plaintiff. Both the response and the
monetary sanctions are to be received by Plaintiff within 30 days of this
order.
