Discussion
 
Legal Standard
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 2033.250, provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days
after service of the request for admissions . . . the party to whom the
requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the
requesting party.” A motion to deem admitted requests for admissions lies based
upon a showing of failure to respond timely. (CCP §2033.280(b); Demyer v.
Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved
on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.)
Requests for admissions must be deemed admitted where no responses in
substantial compliance was served before the hearing. (CCP §2033.280(c).) As to
motions to deem matters admitted, no meet and confer is required. (Demyer v.
Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 393, 395, overruled
on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973, 983.
Also see Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 904–906, 169
Cal.Rptr. 42 [rejecting argument that state rule of court requiring
informal meet and confer applied to motion where no response at all had been
made to interrogatory requests, reasoning that because objections had been
waived for failure to timely answer, there was “nothing to ‘resolve’ with the
meaning” of the rule)].) 
 
Analysis
            Plaintiff provides the Declaration of Laura M. D’Anna
(D’Anna Decl.) which states that on December 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
propounded Requests for Admissions (Set 1) on Defendant. (D’Anna Decl., ¶ 2.)
When no responses were received by the 30-day deadline, Plaintiff filed this
Motion. To date, no responses have been served. 
Therefore, the Motion is
granted. 
 
Conclusion
            Loan Asset Issuer II LLC Serious
2020 1’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted is GRANTED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
