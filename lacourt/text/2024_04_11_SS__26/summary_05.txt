Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to quash filed by Treehouse Botanicals Corporation, ruling that the service of summons was proper. The court found that the service was made in accordance with CCP 416.10, which requires service of a corporation to be made on a designated agent for service of process or a president, chief executive officer, vice president, secretary, treasurer, or chief financial officer. The court also noted that the service was made in person, as the process server left a copy of the summons and complaint at the storefront of Treehouse Botanicals Corporation. The court concluded that the service was proper and that Treehouse Botanicals Corporation's motion to quash was denied.
