And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to take the motion to vacate default and default judgment off the calendar. The motion was filed by defendant David Shenky on December 14, 2023, and was unopposed. However, the court ordered the defendant to file proof of service of the motion papers and notice of the hearing date on the plaintiff by March 14, 2024. Despite this, the defendant failed to file any proof of service by the deadline and again by the new deadline of April 8, 2024. The court finds that the defendant did not comply with its own orders and has therefore decided to take the motion off the calendar.
