On August 8, 2022, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”)
filed its Complaint against Kayla Isaac (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10,
asserting a single cause of action for subrogation.  
 
On
June 20, 2022, this case settled.  The
parties entered into a settlement pursuant to a Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment and Installment Payments (the "Stipulation" ).  The Stipulation calls for the Court to retain
jurisdiction over this matter to enforce the terms of the settlement pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6. 
(Declaration of Brian P. Tapper (“Tapper Decl.) ¶ 2; Ex. “A.”) 
 
The
Stipulation calls for Defendant  to make
monthly payments to Plaintiff, commencing on August 25, 2022.  The settlement was in the sum amount of $
7,067.00.  Up to that time, Defendant had
made S1,400.00 in payments.  Defendant
has defaulted on the terms of payment as set forth in the Stipulation by reason
of Defendant’s failure to make monthly payments due on or after June 25,
2023.  The interest begins on October 21,
2019, which is stated in the Stipulation. 
(Id. ¶ 3.)
 
                On February 13,
2023, Plaintiff filed its instant motion to enforce settlement agreement and
enter judgment against Defendant on the grounds that Defendant has failed to
adhere to the terms of the settlement agreement.  No opposition has been filed to Plaintiff’s
motion.  
 
Discussion 
 
Enforcement of settlement agreements is
governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  This statute provides, in relevant part: If
the parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.  If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6,
subd. (a).)  Strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement
agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff moves for an order to enforce
the settlement against Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6.  It is not disputed (a) that
Plaintiff and Defendant signed a written settlement agreement in August and
September 2022, respectively; and (b) that Defendant had made S1,400.00 in
payments before defaulting on the terms of payment.  (Tapper Decl., ¶¶ 2-3; Ex. “A.”)   Also, the Court retained jurisdiction in this
case to enforce settlement pursuant to section 664.6 since such was requested
when the case was dismissed.  (Id.
¶ 2.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to an order enforcing the settlement
agreement with Defendant.  
 
Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion to enforce the settlement agreement is GRANTED.  Judgment is entered against Defendant in the
sum amount of $8,314.95 pursuant to paragraph 1, 4, and 5 of the Stipulation as
follows: $5,667.62
unpaid principal; $2,422.33 interest at the rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid
principal; $225.00 costs for filing and service of process.
