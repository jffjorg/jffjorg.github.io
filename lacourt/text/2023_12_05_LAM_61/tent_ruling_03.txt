Defendant to give notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL
A party may conduct discovery by propounding
interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories
by answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the interrogatories. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290.) 
 
A
party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.)
Defendant Silvia Romo (Defendant) served Plaintiffs
Valentina Gonzalez and Ricardo Ruiz Gonzalez (Plaintiffs) with Form
Interrogatories (General) on July 25, 2023. (Heim Decl. ¶ 2.) As of the date of
the filing of these motions on September 12, 2023, no responses have been
served. (Heim Decl. ¶ 3.) No opposition to the motions has been filed.
 
Defendant’s motions are GRANTED.
 
II.    SANCTIONS
The
prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary
sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Sanctions are
also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve responses to requests for
admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant seeks $297.50 in sanctions in connection with the
motion directed against Ricardo Ruiz Gonzalez, and $772.50 in connection with
the motion against Valentina Gonzalez, representing respectively one half-hour
and 1.5 hours of attorney work at $475 per hour, plus two $60 filing fees.
(Heim Decl. ¶¶ 4–6.)
 
Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiffs and their counsel
in the amount of $1,070.
