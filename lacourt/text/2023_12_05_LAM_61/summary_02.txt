Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 19STCV24054. The case involves a motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued by Plaintiff Cedric Price to AT&T Communications, requesting all cell phone records of Shayan Ghalari's phone number from December 12, 2018 to May 30, 2019. The defendants, Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company and Shayan Ghalari, argue that the subpoena requests compliance earlier than the 20 days provided for in Code of Civil Procedure § 2020.410 and that the subpoena sweeps too broadly by seeking all phone records for the given period, rather than those related to the transaction at issue.

The judge has granted the motion to quash the subpoena, finding that there is no good cause for the subpoena. The judge notes that the plaintiff's own phone records do not reveal the claimed conversation, and the redacted phone records produced by Ghalari do not reveal the claimed conversation either. The judge also finds that the balance of privacy in this interest weighs against the relative breadth of discovery that the plaintiff requests in this subpoena.

The judge has denied the defendants' request for sanctions of $1,710.00, representing six hours of attorney work at $275 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.
