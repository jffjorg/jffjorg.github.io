And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mardani v. County of Los Angeles, denying the County's motion for summary adjudication of its claim for specific performance against the Mardanis. The County had argued that the Mardanis had failed to install a backwater valve on their property as required by a contract settlement in 2013. The Mardanis had countered that the contractual promise was an independent covenant, supported only by a $500 allowance, which provided inadequate consideration for the installation of the valve. The Judge found that the County had not satisfied its prima facie burden to establish entitlement to summary adjudication, as it had not shown the absence of a triable issue on any element of the claim for specific performance. The Judge noted that a claim for specific performance is an equitable one, and that the County had failed to establish the required elements, including the inadequacy of its legal remedy, the reasonableness of the obligation imposed on the Mardanis, and the mutuality of remedies.
