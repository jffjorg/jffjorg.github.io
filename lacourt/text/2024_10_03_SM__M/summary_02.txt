Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous denial of the defendant's ex parte application for a stay of execution of judgment and an order shortening time for service and hearing on a motion to set aside the judgment. The defendant argues that the court should set aside the judgment due to the defendant's disability and excusable neglect in not appearing in person as ordered. However, the court finds that the defendant has not presented any new or different facts to support the motion, and that the defendant's arguments are based on information that could have been presented at the prior hearing or trial. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1008 and other relevant laws to support its decision.
