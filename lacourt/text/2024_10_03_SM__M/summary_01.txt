Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to change the venue of the action from Los Angeles County to Kern County. The defendants argued that Kern County was the proper venue because the plaintiff's causes of action regarding the corporate governance of ANA International Corp. must be brought in the county where the corporation's principal place of business is located. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's evidence showed that ANA's principal place of business is in Los Angeles County, and therefore the venue is proper.

The judge also awarded the plaintiff attorney's fees in the amount of $7,540, finding that the defendants' motion was made in bad faith and without reasonable basis.
