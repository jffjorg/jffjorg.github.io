And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint (FAC) adding new causes of action for negligent hiring, Business and Professions Code section 17200, and breach of fiduciary duty. The motion is granted because the plaintiff has a right to amend the pleading prior to the hearing on the defendant's demurrer, and no defendant has filed an answer. The plaintiff is directed to serve and file the amended pleading within 10 days.
