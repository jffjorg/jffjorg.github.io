ELIAS GONZALEZ LORENZO, et al.,
 
  
         vs.
 
KIA MOTORS AMERICA, INC. 


 Case No.: 
  19STCV00228
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 17, 2025



 
Defendant Kia
Motors America, Inc.’s motion to stay this matter pending the California
Supreme Court’s ruling on Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th
209, 222-223, is denied.
 
Defendant a Motors America, Inc. (“KA”) (“Defendant”) moves
to stay this action pending the
California Supreme Court’s ruling on Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 209, 222-223.  (Notice
Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On December 12, 2023, this Court
denied Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. 
At the hearing on Defendant’s motion, this Court declined to follow Rodriguez v. FCA
US, LLC (2022)
77 Cal.App.5th 209, 222-223, because at the time it was non-binding, persuasive
authority.
Defendant filed the instant
motion on September 24, 2024.  Plaintiffs
filed their opposition on January 6, 2025. 
Defendant filed its reply on January 10, 2025.
 
On October 31, 2024, the
California Supreme Court issued its decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2024) 17 Cal.5th 189.
 
Discussion
Courts have broad discretion to
stay cases in the interest of efficiency and justice. Every court has the “inherent
power, in its discretion, to stay proceedings when such a stay will accommodate
the ends of justice.”  (See St. Paul Fire
and Marine Insurance Company v. AmerisourceBergen Corp. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1, 6-7.)  The Code of Civil Procedure further empowers every court to “provide
for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it.” (C.C.P. §128(a)(3); see C.C.P. §187 [conferring on
courts and judicial officers “all the means necessary” to carry out their
jurisdiction].)
Here, a stay is not
warranted.  The California Supreme Court
issued its opinion in Rodriguez on October 31, 2024.  There is
no reason for this Court to delay this action. 
Should Defendants need to file any motions in light of a change of law,
any such motion is far more appropriate than the instant one.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to stay this action is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to stay this action is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
