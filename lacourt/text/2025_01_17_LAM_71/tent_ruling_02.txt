Detainer Stipulation filed June 8, 2023, signed by Judge Mark A. Borenstein (D-RJN,

Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.)
The demurring party shall file and serve with the demurrer
a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which the
demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject
to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the
objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party who filed the pleading
subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request of the
demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Moving Defendant’s counsel submitted a meet and confer
declaration stating that she attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff
telephonically, via email, and by text message on December 18, 19, and 20,
2024.  (See Decl. of
Windler ¶3.)  Moving
Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer with Plaintiff are sufficient under C.C.P.
§430.41(a).  Accordingly, the Court will
consider Moving Defendant’s demurrer.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed
his initial Complaint on March 27, 2024, against Moving Defendant and
Non-moving Defendants Winston Cenac, Trustee of the Island Boy Trust (“Cenac”),
Shelby Ring (“Ring”), the Law Offices of Rebecca Hufford-Cohen (“Law Offices”),
and On Time (“On Time”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging four causes of
action: (1) illegal eviction; (2) illegal theft; (3) discrimination; and (4)
fraud.  On July 15, 2024, this Court
sustained Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  (7/15/24 Minute Order.)
On August 5,
2024, Plaintiff filed his first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging seven causes
of action: (1) wrongful eviction; (2) discrimination in violation of FEHA; (3)
breach of contract; (4) conversion; (5) negligence; (6) fraud and
misrepresentation; and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress.
On November 11,
2024, this Court sustained Moving Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC without leave
to amend as to the 1st and 4th causes of action and sustained with 20 days
leave to amend as to the 2nd and 6th causes of action.  (11/13/24 Minute Order.)  Further, this Court, sua sponte, struck
Plaintiff’s 3rd, 5th, and 7th causes of action. 
(11/13/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff filed
the operative SAC on November 22, 2024, alleging six causes of action: (1)
illegal eviction; (2) theft; (3) fraud; (4) discrimination; (5) wrongful
eviction; and (6) conversion.
Plaintiff alleges
he entered into a rental agreement with Cenac for a studio apartment located at
238 1/2 Market St, Venice, CA.  (SAC ¶2.)


Moving Defendant
filed the instant demurrer on December 23, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on January 2,
2025.  As of the date of this hearing no
reply has been filed.
          
A.   Demurrer
Summary of
Demurrer
Moving Defendant
demurs to Plaintiff’s SAC on the grounds that the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th causes
of action were dismissed with prejudice and without leave to amend on November
13, 2024.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-3.)  Moving Defendant demurs to the 3rd and 4th
causes of action on the basis they fail to state facts on which relief may be
granted and are uncertain.  (Demurrer,
pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Fraud (3rd COA)
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.” (Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816 [combining
misrepresentation and scienter as a single element].)

Fraud actions are
subject to strict requirements of particularity in pleading.  (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc.
v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)  Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather
than with general and conclusory allegations.  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  The specificity
requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made,
and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names
of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf
of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the
representation was made.  (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645; West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
Plaintiff alleges
Cenac knowingly and fraudulently obtained a writ of possession by misrepresenting
his ownership status to the court.  (SAC
¶118.)  Plaintiff alleges on or around
August 31, 2023, Cenac filed court documents falsely asserting his continued
ownership of the property, despite having sold it to Moving Defendant in July
2023.  (SAC ¶118.)  Plaintiff alleges Moving Defendant, through
its principal, Jason Panneton, knowingly relied on this invalid writ to mislead
law enforcement and Plaintiff into believing it had lawful authority to enforce
the eviction.  (SAC ¶118.)  Plaintiff alleges on November 9, 2023, Moving
Defendant coordinated the eviction under this pretense, depriving Plaintiff of
his property without court authorization. 
(SAC ¶118.)  
Plaintiff alleges
after selling the property to Moving Defendant, Cenac applied for and obtained
a writ of possession under false pretenses, knowingly misrepresenting his
ownership of the property.  (SAC
¶119.)  
Plaintiff alleges
Cenac deliberately concealed the transfer of ownership, knowing that any disclosure
of the sale would invalidate his standing to seek possession, thereby misleading
the court into granting an unauthorized writ.  (SAC ¶120.) 
Plaintiff alleges this misrepresentation formed the foundation for the
subsequent illegal actions by Moving Defendant. 
(SAC ¶120.)
Plaintiff alleges
Moving Defendant, through its principal, Jason Panneton, misrepresented to law enforcement
and Plaintiff that it had legal authority to enforce the writ of possession, even
though the writ was issued solely in Cenac’s name and did not authorize Moving
Defendant to act.  (SAC ¶121.)
Plaintiff alleges
Moving Defendant knowingly relied on an invalid writ to justify its
unauthorized eviction of Plaintiff and seizure of his property, despite lacking
any legal authorization.  (SAC ¶122.)
Plaintiff alleges
at the time of these representations, Defendants were fully aware of their
falsity.  (SAC ¶123.)  Plaintiff alleges Cenac knew he no longer had
any ownership or legal standing to obtain or enforce a writ of possession after
selling the property in July 2023.  (SAC
¶123.)  Plaintiff alleges Moving Defendant
knew it was not named in the writ and had no independent court authorization to
enforce it.  (SAC ¶123.)  Plaintiff alleges their continued reliance on
this fraudulent writ demonstrates deliberate intent to mislead Plaintiff and
law enforcement into believing their actions were lawful.  (SAC ¶123.) 

Plaintiff alleges
Defendants acted with the intent to deceive Plaintiff, law enforcement, and the
court.  (SAC ¶124.)  Plaintiff alleges these representations were
deliberately made to prevent Plaintiff from challenging the legality of the
eviction and property seizure; expedite the unlawful eviction and confiscation
of Plaintiff’s belongings without due process; and bypass the statutory
requirements for notifying and handling Plaintiff’s property after eviction.  (SAC ¶¶124-127.)
Plaintiff alleges
Defendants’ coordinated actions demonstrate a deliberate effort to mislead
Plaintiff and law enforcement into believing that their actions were lawful.  (SAC ¶128.) 
Plaintiff alleges he reasonably relied on Moving Defendant’s
representations due to its apparent authority and actions consistent with
lawful eviction procedures.  (SAC
¶129.)  Plaintiff alleges Moving
Defendant directed law enforcement in executing the eviction and falsely represented
itself as authorized under the court-issued writ of possession, creating the appearance
of legitimate authority.  (SAC
¶130.)  Plaintiff alleges he had no
reason to suspect the writ’s invalidity, as Moving Defendant presented itself
as the successor landlord operating under court authorization.  (SAC ¶131.) 
Plaintiff alleges Moving Defendant’s conduct, including delivering
notices and accepting rent payments, further reinforced this assumption.  (SAC ¶131.) 
Plaintiff alleges his reliance on these representations was both
reasonable and justified under the circumstances, as Plaintiff had no access to
the court records or knowledge of the writ’s fraudulent procurement.  (SAC ¶132.)
Plaintiff alleges
as a direct result of Defendants’ fraudulent misrepresentations, Plaintiff
suffered substantial harm, including but not limited to Loss of Property:
Defendants unlawfully seized Plaintiff’s personal property, valued at over
$150,000, including essential work equipment, furniture, and irreplaceable
items; Financial Loss: Plaintiff’s remote work was disrupted, leading to
significant lost income and financial instability; and Emotional Distress: The
unlawful eviction and deprivation of Plaintiff’s property caused severe
emotional suffering, including anxiety, stress, and mental anguish.  (SAC ¶¶133-136.)
Plaintiff fails
to allege that Moving Defendant made a knowingly false representation; (2) that
Moving Defendant intended to deceive or induce reliance by Plaintiff; or (3) that
Plaintiff justifiably relied on any representation by Defendant’s, and nor has
Plaintiff established that he can make such allegations.  
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s demurrer to the 3rd cause of action is sustained without
20 leave to amend.
 
Discrimination (4th
COA)
The elements of
the cause of action for housing discrimination are: (1) Plaintiff was a member
of a protected class; (2) applied for and was qualified for a housing
accommodation; (3) was denied a housing accommodation; and (4) circumstantial
evidence of discriminatory motive, such as similarly situated individuals
applied for and obtained housing.  (Department
of Fair Employment and Housing v. Superior Court (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 896, 902.)
Plaintiff fails
to allege he filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and
Housing (“DFEH”) against Moving Defendant prior to filing the instant
action.  (See Govt. Code
§12980(h).)
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s demurrer to the 4th cause of action is sustained without
leave to amend.

 
Conclusion
Moving
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is sustained without leave to
amend as to the 3rd and 4th causes of action.
Moving Party to
give notice.
 
B.    Motion to Strike
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading” and/or “strike out all or part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.” A motion to strike should be applied cautiously and sparingly because
it is used to strike substantive defects.  (PH II, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1683.)  The grounds for a motion to strike must
appear on the face of the pleading under attack, or from matter which the court
may judicially notice.  (C.C.P. §437.)
 
Dismissed Claims
Illegal Eviction,
Theft, Wrongful Eviction, & Conversion (1st, 2nd, 5th, & 6th COAs
“A court is not required to tolerate purported amended complaint
that fails to amend previous pleading, is not filed in good faith, is filed
in disregard of established procedural requirements, or is otherwise
violative or orderly judicial administration.” 
(Tostevin v. Douglas (1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 321, 331, quoting Neal
v. Bank of America National Trust & Savings Association (1949) 93
Cal.App.2d 678, 682-683, emphasis added.) 

Moving Defendant’s motion to strike Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 5th, and
6th causes of action in the SAC is granted because they exceed the scope of
this Court’s granting of leave to amend. 
This Court dismissed these causes of action without leave to amend
on November 13, 2024.  (11/13/24 Minute
Order.)  Plaintiff can no longer state
these causes of action in his SAC.
Accordingly, the Court strikes Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th causes of
action in Plaintiff’s SAC.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s motion to strike Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 5th, and
6th causes of action in Plaintiff’s SAC is granted without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
