And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Whitney Werner. The plaintiff had sought a default judgment for $43,982.02, comprised of $43,369.02 in damages and $613 in costs. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not shown that Werner was properly served with the summons and complaint, and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a default judgment. The judge noted that the plaintiff's proof of service did not show any attempts at personal service, and that usually two or three attempts at personal service must be made before substitute service is allowed. The judge also cited case law to support the decision, noting that the court has no jurisdiction to enter default where a defendant was not properly served.
