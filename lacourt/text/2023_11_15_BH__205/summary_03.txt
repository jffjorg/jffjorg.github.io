And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to deem admitted the requests for admissions (RFAs) served on September 14, 2023, and imposes monetary sanctions on the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to the RFAs, which consisted of 13 requests pertaining to facts relevant to the case. The court finds that the defendant's efforts to communicate with the plaintiff regarding outstanding discovery were unsuccessful, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond was the result of neglect. The court concludes that the mandatory sanction of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c) requires the imposition of a monetary sanction in the amount of $1,425. The court also awards attorneys' fees in the amount of $1,710. The ruling is subject to change before the final hearing on November 15, 2023.
