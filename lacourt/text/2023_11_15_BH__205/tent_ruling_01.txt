  Case Number:  22SMCV00741    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  November 15, 2023 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Forwardline Financial LLC v. Whitney Werner, et al. CASE NUMBER:  22SMCV00741  COMP. FILED:  May 23, 2022    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Forwardline Financial LLC  RESPONDING PARTY: Whitney Werner   BACKGROUND This case arises from breach of a loan agreement.  Defendant Roast Inc. entered into a written loan agreement with Plaintiff Forwardline Financial LLC for $59,890.  Defendant Whitney Werner executed a personal guarantee that if Roast Inc. defaulted, he would be personally and unconditionally liable to Plaintiff.  Roast Inc. failed to make payments under the loan agreement.   On May 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants.  The Complaint alleges three claims for breach of written contract, breach of personal guarantee and account stated.  The Complaint seeks $43,369.02 in damages plus attorneys’ fees and costs.    Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Werner was served by substitute service on June 4, 2022.  Werner was obligated to respond within 30 days. Werner did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Werner’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on April 25, 2023.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on September 5, 2023. Plaintiff served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.  Defendant has not appeared.  RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Werner for a total of $43,982.02, which is comprised of: (1) $43,369.02, for damages and (2) $613, for costs.   ANALYSIS  Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc.  585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has not shown Werner was properly served with the summons and complaint.  The Court has no jurisdiction to enter default where a defendant was not properly served.  (Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal. App. 4th 1193, 1200.)  Plaintiff claims it served Werner by substitute service, but the proof of service does not show any attempts were made at personal service.  Ordinarily two or three attempts at personal service must be made before substitute service is allowed.  (Id. at 1202.)  CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Forwardline Financial LLC’s Request for Default Judgment is DENIED as to Defendant Whitney Werner.
