And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lori Murphy vs Prime Healthcare Services – Sherman Oaks, LLC dba Sherman Oaks Hospital. The Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings against the First Amended Complaint, but the Judge has denied the motion. The Judge found that the complaint is not uncertain simply because it is titled "intentional tort", and that the lack of a prayer for damages does not prevent the Defendant from reasonably responding. The Judge also found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to notify the Defendant that the action is grounded in battery, and that actual damages can be disclosed during discovery. The Judge further found that the Defendant's argument that the attack was outside the course and scope of employment is improper for a motion for judgment on the pleadings, as it requires a review of facts outside the pleading. The Judge ordered the Defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
