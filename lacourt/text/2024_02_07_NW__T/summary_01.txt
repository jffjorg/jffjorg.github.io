And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Gina Watson's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff is ordered to file Form LASC LACIV 105 to substitute the true name of Doe 1 within 5 days. The judge also notes that Non-Party Serve All, Help All Inc. dba Nonprofit Alliance of Consumer Advocates (NACA) generally appeared in the action despite the Plaintiff's failure to file an amendment to substitute the true name of the party defendant. As a result, the judge considered the merits of the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave, NACA's opposition, and REO's joinder. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the requirements of substituting a party's true name is a procedural defect that can be cured by filing the required form. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff's declaration submitted with the Motion for Leave complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. The judge's ruling does not prejudice NACA or REO, and therefore grants the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave. The judge also notes that NACA and REO's motions to compel arbitration and stay the action are deemed MOOT and taken OFF-CALENDAR.
