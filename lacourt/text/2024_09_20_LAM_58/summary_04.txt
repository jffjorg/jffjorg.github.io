And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff Oscar Alvarado Ortiz to prohibit the destruction of evidence, specifically product supply records related to the sale, distribution, supply, delivery, and/or receipt of stone slabs. The records are critical evidence in determining the proportionate liability of the defendants in supplying stone slab products to the fabrication shops where the plaintiff worked and which purportedly caused his alleged silicosis. The Judge has also overruled the objections of Dal-Tile Defendants and Mohawk Industries, Inc. to the declaration of Raphael Metzger. The Judge has jurisdiction to enforce the subpoenas sent to non-parties who may be served with requests for these records. The proposed preservation order is not overbroad and is limited to the time period the plaintiff alleges he worked for the third-party employers and was exposed to the stone slabs giving rise to his injuries.
