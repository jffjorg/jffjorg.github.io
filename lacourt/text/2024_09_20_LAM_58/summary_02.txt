Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action alleged in the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC alleges causes of action for declaratory relief, removal of director, conversion, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty against the Church and its pastor, David R. Harris. The court rules that the conversion, fraud, and fiduciary duty claims lack specificity and fail to state causes of action. The court grants leave to amend the FAC to cure these defects.
