And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City requests that the court take judicial notice of various documents, including Assembly Bill No. 26, the Statement of Proceedings for the County Board of Supervisors' Public Hearing and Closed Session Meeting, the County's 2045 Climate Action Plan, and a reporter's transcript of a previous court hearing. The court grants the City's request for judicial notice of the legislative history and the 2020 and 2045 Climate Action Plans. The City also requests judicial notice of a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power fact sheet and a Proposed State Strategy issued by the California Air Resources Board, but the court denies the request for judicial notice of the fact sheet.

The court concludes that the 2020 Unincorporated County Climate Action Plan only applies to the unincorporated County and not to the City. The City's approvals of the Project are not subject to CEQA, and all other non-CEQA causes of action challenging the City's approvals are barred by the 90-day statute of limitations. The court denies the City's motion to dismiss the case.
