[1] The
City requests judicial notice of (1) Assembly Bill No. 26 (ABx1 26) (RJN Ex. A);
(2) the Statement of Proceedings for the April 16, 2024 Public Hearing and
Closed Session Meeting of the County Board of Supervisors (RJN Ex. B); (3) the County’s
2045 Climate Action Plan (“CAP”) dated April 2024 (RJN Ex. C); (4) the 2020 Unincorporated
County CAP dated August 2015 (RJN Ex. D); and a reporter’s transcript of the court’s
May 21, 2024 hearing on the City’s motion to dismiss (RJN Ex. E).  
The legislative history (RJN Ex. A) is judicially
noticed.  Evid. Code §452(d).  The Board of Supervisors’ Statement of
Proceedings and the 2020 and 2045 CAPs (RJN Exs. B-D) are official acts and are
judicially noticed.  Evid. Code
§452(c).  There is no need to judicially
notice the May 21, 2024 transcript (RJN Ex. E); the court can always consider court
records and transcripts from the pending case.
In reply, the City requests judicial notice of a Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power (“DWP”) fact sheet on the Silver Lake
Reservoir Complex Bypass Pipeline (RJN Ex. 1) and a Proposed State Strategy for
the State Implementation Plan dated August 12, 2022 issued by the California
Air Resources Board on September 22, 2020 (RJN Ex. 2).  The latter is an official act and RJN Ex. 2
is judicially noticed.  Evid. Code
§452(c).  The fact sheet (RJN Ex. 1) is
not an official act and the request for judicial notice is denied.


[2] The previous 2020 CCAP (the Unincorporated
Los Angeles County Community Climate Action Plan 2020), by its name and its
terms, also only applies to the unincorporated County.  RJN Ex. D, pp. 19, 21.

Any amendment of the FAC would be futile because
all other non-CEQA causes of action challenging the City’s August 23, 2023
approvals of the Project are barred by the 90-day statute of limitations under
Government Code 65009(c)(1)(E).  Dem. at
9-10.
