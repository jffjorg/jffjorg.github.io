  Case Number:  23STCP03955    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  85 
Stephen Grey v. Kim Johnson, Director of California
Department of Social Services, 23STCP03955

Tentative decision on petition
for administrative mandamus:    denied



 
Petitioner Stephen Grey
(“Grey”), on behalf of his son Jackson Grey (“Jackson”), seeks mandamus compelling
Respondents Kim Johnson, Director of the California Department of Social
Services (“DSS”) to set aside its two Hearings
Division decisions.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. Third Amended Petition
            On
January 9, 2024, Petitioner Grey filed the Third Amended Petition (“TAP”) against
Respondent DSS and Real Parties-in-Interest California Department of Health
Care Services (“DHCS”), Kaiser Permanente (“Kaiser”), and Los Angeles County’s Department
of Mental Health (“LACDMH”), alleging causes of action for administrative
mandamus and/or traditional mandamus. The verified TAP alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
            In
early December 2017, Petitioner Grey became concerned because his
two-and-half-year-old son, Jackson, was increasingly hitting, pushing, and
dangerously hurting other children at his pre-school.  TAP, ¶1.  Jackson’s preschool suggested that he
should have an aide with him at school for the foreseeable future who would be
able to help him and also ensure other children were not at risk.  TAP, ¶1.
 The school warned that Jackson
would be asked to leave the school if an aide was not secured, and Jackson’s
behavior continued.  TAP, ¶1.
            On December 4, 2017, Grey
spoke with Geri Wexler (“Wexler”), Kaiser’s insurance provider administering
Jackson’s health care plan.  TAP, ¶2.  Grey
asked if Kaiser would be able to help with Jackson’s dangerous behavioral
issues.  TAP, ¶2. 
Wexler stated that Kaiser is not equipped to provide behavioral therapy
for children as young as Jackson, nor is Kaiser equipped to provide aide
assistance for any child whatever their age.  TAP, ¶2.  Wexler informed Grey that his
only option would be to work with Beacon, the company with which Kaiser outsources
services not offered directly in-house at Kaiser.  TAP, ¶2.  
When Grey spoke to
Beacon, it stated that it does not work with children under five years old.  TAP, ¶2.  Grey was told that his only
option would be to pay out-of-pocket for those services from a third party.  TAP, ¶2.  At no point did Wexler or
Beacon mention LACDMH or Special Services for Groups (“SSG”) as options.  TAP, ¶2.  Wexler recommended that Grey
meet with Manuel Fonseca of Kaiser (“Fonseca”) on December 5, 2017.  TAP, ¶2.  
            On December 5, 2017, Grey
met with Fonseca and asked if Kaiser would be able to help with Jackson’s dangerous
behavioral issues.  TAP, ¶3.  Fonseca
reiterated that Kaiser is not equipped to provide behavioral therapy for
children as young as Jackson, nor is Kaiser equipped to provide aide assistance
for any child, and that Grey’s only option was to pay out-of-pocket for those
services from a third party.  TAP,
¶3.  Fonseca similarly failed to mention LACDMH or SSG
as options.  TAP, ¶3.  Fonseca
recommended that Grey take Jackson to meet with Kaiser’s Nancy Brown (“Brown”) on
January 10, 2018.  TAP, ¶3.   
            On January 10, 2018, Grey
met with Brown, who provided the same information as Fonseca.  TAP, ¶4.   Brown also provided Grey with some valuable information
and asked that he connect with her in a couple of months for an update.   TAP,
¶4. 

Grey contends that
if any Kaiser representative had suggested before March 22, 2018 that he seek
help from LACDMH or SSG, he would have done so.   TAP,
¶6. 
Since different mental health professionals at Kaiser told him that his
only option was to pay-out-of-pocket, that is what he did.  TAP, ¶7.  
On March 22, 2018, Grey
had his first appointment with Marilee Hartling (“Marilee”) of third-party
Early Childhood Development Associates (“ECDA”), who continued three types of
therapy for Jackson thereafter on a regular basis: (1) ongoing one-on-one
behavioral health and play therapy for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(“ADHD”) and Sensory Processing Disorder; (2) ongoing social skills group
therapy; and (3) an aide to attend school with Jackson to observe and correct
his behavior.   TAP, ¶7.  
            Since Jackson was still
under the age of three at the time, it took several difficult sessions until he
was comfortable enough to make progress with Marilee and her staff.  TAP, ¶8.  Eventually, he became
comfortable and started making progress.  TAP, ¶8.  
Between May 9 and
December 2018, in addition to the behavioral sessions, Grey took Jackson for
regular occupational therapy with Kaiser’s Judith Shari Ungar (“Ungar”) to help
with his Sensory Processing Disorder.  TAP,
¶9. 
Eventually, Judith informed Grey that she would not be able to justify
Jackson’s continued occupational therapy at Kaiser.  TAP, ¶9.  As a result, Jackson went
without any occupational therapy for some time. 
TAP, ¶9.  
On May 15, 2018, Grey
had a follow-up call with Brown from Kaiser and explained that progress had
been going well with Marilee.  TAP,
¶10. 
Brown suggested that Grey and Jackson meet with Kaiser’s in-house child
psychologist, Lilian Honanian (“Honanian”). 
TAP, ¶10.  
On May 17, 2018, Grey
met with Honanian.  TAP, ¶11. 
Since Jackson was making progress with Marilee, and because Honanian
could only offer bi-weekly treatment to patients, she suggested that Jackson
continue with Marilee.  TAP, ¶11.  Grey
continued to pay out-of-pocket for Marilee’s services to maintain continuity of
care for Jackson.  TAP, ¶11.  
On August 17, 2018, Grey
filed a grievance with Kaiser to reimburse him for all aforementioned services,
as well as a request to authorize continued care for Jackson with Marilee.  TAP, ¶20.  On August 31, 2018, Kaiser
informed Grey by mail that it would reimburse him for those services through
August 2018.  TAP, ¶21.  The
amount would be $6,650 (later corrected to $7,430).  TAP, ¶21.  Also on August 31, 2018,
Kaiser informed Grey that it would not reimburse him for services after August
31, 2018, and would not be authorizing Jackson’s continued care with Marilee.  TAP, ¶22.  Grey should seek these services through
LACDMH.  TAP, ¶22.  
At this point, three
different people -- (1) Marilee from ECDA, (2) Eileen from L.A. Child Guidance
Clinic, and (3) Honanian from Kaiser -- all told Grey in some way that
switching Jackson’s therapists after he had spent months building a rapport was
not a good idea.  TAP, ¶19.
Grey filed an appeal
with Kaiser to reimburse him for all new services paid for since August 2018,
as well as to authorize continued care for Jackson with Marilee.  TAP, ¶24.  On October 15, 2018, Kaiser
informed Grey by telephone, and later by mail, that it would not reimburse him
for services after August 31, 2018 and would not authorize continued care with
Marilee.  TAP, ¶26.
Grey was told that
if he wished to pursue things further, he could request an Independent Medical
Review with DHCS.  TAP, ¶26.  On
October 15, 2018, Grey did so.  TAP,
¶27. 
On May 20, 2020, Erin Sullivan-Pico, Assistant Chief Counsel at DHCS,
informed Grey that, even if Kaiser providers Brown, Wexler, and Manuel gave him
incorrect information, it was outside DHSC’s jurisdiction.  TAP, ¶34. 
In December 2020,
Grey was referred to a LACDMH provider, Children’s Institute, that claimed it would
be equipped to handle Jackson’s mental health needs.  TAP, ¶65.  During an initial call on
December 17, 2020, Colleen Flores from the Children’s Institute informed Grey that
it was only seeing patients remotely at that time.  TAP, ¶65.  Grey explained that this
would be difficult for Jackson but he decided to try anyway.  TAP, ¶65.  Between January 6 and
February 2, 2021, Jackson met remotely with Colleen Flores but Jackson threw
tantrums, left the room, and was generally disinterested in the remote sessions.  TAP, ¶65.  
Grey decided to work
with a highly recommended in-person therapist, Jacqueline Steinberg (“Steinberg”)
who was seeing patients in-person.  TAP,
¶66. 
Jackson started working with Jacqueline in person in February 2021.  TAP, ¶66.  While it took a couple of
sessions for Jackson to feel comfortable with her, it was highly effective.  TAP, ¶66.  Jackson has been working with
Steinberg for some time and Grey has seen significant improvements in his
demeanor and his behavior.  TAP, ¶66.  
On October 26, 2021,
Grey formally submitted a Medi-Cal Claim Form For Beneficiary Reimbursement to
DHCS in an amount of $50,054.  TAP,
¶70. 
DHCS split this claim up, reviewing some of it directly and forwarding
the rest to LACDMH.  TAP, ¶70.  On
March 21, 2022, Grey received DHCS’s denial of reimbursement for its portion.  TAP, ¶71.  On May 31, 2022, Grey received
LACDMH’s denial of reimbursement for its portion.  TAP, ¶72.
On October 4, 2022, Grey
participated in DSS’s administrative hearing process to dispute these
denials.  TAP, ¶73.  
On November 9, 2022,
the first Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) issued a decision which stated: (a) the
first administrative hearing would only address two portions of the $50,054 claim;
(b) the $7,960 and $3,514 portions are denied for reimbursement; (c) that the
remaining $38,580 is under the jurisdiction of LACDMH; and (d) the remaining
$38,580 portion would be assigned to a second administrative hearing to take
place on a different date in the future. 
TAP, ¶74.  Grey submitted a request for rehearing and, on
December 29, 2022, DHCS denied the rehearing request.  TAP, ¶¶ 75-76.
On February 21,
2023, Grey participated in the second administrative hearing.  TAP, ¶77.  On April 28, 2023, the second
ALJ issued a decision denying the $38,580 for reimbursement.  TAP, ¶78.  Grey submitted a request for
rehearing and, on July 13, 2023, DHCS denied the rehearing request.  TAP, ¶¶ 79-80.
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
            On
April 30, 2024, Petitioner Grey filed the TAP.
            On
June 3, 2024, the County filed its Answer.
            On
July 24, 2024, Kaiser, DSS, and DHCS filed their Answer.
 
B. Governing Law
            1.
Medicaid/Medi-Cal
            The Medicaid program
is a federal/state program authorized under title XIX of the Social Security
Act whereby states provide health care to individuals who qualify for
Medicaid benefits if they are aged, blind, or disabled, and their income and
resources are insufficient to meet the costs of health care.  42
U.S.C. §1396a.  The Secretary of the
United States Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for
administering Medicaid and has delegated that authority to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”).  See
42 U.S.C. §§ 1301(a)(6), 1396-1; Arkansas
Dept. of Health & Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, (2006) 547 U.S. 268, 275.  
            To qualify for the
program, a state must submit a state plan, and that state plan must be approved
by CMS.  Douglas v. Indep.
Living Ctr. Of So. Cal., Inc., (2012) 565 U.S. 606, 610-11.  An
approved state plan authorizes the state to implement the Medicaid insurance
program within that state, including the creation of standards for its
implementation.  42 U.S.C. §1396(a)(1), (13).  Such a plan must comply with the provisions
of applicable federal Medicaid law.  42
U.S.C. §1396(a)(5); 42 Code of Federal Regulations (“C.F.R.”)  §§ 430.10, 431.10.
            California’s State
Plan has been approved by CMS, and the Legislature enacted the Medi-Cal
program (Welfare and Institutions (“W&I”) Code
section 14000 et seq.) to implement Medicaid and provides for
medical assistance to certain low-income persons.  Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, (9th
Cir. 1997) 103 F.3d 1491, 1493.  
DHCS is the state agency charged with administration of the
Medi-Cal program.  W&I Code §§ 14063,
10721, 10740; 22 Cal. Code Regs. (“CCR”) §50004.  DHCS’s regulations in 22 CCR implement and
interpret the laws it enforces and also prescribe policies for administration
of the Medi-Cal program.  In implementing
the Medi-Cal program, DHCS must comply with federal and state statutes.  Olszewski v. Scripps Health,
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 804; American Federation of Labor v. Unemployment
Ins. Appeals Bd., (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1017, 1042.  DHCS also must comply with California’s State
Plan.  See Douglas v. Indep.
Living Ctr. of So. Cal., Inc., supra, 565 U.S. at 610-11.
DHCS has ultimate responsibility for the Medi-Cal
program.  42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(5); 42 CFR
§431.10; W&I Code §10740.  DHCS is
responsible for ensuring that DSS and all local district offices that handle
Medi-Cal cases comply with state and federal laws. 42 CFR §431.10.  DHCS must furnish Medicaid promptly to
beneficiaries without any delay caused by the agency's administrative
procedures, continue to furnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible persons until
they are found to be ineligible, and make arrangement to assist applicants and
beneficiaries to get emergency medical care when needed, 24 hours a day and seven
days a week.  42 CFR §435.930.
Every person administering aid under any public assistance
program shall conduct himself with courtesy, consideration, and respect toward
applicants for and recipients of aid under that program, and shall endeavor at
all times to perform his duties in such manner as to secure for every person
the amount of aid to which he is entitled, without attempting to elicit any
information not necessary to carry out the provisions of law applicable to the
program, and without comment or criticism of any fact concerning applicants or
recipients not directly related to the administration of the program.  W&I Code §10500.  This statute imposes a ministerial duty to
give notification to individuals of their right to make an application for
welfare benefits, regardless of the applicant’s eligibility for aid.  Diaz v. Quitoriano, (1969) 268 Cal.
App. 2d 807, 810.  
A county shall (1) perform redeterminations of eligibility
for Medi-Cal beneficiaries every 12 months and (2) promptly redetermine
eligibility whenever the county receives information about changes in a
beneficiary’s circumstances that may affect eligibility for Medi-Cal
benefits.  W&I Code §14005.37(a).  Medi-Cal eligibility shall continue during
the redetermination process and a beneficiary’s Medi-Cal eligibility shall not
be terminated until the county makes a specific determination based on facts clearly
demonstrating that the beneficiary is no longer eligible for Medi-Cal benefits
under any basis.  W&I Code
§14005.37(d).
 
1.   Managed Care
The Medi-Cal program
provides health care coverage to beneficiaries on either a fee-for-service or
managed care basis.  W&I Code §14016.5(b).
 Under fee-for-service, the Medi-Cal beneficiary gets care from any
provider(s) willing to treat the beneficiary and accept reimbursement from DHCS
at a set amount for the services provided.  W&I Code §14016.5(b)(1). With managed
care, DHCS contracts with plans to provide health care to Medi-Cal
beneficiaries. W&I Code §14204. The plans are reimbursed on a capitated basis
-- a predetermined amount per person, regardless of the number of services
provided to a particular person. W&I Code §14301(a).  Where
DHCS requires management care enrollment, it shall not terminate an enrollee’s
access to fee-for-service Medi-Cal until the enrollee has been assigned to a
managed care health plan.  Ibid.  The purpose of managed care programs is to
“reduce costs, prevent unnecessary utilization, reduce inappropriate
utilization, and assure adequate access to quality care for Medicaid recipients.”  Life Care Centers of America v. Cal Optima
(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1169, 1174.
In exercising its
authority to require persons on Medi-Cal to have managed care, DHCS is required
to ensure that managed care plans provide for a continuity of care by
permitting fee-for-service providers with an ongoing relationship with a new
managed care member to continue that relationship for up to 12 months if the
provider will accept Medi-Cal rates and there are no quality of care issues.  W&I Code §14182(b)(13), (14).  DHCS must “[e]nsure that the [medical
exemption request (“MER”)] criteria applied in counties operating under Chapter
4.1 (commencing with Section 53800) or Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section
53900) of Subdivision 1 of Division 3 of Title 22 of the California Code of
Regulations are applied to seniors and persons with disabilities served under
this section.” W&I Code §14182(b)(15). 

 
2. Conlan I and II
In Conlan v. Bonta, (“Conlan I”) (2002) 102
Cal.App.4th 748 and Conlan v. Shewry, (“Conlan II”) (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 1354, the appellate courts directed DHCS to ensure that Medi-Cal
recipients entitled to reimbursement for covered services receive notification
and are promptly reimbursed.  DHCS is
required to provide recipients reimbursement for medically necessary services
received and paid for during the following periods: (1) a retroactive period up
to three months prior to the date of application for Medi-Cal; (2) the
evaluation period, which is the period between the date of application for
Medi-Cal eligibility and the date it was approved; and (3) the post-approval
period covering excess co-payments and excess Medi-Cal Share of Cost expenses paid
after the recipient was approved for Medi-Cal.
 
3.
Continuity of Care
In effect since 2000, 22
CCR section 53887 sets forth the criteria for a temporary MER from managed care
plan enrollment:  “An eligible
beneficiary ... who satisfies the requirements in (1)[1]
or (2) below, may request fee-for-service Medi-Cal for up to 12 months as an
alternative to plan enrollment by submitting a request for exemption from plan
enrollment to the Health Care Options Program ....” 22 CCR §53887(a).  
A MER may be granted for
continuity of care with a fee-for-service provider for a complex medical
condition: “An eligible beneficiary who is receiving fee-for-service Medi-Cal
treatment or services for a complex medical condition, from a physician, a certified
nurse midwife, or a licensed midwife who is participating in the Medi-Cal
program but is not a contracting provider of either plan in the eligible
beneficiary's county of residence, may request
a medical exemption to continue fee-for-service Medi-Cal for purposes of
continuity of care.”  22 CCR
§53887(a)(2).
 “For purposes of [22 CCR section 53887],
conditions meeting the criteria for a complex medical condition include, and
are similar to, the following: (1) an eligible beneficiary is pregnant; (2) an
eligible beneficiary is under evaluation for the need for an organ transplant;
has been approved for and is awaiting an organ transplant; or has received a
transplant and is currently either immediately post-operative or exhibiting
significant medical problems related to the transplant ...; (3) an eligible
beneficiary is receiving chronic renal dialysis treatment; (4) an eligible
beneficiary has tested positive for HIV or has received a diagnosis of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); (5) an eligible beneficiary has been
diagnosed with cancer and is currently receiving chemotherapy or radiation
therapy or another course of accepted therapy for cancer that will continue for
up to 12 months or has been approved for such therapy; (6) an eligible
beneficiary has been approved for a major surgical procedure by the Medi-Cal
fee-for-service program and is awaiting surgery or is immediately
post-operative; (7) an eligible beneficiary has a complex neurological
disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, a complex hematological disorder, such as
hemophilia or sickle cell diseases, or a complex and/or progressive disorder
not covered in 1 through 6 above, such as cardiomyopathy or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, that requires ongoing medical supervision and/or has been approved
for or is receiving complex medical treatment for the disorder, the
administration of which cannot be interrupted; and (8) an eligible beneficiary
is enrolled in a Medi-Cal waiver program that allows the individual to receive
sub-acute, acute, intermediate or skilled nursing care at home rather than in a
sub-acute care facility, an acute care hospital, an intermediate care facility
or a skilled nursing facility.”  22 CCR
§53887(a)(2)(A).
A MER based on complex
medical condition may be denied in certain circumstances where managed care
plan provider services are available: “A request for exemption from plan
enrollment based on complex medical conditions shall not be approved for an
eligible beneficiary who has: 1. Been a member of either managed care plan on a
combined basis for more than 90 calendar days, 2. A current Medi-Cal provider
who is contracting with either plan, or 3. Begun or was scheduled to begin
treatment after the date of plan enrollment.” 22 CCR §53887(a)(2)(B).
The duration of a MER is
limited: “Except for pregnancy, any eligible beneficiary granted a medical
exemption from plan enrollment shall remain with the fee-for-service provider
only until the medical condition has stabilized to a level that would enable
the individual to change physicians and begin receiving care from a plan
provider without deleterious medical effects, as determined by a beneficiary’s
treating physician in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program, up to 12 months
from the date the medical exemption is first approved by the Health Care
Options Program.”  Id.  A beneficiary granted a medical exemption due
to pregnancy may remain with the fee-for -service Medi-Cal provider through
delivery and the end of the month in which 90 days post-partum occurs.
A MER based on a complex
medical condition must be requested on the “request for Medical Exemption from
Plan Enrollment” form (HCO Form 7101) available from the Health Care Options
Program. 22 CCR §53887(b).  
 
C. Standard of Review
A party may seek to set aside an agency decision by
petitioning for either a writ of administrative mandamus (CCP §1094.5) or of
traditional mandamus. CCP §1085.  CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974)
11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
CCP section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases
are subject to independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (1999)20
Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases reviewing
decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court exercises
independent judgment on the evidence. Bixby v. Pierno, (1971) 4 Cal.3d
130, 143.  See CCP §1094.5(c).  In administrative mandamus actions to review
decisions denying applications for public assistance, the trial court exercises
independent judgment on the evidence.  Ruth
v. Kizer, (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 380, 385; see also Frink v. Prod, (1982) 31 Cal.3d 166, 171 (applying
independent judgment standard to decisions terminating welfare).
Under the independent judgment test, “the trial court not
only examines the administrative record for errors of law but also exercises
its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de
novo.”  Id. at 143. 
The court must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and
make its own credibility determinations. 
Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of
Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868.  In short, the court substitutes its judgment
for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when, why, and the
credibility of witnesses.  Guymon v.
Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
“In exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must
afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative
findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the
burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to
the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda
v. City of Angles, supra, 20
Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be
demonstrated by petitioner that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any
reasonable basis in law or any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not
interfere with the agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of
the agency.  Bixby v. Pierno, supra,
4 Cal.3d at 150-51; Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board,
(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            Where an agency’s hearing procedure
is attacked as a due process violation, the issue is one of law.  Mohilef v Janovici, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 267, 285; Hall v. Superior Court, (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th
792, 808.Whether there was a fair trial at the administrative level is a
question for the trial court to determine independently.  Western Air Lines, Inc. v Schutzbank,
(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 218, 226.  See
Zurn Eng’rs v State ex rel Department of Water Resources, (1977) 69
Cal.App.3d 798, 835.  The trial court’s
independent evaluation of the fair trial issue is not a trial de novo; the
court renders its independent judgment on the basis of the record.  City of Fairfield v Superior Court,
(1975) 14 Cal.3d 768, 776. 

The agency’s decision must be based on a preponderance of
the evidence presented at the hearing.  Board
of Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga,
supra, 11 Cal.3d at, 514-15. 
Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set
forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
decision or order.  Id. at 115.
An agency is presumed to have regularly performed its
official duties (Ev. Code §664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of
proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County
Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137.  “[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party
attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings
were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of
discretion.  Afford v. Pierno,
(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.
 
D. Statement of Facts[2]
            1. Background
            Jackson, a minor, has been
diagnosed with Disruptive Behavior Disorder since the age of three.  AR 1024.  After an evaluation by his school district, he
received an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) under the eligibility of
“Other Health Impairment/ADHD.”  AR 1023.  
During the period at
issue, Jackson was eligible for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits through L.A. Care
Health Plan as the managed care plan.  AR
7.  Jackson’s health plan requires a
referral for specialized treatments, including occupational therapy. AR 317-18.
 Additionally, the health plan requires
prior authorization for services not available from network providers to
determine whether the services are medically necessary.  AR 319. 

 
2. Grey’s
Communications With Kaiser
Starting in early
December 2017, Grey attempted to seek services for Jackson through his assigned
provider Kaiser.  AR 52, 122.  Kaiser repeatedly gave Grey incorrect
information, stating that these services were not covered under the plan, and
that Grey must instead seek and pay for these services out-of-pocket from a
third party, which Grey proceeded to do. 
AR 52, 122.
Grey filed a grievance
with Kaiser.  AR 123.  On August 31, 2018, Kaiser informed Grey that
the services he sought for Jackson are considered to be specialty mental health
services that are excluded from Jackson’s coverage.  AR 80. 
He must get these services through LACDMH.  AR 123.  
In or around June 2018,
a clinical program manager at Kaiser provided Grey with referrals to LACDMH,
L.A. Child Guidance Clinic, and SSG.  See
AR 54.  Grey declined services from
SSG on October 9, 2018.  See AR
1016.
On August 31, 2018, Kaiser
reimbursed Grey for the out-of-network services Jackson received from EDCA for
the period of March 22 to the July 31, 2018 date when Kaiser’s clinical manager
provided the in-network referrals.  AR 54-55,
290, 383.  Kaiser informed Grey that this
reimbursement was a one-time courtesy, and it would not reimburse him for any
future treatment with out-of-network providers. AR 55, 290, 383.  Grey filed an appeal which Kaiser denied on
October 15, 2018.  AR 55-56.
 
3. The DHCS
Independent Medical Review  
On October 15, 2018, Grey
requested an Independent Medical Review with DHCS.  AR 396.  On November 16, 2018, DHCS informed Grey that Jackson’s
health plan required him to receive non-emergency treatment from in-network
providers.  AR 396.  If none are available, an out-of-network
provider can be authorized.  AR 396.  However, Kaiser indicated that no in-network
provider had referred Jackson to an out-of-network provider and ECDA’s services
are not covered benefits.  AR 396.  In addition, specialty mental health services
are not provided by Medi-Cal managed care plans and are only available through
LACMHD.  AR 396.  DHCS cannot compel Kaiser to authorize the
requested services with ECDA.  AR 396.  DHCS noted that Kaiser had called LACMHD and
Jackson had been referred to SSG.  AR
396.
 
4. LACDMH
Referrals
By this time, Jackson was
making progress with the third-party providers, and several medical
professionals advised that it would be medically unsound to switch providers.  AR 54-55, 1075.  Although Grey received in-network referrals
for Jackson’s treatment, he declined to change providers because he felt it
would be detrimental to Jackson’s progress. 
AR54-55.  From 2018 to 2021, Jackson
received mental and behavioral health treatment from multiple providers for his
disruptive behaviors.  ECDA, the principal
provider treating Jackson, was not a Medi-Cal provider.  AR 1027. 
Grey paid for these treatments without authorization from Jackson’s
health insurance.  
When LACDMH learned of Grey’s
reimbursement request, it contacted ECDA and inquired whether it would be
interested in contracting with LACDMH as a Medi-Cal provider.  AR1017.  ECDA declined the offer.  AR1017. 

LACDMH also learned that
Grey had reached out to an LACDMH-operated clinic for a letter in support of Jackson
remaining with his current providers.  AR
1016.  According to Grey, everyone at the
clinic told him that the safest and most sound medical decision was to continue
therapy with the out-of-network provider. 
See AR 1020.  When the
LACDMH-operated clinic requested to assess Jackson, Grey declined the
assessment.  AR 1016, 1028.
 
5. The Joint
LACDMH and Kaiser Assessment
To assist Grey with
locating an in-network provider for Jackson, LACDMH and Kaiser conducted a
joint assessment on April 8, 2020.  AR 1017.
 The assessors determined that LACDMH was
the best agency to service Jackson’s needs because he needed specialty mental
health services.  AR 1017.  LACDMH orally communicated its findings to Grey
and sent a follow-up letter explaining the findings, recommendation, and
referral information.  AR 1017.  The letter identified five in-network clinics
for Jackson to obtain services.  AR 1017.
After several
unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Grey regarding LACDMH services,
LACDMH sent him a July 16, 2020 letter explaining that his non-responsiveness indicated
that he was not interested in LACDMH services.  AR 1017.  
Should he change his mind, LACDMH included contact information and a
copy of the Guide to Medi-Cal Mental Health Services.  AR 1017. 
 
6. The LACDMH and
Kaiser Denials
On November 12, 2021,
DHCS received Grey’s request for reimbursement for $50,054 for services by ECDA
and provider Ms. J, LCSW incurred for Jackson from March 22, 2018 to September
27, 2021.  AR 1013-14.  DHCS referred a portion of the claim to
Kaiser and another portion to LACDMH.  AR
224.  The agencies denied Grey’s
reimbursement request because Jackson used out-of-network providers and did not
seek the appropriate referral to authorize reimbursement for their services.  AR 291, 378. 

Grey orally requested a DSS
fair hearing to appeal the decisions.  AR375-76.

 
7. The First
Administrative Hearing 
On October 4, 2022, the
first administrative hearing took place and addressed DHCS’s denial of
reimbursement for services provided from October 18, 2020 to September 30,
2021.  AR 856.  A representative from Kaiser, a
representative from Medi-Cal, and Grey were present.  AR 856-57.
On November 9, 2022, the
ALJ upheld DHCS’s denial of Grey’ request for reimbursement of $7,960 for
services J, LCWS from October 18, 2020 through September 30, 2021.  AR 16-17. 
Reimbursement is only permitted when the services received during the
post-approval period were rendered by a provider enrolled with the Medi-Cal
program or with an approved Treatment Authorization Request (“TAR”) if medical
necessity is established.   AR 17.  J, LCWS was not an enrolled Medi-Cal
provider, and the services rendered were not Medi-Cal covered services, as
required under the Conlan Plan criteria.  AR 17.  There
was no evidence in the record that Jackson’s need for mental health services was
a medical necessity or there was an approved TAR.  AR 17. 
Therefore, DHCS correctly denied the reimbursement claim in the amount
of $7,960 for services rendered by provider J, LCWS for the period of October
18, 2020 to September 30, 2021.  AR 17.
The ALJ dismissed without
prejudice Grey’s reimbursement claim against Kaiser for $3,514 by providers
ECDA and Play 2 Progress during the period of June 7, 2018 through September
27, 2021.  AR 17.  AR 17-18. 
Kaiser had never received a DHCS referral for Play 2 Progress’s services
and Kaiser had not denied the $330 claim for ECDA.  AR 18.
DHCS had referred to
LACMHD Grey’s claim for imbursement for $38,580 for services provided during
the period of March 22, 2018 through September 28, 2020.  AR 18. 
Grey asked to continue the hearing to add LACMHD as a party to address
that reimbursement claim, as well his claim for continuation of services
beginning October 2021.  AR 6-7.  DHCS and Kaiser did not agree to add
continuation of services as an issue.  AR
7.  
The ALJ opened a second hearing
request on Grey’s behalf.  AR 19.  The ALJ stated that there was no evidence
that LACMHD had denied any reimbursement claim for those dates of service.  AR 19. 
Since more than 120 days had passed since DHCS had referred the claim to
LACMHD, and because there was no evidence of a denial, the State Hearings
Division would open a hearing request on Grey’s behalf regarding this claim.  AR 19. 
As a result, the remaining $38,580 portion of Grey’s reimbursement claim
would have a separate hearing to take place on February 21, 2023.  AR 1010-12.
On December 8, 2022, Grey
submitted a request and statement for a rehearing. AR 853.  On December 28, 2022, DHCS denied the rehearing
request, stating that it did not meet any of the statutory criteria necessary
to obtain a rehearing.  AR 853-54.
 
8. The Second
Administrative Hearing 
The second
administrative hearing took place on February 21, 2023 to address LACDMH’s
denial of reimbursement for services by EDCA, Ms. J, LCWS, and Play 2 Progress from
March 22, 2018 through September 28, 2020. 
AR 1010-12, 1049.  Grey and a County
representative appeared telephonically.   
On April 28, 2023, the
ALJ issued a decision upholding LACDMH’s denial of Grey’s request for
reimbursement.  AR 1050.  The ALJ first determined that, while Grey had
not filed an appeal with LACDMH before seeking a DSS fair hearing, LACDMH had
notice of Grey’s request for a fair hearing and Grey was deemed to have
exhausted this requirement by LACDMH’s delay. 
AR 1048.
Grey testified that he
contacted all five providers listed by LACDMH in its July 16, 2020 letter, and
each of the providers was not able to provide services based on Jackson’s age.  AR 1020. 
In response, the LACDMH representative testified that the providers
likely declined to provide services because Grey incorrectly referred to his
son’s sensory disorder to explain Jackson’s need for services from these
providers.  AR 1032.  
The ALJ determined that Jackson
obtained services from mental health therapists who were not enrolled as
Medi-Cal providers and therefore Grey’s reimbursement claim for $38,580 failed
to meet the requirements under the Conlon Beneficiary
Reimbursement Plan.  AR 1049.  The ALJ acknowledged that Grey tried to
obtain mental health services based on his contention that various
professionals, including LACDMH representatives, recommended continuity of
care.  AR 1049.  However, the ALJ did not have authority to disregard
the requirements of the Medi-Cal Program and Conlan Beneficiary
Reimbursement Plan.  AR 1049.  There is no express exemption in that respective
Program or Plan for extenuating circumstances. AR 1049.  The ALJ noted that this decision is entirely
consistent with the decision in the first administrative hearing.  AR 1049.
Regarding the issue of
continuity of care under the Medi-Cal Program, a beneficiary receiving
fee-for-service Medi-Cal may request an exemption from mandatory enrollment in
a Medi-Cal managed care plan pursuant to 22 CCR section 58377(a).  AR 1050. 
The fee-for-service Medi-Cal beneficiary may submit a MER to continue
under fee-for-service Medi-Cal for the purposes of continuity care to receive
treatment or services for the beneficiary’s complex medical condition.  AR 1050. 
There was no showing that Jackson is a fee-for-service Medi-Cal
beneficiary, and his provider did not a submit a MER form with supporting
medical supporting evidence either.  AR
1050.   Therefore, continuity of care is not
applicable in this case.  AR 1050.  Additionally, LACMDH offered a contract to
EDCA to be a network provider and the offer was declined.  AR 1050.
On May 19, 2023, Grey submitted
a request for rehearing.  AR 1122.  On July 10, 2023, DHCS denied the rehearing
request.  AR 1129.
 
E. Analysis
As argued in the joint opposition of Respondent DSS and Real
Party DHCS (Opp. at 9-10),
Grey’s
reimbursement request was required to follow the Conlan Plan, which
requires that treatment eligible for a post-approval reimbursement request must
be provided by a Medi-Cal provider.  Grey
submitted requests for reimbursements in the post-approval period for treatment
from non-Medi-Cal providers.  
Grey does not dispute
the ALJs’ findings that he failed to meet the reimbursement criteria under the Conlan
Plan that the providers at issue were not Medi-Cal-affiliated.  Grey raises only two issues: (1) he did not
receive a fair trial when his administrative hearings were split; and (2) the
doctrine of equitable estoppel applies and the ALJs did not address this issue.[3]
 
1. Equitable Estoppel
Equitable estoppel applies in circumstances where a party
has induced another into forbearing to act. 
Lantzy v. Centex Homes, (2003) 31 Cal.App.4th 363, 383.  The
doctrine is “founded on notions of equity and fair dealing and provides that a
person may not deny the existence of a state of facts if that person has
intentionally led others to believe a particular circumstance to be true and to
rely upon such belief to their detriment.” 
Steinhart v. County of Los
Angeles, (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1298, 1315.  
The elements of estoppel are: (1) the party to be estopped
must be appraised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be
acted upon; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts;
and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.  Driscoll v. City of Los Angeles (1967)
67 Cal.2d 297, 305.  The doctrine applies
to a public entity in the same manner as a private party when the elements of
equitable estoppel have been shown, and when the injustice which would result
from a failure to estop the agency is sufficient to justify any adverse effect
upon public interest or policy which would result.  City of Long Beach v. Mansell, (1970)
3 Cal.3d 462, 496-97.
            Grey
notes that his written statement for one of the administrative hearings
provided as follows:
 
“Our family has been through the wringer, for
more than four years now, trying to secure mental health care services for our
son, through all channels under the DHCS umbrella. He was only two and a half
when this process began. He’s seven now, and we still don’t have the care that
he needs, unless we’re paying for it out-of-pocket. We’ve taken every
reasonable step, and then some, to secure these services through
DHCS-affiliated channels. Unfortunately, literally none of these services
turned out to be readily available to us, or otherwise, the options were
inappropriate (or worse, medically hazardous) for our son. Every door we’ve
tried to open has been slammed in our face. And so, as a result, we’ve done
what any reasonable parent should do: We’ve instead paid out-of-pocket for
appropriate services, even though we never should have had to, since our son is
on a Medi-Cal plan … To conclude, back before March 22, 2018, there were
other options (i.e. having the services we needed covered by LACDMH) that
nobody from Kaiser told me about, even when I desperately asked and pleaded for
other options besides paying out-of-pocket. But after we had been paying out of
pocket (as multiple Kaiser representatives had incorrectly told me I must) for
more than two years, there was no turning back without risking severe damage to
Jackson’s progress, and it’s clear that’s something that no competent
health care professional thought we should do. (We’ve now received
recommendations from eight professionals, who all said, pre-pandemic, that
Jackson should not switch providers, four in writing.) And even when we did
consider switching providers (when remote, pandemic-era sessions were proving
ineffective with Jackson’s long-time provider, Marilee Hartling), for months, LACDMH
didn’t offer Jackson all the services that he needed anyway. And when they
eventually did offer us something more appropriate, but remotely as well, it
proved unsuccessful too. Further, we were told, if we were ever to lose
Medi-Cal coverage, Jackson would be forced to switch again to a new provider
anyway, again in contrast with recommendations that we received from several
mental health care providers. Further, the DHCS (run by the State of California
– Health and Human Services Agency) echoes the erroneous stances posited by
Kaiser and LACDMH. It is unfathomable to me that my child, as a Medi-Cal
recipient, would be unable to receive his needed services within the program,
and still be stuck with a $50,000+ bill that resulted from reliance on
erroneous information given by the three agencies, as well as several Medi-Cal
referred providers who themselves told me that their services were inadequate
for our son’s needs. In closing, we again respectfully request that, in
accordance with The California Code, Health and Safety Code - HSC § 1374.72,
these entities should be made to (a) reimburse us for all medical costs to date
related to our son’s mental health care, (b) continue to reimburse us for all
future medical costs related to our son’s mental health care with his current
providers, and (c) be subject to some kind of review process to ensure that
this type of situation stops happening to our child, and to other children, as
well.” AR 51 (emphasis added).
 
            Grey also stated: “From April 10, 2019
onward, we sought out additional medical opinions and letters to find out if
they thought it was medically sound for Jackson to switch providers, without
any transition period supplemented by a continuity of care plan. Every medical
professional agreed that continuing with Marilee Hartling’s treatment made
sense, with some going so far as to say that switching providers could be
dangerous, echoing previous medical opinions offered to us”.  AR 58. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 14-15.
            Essentially, Grey testified or provided
written statements that he was misled by Kaiser, which did not tell him that
LACMHD could provide the mental health services for Jackson, and that he could
not change providers without endangering Jackson’s progress once he was informed
of those covered services.
            Grey’s
moving papers add that his equitable estoppel claim is based in part on the Right
to Be Free from Hazardous Procedures.  The
ALJs’ decisions failed to administer 17 CCR section 50510(9), which allows
“each person with a developmental disability … A right to be free from
hazardous procedures.”  Pet.  RJN.[4] Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
            Grey’s
equitable estoppel claim is procedurally defective.  First, he does not identify which agency should
be estopped: Kaiser, LACMHD, or DHCS.  Assuming
Grey contends that Kaiser is the entity to be estopped, Grey presents only his
own testimony and fails to present evidence supporting Kaiser.  The petitioner is obligated to lay out
the evidence favorable to the other side and show why it is lacking. The
"[f]ailure to do so is fatal" to any substantial evidence challenge
and "is deemed a concession that the evidence supports the findings."
 Defend the Bay v. City of Irvine,
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.  The
reviewing court should "not independently review the record to make up for
appellant's failure to carry his burden." 
Ibid.  
At a minimum, Grey was
required to present the following evidence to meet this obligation: (1) a
clinical program manager at Kaiser provided Grey with referrals to LACDMH, L.A.
Child Guidance Clinic, and SSG, and Grey declined services from SSG, (2) Kaiser
reimbursed Grey as a one-time courtesy for the out-of-network services Jackson
received from EDCA for the period of March 22 to the July 31, 2018 date when
Kaiser’s clinical manager provided the in-network referrals, (3) DHCS informed
Grey that specialty mental health services are not provided by Medi-Cal managed
care plans and are only available through LACMHD, (4) ECDA, the principal provider
treating Jackson, was not a Medi-Cal provider, (5) when LACDMH learned of Grey’s
reimbursement request, it contacted ECDA about whether it would be interested
in contracting with LACDMH as a Medi-Cal provider and ECDA declined, (6) Grey
declined an assessment by a LACDMH-operated clinic, (7) LACDMH and Kaiser
conducted a joint assessment on April 8, 2020 which determined that LACDMH was
the best agency to service Jackson’s needs and LACDMH identified five
in-network clinics for Jackson to obtain services, (7) LACDMH tried
unsuccessfully to communicate with Grey regarding such services to which he was
unresponsive, and (8) Jackson successfully has switched to another provider, Steinberg. 
TAP, ¶66.  
Second, Grey fails to show that he presented an estoppel
claim to the ALJs.  “Exhaustion
requires ‘a full presentation to the administrative agency upon all issues of
the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.’”  City of San Jose v. Operating Engineeers
Local Union No. 3, (2010) 49 Cal.4th 597, 609 (citations
omitted).  The exhaustion doctrine
includes issue exhaustion as well as exhaustion of administrative
remedies.  The agency must be given the
opportunity to reach a reasoned and final conclusion on each and every issue
upon which it has jurisdiction to act before it is raised in a judicial
forum.  Hill RHF Housing Partners,
L.P. v. City of Los Angeles, (“Hill”) (2021), 12 Cal.5th 458, 479
(citation omitted).  The exact
issue raised in the lawsuit must have been presented to the administrative
agency.  Tahoe Vista Concerned
Citizens v. County of Placer, (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 577,
594.  Otherwise, a litigant could present
narrow arguments or even omit them before the final administrative authority in
hopes of obtaining a more favorable decision from a trial court.  Id. 
            Grey argues that, for both the administrative hearings and the rehearing
requests, he referenced Kaiser’s offering of incorrect information, followed by
events resulting in a deep injustice affecting a child’s health care and worthy
of the application of equitable estoppel. Yet, both the ALJs’ decisions and the
denials of the rehearing requests did not address equitable estoppel.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
This is
inadequate.  Grey fails to cite
any mention of equitable estoppel at either administrative hearing or in the
rehearing requests.  The only conclusion
possible is that equitable estoppel was
not expressly raised.  The ALJs cannot be
faulted for failing to address a legal issue that was never raised.  See Pet. Op. Br. at 15.[5]  
Grey’s only argument
at the administrative hearings was that he was misled for a time and did not
want to change when he was given LACDMH providers. The ALJ at the second
administrative hearing addressed this issue. 
The ALJ acknowledged that Grey tried to obtain mental health services
based on his contention that various professionals, including LACDMH
representatives, recommended continuity of care.  AR 1049. 
However, the ALJ stated that he did not have authority to disregard the
requirements of the Medi-Cal Program and Conlan Beneficiary
Reimbursement Plan.  AR 1049.  This ruling therefore addressed Jackson’s
argument that he was misled, which was the only issue presented.
Assuming, arguendo,
that the ALJs should have addressed the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the
joint opposition is correct that the evidence does not support this claim.  See Opp. at 10.
            The
first element of equitable estoppel is that the party to be estopped
must be appraised of the facts.  According
to Grey, Kaiser informed him that it
would not provide behavioral therapy for children as young as Jackson and would
not provide aide assistance for any child. 
Grey was told that his only option would be to pay out-of-pocket for
those services from a third party.  Kaiser did not mention that LACDMH and its
contracting entities such as SSG were an option.  The court accepts that, while Kaiser may not have intentionally misled
Grey, it should have known that services could be provided through LACDMH. 
            The second element of equitable estoppel is that the party to be
estopped must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon.  The court also accepts that, when Kaiser
informed Grey that his only option
would be to pay out-of-pocket for those services from a third party, it
intended Grey to act upon this option.
            The
third element of equitable estoppel is that the other party must be
ignorant of the true state of facts.  The
court accepts that Grey initially did not know that LACDMH was an option.
            The
fourth element is that the other party must rely upon the conduct to his
injury.  This is where Grey’s claim
fails.  On August 31, 2018, Kaiser
reimbursed Grey for the out-of-network services Jackson received from EDCA for
the period of March 22 to the July 31, 2018 date when Kaiser’s clinical manager
provided the in-network referrals.  AR 54-55,
290, 383.  Kaiser informed Grey that this
reimbursement was a one-time courtesy, and it would not reimburse him for any
future treatment with out-of-network providers. AR 55, 290, 383.  
            Kaiser’s action essentially cured
any failure to refer Grey to LACDMH services. 
Yet, Grey chose to continue
treating with out-of-network providers even after Kaiser’s clarification.  AR 55, 57, 58.  Jackson’s health plan
requires a referral for specialized treatments and prior authorization for
services not available from network providers to determine whether the services
are medically necessary.  AR 319.  Grey chose to continue with out-of-network
providers without obtaining the
necessary approval and authorization required by his health insurance.  Grey’s decision not to switch to an
in-network provider, and to continue with an out-of-network provider, to avoid regression
in his son’s disruptive behaviors is understandable but still a voluntary
choice.[6]  At that stage, he cannot be deemed to have
detrimentally relied on Kaiser’s advice. 
The doctrine of equitable estoppel is not a tort rule supporting all
consequential damages.
            Grey’s equitable estoppel claim
fails both procedurally and substantively. 

 
2. Fair Trial
            At the first administrative hearing, Kaiser and DHCS were present, and
LACDMH was not.  At the second
administrative hearing, LACDMH was present and the other two entities were
not.  Grey argues that the ALJ’s decision
to split the cases resulted in an unfair hearing.  
            The principles of due process determine
whether the hearing granted by an agency was fair.  Hall v. Superior Court, (2016) 3
Cal.App.5th 792, 808.  The
question whether the trial was “fair” encompasses pre-hearing and post-hearing
events or procedures affecting the due process requirements of adequate notice
and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. 
See Vollstedt v City of Stockton, (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
265, 273. Under Govt. Code section 11513(b), each party has the right to call
and examine witnesses, cross-examine opposing witnesses, and impeach any
witness regardless of which party called him or her.  If the trial court determines that the
petitioner was denied a fair hearing, the court should issue a judgment remanding
the case for proper proceedings.  See
English v City of Long Beach (1950) 35 Cal.2d 155, 159; Wood v City
Civil Serv. Comm’n, (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 105, 111 (existence  of substantial evidence where administrative
hearing was unfair does not affect requirement for remand).       
            Grey
argues that Kaiser created his detrimental reliance.  At the first hearing, Kaiser submitted
testimony concerning LACDMH, which was not present for Grey to
cross-examine.  Similarly, LACDMH
presented testimony at the second administrative hearing concerning Kaiser and
DHCS, neither of which were present for Grey to cross-examine.  The facts between the two split hearings
prevented a fair hearing of Grey’s equitable estoppel claim.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9; Reply at 4.
            In
both of his rehearing requests, Grey contended that the hearing split led to
unfair circumstances that prevented the parties from being able to address the
other’s testimony.  His rehearing request
for the first administrative hearing argued: 
 
“The decision also states, ‘[Grey] requested
that this hearing be continued to add this agency [LACDMH] as a party,”
however, this is never addressed again in the decision, and apparently, the
judge determined – for reasons that aren’t mentioned in the decision – that
this hearing should not be continued to include representatives from
LACDMH, and that, instead, a new hearing should be convened to address only
the LACDMH portion of the claim. However, since then, LACDMH has already
submitted new documents, making claims about what Kaiser and DHCS did and said,
so it is essential that all parties be present simultaneously, so that all
information on this matter can be revealed, discussed, and questioned, per the
original intent of my hearing request. LACDMH was not present at the hearing,
and therefore, a rehearing – which must include representatives from (1)
Kaiser, (2) DHCS, and (3) LACDMH – is the only way to ensure that this
situation is made right. The full claim is absolutely inter-connected between
these three parties”.  AR 593-94.  
 
            Grey
argues that both rehearing requests were denied without any reference to this
specific point.  At a minimum, the case
should be remanded to DSS’s Administrative Hearings Division to consider
whether splitting the hearing violated Grey’s right to due process.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.          
            In
reply, Grey notes that the joint opposition fails to address the fair hearing
issue and argues that it tacitly concedes the issue that he did not receive a
fair hearing.  Reply
at 4.  Without a fair hearing, it is not
possible to fully appreciate Grey’s equitable estoppel claim.  Acting on the advice of the medical
professionals he consulted, Grey acted appropriately to require Kaiser and as
authorized agent for LACDMH to be accountable for the wrongful advice given in
the beginning of the course of treatment.  
There was a wrong by Kaiser for which there ought to be fair and equable
remedy imposed and the lack of a fair hearing prevented presentation of
evidence on these facts.  Reply at 5.
Grey’s fair hearing argument is based solely
on his equitable estoppel claim.  As that
claim fails, it follows that Grey necessarily was not denied a fair hearing.  Nor does Grey adequately show why he needed
all of Kaiser, DHCS, and LACDMH present at the same hearing. It is insufficient
to contend that he could not cross-examine LACDMH at the first hearing and
could not cross-examine Kaiser and DHCS at the second hearing.  Cross-examine on what issues?  Particularly since all three entities were
present at the hearings collectively, what testimony would have been elicited
that was not?  How would the evidence
have changed?  Grey does not say. 
Moreover, a due process violation requires a showing of
prejudice.  Krontz v. City of San Diego, (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
1126, 1141 (delay in notice and opportunity to be heard requires
prejudice).  Prejudice will not be presumed; actual prejudice must be
shown in order to be balanced against a due process violation.  People
v. Belton, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1433 (delay in filing
criminal charges requires balancing of prejudice against justification for
delay).  “Reversible error requires demonstration of prejudice arising
from the reasonable probability the party ‘would have obtained a better outcome’
in the absence of the error”.  Fisher
v. State Personnel Bd., (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1, 20.  
Grey’s claims in the
first hearing were for DHCS’s denial of his request for reimbursement of $7,960
for services J, LCWS from October 18, 2020 through September 30, 2021 and against
Kaiser for $3,514 by providers ECDA and Play 2 Progress during the period of
June 7, 2018 through September 27, 2021. 
DHCS had referred to LACMHD Grey’s claim for imbursement for $38,580 for
services provided during the period of March 22, 2018 through September 28,
2020.  AR 18.  Grey asked to continue the first hearing to
add LACMHD as a party to address that reimbursement claim, as well his claim
for continuation of services beginning October 2021.  AR 6-7. 
DHCS and Kaiser did not agree to add continuation of services as an
issue.  AR 7.  Instead, the ALJ opened a claim against
LACMHD for a second hearing.  The ALJ’s
decision to split the hearings makes sense and Grey fails to show any prejudice
from the decision.

Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
Counsel for Respondent DSS and Real Party DHCS is ordered to prepare a
proposed judgment, serve it on Grey’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten
days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections,
and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for November 12,
2024 at 9:30 a.m.
