24STCV18673

Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order:  granted




 
 



Plaintiff CG Owner, LLC (“CG”) applies for a right to attach
order against Defendant Michael Sullivan & Associates, LLP (“Sullivan”).
The court has read and considered the moving papers and
opposition[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiff CG commenced this action on July 25, 2024, by
filing the Complaint against Defendant Sullivan alleging Breach of Lease and
Anticipatory Breach of Lease.  Compl., ¶¶ 9-21.
In 2012, Continental Grand II, L.P.
("Continental") owned real property, including a commercial building,
at 400 North Continental Blvd, El Segundo ("Building").  Compl., ¶5.  Continental and Defendant
Sullivan signed a Lease dated November 4, 2012, for Sullivan to rent 17,062
rentable square feet in the Building, referred to as Suite 100
("Premises"). Compl., ¶5.  Sullivan was required to pay monthly
rent and other charges as provided for in the Lease. Compl., ¶5.  
In June 2017, CG purchased the Building from Continental and
became the assignee and landlord under the Lease.  Compl., ¶6.  CG and Sullivan signed
a ''Second Amendment to Lease" ("Amendment") dated June 12,
2019, extending the Lease to June 30, 2025. 
Compl., ¶7.  The Amendment also provided that the
rent would be $76,204.06 per month in 2023, $78,471 per month in 2024, and
$80,912.32 per month in 2025.  Compl., ¶7. 

In breach of the Lease and the Amendment (collectively the
"Lease Documents"), Sullivan vacated the Premises on or about
November 30, 2023.  Compl., ¶8.
 
2.  Course of
Proceedings 
On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Complaint.
On September 23, 2024, Sullivan filed its Answer. 
 
B. Applicable Law
1. Attachment
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five
hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41 (attachment
appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of commercial
equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section
487.010” is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
D. Statement of Facts
1. CG’s Evidence

            a. Lease and Abandonment
            Sullivan executed the
Lease Documents in which it agreed to lease the Premises through June 30, 2025.  Hursh Decl., ¶¶ 2-5, Exs. 1-2.  CG has performed all covenants and conditions
under the Lease, including providing possession of the Premises to Sullivan.  Hursh Decl., ¶7.  
On or around November
30, 2023, Sullivan vacated the Premises. 
Hursh Decl., ¶6.  Since then,
Plaintiff CG has been attempting to relet the Premises, without success.  Hursh Decl., ¶6.
 
            b. Default 
Per the terms of the
Lease Documents, the Lease remains in existence through June 30, 2025.  Hursh Decl., ¶7.  Sullivan has failed to pay the monthly rent
and other obligations owed under the Lease Documents for the months of August
1, 2023, through July 31, 2024, and is now in default.  Hursh Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.  Sullivan owes $996,807.16 in unpaid rent for
the period from August 1, 2023, through July 31, 2024.  Hursh Decl., ¶9.  Sullivan also owes other amounts under the
Lease, including interest, and attorney’s fees. 
Solely for purposes of this attachment, CG is only
seeking to attach the principal amount of $996,807.16 as reflected in the Lease
ledger.  Hursh Decl., ¶10, Ex. 3.
 
            2. Sullivan’s Evidence
            Sullivan’s inability to
pay rent due because it was shut down due to COVID-19 is material, since the
existence of a probable affirmative defense outweighs the possible existence of
an affirmative defense.  Fink Decl., ¶3.  There is more than simply the possibility of a
superseding intervening cause, it is a fact that government restrictions forced
Sullivan to close its business.  Fink
Decl., ¶3.  The forced closure of all
non-essential businesses meant that it was impossible and financially unviable
to use the Premises as was intended under the lease.  Fink Decl., ¶4.  
            The defense of adherence to
statute is more than a mere possibility, it is a probable affirmative defense
in this case.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  The COVID-19 order [health order]
mandated the closure of all non-essential businesses.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  Sullivan was required by statute to
close its doors.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  To do otherwise would have been
unlawful.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  
CG has not made reasonable attempts to mitigate its damages
in that it has had ample opportunity to find a replacement tenant.  Fink
Decl., ¶6.  On or about December
1, 2022, Sullivan sent CG a letter indicating that it desired to terminate the
lease.  Fink Decl., ¶6.  On or about
June 1, 2023, Sullivan send CG a second letter providing 60 days’ notice that Sullivan
would vacate the Property.  Fink Decl., ¶6.  
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff
CG seeks a right to attach order against Defendant Sullivan in the amount of $996,807.16
in unpaid rent and other charges.
1. A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment
May Be Based 
            A writ of attachment may be issued
only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            CG’s claim for attachment is based
on the Lease between the parties and exceeds $500.
             
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable  
            A claim is “readily ascertainable”
where the damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the contract and
the basis of the calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a
standard by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by
which the damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations
omitted). 
Sullivan has failed
to pay the monthly rent and other obligations owed under the Lease Documents
for the months of August 1, 2023 through July 31, 2024.  Hursh Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.  As reflected in the Lease ledger, Sullivan owes
$996,807.16 in unpaid rent for the period from August 1, 2023, through July 31,
2024.  Hursh Decl., ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. 3. This
is amount that is fixed and readily ascertainable under the Lease Documents.
 
            3. Probability of Success 
            A claim has “probable validity”
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will recover on that
claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp
Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th
1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually
valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the
decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            CG shows that, as reflected in the Lease ledger, Sullivan owes
$996,807.16 in unpaid rent for the period from August 1, 2023, through July 31,
2024.  Hursh Decl., ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. 3.
            Sullivan
does not dispute this calculation.  It
argues that Sullivan’s inability to pay
rent was due to the fact that it was shut down due to COVID-19.  Fink Decl., ¶3.  The COVID-19 order [health order]
mandated the closure of all non-essential businesses.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  Sullivan was required by statute to
close its doors.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  To do otherwise would have been
unlawful.  Fink Decl., ¶5.  The forced closure
of all non-essential businesses meant that it was impossible and financially
unviable to use the Premises as was intended under the lease.  Fink Decl., ¶4.  Opp. at 2-3.
Although not clear,
it appears that Sullivan is relying on the doctrine of impossibility and/or
frustration oof purpose. Sullivan has the burden of proof for these affirmative
defenses.
Impossibility is an
excuse for non-performance of a contract where it is strictly impossible or
only possible because of extreme and unreasonable difficulty.  Autry v. Republic Productions, (1947)
30 Cal.2d 144, 148-49. Where the reason the parties entered the
agreement has been frustrated by a supervening circumstance that was not
anticipated, such that the value of performance by the party standing on the
contract is substantially destroyed, the doctrine of commercial frustration
applies to excuse performance.  See, e.g. Habitat Trust for Wildlife,
Inc. v. City of Rancho Cucamonga, (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1336.  “A
thing is impossible in legal contemplation when it is not practicable; and a
thing is impracticable when it can only be done at an excessive and
unreasonable cost.”  Id. at
1336.  
The doctrine of frustration of purpose applies when a change
in law frustrates the purpose of
the agreement and excuses the parties from performance.  See, e.g., Century Lites, Inc. v.
Goodman (1944), 64 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 938, 939-40 (excusing payment under a
lease for neon signs when World War II orders prohibited the use of outdoor neon
lighting equipment). A frustration of purpose defense does not apply when
government laws have only restricted and not completely destroyed use of the
premises.  See Grace v.
Croninger, (1936) 12 Cal. App. 2d 603 (lease for use as a saloon and cigar
store was not frustrated when prohibition laws prohibited the sale of liquor).  
Sullivan has failed
to meet its burden for either defense. 
It does not even identify the nature of its business or how COVID-19
orders affected it.  The Lease describes
Sullivan’s permitted use of the Premises as offices.  Hursh Decl., Ex. 1.  There is nothing about that use that was frustrated
by the pandemic or any COVID order.  Moreover,
Sullivan does not identify the pertinent COVID order or when it began and
ended.  Sullivan has failed to pay the
monthly rent and other obligations owed under the Lease Documents for the
months of August 1, 2023 through July 31, 2024. 
Hursh Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.  It is common
knowledge that COVID pandemic had ended by those dates.  Therefore, most probably no City or County of
Los Angeles COVID order applied.
Sullivan also argues that CG has not made reasonable
attempts to mitigate its damages in that it has had ample opportunity to find a
replacement tenant.  Fink Decl., ¶6.  On or about December 1, 2022, Sullivan
sent CG a letter indicating that it desired to terminate the lease.  Fink
Decl., ¶6.  On or about June 1,
2023, Sullivan send CG a second letter providing 60 days’ notice that Sullivan
would vacate the Property.  Fink Decl., ¶6.  Opp. at 3. 
These conclusions do
not meet Sullivan’s burden of proof to overcome CG’s conclusion that it has
been unsuccessful in its attempts to relet the Premises since the November 30,
2023 date that Sullivan vacated the Premises. 
Hursh Decl., ¶6.  Sullivan may
obtain more evidence on the mitigation issue through discovery and present it
at trial, but its evidence is insufficient for purposes of attachment.
 
            4.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment must not be sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which attachment is based.¿
CCP §484.090(a)(3).  CG seeks attachment
for a proper purpose.
 
E. Conclusion
The application for a right
to attach order against Sullivan is granted in the
amount of $996,807.16.  No right
to attach order will issue until CG posts a $10,000 undertaking.
