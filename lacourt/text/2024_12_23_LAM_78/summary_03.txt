And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Main 50 Housing, LP due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with court rules and procedures. The plaintiff failed to submit a copy of the Statement of Damages, a brief summary of the case, and a declaration with admissible evidence in support of the amount of damages sought. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not dismissed all parties against whom judgment is not sought and has not provided sufficient evidence to support the amount of damages sought. Additionally, the judge points out that default was entered against Alpha Construction Co., Inc. on October 11, 2024, but the company filed an Answer to the complaint on November 5, 2024, and therefore is still out of court and cannot take further steps in the case. The plaintiff is ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by January 28, 2025, and failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
