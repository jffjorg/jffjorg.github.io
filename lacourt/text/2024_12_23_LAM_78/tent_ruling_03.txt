 Case Number:  24STCV16487    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  12/23/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  24STCV16487 ALEJANDRO ROMERO vs ALPHA CONSTRUCTION CO., INC., et al REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Main 50 Housing, LP TENTATIVE RULING:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Alejandro Romero (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Alpha Construction Co., Inc., Ameriland Guard Services, Inc., Main 50 Housing, LP and Does 1 through 20 alleging that he slipped and fell on a construction site located at 5501 Main Street, Los Angeles, CA 90037 due to an unmarked and misplaced electrical cord on the sidewalk/walkway. The complaint sets forth two causes of action for (1) general negligence, and (2) premises liability.  The request for default judgment submitted on December 17, 2024 is DENIED for the following reasons:  First, for personal injury cases, Plaintiff must submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on the defendant pursuant to CRC 3.250(a)(20). The Court is unable to locate of a copy of the Statement of Damages served on Main 50 Housing, LP.  Second, Plaintiff did not file a brief summary of the case. (CRC 3.1800(a)(1).)  Third, there is no declaration filed by Plaintiff under penalty of perjury with admissible evidence in support of the amount of damages sought. (CRC 3.1800(a)(2).) A defaulting defendant admits only the well pled facts concerning liability, not damages. Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.)  Lastly, Plaintiff must dismiss all parties against whom judgment is not sought (which includes all unnamed Doe defendants) or file an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).) Here, Plaintiff has not dismissed Does 1 through 20. Both Ameriland Guard Services, Inc. and Alpha Construction Co., Inc. filed Answers to the complaint. If Plaintiff is seeking damages solely against Main 50 Housing, LP, Plaintiff must substantiate that the specific damages sought against Main 50 Housing, LP are severable and not duplicative of the damages sought against the remaining defendants.  Additionally, default was entered against Alpha Construction Co., Inc. on October 11, 2024, yet Alpha Construction Co., Inc. filed an Answer to the complaint on November 5, 2024. Entry of default cuts off a party’s right to appear in the action, including by filing pleadings, until default is set aside. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-86.) “A defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff's right of action; he cannot thereafter, until such default is set aside in a proper proceeding, file pleadings or move for a new trial or demand notice of subsequent proceedings.” (Brooks v. Nelson (1928) 95 Cal. App. 144, 147–148.)¿There is no record of the parties having stipulated to set aside entry of default, nor has there been a motion to set aside default to date. As such, the default against Alpha Construction Co. still stands.  No later than January 28, 2025, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.   The Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service and Failure to File Default Judgment Pursuant to CRC 3.740 is continued to February 6, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
