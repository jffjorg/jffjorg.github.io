  Case Number:  22STCV02983    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California¿ County of Los Angeles¿ Department 78¿ ¿ BRIAN GUADALUPE MAGALLANES, Plaintiff(s), vs.¿ GENERAL MOTORS, LLC, et al.,  Defendant(s).¿ Case No.:¿ 22STCV02983 Hearing Date:¿ December 23, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES   I. BACKGROUND On January 25, 2022, Brian Guadalupe Magallanes and Patricia Rodriguez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this lemon law action against defendant General Motors (“Defendant”). On February 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement of entire case. On November 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for attorney fees. On December 10, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On December 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply.  II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE¿¿ Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice of a series of rulings on fee motions in other Song-Beverly cases.¿¿ The Court may take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code § 452(d)(2).) The request for judicial notice is GRANTED to the extent of their existence. However, the Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters within the documents. (See C.R. Tenet Healthcare Corp. (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1094, 110.)¿  III. LEGAL STANDARD¿ Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)  In a lemon law action, costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly Act. (See Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)  Section 1794 provides: “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794.) Thus, the statute includes a “reasonable attorney’s fees” standard.  The attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Ibid.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) The Court has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time. (Horsford v. Bd. of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 359, 395.) In determining a reasonable attorney fee, the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  The lodestar may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case in order to fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided. (Ibid.) These facts include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. (Ibid.)  IV. DISCUSSION It is undisputed that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party in this action, and are therefore entitled to attorney fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code 1794(d). Plaintiffs move for an award of attorney fees in the amount of $199,525.75, consisting of (1) $128,010.50 in attorney fees (comprised of $85,706.50 to Consumer Law Experts, PC & $42,304.00 to Resolute Trials), (2) a 1.5 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees $64,005.25, (3) $5,000.00 in costs and expenses for the motion, and (4) an additional $2,500.00 multiplier for the motion and to attend the hearing. A. Reasonableness of Fees i. Reasonable Hourly Rate “The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) Plaintiffs seek to recover attorneys’ fees for 2 different attorneys (Vanessa J. Oliva and Carey B. Wood) and 1 paralegal (Robert Aguilar) from Consumer Law Experts, PC, and 1 attorney (Theodore Swanson Ramirez) from Resolute Trials who worked on the case. Their hourly rates are as follows: (1) Vanessa J. Oliva: 2022 rate of $465/hour, 2023 rate of $470/ hour, January to June 2024 rate of $490/hour, July 2024 rate of $500/ hour, and August 2024 rate of $515.00/hour; (2) Carey B. Wood: 2022 to 2023 rate of $500/hour and 2024 rate of $515.00/hour; (3) Robert Aguilar (paralegal): $175-$210/hour; and (4) Theodore Swanson Ramirez: $800/hour. For each attorney from Consumer Law Experts, PC, Oliva attests to their legal experience and the reasonableness of their rates. (Oliva Decl. ¶¶ 69-72, 74-75.) Ramirez from Resolute Trials attests to his own legal experience. (Ramirez Decl. ¶¶ 3-11.) In opposition, Defendant argues that Ramirez’s rate is 50% higher than any hourly rate previously approved by any court for him, and that the highest approved rate for Ramirez is $550, yet he seeks $800 per hour in this matter. Defendant also contests the hourly rates of Oliva and Wood, arguing that Oliva has not presented evidence to establish their requested rates. Based on the submitted evidence and the Court’s review of the rates, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ requested hourly rates for Consumer Law Experts, PC are reasonable for attorneys with the experience stated in the Oliva Declaration and by way of judicial notice. The range of rates charged in this matter by Consumer Law Experts, PC is reasonable for attorneys of similar experience, in the same area, dealing with the same subject matter. (See Goglin v BMW of North America (2016) LLC 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473-74 [approving $575 per hour fee on lemon law action for attorneys in Los Angeles]. However, the rate for Ramirez of $800 per hour is unsupported. The Court reduces Ramirez’s rate to $550 per hour. (Ramirez Decl. ¶10.) The Court therefore finds the hourly rates reasonable for Consumer Law Experts, PC, but reduces the rate for Resolute Trials to $550 per hour. ii. Reasonable Hours Incurred “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) A reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation that an attorney overlitigated a case or submitted a padded bill or that the opposing party has stated valid objections. (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.) Plaintiffs seek to recover attorneys’ fees for 213.60 hours spent by Consumer Law Experts, PC litigating this matter (Oliva Decl Ex. 19), and 52.8 hours spent by Resolute Trials (Ramirez Decl. Ex. E). A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)  Defendant argues that the bills “padded” time, and that these entries are templated and continuously used for every case without change except for case style and vehicle type. Defendant argues the following are excessive and unreasonable based on Consumer Law Experts, PC’s use of templates: (1) March 4, 2022 discovery requests billed at 1.2 hours, (2) meet and confer correspondences on April 19, 2022 and May 13, 2022 billed at 0.9 hours, (3) May 31 and September 21, 2022 motion to compel further RFP responses billed for 4.5 hours, (4) May 9, 2023 discovery responses billed for 2.6 hours, (5) May 26 and October 11, 2023 motion to compel PMQ deposition billed for 3.1 hours, (6) September 13, 2023 ex parte application billed for 1.1 hours, (7) October 10, 2023 oppositions to motions in limine billed for 2.6 hours, (8) October 19, 2023 trial documents billed for 2.9 hours, (9) January 18 and 19, 2024 motion in limine billed for 1 hour, (10) March 19 & 21, April 3 & 29, July 11 & 12, September 12, 13, & 18, October 2, 3, 23 & 29, November 11 & 13, 2024 “anticipated” time for fee motion billed for 15.8 hours. The Court has reviewed these entries and finds Defendant’s request to significantly reduce the amount of time spent to draft and prepare documents based on the use of templates to be unsupported. Even if Plaintiffs’ counsel made use of templates from prior cases to assist in drafting discovery and motions, the Court does not find that this justifies cutting the amount billed to less than an hour or a quarter of an hour for the specific challenged entries.  As to Aguilar’s billing entries, Defendant argues the entirety of his billing was purely clerical in nature. However, paralegal work is compensable, and courts have upheld the awarding of non-attorney fees, including even by non-paralegals such as legal support staff.¿(Ellis v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 853, 890 [stating time spent by non-paralegal legal staff compensable]; see also Guinn v. Dotson (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 262, 269 [stating paralegal time compensable].) Defendant did not meet its burden to challenge the entirety of Aguilar’s paralegal billed hours. As for the remainder regarding travel time, internal meetings on the case, joint appearances by Oliva and Rodriguez, communications, depositions, and hearing attendance, Defendant does not provide authority to support striking it in its entirety or reducing these entries.  However, the Court will reduce the amount of time billed for the motion and appearance to a reasonable amount. Here, Oliva billed a total of 9.8 hours to draft the fee motion (September 12, 13, 18, October 2, 3, 23, 29, and Nov. 11, 13) at a rate of $515/hour, and anticipates an additional $5,000 to review the opposition, prepare a reply and attend the hearing. The supplemental declaration filed in reply provides that Oliva actually expended $3,233.50 for the reply and anticipates $1,030 to prepare for attend the hearing. The Court reduces Oliva’s billed time spent on the fee motion from 9.8 to 4 hours (which represents a reduction of 5.8 hours in the amount of  $2,987 from the total $85,706.50 billed), and the Court grants 2 hours to review the opposition and draft the reply collectively, and one hour to attend the hearing at Oliva’s billing rate of $515/hour, which represents an addition of $1,545.00. The Court also reduces Rodriguez’s “anticipated time for hearing” from 2.0 hours to 1 hour at the reduced billing rate of $550 per hour rather than $800 per hour. Thus, of the $85,706.50 in attorney fees requested by Consumer Law Experts, PC, the Court reduces the amount to $84,264.50. As for the attorney fees requested by Rodriguez of Resolute Trials in the amount of $42,304.00, the Court reduces the amount to $28,490.00. C. Multiplier While the lodestar reflects the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community, it may be adjusted based on various factors, including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award” and (4) the success achieved. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)¿ Nonetheless, the court must not consider extraordinary skill and the other Serrano factors to the extent these are already included with the lodestar. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1138-1139.) “[A] trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the quality of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar calculation. Otherwise, the fee award will result in unfair double counting and be unreasonable.” (Id. at 1139.)¿ Plaintiffs request a lodestar multiplier enhancement of 1.5. The Court finds that a lodestar multiplier is not warranted here. Nothing before the Court indicates that the case presented novel issues or that the quality of representation far exceeded the quality of representation that would have been provided by attorneys of comparable skill and experience billing at the same rates. The¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿Plaintiffs’ attorneys¿assert are absorbed by their hourly rates.¿(See¿Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.)¿ Accordingly, the Court declines to award a lodestar multiplier.¿  V. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART. Consumer Law Experts, PC is awarded the reduced amount of $84,264.50 in attorneys’ fees and Resolute Trials is awarded the reduced amount of $28,490.00 in attorney’s fees.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: December 20, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
