 Case Number:  24STCV02636    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  12/23/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  24STCV02636 PCH PROPERTY, LLC vs TOCAYA ORGANICA, LLC, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  AMROU I. ALMANASEER TENTATIVE RULING:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiff PCH Property, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this breach of contract action against defendants Tocaya Organica, LLC d/b/a “Tocaya Organica” (“Tocaya Organica”), Amrou I. Almanaseer (“Almanaseer”), and Does 1 through 20 alleging that on May 21, 2018, Plaintiff and Tocaya Organica entered into a commercial lease agreement for Tocaya Organica’s use of the retail sales space located at 6480 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Space C-100, Long Beach, CA 90803 (“the Lease”). (Compl. ¶ 11.) Under the Lease, Tocaya Organica agreed to pay rent and continuously operate at the premises through October 31, 2029, the natural expiration of the Lease. (Compl. ¶ 19.) Almanaseer is Tocaya Organica’s guarantor. (Compl. ¶ 3.) In July 2023, Tocaya Organica breached the lease by failing to pay the full amount of rental due, and Tocaya Organica further breached the lease by unilaterally vacating the premises on December 20, 2023. (Compl. ¶¶ 20-21.) The complaint sets forth two causes of action for (1) breach of contract – against Tocaya Organica and Does 1 through 10, and (2) breach of guaranty – against Almanaseer (as the guarantor) and Does 11 through 20.  The application for default judgment filed on October 21, 2024 is denied without prejudice for the following reasons:  Plaintiff seeks the full amount prayed for in the complaint solely against Almanaseer as the guarantor of the Lease, and has not dismissed Tocaya Organica. Plaintiff must dismiss all defendants against whom default judgment is not sought pursuant to CRC 3.1800(a)(7).  Plaintiff seeks principal damages in the amount of $1,993,789.75 against Almanaseer, which is largely comprised of consequential unpaid future rental from December 2023 through the natural expiration of the Lease on October 31, 2029. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 20.) The Court finds the future consequential damages to be unsupported. Tocaya Organica vacated the premises on December 20, 2023 and the actual damages are $32,077.43 in unpaid Rental. (Lopez Decl. ¶¶ 17,19.) The commercial rental property is part of the 2nd and PCH shopping center (Lopez Decl. ¶ 2), and as a matter of business, efforts should be made to not keep any sales space empty for prolonged periods. Plaintiff’s general manager declares generally that “Plaintiff has not been able to relet the Premises to a replacement tenant, despite all its efforts of marketing the Premises.” (Lopez Decl. ¶ 20.) A default is not intended to be a windfall. The Court would like more detail of the affirmative efforts Plaintiff has made to rent Space C-100 to mitigate damages caused by the abandonment of the lease, and why Plaintiff believes it will be unable to find a replacement tenant for the next five years such that it would be entitled to anticipated rent until 2029. (See CCP § 1951.2.) A defendant’s default is not “an unalloyed gift: an opportunity to obtain a big judgment with no significant effort.” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 271.) “Instead, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove up his damages, with actual evidence.” (Id. at 272.)  Within 40 days, which is no later than January 28, 2025, Plaintiff is ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.   The Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is continued to February 6, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
