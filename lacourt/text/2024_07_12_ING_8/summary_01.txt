Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous ruling on the motion to compel further answers to deposition questions. The plaintiff argued that the Los Angeles County Assessor's statement at a city council meeting on June 4, 2024, was a "new fact" that changed the court's previous ruling. However, the judge found that the statement was not a new fact, but rather a reiteration of the Assessor's previous position that there is no policy for reassessing property when the surface moves. The judge also found that the Assessor's office assesses property based on unmodified tract maps, and that the surface movements of parcels do not trigger reassessments. Therefore, the court's original ruling stands, and the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied.
