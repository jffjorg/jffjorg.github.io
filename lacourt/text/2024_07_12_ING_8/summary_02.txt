And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to seal Exhibit A, an insurance application, and references to it in the memorandum and statement. The motion was filed by Scottsdale Insurance Company and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, who contend that the application contains confidential information and that there is an overriding interest of privacy that justifies sealing the document. The judge found that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that there are no less restrictive means to achieve the overriding interest of privacy. The judge also found that the moving parties complied with the rules of court and served the parties that have appeared in the case. The court invites argument on how to effect the sealing of the 3 sentences in the Memorandum of Points and Authorities, i.e., by filing a redacted version of the same that would not be sealed while the court seals the originally filed brief, or otherwise.
