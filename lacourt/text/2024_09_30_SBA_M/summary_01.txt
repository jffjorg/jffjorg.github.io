And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Tony Taleff's motion for replevin (or application for writ of possession) without prejudice. The motion was filed in connection with the parties' dissolution of marriage proceedings, and Taleff seeks to obtain immediate possession of three 1882 S20 Coronet Head Double Eagle Liberty Gold coins and gold pendants and chains. However, the judge found that Taleff failed to provide an evidentiary basis for his claim, failed to show that the property is being wrongfully detained, and failed to provide a statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine. Additionally, the judge noted that Taleff's contention that the gold coins are his separate property is conclusory and that the property may actually belong to a non-party, Vera Taleff. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing Taleff to refile his claim if he can provide the necessary evidence.
