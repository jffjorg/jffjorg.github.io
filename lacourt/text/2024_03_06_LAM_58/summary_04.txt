And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint in its entirety with leave to amend. The demurrer to the first through fifth causes of action is sustained because the Complaint fails to identify whether the Vehicle was purchased or leased and whether the Plaintiff accepted or rejected the goods. The demurrer to the second cause of action for violation of Civil Code, section 1793.2(d) is overruled because Kia failed to assert this ground in its earlier demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's claims are uncertain and that the Court should not dismiss the action for failure to join an indispensable party. The Court gives the Plaintiff leave to amend the Complaint and orders that the amended complaint be served and filed on or before April 5, 2024.
