And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial into two phases. The defendant, Allenco Energy Inc., Timothy James Parker, and Clifford E. Peter Allen, seeks to bifurcate the trial to determine general medical causation of cervical cancer, which is a key issue in the case. The Judge agrees that bifurcation would promote judicial economy and efficiency, minimize jury confusion, and avoid unfair prejudice. The first phase would focus on general medical causation, and if the trier of fact determines that exposure to the identified chemicals is not a cause of cervical cancer, the case would likely be resolved without further trial proceedings. The second phase would address the remaining issues, including liability and damages. The Judge notes that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced by bifurcation and that the bifurcation would allow the presentation of issues to be more compartmentalized, thereby decreasing the risk of unnecessary complexity.
