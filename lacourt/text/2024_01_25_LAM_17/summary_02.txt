Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies EBR's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication as to Grand Pacific Financing Corporation's cross-complaint. The court finds triable issues of fact regarding EBR's negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. The court concludes that EBR Escrow had a fiduciary duty to inform GPFC of the potential fraud and failed to perform under that duty. The court also finds that GPFC is entitled to restitution based on the jury's finding that EBR Escrow breached its fiduciary duty and failed to deliver "duly executed and acknowledged" loan documents. The case will proceed to a hearing on January 25, 2024.
