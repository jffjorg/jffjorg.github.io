Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a partition action case. The defendant objected to the appointment of Mr. Taylor, but did not propose alternative names. The court notes that little information was presented about Stacy, who did not appear in court. The defendant testified that she gave her mother $400 a week, but this raises questions about how her mother accumulated $54,000 in back rent. The court declines the defendant's request for appraisals, citing the property's horrific condition, which is due to the defendant's actions. The court also finds that maintenance expenses are not a shared responsibility, as the defendant and their family lived at the property while the mother was forced to live elsewhere. The court criticizes the defendant's accounting exhibits, which were not introduced into evidence and undermine the credibility of the defendant's daughter. Finally, the court notes that the defendant's "Buy Hatteras" checks were marked as exhibits but never introduced into evidence.
