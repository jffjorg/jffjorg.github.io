ANDREW LUFT, et al. 
  
        
  vs.
 
GLENHURST
  VENTURES, LLC 
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV15382
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 25, 2024



 
            
Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED, and this action is ordered stayed
pending the completion of arbitration.
 
On 6/30/2023,
Plaintiffs Andrew Luft, Jennifer Patterson, KPM Holdings, LLC, Caryn Waechter,
Rajinder Sekhon, Hyung Shin Na as trustee of the Hyung Shin Na Livign Trust
U/A, dated 7/14/2017 (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit against Glenhurt
Ventures, LLC (Defendant), alleging: (1) violations of building standards for
original construction pursuant to California Civil Code section 896 and 897.
 
            Now,
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiffs to arbitrate its Complaint, and stay this
proceeding pending the completion of arbitration. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
Where the Court has determined that an agreement to
arbitrate a controversy exists, the Court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy …unless it determines that…  grounds exist for rescission of the
agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) Among the grounds which can support
rescission are fraud, duress, and unconscionability. (Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 239.) The
Court may also decline to compel arbitration wherein there is possibility of
conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2 (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
The party moving to compel arbitration “bears the burden
of proving [the] existence [of an arbitration agreement] by a preponderance of
the evidence.” (Rosenthal v. Great
Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.) The moving party
also bears the burden of demonstrating that the claims fall within the scope of
the arbitration agreement. (Omar v.
Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
 
            Here,
Defendant submitted evidence that the CC&Rs require that construction
disputes between Plaintiffs and Defendant be arbitrated.
 
            More
specifically, Defendant submitted evidence that it recorded CC&Rs against
the community on 12/8/2017, which notified Plaintiffs that any disputes
associated with or relating to the design and/or construction of the community
must be resolved through binding arbitration. Section 10.3 of the CC&R
provides in relevant part:
 
10.3 DISPUTES
WITH DECLARANT PARTIES. Any dispute between the Association or any Owners,
on the one hand, and the Declarant, or any director, officer, partner,
shareholder, member, employee, representative, contractor, subcontractor,
design professional or agent of the Declarant (each, a “Declarant Party,” and
collectively the “Declarant Parties”), on the other hand, is a “Dispute” that
shall be resolved in accordance with the following alternative dispute
resolution procedures…
 
10.3.4
BINDING ARBITRATION. IN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE WITH A DECLARANT
PARTY IS NOT RESOLVED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 10.3.1, 10.3.2 OR 10.3.3, SUCH
DISPUTE SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO AND RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION
SHALL BE MANDATORY AND BINDING, AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION
ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT (TO THE EXTENT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT)…
 
…
 
(n)
AGREEMENT. BY TAKING TITLE TO OR ANY LEGAL INTEREST IN ALL OR ANY
PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY, THE ASSOCIATION AND EACH OWNER ARE DEEMED TO AGREE TO
HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THE MATTERS INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION 10.3
ENTITLED “DISPUTES WITH DECLARANT PARTIES” DECIDED BY NEUTRAL BINDING
ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA
ARBITRATION ACT, TO THE EXTENT THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, AND THE PARTIES ARE GIVING UP ANY RIGHTS THE
PARTIES MIGHT POSSESS TO HAVE THE DISPUTE LITIGATED IN A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.
BY TAKING TITLE TO OR ANY LEGAL INTEREST IN ANY PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION 10.3, THE PARTIES ARE GIVING UP THEIR RESPECTIVE
JUDICIAL RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL, UNLESS THOSE RIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY
INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION 10.3 ENTITLED “DISPUTES WITH DECLARANT PARTIES.” IF A
PARTY REFUSES TO SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION AFTER TAKING TITLE TO OR ANY LEGAL
INTEREST IN ANY PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY AND AGREEING, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH,
TO THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS, SUCH PARTY MAY BE COMPELLED TO ARBITRATE UNDER THE
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT, TO THE EXTENT THE
CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. BY
EXECUTING ANY GRANT DEED OR OTHER INSTRUMENT CONVEYING, BY FEE OR EASEMENT, ANY
PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY, THE GRANTEE THEREIN SHALL BE DEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT ITS AGREEMENT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS VOLUNTARY.
 
(Coppola
Decl., Exh. B, pp. 47-52.)  
 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs do not dispute being bound by the CC&Rs. However,
they contend that the ADR provisions in the CC&Rs contain a multi-step
process which Defendants have not abided by. 
 
More
specifically, Plaintiffs argue: 
 
The ADR
Provisions on which Defendant relies in its Motion to Compel Arbitration
contain a multi-step process in which the parties are first required to attempt
resolution, then mediate, and then potentially arbitrate a dispute in the event
that the prior efforts did not reach resolution. Specifically, Section 10.3,
entitled “Disputes With Declarant,” first requires Plaintiffs to send a Written
Notice of Claim to Defendant regarding the construction defects. (Defendant’s
Request for Judicial Notice (“DRJN”), Exhibit A, ¶10.3.1.) 
 
Pursuant to
Section 10.3.2 of the CC&Rs, upon receipt of the Notice of Claim, Defendant
an its representatives “have the right to (a) meet with the party alleging the
Dispute at a reasonable time and place to discuss the Dispute, (b) enter the
Community to inspect any areas that are subject to the Dispute, and (c) conduct
inspections and testing (including destructive or invasive testing) in a matter
deemed appropriate” by Defendant. (DRJN, Exhibit A, ¶10.3.2.) 
 
After
inspections, Defendant is provided full access to the Community to take
complete and corrective action, including construction repairs. (Id.) In the
event the dispute is not resolved within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
Notice, the Declarant has the option to submit the matter to mediation. (DRJN,
Exhibit A, ¶10.3.3.) No deadline for submitting the matter to mediation is
specified in the CC&Rs. (Id.) If the dispute has not been resolved after
the parties have complied with Section 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3 of the
CC&Rs, the CC&Rs next call for arbitration of the remaining claims.
(DRJN, Exhibit A, ¶10.3.3.)
 
Plaintiffs further argue that SB800 requires that ADR
procedures meet the minimum standards of the Civil Code, and that the ADR
procedures here fail to meet that standard. 
 
However, the Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiffs
are confusing prelitigation dispute resolution procedures with the right to
arbitrate. These are two separate and distinct
processes and both are separately enforceable. The arbitration provision set
forth in the CC&Rs is authorized and protected by both Federal and
California law. "California law, like federal law, favors enforcement of
valid arbitration agreements." (Armendariz v. Foundation Health
Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97.) "The Federal
Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) incorporates a strong federal policy of
enforcing arbitration agreements, including agreements to arbitrate statutory
rights." (Id. at 96-97.) In this case, Plaintiffs filed suit
against Defendant. Defendant is therefore entitled to rely on, and enforce,
their arbitration agreement, and is not required first to utilize ADR methods
for resolving pre-litigation construction disputes. Rather, Defendant must
abide by the terms of the binding arbitration agreement, and in moving to
compel arbitration has done so. 
 
Here,
Plaintiffs did not submit any evidence which could show that a binding
arbitration agreement does not exist, nor have they advanced any argument by
which to show that the agreement is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.

 
Moreover,
Defendant is not barred from enforcing the arbitration agreement because it was
inactive at the time the complaint was filed. Glenhurt Ventures is currently active
and in good standing with the Secretary of State.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is granted, and this action
is ordered stayed pending the completion of arbitration. 
 
It is so ordered.
