On February 14, 2024, the court  entered the stipulation of the parties for the filing of the first amended  complaint.    RULING: Denied. Plaintiff Chiemel Warderh moves to compel Defendant  Healthcare Partners Medical Group, P.C. to provide further responses to form  interrogatories – employments (set one), numbers 201.6, 207.1, 209.2, 211.1,  215.1, 215.2, 216.1 and 217.1. Plaintiff maintains the objections lack support  and the responses are incomplete. Defendant in opposition challenges responses  on grounds of privacy rights for both current employees and third parties, and  the responses are otherwise complete. Plaintiff in reply reiterates the  deficiencies, and maintains a compelling interest for witness discovery exists.   The court generally refers to the operative pleading for  contextual support of discovery disputes. The first amended complaint while  quite lengthy at 23 causes of action provides minimal contextual facts beyond the  Nigerian nationality and ancestry of Plaintiff, alleged discriminatory conduct,  and labor code wage and hour violations. Defendant, for context, represents  producing 414 pages of documents, a chart correlating the pages, and a  privilege log in response to a prior request for production of documents.  Defendant also represents ongoing efforts to meet and confer.    The court adheres to a robust discovery policy for  production of non-privileged discovery, with consideration of privileged  material where warranted, in order to allow for as thorough and complete  adjudication of the action as possible. Given the sheer volume of the number of  items in dispute based on the objections and arguments against production, the  court reviews the motion as a function of determining the relevance, scope of  requested discovery, and validity of the objections.    Numbers 201.6, 209.2, seeks witness information to which  Defendant objects. Plaintiff offers no challenge to the privacy objections themselves,  and instead in reply presents argument seeking to establish a compelling  interest.    No party may waive third party privacy rights. Defendant in  fact offers a protective order, and to agree upon a methodology for identifying  the witnesses while adhering to privacy standards to which Plaintiff provides  no acknowledgment. While production can be compelled, the court declines to  find the necessity for compelling disclosure given the offer of Defendant to establish  a protective basis of disclosure. The court therefore finds no compelling  interest in that reasonable, alternative means for sought after discovery  exist.   The court orders the parties to craft a solution protecting  the confidential information. The parties may enter into a protective order to  protect the information from public disclosure, which should include a method  for third party notification. The parties may also consider a potential option  allowing any identified person the option an opt out of the disclosure of their  identifying information. (Pioneer  Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 370; Los  Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center v. Superior Court (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th  288, 307, 311; Belaire-West Landscape,  Inc. v. Sup. Ct., supra, 149 Cal.App.4th  at pp. 561-562.) If the parties are unable to determine a solution for notice  and opt out, the court can order the appointment of a discovery referee for the  limited purpose of examining the information and reviewing the results.    Numbers 207.1 contains subparts that only require further  response if applicable. Defendant maintains subparts (d) and (e) are not  applicable. The response is complete.    Number 211.1 provides responsive information as to potential  benefits. The lack of supporting documents, such as paystubs is not part of the  scope of the subject discovery. The court declines to consider collateral  discussion regarding efforts to obtain payroll information. The court reminds  to Plaintiff to avoid citing unpublished opinions in law and motion, as such  authority cannot be considered by the court.    Numbers 215.1, 215.2 provide a complete response in that  Defendant maintains no interviews of any requested witnesses occurred. While  Defendant would be required to identify any such potential people, any content still  remains privileged. “An objecting party may be  entitled to protection if it can make a preliminary or foundational showing  that answering the interrogatory would reveal the attorney's tactics,  impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in opposing counsel  taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or efforts”].) (Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 502.) Notes,  statements, and impressions of the case are protected by the work product  doctrine. A list of potential witnesses is not work product. (Id. at p. 495; Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996) 47  Cal.App.4th 214, 217–218.) The court therefore finds no basis to compel a  further response.   Number 216.1 provides a complete response, including  referenced documents. Nothing in the motion establishes a requirement that  Defendant identify the exact pages of each and every identified item. Defendant  is not required to compile evidence in order to help Plaintiff prosecute the  action against it.   On Number 217.1, the response is complete. The parties may  negotiate identification and notification protocols as addressed in numbers  201.6 and 209.2.   In summary, the motion to compel further responses to Form  Interrogatories – Employment (set one) is DENIED without prejudice subject to  the parties entering into a protective order and/or notification system for  numbers 201.6, 209.2, and 217.1. If Defendant refuses to cooperate, Plaintiff  may return for limited address of any barriers to the agreement, and NOTHING  ELSE. The remainder of the items are DENIED with prejudice.   The  court declines to impose sanctions given the limited items requiring further  communication and agreement. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.  (d).)   This  court does not conduct independent discovery conferences. The subject motions continue  to usurp significant court resources.  A  third motion for protective order is scheduled for October 14, 2024; and motion  to compel deposition for October 28, 2024. Continued voluminous disputes may  lead to the setting of an OSC re: Discovery Referral. The court may accelerate  any potential OSC if the parties again return for any ex parte relief on any  further discovery disputes.    Plaintiff to  give notice.Dept.

Covenant Of Good Faith And Fair Dealing. On February 14, 2024, the court
entered the stipulation of the parties for the filing of the first amended
complaint.  RULING: Granted in Part/Denied in Part.Defendant, Healthcare Partners Medical Group, P.C. moves for
a protective order requiring no further production on Special Interrogatories
(set one) numbers 3, 12, 22-25, 29, 32 and 57-68. Plaintiff Chiemel Warderh moves
to compel Defendant Healthcare Partners Medical Group, P.C. to provide further
production of request for special interrogatories, numbers 3, 12, 22-25, and 29-32.
Given the motions address a number of common items, the court consolidates the
ruling. The court generally refers to the operative pleading for
contextual support of discovery disputes. The first amended complaint while
quite lengthy at 23 causes of action provides minimal contextual facts beyond the
Nigerian nationality and ancestry of Plaintiff, alleged discriminatory conduct,
and labor code wage and hour violations. Defendant, for context, represents
producing 414 pages of documents, a chart correlating the pages, and a
privilege log in response to a prior request for production of documents.
Defendant also represents ongoing efforts to meet and confer.  The court adheres to a robust discovery policy for
production of non-privileged discovery, with consideration of privileged
material where warranted, in order to allow for as thorough and complete
adjudication of the action as possible. Given the sheer volume of the number of
items in dispute based on the objections and arguments against production, the
court reviews the motion as a function of determining the relevance, scope of
requested discovery, and validity of the objections.  The court first notes that Plaintiff only seeks further
responses to numbers 3, 12, 22-25, and 29-32, while Defendant seeks a
protective order for numbers 3, 12, 22-25, 29, 32 and 57-68. It appears that
numbers 30, 31, and 57-68, are separate and apart from the motion to compel
further responses. Given the lack of any pending motion to compel further
responses to numbers 57-68, and lack of any challenge to numbers 31 and 32, the
court first addresses the motion to compel furthers and overlapping protective order
on the operative items.  Defendant categorizes the challenges within two groups: 3,
22, 23 are compound, conjunctive, and contain impermissible subparts (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.060, subd. (f); numbers 12, 24, 25, 29, and 32 cause an undue
burden and expense in that the requests constitute duplicative requests.
Plaintiff opposes the motion on grounds of lack of good cause, and failure to
diligently present the motion. Plaintiff denies the interrogatories are
compound or seek duplicative information. Defendant in rely maintains the motion
is not moot as to numbers 57-68, Plaintiff lacks support for compelling further
responses, the protective order is timely, and good cause exists. Number 3: Please describe the working relationship of each
supervisor who supervised PLAINTIFF, while PLAINTIFF was employed by DEFENDANT,
by stating each supervisor's full name, job title, and dates of employment,
describing all duties and responsibilities each supervisor had with regards to
overseeing PLAINTIFF, and providing the last known address, cellular phone
number, and all known personal emails of each supervisor. Number 22: As to each company policy of DEFENDANT; which was
designed to prevent unlawful discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation
from occurring in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act,
to PLAINTIFF, as well as the other employees employed at the same time as
PLAINTIFF; please identify all MANAGING AGENTS ("MANAGING AGENT"
means any officer, director, managing agent, and/or any person whose decisions
can determine corporate policy for DEFENDANT) who were responsible for ensuring
the policies were being followed by DEFENDANT's MANAGEMENT
("MANAGEMENT" refers to employees of DEFENDANT that were placed in a
management or supervisory role over other employees of DEFENDANT) to prevent
unlawful discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation from occurring to
PLAINTIFF, as well as the other employees employed at the same time as
PLAINTIFF, by stating each MANAGING AGENT's name, office address, job title,
direct supervisor, and dates of their employment with DEFENDANT. Number 23: Please identify the MANAGING AGENT(s) for
DEFENDANT who oversaw human resources for DEFENDANT and was responsible for
human resource policy at the time of PLAINTIFF's TERMINATION, by stating each
MANAGING AGENT's name, office address, job title, direct supervisor, and dates
of their employment with DEFENDANT. The plain language of the interrogatories contains subparts,
thereby rendering the interrogatories invalid. The motion is granted as to 3,
22, and 23. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd. (f).) On numbers 12, 24, 25, 29, and 32, Defendant represents the
provision of the sought after information. Plaintiff acknowledges
identification of the persons in number 12, but challenges the lack of
follow-up contact information. The argument while correctly acknowledging the
lack of follow-up information also disregards the statement that all
information will be provided upon contacting counsel. The court assumes the
information was not otherwise disclosed due to privacy objections to which
Plaintiff offers no counter. While the requests are redundant with other
interrogatories, Defendant still provided the subject information, and offered
further follow upon address of the privacy objections (see motion to compel
further responses to form interrogatories – employment (set one).). The motion
for protective order is therefore granted as to number 12. Numbers 24, 25, 29, and 32, seek identification of documents,
benefits and basis for disciplinary action, which again, after the objections,
Defendant provides responses to the identified range of items. While Plaintiff
challenges the quality of the responses, the court declines to review each and
every document presented for verification of exact sufficient compliance on
behalf of Plaintiff. The court finds Plaintiff otherwise fails to establish a
specific basis for the deficiency in production. The motion for protective
order is granted as to these items as well. In granting the motion for protective order to all
overlapping special interrogatories, the motion to compel further responses to special
interrogatories (set one), numbers 3, 12, 22-25, 29, and 32 is DENIED as moot.
The court also DENIES the motion for protective order on numbers 57-68 in that
Plaintiff submits no motion seeking to compel further responses to the subject
items, thereby rendering the motion necessary. The time frame for potential
enforcement via a motion lapsed, and the court declines to provide an advisory
order. On the motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories numbers 30-31, the court agrees the requests are compound.
Again, Defendant provided identifying information and agreed to provide further
information via counsel due to privacy protections. The motion is therefore
DENIED as to these items. In summary, the motion for protective order is GRANTED as to
3, 12, 22-25, 29, and 32. The motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories (set one) is DENIED in its entirety.  The
court awards $500 in sanctions in favor of Defendant and counsel of record for
the protective order. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.090, subd. (d).)
Payable in 30 days. This
court does not conduct independent discovery conferences. The subject motions continue
to usurp significant court resources.  A
third motion for protective order is scheduled for October 14, 2024; and motion
to compel deposition for October 28, 2024. Continued voluminous disputes may
lead to the setting of an OSC re: Discovery Referral. The court encourages the
parties to consider the guidelines provided in the prior orders before the
impending hearings, and strongly engage in meet and confer efforts to reduce
the scope of issues and/or perhaps lead to resolution.  The
court may accelerate any potential OSC for referee referral if the parties continue
to return for ex parte relief on any further discovery disputes.  Moving parties
to give notice.
