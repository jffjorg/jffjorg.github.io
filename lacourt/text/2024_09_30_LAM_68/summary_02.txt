And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant to provide further responses to special interrogatories, but grants the Defendant's motion for a protective order. The court finds that the Plaintiff's motion lacks sufficient support and that the Defendant has already provided the requested information. The court also notes that the Plaintiff's motion is compound and seeks duplicative information. The court awards $500 in sanctions to the Defendant and counsel of record. The parties are encouraged to engage in meet and confer efforts to reduce the scope of issues and/or lead to resolution. The court may accelerate any potential OSC for referee referral if the parties continue to return for ex parte relief on any further discovery disputes.
