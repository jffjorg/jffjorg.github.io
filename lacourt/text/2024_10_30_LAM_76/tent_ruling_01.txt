Texas moves to compel arbitration.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
            
            Defendant Burlington Coat Factory of
Texas’s motion to compel arbitration is currently MOOT. Plaintiff has submitted
her claim to the American Arbitration Association. Defendant’s request that the
Court issue an order compelling arbitration anyone is DENIED. The Court
arguably does not have jurisdiction anymore, as the case is now in arbitration.
More fundamentally, “[t]he law neither does nor requires idle acts.” (Civil
Code § 3532.)
 
 
The Court sets a status
conference regarding the status of arbitration for June 25, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
