And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration brought by the defendant, Burlington Coat Factory of Texas. The motion is currently moot because the plaintiff has already submitted their claim to the American Arbitration Association. The judge denies the defendant's request for an order compelling arbitration, citing the fact that the Court no longer has jurisdiction over the case since it has been submitted to arbitration. The judge also sets a status conference for June 25, 2025, to discuss the status of the arbitration.
