The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Plaintiff Alfredo Reyes and Defendant Kia America, Inc. The Defendant had moved to compel Plaintiff to respond to requests for production of documents and requested sanctions. However, since Plaintiff has since served responses, the motion to compel is now moot. The Judge did grant the Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel Downtown L.A. Law Group in the amount of $500, which must be paid within 20 days. The Judge also notes that oral argument will not be permitted unless notice of intention to appear is given.
