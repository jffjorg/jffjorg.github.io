The plaintiff, American Credit Acceptance, LLC, has established the probable validity of their claim to possession of the property. The defendant, Brittany Nicole Penrow, was properly served with the Summons and Complaint by substitute service. The Court finds that the amount owed by the defendant ($25,092.34) exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($14,131), so no undertaking is required. However, the Court is ordering a redelivery bond in the amount of $14,131, which is the current fair market value of the vehicle.
