  Case Number:  21STCP02365    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  86  MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date:               10/3/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:               Save Our Slopes v. City of
Monterey Park (21STCP02365)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Counsel Whitney A. Hodges and
Allison C. Wong of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for real party in interest Center International Investments
is GRANTED CONDITIONALLY, subject to submission of an amended proposed order as
discussed below.
 
In item 6 of the proposed order,
submitted on 8/13/24, counsel for real party in interest states that real
party’s last known address is 1648 Puente Avenue, Baldwin Park, California
91706 and/or 501 W. Garvey Avenue, #207, Monterey Park, CA 91754. However, on
8/26/24, counsel filed a proof of service indicating that real party was
personally served at 561 Ramona Avenue, Sierra Madre, CA 91024 on 8/20/24 (after
the proposed order was lodged). It thus appears that item 6 of the proposed
order should reflect real party’s current address where service was effectuated.
In addition, item 6 does not contain real party’s telephone number—either current
or last known.
 
No later than 10/9/24, counsel shall
lodge a proposed order for the Court’s signature. On item 6 of the proposed
order, counsel shall indicate real party’s current address and telephone
number, specifying whether the telephone number is current or last known.
Counsel must also indicate in item 5 of the proposed order that counsel will be
relieved effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order
upon the client (not on the date of the hearing on the instant motion, as
proposed by counsel). Upon submission of the amended proposed order as directed
above, the Court will sign the amended proposed order.
