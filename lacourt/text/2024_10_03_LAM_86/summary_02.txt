And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued by the defendants to Corporate Kit Supply (CKS). The defendants seek production of documents related to Yellow Owl Properties Managements, Inc., including purchase orders, invoices, receipts, and communications. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena is overbroad, seeks personal records, and was improperly served. However, the judge finds that the subpoena is relevant to the litigation, seeks business records, and was properly served. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the subpoena was served too late and that the requests are too broad. The motion is denied, and CKS is ordered to comply with the subpoena by October 18, 2024.
