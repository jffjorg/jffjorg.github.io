Date:               10/3/24 (1:30 PM) 
Case:               American Credit Acceptance, LLC v. Brittany Nicole
Penrow (24STLC02886) 
  
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Plaintiff American Credit Acceptance’s UNOPPOSED Application
for Writ of Possession is GRANTED. 
 
On 8/27/24, the Court issued a tentative ruling denying the
motion because no proof of service had been filed indicating that defendant Brittany
Nicole Penrow had been served with the Summons and Complaint, as required by
CCP § 512.030. Counsel for plaintiff requested a continuance. (8/27/24 Minute
Order.) The Court continued the hearing to 10/3/24 with plaintiff to provide
notice. 
 
On 8/27/24, plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of Summons
indicating that defendant was served the Summons and Complaint by substitute
service. On 9/12/24, plaintiff served and filed a notice of continuance of the
hearing. Defendant having been properly served pursuant to CCP § 512.030,
the Court rules on the merits of the application. 
 
The Court finds that plaintiff has established the probable
validity of its claim to possession of the property, namely, a 2018 Honda
Accord (VIN 1HGCV1F12JA232195). 
 
No undertaking is required. The amount owed ($25,092.34)
exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($14,131). (CCP § 515.010; Hall Decl. ¶¶
10, 12 & Exs. 3, 4.)
 
Redelivery bond is ordered. The written undertaking required
by the defendant for redelivery or to stay delivery is in the amount of $14,131,
the current fair market value of the vehicle. (Hall Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. 4.)
