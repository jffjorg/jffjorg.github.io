Date:               10/3/24 (1:30 PM) 
Case:               1138 Princeton, LLC v. Santa Monica Rent Control Board (24STCP02381) 
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner 1138 Princeton, LLC’s Motion for a Preliminary
Injunction is DENIED. 
 
Respondent Santa Monica Rent Control Board’s evidentiary
objections to the declarations of Jorge Velasquez and Ada R. Cordero-Sacks are
OVERRULED. Respondent and petitioner’s respective requests for judicial notice
is DENIED in their entirety as “unnecessary to the resolution” of the issues
before the Court. (Martinez v. San Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50
Cal.App.5th 1048, 1075.) 
 
Petitioner moves for a preliminary injunction to enjoin respondent
Santa Monica Rent Control Board (“Board”) and real party tenants from
implementing the four rent reductions in favor of real party tenants, which
were ordered in respondent’s July 5, 2024 decision.  
 
“[T]he question whether a preliminary injunction should be
granted involves two interrelated factors: (1) the likelihood that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms
that is likely to result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive
relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 554.) Before
the Court can exercise its discretion and consider the two interrelated
factors, however, “the applicant must make a prima facie showing of entitlement
to injunctive relief. The applicant must demonstrate a real threat of immediate
and irreparable injury due to the inadequacy of legal remedies.” (Triple A
Machine Shop, Inc. v. State of California (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 131, 138,
citation omitted.) 
 
“[A]n injunction is an unusual or extraordinary equitable
remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually damages) will
adequately compensate the injured plaintiff,” and the party seeking injunctive
relief bears the burden to prove its absence. (Department of Fish & Game
v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist. (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1564-65.) “Mere monetary loss is not ordinarily irreparable in the
contemplation of the remedy by injunction. At least, it should not be
considered so in the absence of any averment or showing that the parties
causing the loss are insolvent or in any manner unable to respond in damages.”
(Duvall v. White (1920) 46 Cal.App. 305, 308.)
 
The foregoing principles concerning injunctive relief remain
applicable notwithstanding petitioner’s attempts to distinguish the facts of
the cases. (See also CCP § 526(a)(4) [injunction may be granted “[w]hen
pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief” and “[w]here it would
be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation which would
afford adequate relief”].) 
 
Here, petitioner maintains that the rent reductions ordered
by the Board will create a negative cash flow of -$9,154 per month from at
least August 2024 until December 2024. (Velasquez Decl. ¶¶ 12-20.) Petitioner
also maintains that the tenant in one of the units at issue was contemplating
moving, which means that the likelihood of recouping its loss should petitioner
ultimately prevail on its petition for writ of mandate is unlikely. (Velasquez
Decl. ¶¶ 26, 30(c).)
 
Plaintiff’s assertion of harm is solely financial hardship,
which is not irreparable. If plaintiff prevails on the instant petition and the
tenants fail were to fail to pay back rent owed, plaintiff would have recourse
to bring a civil action for damages against any such tenant. This is true even
if certain tenants were to relocate in response to an order from this Court reversing
the Board’s decision, as such tenants could still be served with a summons and
complaint. Further, plaintiff’s assertion of harm is based on the loss of
rental revenue for four units. (Velasquez Decl. ¶¶ 12, 19.) It is unclear
whether plaintiff’s assertion of total monthly revenue, from which the
purportedly negative cash flow was calculated, is based on all 24 units at the
property or only 8 units, as petitioner references two structures with four
units each. (Velasquez Decl. ¶¶ 8 [24 households], 14 [monthly revenue for “1132-1136
Princeton, Units A through D” and “1138-1142 Princeton, Units A through D].) Consequently,
plaintiff’s assertion of irreparable harm lacks foundation and is ambiguous at
best.
 
Because plaintiff fails to show irreparable harm due to the
inadequacy of legal remedies, the Court declines to consider the likelihood
that plaintiff will prevail on the merits or the balance of harms that would
result from the proposed preliminary injunction. 
 
To the extent that petitioner relies on CCP § 1094.5(g) for
a stay of the Board’s decision (Mtn. at 6:6-12), the Court declines to stay the
decision as against the public interest. 
The Rent Control Law and implementing regulations at issue provide for
rent reductions due to unreasonable construction impacts, which is a benefit to
renting members of the public.  Thus, notwithstanding
plaintiff’s assertion that construction ultimately increases housing stock
(Cordero-Sacks Decl. Ex. 4 at 5, Ex. 5 at 43-49), the Court finds that any stay
of respondent’s decision would be against the public interest here.
 
The motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED
