Summary in English text:
The Judge has denied the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction filed by 1138 Princeton, LLC (Petitioner) against the Santa Monica Rent Control Board (Respondent). The Petitioner sought to enjoin the implementation of rent reductions ordered by the Board, which were intended to benefit renting members of the public. The Judge found that the Petitioner failed to show irreparable harm due to the inadequacy of legal remedies, as the Petitioner would have recourse to bring a civil action for damages against tenants who fail to pay back rent. The Judge also found that the Petitioner's assertion of harm was based solely on financial hardship, which is not irreparable. The Judge further declined to stay the Board's decision, as it is in the public interest to allow the rent reductions to take effect.
