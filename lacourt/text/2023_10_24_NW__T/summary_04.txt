And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the defendant's motion for sanctions and a grant of the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain exhibits. The defendant's motion for sanctions is denied because it was not properly served, as it was served via email on July 18, 2023, but the operative pleading at that time was the original complaint, not the Second Amended Complaint, which was filed on August 15, 2023. The judge finds that the defendant's reliance on an email notifying of an "intent" to file a sanctions motion is insufficient and that the chronology of the events and filing of pleadings belie the defendant's contention.

The plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is also denied because it failed to show compliance with the Safe Harbor Provision, which requires a motion for sanctions to be filed separately from other motions or requests. The judge notes that the plaintiff's inclusion of a sanctions request in the opposition is improper because such a request requires its own separate motion.

The judge grants the defendant's request for judicial notice of exhibits N, O, and P, but denies the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of exhibits 12, 13-17, as it is only granted as to the existence of the pleading and not as to any hearsay or facts in dispute.
