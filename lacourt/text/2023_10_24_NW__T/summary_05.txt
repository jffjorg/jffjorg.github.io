```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate the cases. The Judge denies the motion, stating that there is no reason to consolidate the cases. The claims by Ava M are limited to monetary damages only, and the eviction proceeding in the other case pertains to the right of Mr. Maly to evict Ms. Sharifabad. The Judge believes that the issue of whether the minor has the right to occupy the premises can be handled in the eviction proceeding, as the court will need to consider whether Ms. Sharifabad can be evicted if the minor child has the right to stay. Since Ava M is a defendant in the eviction proceeding by virtue of the prejudgment claim, the Judge will not consolidate the proceedings.
