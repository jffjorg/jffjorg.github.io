  Case Number:  22VECV00328    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  T Papa v 7020 Van Nuys Blvd 22VECV00328
Tentative ruling: Motion for sanctions
1.  Motion for
terminating sanctions is denied
2.  The court needs
more information on where the delay is coming from: is it coming  from plaintiffs or their counsel.  The court is inclined to think counsel. The
court will hear from Mr. Smith.  Monetary
sanctions were requested only against plaintiffs.  If it is not the plaintiffs that are causing
delay and inadequate responses (and it is the attorney who generally prepares them)
should the court assess the sanctions against them?  No sanctions were requested against the
attorney.  Was that a tactical
decision?  The court hear argument.
