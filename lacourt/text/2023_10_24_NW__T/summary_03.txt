And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and recalls the writ of possession, as the default was entered due to the defendant's mistake or excusable neglect. The defendant mistakenly believed that their insurance company would assign counsel to defend the action and therefore failed to respond to the complaint. The court finds that this mistake was sufficient to vacate the default judgment. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees, but reduces the amount from $1,000.00 to $450.00.
