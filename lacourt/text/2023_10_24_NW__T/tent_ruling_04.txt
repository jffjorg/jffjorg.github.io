 Case Number:  23VECV02319    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV02319 CALTON V PAYQWICK
The tentative ruling below for denying the motion was not
raised in the Opposition.  As such,
Defendant may argue that they are being "blind-sided" by the
ruling.  If  Defendant feels that it needs time to
respond, then the Court may CONTINUE the hearing to allow Defendant an
opportunity to address the failures/defects in the motion identified below. The
SAC was not in existence back on July 18, 2023.
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Green Check Verified, Inc.’s Motion for Sanctions is
DENIED.  
Defendant Green Check Verified, Inc.’s Request for Judicial
Notice of Exhibits N, O. and P is GRANTED.
Plaintiff Morgan Calton’s Request for Judicial Notice is
GRANTED as to Exhibit 12 but only as to the existence of the pleading and not
as to any hearsay or facts in dispute; GRANTED as to Exhibits 13-17.
Plaintiff Morgan Calton’s Request for Sanctions is DENIED. 
The objections to evidence are irrelevant for purposes of
this tentative ruling.
Introduction 
Defendant Green Check Verified, Inc. (Defendant) moved for
dismissal and monetary sanctions of $40,305.00 (128.7 Motion) against Plaintiff
Morgan Calton’s (Plaintiff) Second Amended Complaint (SAC).  Defendant’s request for monetary sanction is
against Plaintiff and  Counsels,
Fairchild A.P.C., Aaron Fairchild, and Andrew S. Levine, jointly and
severally.  
In the Opposition, Plaintiff also requested monetary
sanctions of $35,686.75 to be levied against Defendant and Counsels, Buchalter,
A.P.C., Tracy Warren, Kathryn Fox, and Yvonne Ricardo, jointly and severally.           
Discussion  
A 128.7 Motion may not be filed until 21 days after it is
served (Safe Harbor Provision).  (Code
Civ. Proc., sec. 128.7(c)(1); Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured Asset Sales,
LLC (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 596, 605.)  
Substantial compliance with the Safe Harbor Provision is
insufficient.  The notice of motion and
the motion to be served must be the same papers which are to be filed with the
Court.  (Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65
Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 15.)  ““Close” is
good enough in horseshoes and hand grenades, but not in the context of the
sanctions statue.” (Hart v. Avetoom (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 410, 414.)  Per the Declaration of Tracy Warren (Warren),
Defendant served a sanctions motion via email on July 18, 2023.  The email was sent by Warren’s legal
assistant, Amalia Alvarado.  (Warren
Decl. par. 3, Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice (DRJN) Exh. M.)  Warren attested, rather conclusorily, that
the instant 128.7 Motion complied with Code of Civil Procedure section
128.7(c).  However, service of a motion
on July 18, 2023 (although titled exactly the same as the instant 128.7 Motion)
could not have addressed or argued against the operative pleading, the
SAC.  The SAC was filed on August 15,
2023 as a result of an August 7, 2023 Stipulation and Order.  To address the August 15, 2023 SAC, the
instant 128.7 Motion must have been served on a date after August 15,
2023.  It is apparent that the July 18,
2023 service of a sanctions motion was in response to a prior pleading,
possibly the First Amended Complaint (FAC) which was filed on July 7, 2023 (or
even the original Complaint filed on May 25, 2023.)  The July 18, 2023 service of a sanctions
motion could not have been the same as the instant 128.7 Motion filed on
September 21, 2023 due to the chronology of the filing of the multiple
pleadings – original Complaint, the FAC and the SAC.  
Defendant further appeared to argue that a July 6, 2023
email notifying of an “intention” to file a sanctions motion is sufficient to
comply with the Safe Harbor Provision. 
(See Warren Decl. par. 2, DRJN Exh. L and Memorandum pg. 7:24-26.)  Preliminarily, as noted above, the actual
notice of the motion and the motion must be served to comply with the Safe
Harbor Provision.  Nothing in the attached
July 6, 2023 email showed that any attachments were included with the
email.  Defendant’s reliance upon an email
notifying of an “intent” to file a sanctions motion is insufficient.  Further, the chronology of the events and/or
filing of pleadings belie Defendant’s contention.  When the July 6, 2023 email asserting an
intent to file a sanctions motion was sent, the operative pleading was the
original complaint filed on May 25, 2023. 
Since the July 6, 2023 email was sent, the operative pleading has changed.  Plaintiff filed the FAC the very next day,
July 7, 2023, and then by Stipulation and Order, Plaintiff filed the SAC on
August 15, 2023.  It is chronologically
impossible for the July 6, 2023 email to serve as a warning to Plaintiff that
the SAC was not in compliance with the certification requirements in Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.7, let alone show that the instant 128.7 Motion was
served in July 2023.  Defendant’s
contention that Plaintiff’s claims in the SAC are “almost identical” to the
original Complaint is of no consequence because the 128.7 Motion and compliance
with the Safe Harbor Provision must be made against the operative pleading, the
SAC.
The 128.7 Motion is DENIED. 

In the Opposition, Plaintiff requested monetary sanctions
per Code of Civil Procedure, section 128.7 based upon the instant 128.7 Motion
improper certification.  However,
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.7 also failed to show compliance with the same Safe Harbor
Provision reviewed above.  Concurrent
with the filing of the Opposition, Plaintiff filed a brief titled “Plaintiff Morgan
Calton’s Notice of Intent to Seek Costs and Fees in Connection with Opposition
to Motion for Sanctions” (Notice of Intent). 
Plaintiff’s Notice of Intent is insufficient because it was not served
21 days prior to the filing of the Opposition and it was not the exact same
“motion for sanctions” to be filed.  The
Opposition’s request for sanctions also failed to comply with the statute’s
requirement that a motion for sanction be filed separately from other motions
or requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
128.7(c)(1).)  Although not cited as
grounds for the Opposition’s request for sanctions, the Court noted that the
subsection (h) of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 provides for a “motion
for sanctions” when a motion for sanctions is brought for an improper
purpose.  As such, Plaintiff’s inclusion
of a sanctions request in the Opposition is improper because such a request
requires its own separate motion per Code of Civil Procedure, section
128.7(h).  
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED without
prejudice.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
