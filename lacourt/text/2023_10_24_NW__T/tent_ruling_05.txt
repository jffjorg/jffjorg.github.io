 Case Number:  23VECV02649    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV02649 Ava M v Maly­REVISEDTentative ruling on motion to consolidate: Deny.  The court does not believe that there is any reason to consolidate the cases.  The claims by Ava M pertain to monetary damages only.  The UD action pertains to the right of Mr. Maly to evict Ms. Sharifabad.  The issue of whether the minor has the right to occupy the premises can be handled in the UD action because the court will be faced with whether Ms. Sharifibad can be evicted  if the minor child has the right to stay.  Ava M. is a defendant in the UD case by virtue of the prejudgment claim. Therefore, the court will not consolidate the proceedings.
