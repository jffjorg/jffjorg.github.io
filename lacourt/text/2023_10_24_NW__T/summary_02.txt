And here is a summary in English text:

Judge T Sanchez has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for proposal (RFP) filed by the plaintiff, V. The judge denied the motion due to the plaintiff's failure to meet and confer in good faith with the defendant, GM. The plaintiff's counsel sent a single letter in June 2023, and the defendant responded with a letter stating its intent to not provide additional substantive documents. The plaintiff did not seek to advance the hearing on the motion and waited months before filing the motion. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith and that there must be consequences for the delay in addressing problems with the defendant's responses to discovery. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 2023.010(i), 2023.020, and 2023.030 in support of the ruling.
