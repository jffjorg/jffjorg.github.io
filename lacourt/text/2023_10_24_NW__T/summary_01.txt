And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Sanctions, denying the motion to terminate sanctions. The Judge notes that more information is needed to determine the cause of the delay, which the Judge believes may be coming from the attorney rather than the plaintiffs. The Judge is inclined to think that the attorney is responsible for the delay and inadequate responses, and has requested that Mr. Smith, the attorney, provide more information. The Judge also questions whether the decision not to request sanctions against the attorney was a tactical decision. The Judge intends to hear argument on the motion for sanctions and will make a final ruling after reviewing the information provided.
