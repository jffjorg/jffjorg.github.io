And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Smart & Final LLC and Smart & Final Stores LLC, seeks an order compelling the plaintiff, Jacqueline Escobar, to undergo a second physical examination by Dr. Hillel Sperling. The defendant argues that since the plaintiff has already been examined once by Dr. Nathaneal Heckman, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in knees, it should now be able to require the plaintiff to undergo an additional examination by Dr. Sperling, who is a spine specialist. However, the court finds that the defendant failed to provide evidence of the scope of Dr. Heckman's examination, and therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice. The court notes that the defendant's motion lacks adequate meet and confer process between counsel and that the proposed examination date is in the past.
