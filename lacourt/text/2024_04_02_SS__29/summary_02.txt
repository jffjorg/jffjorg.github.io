Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has considered the evidence presented. The defendant has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff cannot establish a breach of duty by the defendant. The court has reviewed the evidence and has determined that there are triable issues of material fact. Specifically, the court finds that there is evidence that the defendant did not have actual or constructive notice of the spill on the floor, and that the defendant did not produce evidence of hourly or periodic inspection or cleaning of the restrooms. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant had a duty to inspect the floor. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
