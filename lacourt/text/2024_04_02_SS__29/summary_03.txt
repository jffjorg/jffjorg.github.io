And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiffs' counsel, Kelly Lawrence Casado, stated that the June 14, 2023 hearing was not properly calendared, leading to counsel's nonappearance. The court found that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. Therefore, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal. The court set aside the dismissal order and set an OSC re dismissal for failure to file proof of service in approximately 30 days.
