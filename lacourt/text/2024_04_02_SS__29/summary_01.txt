And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court plans to hear from counsel on several issues regarding the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court is concerned that the plaintiff's response does not comply with California Rules of Court, as it does not cite specific evidence. The court also questions the plaintiff's claim that she fell, as she does not provide a specific estimate of the location. Additionally, the court is unclear about the allegedly dangerous condition of the curb, which the plaintiff claims is uneven and has red paint that camouflages cracks and grooves in the sidewalk. The court requests that counsel address these issues during the hearing.
