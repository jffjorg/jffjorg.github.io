 Case Number:  21STCV20011    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to  Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One)  Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Requests for Production (Set  One)   Tentative The motions are granted. Background On May 27, 2021, Kyung Sil Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a  complaint against Hyo Rang Lee, M.D. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100 for  Medical Malpractice/Professional Negligence arising from a medical procedure on  February 25, 2020.  On October 3, 2023,  Defendant filed an answer.   On October 27, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with discovery,  including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One),  and Requests for Production (Set One). (Rubaum  Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A and Exh. B.)   No responses were provided.  (Id.,  ¶¶ 3-5.)    On January 31, 2024, Defendant filed these motions to  compel.  No opposition has been filed.    Legal Standard   A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days  after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom  interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the  interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit  for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are  required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.  v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor  must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who  fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  When a party moves to compel initial responses to  interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one  subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.  (c).) A party must respond to requests for production of  documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,  subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed  does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order  compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There  is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and  confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare  Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th  390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who  fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  When  a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be  propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the  summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2033.020(b).) Discussion On October 27, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with written discovery. (Rubaum Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A  and B.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id.)   Defendant need not show anything more.  The motions to compel are GRANTED. The requests for sanctions are DENIED.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section  2023.030, subdivision (a), an award of sanctions must be “authorized by the  chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of  this title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,  subd. (a).)  For interrogatories and  requests for production, the statutes authorize sanctions “against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel initial  responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300,  subd. (c).)   The Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Justice Moor,  made this very point in City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC  (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504 (“sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not  independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse  of discovery … without regard to any other provision of the Discovery Act”).  The Court is aware that the California  Supreme Court has granted review of that case.   The order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that  pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its  persuasive value.”  The Court finds the  reasoning of Justice Moor to be persuasive. Here, no opposition has been filed.  Accordingly, there is no statutory basis for  an award of sanctions. Conclusion The Court GRANTS the  motions to compel. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to  provide verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objections, to  Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One),  and Request for Production of Documents (Set One), within 21 days of notice. The Court DENIES Defendant’s request  for sanctions. Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
