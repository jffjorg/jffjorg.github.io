Here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motions to compel plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The defendant served the plaintiff with these discovery requests on October 27, 2023, but the plaintiff has not responded. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond waives all objections and grants the defendant's motions to compel. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the discovery requests without objections within 21 days of notice.
