 Case Number:  20STCV41121    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
TENTATIVE
 
The
motion is denied.
 
Background
 
On October 27, 2020, Moraima
Mora-Taximoroa and Efren Tellez (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint
against The Salvation Army (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 30. On January 11,
2021, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint against the same defendants.
On February 9, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (the “SAC”)
against the same defendants. In the SAC, Plaintiffs assert causes of action for
general negligence, premises liability, and loss of consortium causes of action
arising from an alleged slip and fall incident on December 1, 2018.
On March 16, 2021, Defendant
filed its answer to the SAC as well as a cross-complaint for indemnity against
Roes 1 through 25.
On September
15, 2022, Defendant filed this motion for summary judgment, or in the
alternative for summary adjudication. The hearing for the motion was originally
set for July 18, 2023. Pursuant to written stipulations, the Court continued
the hearing to October 3, 2023; to January 29, 2024; and then to April 2, 2024.

Plaintiffs
filed their opposition on March 19, 2024, and a notice of errata on March 28. Defendant
filed its reply, along with evidentiary objections and additional evidence, on
March 28.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment
is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact
necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each cause of action as framed by the
complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or
more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
The party opposing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Objections to Evidence
Defendant objects
to a number of the passages in the declarations submitted in opposition to the
motion. 
Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell
Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all
of the evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which
objections have been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
The Court overrules
Defendant’s Objections to the Declarations of Loren B. Halpern and Samuel
Attal-Watts.
As to the
Declaration of Daniel N. Greenbaum, the Court sustains Defendant’s Objections
Nos. 1 and 9 (lack of personal knowledge). The Court sustains Objections Nos.
2-5 (lack of personal knowledge, secondary evidence); the Court will base its
rulings on the evidence, including the deposition transcript of Plaintiff Mora,
not counsel’s summary of the transcript. The Court otherwise overrules Defendant’s
Objections.
Discussion
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence
and premises liability. The basic
elements of a cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the
same: (1) the existence of a legal duty;
(2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 37; Brooks v. Eugene Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.) If a dangerous condition exists, the
property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the
condition reasonably safe for their [customers’] use or to give a warning
adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores,
Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.) 
“It is well established in California that although
a store owner is not an insurer of the safety of its patrons, the owner does
owe them a duty to exercise reasonable care in keeping the premises reasonably
safe.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205.) “A store
owner exercises ordinary care by making reasonable inspections of the portions
of the premises open to customers.” (Moore v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 472, 476.) “The care required is commensurate with the
risks involved.” (Ibid.) 
“A
plaintiff alleging injuries based on a dangerous condition must prove the
defendant either: (1) created the dangerous condition, or (2) knew or should
have known of the dangerous condition.” (See Peralta v. Vons Companies, Inc.
(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1030, 1036; see also Ortega,
supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1206; Robison v. Six Flags Theme Parks Inc.
(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1304.) “[A] defendant is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law if the plaintiff fails to show that the dangerous condition
existed for at least a sufficient time to be discovered by ordinary care and
inspection.” (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1207.) “Whether a
dangerous condition has existed long enough for a reasonably prudent person to
have discovered it is a question of fact for the jury.” (Ibid.) “The
owner must inspect the premises or take other proper action to ascertain their
condition, and if, by the exercise of reasonable care, the owner would have
discovered the condition, he is liable for failing to correct it.” (Ibid)
“A store owner exercises ordinary care by making reasonable inspections of the
portions of the premises open to customers...” (See id. at p. 1205.)
“[A]s to business invitees, the owner should conduct frequent inspections.”
(See id. at p. 1207.) 
To establish liability for
negligence, “[t]here must be some evidence . . . to support the conclusion that
the condition had existed long enough for the proprietor, in the exercise of
reasonable care, to have discovered and remedied it.” (Girvetz v. Boys’
Market (1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 827, 829; Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at
p. 1206 [the owner must have had actual or constructive knowledge of the
dangerous condition or have had the ability, through the exercise of ordinary
care, to discover it, and sufficient time to correct it].) “Because the owner is not the insurer of the
visitor’s personal safety …, the owner’s actual or constructive knowledge of
the dangerous condition is [in many cases] a key to establishing its
liability.” (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1206.) 
“[W]here
the plaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous condition to prove
the owner’s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the owner
had notice of the defect in sufficient time to correct it.” (Ibid.) The plaintiff has the burden because
“shifting the burden to defendant would, contrary to existing negligence law,
permit an inference of negligence to be drawn against the owner based solely on
the fact that the fall or accident occurred.” (Ibid.)¿ 
“[A]
defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the plaintiff fails to
show that the dangerous condition existed for at least a sufficient time to be
discovered by ordinary care and inspection.” (Id. at p. 1207.)
Here, Plaintiff Mora that she slipped on “a puddle of liquid
on the floor of the bathroom” at Defendant’s premises, fell, and was injured.
(SAC, at p. 4; see also Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”],
Nos. 5-7.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff
has no evidence that Defendant created the dangerous condition or had actual or
constructive knowledge of it, and therefore as a matter of law Plaintiff cannot
establish any breach of duty by Defendant.
The alleged accident occurred on December 1, 2018,
at Defendant’s store on Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills. (DSUMF, No. 8.) At
her deposition, Plaintiff Mora testified that she and her husband entered the
store, and “after a little while” she went to the bathroom:
“I did not
notice that there was water spilled on the floor. … Well, I slipped. And I
slipped all the way down. And I think I struck my head on the toilet bowl. And
after I sort of, like, reacted – had a reaction to that, I just saw that I was
all wet. My back was all wet. … My whole back is wet”
(Marcos-Shaller Decl., Exh. D [“Plaintiff’s Depo.”],
at 56:2-17; see also DSUMF, Nos. 10-12.) 
There is some dispute between the parties whether
Plaintiff Mora was in the women’s or men’s restroom when she fell. In her
deposition (or at least the excerpts provided to the Court in connection this
motion), Plaintiff Mora was not asked, and did not specifically state, whether
this accident occurred in the women’s or men’s restroom. Plaintiff Mora was
asked, however, whether there were separate stalls in the restroom of whether it
was just one room. She responded “it was one room.” (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 58:9-16.)
The women’s bathroom at the store is a two-stall bathroom. (DSUMF, No. 27.)
Thus, there is at least some evidence in the record that supports Plaintiff’s
contention that the accident occurred in the men’s restroom.
Although it is not particularly unusual for water to
spill on the floor of a restroom, there is no evidence in the record regarding
(1) how the water was spilled in the restroom on this particular occasion or (2)
who spilled it. (DSUMF, Nos. 15, 19.) There is no evidence that Defendant had
actual notice of the spill prior to Plaintiff Mora’s fall. (DSUMF, No. 20.) Nor
is there evidence about how long the water was on the floor prior to Plaintiff’s
fall. (DSUMF, No. 21.)
The evidence regarding Defendant’s
inspection practices is in dispute. Although Defendant contends that it
inspects the restrooms on an hourly basis, the written policy produced in
discovery does not say this, and Defendant’s housekeeping policies refer to
daily cleaning. (DSUMF, No. 25; Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional Material
Facts [“PSAMF”], Nos. 32-35, 50-51; Greenbaum Decl., ¶ 17 & Exh. I.)
Defendant did not produce “sweep sheets” or cleaning logs showing hourly (or
other periodic) inspection or cleaning of the store restrooms on the day of the
incident, or any other evidence of when the restrooms were inspected on that
day. (PSAMF, Nos. 37, 44-45.)
On this record, the issue of breach
of duty is a question of fact. A finder of fact could reasonably draw the
inference that the water had accumulated on the floor of the restroom for a
long enough period of time to charge Defendant with constructive notice of the
dangerous condition. Of course, the finder of fact could also draw the contrary
inference. But it is an issue of fact, not an issue of law, on this record. 
As there are triable issues of
material fact, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion
for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication.
Moving party to give notice.
