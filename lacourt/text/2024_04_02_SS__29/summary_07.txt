Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to the interrogatories and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendants filed motions to compel a response. As the plaintiff did not file an opposition, the Court finds that there is no statutory basis for an award of sanctions. The Court orders the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the defendants' requests within 21 days of notice.
