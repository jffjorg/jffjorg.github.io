And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka on a motion filed by Stuart Lee Zubrick to expunge a notice of attorney's lien. The motion was based on alleged fraudulent and negligent actions by the law firm Epps & Coulson, LLP, which is seeking to enforce the lien. The judge denied the motion, finding that the procedural mechanism for expunging a notice of attorney's lien is not applicable in this case. The judge also noted that the defendant's arguments were misplaced and that the issue should be adjudicated in the underlying action. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
