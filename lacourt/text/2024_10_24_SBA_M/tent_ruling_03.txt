TENTATIVE RULING

Padilla’s Company, Inc.’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Padilla’s Company, Inc.’s Motion to Strike Portions of
First Amended Complaint is deemed moot. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on August 7, 2023 and
the First Amended Complaint was filed on May 28, 2024. Plaintiff alleges the
following facts. Plaintiff is the general contractor for a construction project
(“Project”) located at 1700 S. Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach, California.
Plaintiff entered into sub-contracts with Padilla’s Company, Inc. for rough
grading and shoring, and, later, for concrete masonry. Defendant failed to adequately
perform the contracts and failed to have the proper licensing to perform the
contracts.   Plaintiff alleges the following causes of
action: 1. Disgorgement (B&P 7031(b)); 2. Disgorgement (B&P 7031); 3.
Fraud; 4. Negligence; 5. Unlawful, Fraudulent, and Unfair Business Practices
(B&P 17200 et seq.); 6. Breach of Contract; 7. Breach of Contract.
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant filed a meet and confer
declaration in sufficient compliance with both CCP § 430.41 and CCP §
435.5.  (Decl., David. A. Carnie.) 
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendant demurs to the third cause of
action for fraud for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and uncertainty. CCP § 430.10(e)(f).    
            Third
Cause of Action for Fraud 
            The
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
            “A
complaint for fraud must allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false
representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance;
(3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages.”  Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he elements of an action for fraud and
deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he has known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230,
248.
 
            “Every
element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper manner
and the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged with sufficient
specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the nature of the charge
made.”  Tarmann v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiff must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
“[C]onduct amounting
to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty
independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law. An omission to
perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that omission is also an
omission of a legal duty.” Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551
(internal citations and quotations omitted.)
 
            Plaintiff
has failed to allege specific facts as to the element of justifiable reliance. Plaintiff
relies upon written representations made in the sub-contracts itself with
respect to the licensure status of Defendant. However, as noted above, failure
to comply with terms in the contract, which are specifically set forth with
respect to the licensure status of Defendant, may support a cause of action for
breach of contract but does not support a tort unless an independent duty
arises separate and apart from the contract. That independent duty could be
derived via a properly stated fraud cause of action. However, here, mere conclusions
are set forth with respect to justifiable reliance. 
 
For example, the
alleged representations must have been made, according to Plaintiff’s theory,
in writing, on October 5, 2020 and May 31, 2021 when the Vice President of
Padilla signed the sub-contracts. However, it is unclear and not stated when
the signatory for Plaintiff signed the sub-contracts. If the signatory signed
prior to these dates, it appears unlikely that Plaintiff could have justifiably
relied in any manner upon those representations prior to entering into the
agreements. There are no specific facts to indicate that the signatory for
Plaintiff actually reviewed and read the purported written representation made
by Defendant and, in justifiable reliance upon the representation, then
proceeded to execute the agreement. In addition, the Court notes that Plaintiff
still has not stated specific facts as to where the representations were made.  
 
            Defendant’s
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
 
            Motion to Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  CCP § 436(a). 
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  CCP § 436(b).  The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws.  CCP §
436.  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendant moves to strike the following
paragraph of the Complaint: “Paragraph 48, 10:11-14 – “Defendants acts as
alleged herein were malicious, fraudulent and/or oppressive and were undertaken
in the conscious disregard of the rights of Plaintiff. Defendants’ actions
entitle Plaintiff to an award of punitive damages in an amount appropriate to
punish to make an example of Defendants, according to proof.”  (Notice of Motion, page 2, lines 3-6.)
 
The motion to strike is moot upon the
sustaining of the demurrer to the third cause of action. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
