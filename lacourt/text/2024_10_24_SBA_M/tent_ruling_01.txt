            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on July 23, 2019. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff
is the owner of real property located at 209 Camino De Las Colinas, Redondo
Beach, Los Angeles County, California, which is legally described as follows:
7514002020, 209 Camino De Las Colinas, Torrance, Tract #10300 Lot 32 Blk H. Defendants
are the owners of other real property commonly known as 213 Camino, De Las
Colinas, Redondo Beach, Los Angeles 5 County, California, which property is
adjacent to Plaintiff’s property, and which is legally described as follows:
7514002019, 213 Camino De Las Colinas, Torrance, Tract#10300 Lot 31 Blk H.
Defendants have engaged in improper, non-authorized, and non-permitted
construction on their property which has caused a nuisance to Plaintiff. On
August 25, 2023, the Court entered an amended judgment in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendants.
 
            Motions to Compel
 
            CCP §
2030.290 states: “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the following rules apply…The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
            CCP §
2031.300 states: “If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following
rules shall apply: The party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.”  (CCP §
2031.300(b)).
 
               Pursuant to CCP § 708.020, a
judgment creditor may propound written interrogatories to a judgment
debtor.  Interrogatories are enforced in
the same manner as interrogatories in a civil action. CCP § 708.020(c).  Thus, the provisions of CCP § 2030.290 apply
equally to a judgment creditor’s interrogatories.
 
            Pursuant
to CCP § 708.030, a judgment creditor may propound a demand for production and
inspection of documents to a judgment debtor. 
Demands for production of documents are enforced in the same manner as
inspection demands in a civil action. CCP § 708.030(c).  Thus, the provisions of CCP § 2031.300 apply
equally to a judgment creditor’s demand for production of documents. 
 
            Judgment
creditor/Plaintiff served upon judgment debtors/Defendants first set of
judgment debtor interrogatories and judgment debtor requests for production of
documents on July 10, 2024. (Decls., Michelle R. DeMason, ¶¶ 3-5.)  Plaintiff contends that no responses were
served to the discovery requests. 
(Id.)  
 
            Thus,
the motions to compel responses to first set of judgment debtor interrogatories
and judgment debtor requests for production of documents are granted. 
 
            Judgment
debtors are ordered to serve responses, without objections, within 10 days of
this date.
 
            Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff’s
requests for monetary sanctions are granted. 
 
        Defendants
and Defendants’ counsel are sanctioned the total amount of $2,240.00 which was
calculated as follows: 5 hours to prepare and appear at $400 per hour, plus 4
filing fees at $60.00 each. Thus, Defendant Renee M. Smith and her counsel are
sanctioned the total amount of $1,120 and Defendant Frank James Corbett and his
counsel is sanctioned the total amount of $1,120.00. 
 
            Sanctions
are payable within 30 days of this date.
 
            Plaintiff/judgment
creditor is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
