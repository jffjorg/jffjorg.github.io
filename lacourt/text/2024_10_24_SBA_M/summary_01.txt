Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions to compel responses to the first set of judgment debtor interrogatories and requests for production of documents from Frank James Corbett and Renee M. Smith, as well as requests for sanctions. The defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests despite being served on July 10, 2024. The court finds that the defendants are in contempt of court and orders them to serve responses to the discovery requests without objections within 10 days. Additionally, the court sanctions the defendants and their counsel in the total amount of $2,240.00, which is calculated as follows: 5 hours to prepare and appear at $400 per hour, plus 4 filing fees at $60.00 each. The sanctions are payable within 30 days of the date of this ruling.
