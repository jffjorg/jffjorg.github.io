And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the demurrer to the complaint and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will need to re-file a revised complaint. The motion to strike is deemed moot since the demurrer has been sustained. The court found that the plaintiff's original complaint was unclear and incomplete, failing to state sufficient facts to establish the causes of action. The plaintiff will have 30 days to file and serve a first amended complaint, and the defendants will have 30 days to file and serve a response.
