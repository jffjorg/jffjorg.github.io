BACKGROUND
                
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff Azariah M.
Ellington filed a complaint against Defendants Franchise Tax Board of
California and Daniel Ortiz, asserting causes of action for (1) reckless
disregard; (2) criminal negligence; (3) elder abuse; (4) tortious interference;
(5) abuse of authority; (6) invasion of privacy; (7) fraud; (8) bank fraud; and
(9) mail fraud.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendants demur to the complaint on
the grounds that it is uncertain and fails to state sufficient facts to
establish the causes of action. The Court agrees. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
wrongfully attempted to collect taxes from Plaintiff. But Plaintiff’s
allegations are confusing and appear incomplete. It is unclear in what way
Defendants’ collection efforts allegedly are wrongful or illegal. It is also
unclear what Plaintiff seeks as a remedy.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend. The motion to strike is MOOT.
