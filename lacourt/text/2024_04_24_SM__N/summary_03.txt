And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff Douglas Emmett 1995, LLC ("Plaintiff") against Defendant Henry Young ("Defendant"). The Plaintiff moves for summary judgment based on its claim that it has the right to immediate possession of the premises and a monetary judgment. However, the Plaintiff has failed to provide a separate statement in support of its motion, as required by law. The Court has reclassified this action from a limited jurisdiction unlawful detainer case to an unlimited civil jurisdiction case, and thus a separate statement is required. The Court will continue the hearing to a date to be determined, and the Plaintiff will be required to provide a separate statement in support of its motion on or before the continued hearing date.
