And here is a brief English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants defendant/cross-complainant Said Hakim's motion to challenge privilege clawback under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.285. The ruling finds that the emails between Michael Hakim and attorney Benjamin Brin are not privileged. The court's reasoning is based on the fact that there is no evidence of an attorney-client relationship between Michael Hakim and Benjamin Brin, and that Michael Hakim waited too long to assert his privilege claim. The court also notes that the emails were produced in February 2022 and were referenced in discovery responses, and that Michael Hakim failed to take prompt action to seek to protect the emails.
