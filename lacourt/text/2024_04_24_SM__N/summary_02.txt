The defendants, Gosh Enterprises, Inc., Bibibop Development LLC, and Nichaboon McClellan, discovered new facts after filing their answer that support their cross-complaint. The court finds that allowing the defendants to file the cross-complaint is proper, as there is no apparent prejudice to the plaintiff or the court. The court cites various laws and regulations, including the California Rules of Court and the Code of Civil Procedure, to support its decision.
