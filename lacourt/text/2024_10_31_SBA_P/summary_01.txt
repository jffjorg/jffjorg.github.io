And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Agbasi's motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs' claim for non-economic damages. The motion was procedurally deficient under Code Civ. Proc. section 437c, subd. (t) because Agbasi failed to file a joint stipulation and declarations that the motion would further the interest of judicial economy. The court also found that there was a triable issue of material fact regarding the insurance status of the 2018 Toyota Camry owned by Hernandez, which was involved in the car accident. Agbasi argued that the Camry was uninsured, but the deposition testimony of Hernandez did not establish that the Camry was uninsured at the time of the accident. Additionally, Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Medina, who was driving the Camry, was insured under a separate policy at the time of the accident. Therefore, the court denied Agbasi's motion for summary adjudication.
