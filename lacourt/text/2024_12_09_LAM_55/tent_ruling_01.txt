  Case Number:  23STCV15764    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  55 23STCV15764
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record
 
Counsel for Plaintiff Michael Greco has filed a motion
to be relieved as counsel. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s
motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the
trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in
the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notice, declaration, and proposed order
sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to be relieved as
counsel. See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362. 
However, counsel has not provided a proof of service
for Plaintiff Greco at his last known address. The proof of service filed 11/12/24
only shows service on defense counsel. 
Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
Counsel may re-file (and serve) a motion to be relieved as counsel.
