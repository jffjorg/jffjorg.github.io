And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by counsel for Plaintiff Michael Greco to be relieved as counsel of record. The Judge notes that the determination of whether to grant or deny the motion lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that the form notice, declaration, and proposed order comply with the requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel. However, the Judge denies the motion without prejudice because the proof of service filed only shows service on defense counsel and not on the Plaintiff himself. The Judge allows counsel to re-file and serve the motion.
