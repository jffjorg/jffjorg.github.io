And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action case, where Plaintiff Tom Burgett is seeking to compel the depositions of Arshad Assofi and Adam Ohnstad. The Plaintiff asserts that Assofi is an owner and officer of the Defendant, Shadow Wolf Energy, and Ohnstad is a high-level agent who verified the company's discovery responses. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to properly serve the deposition notice on Assofi and Ohnstad. The Judge finds that the Defendant's objections lack merit, as the deposition notice was served over a year ago and a reasonable lawyer would have negotiated a new deposition date rather than obstructing discovery for so long. The Judge orders that the depositions be completed by February 28, 2025, and grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel. The Judge also declines to award sanctions at this time.
