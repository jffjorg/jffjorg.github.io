 On August 21, 2024, Plaintiff Morrow-Meadows Corporation filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) reasonable value of goods and services, (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (4) enforcement of stop payment notice, (5)-(7) claim on payment bond, and (8) claim on stop payment notice release bond.  The relevant allegations are as follows.  “In 2018, the City of Los Angeles’ Department of Airports, known as Los Angeles World Airports (‘LAWA’), acting through its Board of Airport Commissioners, approved a roughly $2 billion contract granting GATEWAY PARTNERS the exclusive right, during the term of 28 years, to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain a work of improvement known as the Consolidated Rent-A-Car Facility (‘ConRAC’) at Los Angeles International Airport (‘LAX’) (the ‘Project’). Accordingly, in addition to designing and constructing the Project, GATEWAY PARTNERS was granted the exclusive right to operate the ConRAC Facility (among other rights) for a term of 28 years, thereby creating a de facto lease of the property. The Project was procured through a purported Public Private Partnership Design-Build Finance, Operate, Maintain (DBFOM) procurement model. GATEWAY PARTNERS financed the design and construction of the Project through a complex combination of public funding and private funding. As stated in its Financial Plan, the design and construction activities would be funded with private loan funds and private equity, among other sources, including public funds from LAWA. The stated goal of the ConRAC Project was to consolidate more than 20 various rental car locations in and around LAX into one convenient facility, along with rental car employee parking spaces and LAWA employee parking spaces. ”“In turn, GATEWAY PARTNERS entered into a design/build agreement with PCL [(Defendant PCL Construction Services, Inc.)] dated November 6, 2018. PCL was selected as the design-build contractor for the Project. Contractually, PCL was hired to design and build the Project.”“On or about March 31, 2019, [Plaintiff] MMC and PCL entered into a written subcontract (‘Subcontract’) whereby MMC agreed to furnish and install electrical and low voltage systems.” “PCL breached the Subcontract by failing to pay MMC all amounts due and owing for performance on the Project, including for extra work, despite MMC’s continued demands for payment.”“The labor, services, equipment, and materials furnished by MMC were and are reasonably worth the sum of $202,451,662.52. The amount due, owing, and unpaid is the sum of $60,588,010.64.  [¶] Prior to the expiration of the period within which a stop payment notice must be served, MMC served on GATEWAY PARTNERS its Stop Payment Notice in the amount of $60,588,010.64.”Defendant LA Gateway Partners, LLC (“LAGP”) now demurs to the SAC’s fourth cause of action for failure to state sufficient facts.  LAGP argues that “MMC continues to seek to enforce two stop payment notices on the Los Angeles World Airports [ ] Consolidated Rent-A-Car [ ] Project [ ]—one against a public entity, the City of Los Angeles [ ], pursuant to California Civil Code section 9350, et. seq. (the ‘First Stop Payment Notice’), and the second against a private developer, LAGP, pursuant to Civil Code section 8500, et. seq. (the ‘Second Stop Payment Notice’), in the exact same dollar amount—$60,588,010.64—for the exact same work. Because the Project is a work of public improvement, and MMC’s work was furnished pursuant to a public works contract within the meaning of Civil Code section 8038 and Public Contract Code section 1101, MMC’s remedies are governed exclusively by Civil Code section 9350, et. seq. Accordingly, as this Court has previously ruled, the Second Stop Payment Notice to LAGP is invalid . . . .” When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)“Part 6 of division 4 of the Civil Code (§§ 8000-9566) lays out a comprehensive statutory scheme to resolve payment disputes in construction projects. Different remedies are available in public versus private construction projects. (Compare § 8160 et seq. with § 9000 et seq.) Sovereign immunity principles prevent mechanics liens from being asserted on public works projects. (N.V. Heathorn, Inc. v. County of San Mateo (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1526, 1535, 25 Cal.Rptr.3d 400; Liton Gen. Engineering Contractor, Inc. v. United Pacific Insurance (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 577, 584, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 200 (Liton).) Accordingly, the principal statutory remedies for claimants who have furnished labor, services, equipment, or material on a public works project are stop payment notices and payment bonds. (§ 9100, subd. (a)(1).  [¶] Nevertheless, the statutes dealing with both private and public works ‘deal with the same specific subject, and are to be construed together.’ (Globe Indemnity Co. v. Hanify (1933) 217 Cal. 721, 730, 20 P.2d 689, accord Capitol Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Mega Construction Co. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1061, 68 Cal.Rptr.2d 672 (Capitol Steel).)A stop payment notice notifies a project owner [ ] to withhold funds due to the direct contractor sufficient to satisfy the amount of the stop notice claim, plus reasonable litigation costs. (§ 9358; see generally, §§ 9350-9510.) A payment bond ‘guarantees payment to claimants on a construction project to the extent they are not otherwise paid.’ (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (11th ed. 2017) Security Transactions in Real Property, § 27, p. 820; see generally §§ 9550-9566.) . . . Every direct contractor awarded a public works contract in excess of $25,000 must, before beginning the work, provide a payment bond to the public entity. (§ 9550, subd. (a).) ‘In addition to protection of the public entity from liability for a defaulting contractor, the purpose of the surety bond is to provide a distinct remedy to public works subcontractors and suppliers of labor or materials to public works projects.’ (Liton, supra, 16 Cal.App.4th at p. 584, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 200.) If the direct contractor fails to satisfy its payment obligation to the subcontractor or supplier, the surety must do so. (§ 9554, subd. (b)(1).)”  (Crosno Constr., Inc. v. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am. (2020) 47 Cal. App. 5th 940, 950–51.)Based on the additional facts alleged, for the purposes of the pleadings stage, there does appear to be a valid theory asserted for the fourth cause of action. As Plaintiff puts it, “the overall development is on public land pursuant to a contract with LAWA, a public entity. These facts give rise to Plaintiff’s SPN rights regarding funds held by LAWA. However, the development also includes LAGP’s long-term lease, operation, and maintenance rights, which give rise to Plaintiff’s SPN rights regarding funds held by LAGP.”  As Plaintiff also points out, “[t]o enforce payment, a party contracting with a private lessee to perform work of improvement on publicly owned property may utilize the bonded stop notice procedure under sections 3159 and 3162, as can its subcontractors.”  (N. Bay Constr., Inc. v. City of Petaluma (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 552, 563.)  By using its requests for judicial notice (“RJN”), Defendant attempts to defeat the existence of a lease; however, most of the documents—like emails, stop notices, and contracts—  are not subject to judicial notice, and the Court already has the pleadings on its docket.  Thus, the RJN is denied.  Extrinsic facts cannot be considered for any purpose.Further, ultimately, a double recovery will not be allowed.For all these reasons, the Demurrer is overruled.  Moving party to give notice.
