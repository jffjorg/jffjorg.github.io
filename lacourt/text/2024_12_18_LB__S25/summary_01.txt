And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the complaint and the demurrer filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Company, and has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the 5th cause of action (Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The court has also granted the defendant's Motion to Strike and has ordered that item “e” in the Prayer for Relief, line 24, p. 16, be stricken. The court has concluded that the complaint fails to adequately allege a duty to disclose and therefore does not state a cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The court has also determined that punitive damages are not available under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and has granted the defendant's Motion to Strike the demand for punitive damages. The court has left open the possibility of amendment to the complaint to correct the defects identified.
