As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in the case of Benjamin Dadbin v. Palazzo West et al. The case arises from allegations that the defendants failed to take adequate remedial actions to address a bedbug infestation in an apartment rented by the plaintiff.

The judge sustains the demurrer as to the first cause of action, which alleges a battery claim, finding that the plaintiff's claim is based on the defendants' alleged failure to remediate the infestation, which is not sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge also sustains the demurrer as to the third cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the allegations do not demonstrate outrageous conduct.

The judge overrules the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action, which alleges unfair competition law, finding that the complaint contains sufficient facts to plead a cause of action. The judge also denies the motion to strike as to punitive damages, finding that the allegations in the complaint demonstrate a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights and safety.

The judge grants the motion to strike as to attorney's fees, finding that the plaintiff has not pled a statutory or contractual basis for attorney's fees. The judge sustains the demurrer as to the eighth and ninth causes of action, which allege violations of Civil Code sections 1942.3 and 1942.4, and the thirteenth cause of action, which alleges public nuisance.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument at the hearing on October 30, 2024.
