I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On March 16, 2023, Plaintiffs, Christina Maier,
Tierney Mauge, and Traci Maier (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against Defendant, Kate Dunitz, and DOES 1 through 10. On August 29, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action
for: (1) Conversion; (2) Defamation (Slander); and (3) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress. 
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff, Christina Maier
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set Three and Requests for Admission on
Defendant. Responses by Defendant were due on or before January 5, 2024.
However, on January 14, 2024, Plaintiff notes that Defense Counsel emailed
objections with no responses to each of the discovery requests. Plaintiffs note
that on February 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter,
but that despite this, there has been no response or any attempt to resolve the
matter. 
 
In Defendant’s opposition briefs, the Declaration of
Thomas Carter (“Carter Decl.”), defense counsel, it notes that since the filing
of the motions, Defendant Donitz has served verified, amended responses to each
set of discovery that is subject to each of the motions. (Carter Decl., ¶ 2.)
Carter further notes that he has provided Plaintiffs with verifications for
each previously served response as well as the amended responses on the very
day those verifications became available. (Carter Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.)
 
The Motions to Compel Initial Responses were heard on
August 16, 2024, where this Court deemed them mooted by the service of verified
responses to discovery requests prior to the hearing. However, this Court
acknowledged that the service of those verified responses did not moot the
sanctions requests. As such, Plaintiffs move now on a Motion for those
sanctions. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
These motions were originally heard on
August 16, 2024, where this Court deemed the motions to compel initial
responses mooted but continued the requests for sanctions. 
 
On December 13, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition to the Motion for Sanctions.
 
On December 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
reply brief.  
 
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
            As
the Court explained in the August 16, 2024 minute order, it will not be
awarding the excessive amount sought by Plaintiffs for monetary sanctions.
Instead, it will be awarding $1,000 total for the motions to compel further responses,
not the improper motions to compel initial responses which were filed after the
moving party had already received initial responses.
