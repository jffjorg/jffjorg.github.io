And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maurice Stephenson v. Leo Ramsey, et al. (Case Number: 22TRCV01128). The Judge has granted Plaintiff's Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set Two as Admitted, as Defendants failed to respond to the requests for admission. The Judge has also denied Plaintiff's Request for Monetary Sanctions, as the granting of the motion is devastating to Defendants' potential defenses. The Judge notes that the Requests for Admission deemed admitted are nearly tantamount to a motion admitting Defendants' breach of contract. The Judge orders Plaintiff to provide notice of the tentative ruling.
