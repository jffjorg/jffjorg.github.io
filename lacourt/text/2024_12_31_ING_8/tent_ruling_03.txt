BACKGROUND   A. Factual   On May 21, 2024, Plaintiffs, Jocelyn  Espinoza dba Skewer Mediterranean Grill and Julia Alegria (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”) filed, in pro per, a complaint against Defendant, South Bay  Center SPE, LCC. The complaint alleged causes of action for: (1) Breach of  Contract; (2) Violation of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;  (3) Fraudulent Misrepresentation; (4) Negligence; (5) Tortious Interference  with Business Relations; (6) Retaliation; (7) Constructive Eviction; and (8)  Deceptive Trade Practices.    On October 11, 2024,  Plaintiffs served written discovery requests upon Defendant, South Bay Center  SPE, LLC (“South Bay Center”). Plaintiff, Julia Alegria, propounded 288 written  discovery requests, which included 96 Requests for Admission. Plaintiff, Jocelyn  Espinoza propounded 193 written discovery requests, including 56 requests for  admission. Responses were due November 16, 2024.    Beginning on November 7,  2024, Defense Counsel reached out to Plaintiff Alegria to request a brief  extension of time to respond. At that time, Defense Counsel indicates that he  had no contact information for Plaintiff Espinoza, so he requested that Plaintiff  Alegria set up a phone call between the three of them. On November 12, 2024,  the Parties were able to meet, and Defense Counsel requested an extension of  three weeks, making the deadline for responses December 6, 2024. Defense  Counsel states the Parties agreed to the extension. The following day, on  November 13, 2024, Defense Counsel wrote an email addressed to Plaintiffs to  confirm the extension in writing. However, later that night, at 8:19 p.m.,  Plaintiff Alegria responded and revoked the extension, leaving Defense Counsel  with two days to respond.    On November 15, 2024,  Defendant served responses to both Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission.  Plaintiffs contend that Defendant has failed to provide any valid responses  that comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.210,  et seq., and instead, only consist of objections.    As such, Plaintiffs have each  brought a Motion to Deem Requests for Admission as Admitted.    B. Procedural                  On November 22, 2024, Plaintiffs  filed their respective Motions to Deem the Truth of the Matters Specified in  that Requests for Admission Admitted. On December 17 2024, Defendant filed an  opposition brief. On December 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply brief.   II.  ANALYSIS    A. Legal Standard    Pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 2033.280, “[i]f a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response,” the court shall make the order  deeming the truth of the matters admitted unless the responding party serves  before the hearing a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in  substantial compliance with Code Civil Procedure § 2033.220. Code of Civil  Procedure § 2033.220 requires that each answer either admits, denies or  specifies that the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge. The  moving party is not required to meet and confer before bringing such a motion.  (Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates, 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395.)   Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court  may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the  discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery  process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of  discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)                 B.  Discussion     Plaintiffs  incorrectly move on a Motion to Deem Requests for Admission as Admitted  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280. However, as noted above,  this motion is made when a party to whom requests for admission are directed,  fails to serve any timely response. Here, Plaintiffs’ moving papers concede  that Defendant served responses. The exhibits attached to the moving papers  show that the responses were served November 15, 2024, one day before their due  date. As such, Plaintiffs may not move on a Motion to Deem Requests for  Admission as Admitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.   Instead,  the Court notes that because Defendant provided responses via objections,  Plaintiffs may instead move under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, for  an order compelling a further response if they assert that an answer to a  particular RFA is evasive of incomplete, or an objection to a particular  request is without merit or too general. However, Plaintiffs have not moved for  such a ruling, and thus, their Motions to have Requests for Admissions Deemed  Admitted is DENIED.                C. Sanctions                Code of Civil  Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose  a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process  to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone  because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing to respond  or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc.  §2023.010(d)).                As noted above, the Court is denying the Plaintiffs’  Motions as they were incorrectly brought. Thus, the sanctions are DENIED as  well.
