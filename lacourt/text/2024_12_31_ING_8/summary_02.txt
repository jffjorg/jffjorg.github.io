And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions in the total amount of $1,000. The sanctions are payable by the defendant to the plaintiffs' counsel on or before January 15, 2025. The motion was filed after the defendant failed to respond to discovery requests despite multiple attempts by the plaintiffs to resolve the issue. The defendant had initially failed to respond to the discovery requests, but later served verified responses after the motions to compel had been filed. The court had previously deemed the motions to compel moot, but continued the requests for sanctions. The judge has awarded $1,000 in total for the motions to compel further responses, rather than the initial responses which were already served.
