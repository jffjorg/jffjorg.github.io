And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion brought by the plaintiffs, Jocelyn Espinoza and Julia Alegria, against the defendant, South Bay Center SPE, LLC. The plaintiffs are seeking an order deeming certain requests for admission as admitted, and are also requesting monetary sanctions against the defendant.

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motions, finding that they were incorrectly brought. The plaintiffs' motions were based on the defendant's failure to provide valid responses to the requests for admission, but the judge notes that the defendant did provide responses, albeit in the form of objections.

The judge also notes that the plaintiffs could have moved under a different code section, Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, to compel further responses from the defendant if they believed the defendant's responses were evasive or incomplete. However, the plaintiffs did not make this motion.

As a result, the judge has denied the plaintiffs' motions and also denied their request for monetary sanctions. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further submissions from the parties.
