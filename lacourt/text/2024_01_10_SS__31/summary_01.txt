Summary:

The City of Beverly Hills has moved for summary judgment, arguing that it had no constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the road and that it did not cause the injuries sustained by Albert Cohen in a bicycle accident. However, the court has denied the motion, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding the period of time the spalling existed and whether a reasonably adequate inspection system would have discovered the condition. The court also found that the City's evidence was insufficient to meet its burden of showing that it did not have constructive notice of the condition.
