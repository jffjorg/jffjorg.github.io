Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Olive's motion to continue the trial as moot, as the trial date has already been continued to June 2, 2025. The Judge has also denied Olive's motion to dismiss under California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, which bars joint tortfeasors who received notice of the motion from seeking equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity from the settling tortfeasor. The Judge found that Olive, as a subsidiary of RHF, was not a joint tortfeasor at the time of the settlement and therefore did not receive notice of the good faith settlement determination. The Judge also found that the Court's order determining the settlement to be in good faith did not mention or refer to RHF's subsidiaries, including Olive. As a result, the Judge denied Olive's motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing Olive to raise this defense at or before trial through a separate motion.
