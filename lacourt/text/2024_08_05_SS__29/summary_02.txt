And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial due to newly discovered information regarding the plaintiff's neurological treatment. The defendant claims that the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories did not list a neurologist as treating the plaintiff, but during the plaintiff's deposition, the plaintiff testified to certain symptoms and treatment by a neurologist. The defendant did not receive treatment records from the neurologist until July 3, 2024. The defense counsel argues that an examination by the neurologist is necessary, and the earliest examination can take place is August 2024, with a report received in September 2024. The court finds that the defendant has established good cause to continue the trial and grants the motion. The trial date is continued to January 21, 2025, and the final status conference is continued to January 7, 2025. All discovery deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
