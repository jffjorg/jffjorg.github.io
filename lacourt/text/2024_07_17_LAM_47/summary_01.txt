And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs and their counsel for filing a motion for specific performance. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs' motion was a frivolous tactic intended to cause unnecessary delay, and therefore, the defendant is entitled to sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. However, the court finds that the defendant did not comply with the safe harbor requirements of section 128.5, which provides a 21-day period for a party to withdraw a motion or pleadings before filing a motion for sanctions. The court concludes that the defendant's motion for sanctions is denied and that the plaintiffs and their counsel are not subject to sanctions for their motion for specific performance.
