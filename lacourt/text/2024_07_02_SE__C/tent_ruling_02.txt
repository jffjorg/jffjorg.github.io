Background 
This is a lemon law action, where Plaintiff Savannah Haynie
(“Plaintiff”) has filed suit against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
(“Defendant”) alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act. 
On February 15, 2023, Plaintiffs propounded their Form
Interrogatories and Request for Production on Defendant. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 2;
Exh. A.) Written responses to these requests were initially due on or before
March 20, 2023. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 3.) 4. On February 21, 2023, Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings was granted. (Lupinek Decl.,
¶ 4) However, on June 14, 2023, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration was
granted, and the previous stay was lifted. (Id.)
On October 3, 2023 Plaintiffs’ office emailed Defendant to
inform Defendant they had not produced their discovery responses for this case
and requested Defendant provide substantive verified responses within 30 days
of their letter. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. B) Having not received a response to
their letter, on October 9, 2023 Plaintiffs’ office emailed Defendant to
inquire if they would be providing substantive discovery responses. (Lupinek
Decl., ¶ 6; Exh. C.) Defendant responded and agreed to provide substantive
responses by October 20, 2023. (Id.) 
However, Plaintiff contends no additional discovery has
been provided as of the filing of the motion. 
As of June 28, 2024, the two motions are unopposed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A.  
 Motions to Compel Responses. 
 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030. A party may propound
35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter
of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion 
A.  
‘Motions to Compel
Responses.
 
Defendant had 30 days to respond but did not do so.  
Upon
review of the separate motions submitted, the documents for the two motions are
identical in substance.  Each contains
the same factual allegations and legal support. 
 
Because
Defendant has failed to respond to the discovery requests, Defendant is
compelled to respond to the request for production of documents and form
interrogatories, without objection, including
objections based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300 subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  For the interrogatories, the failure to
respond also waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Initial Discovery is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
Legal Standard
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a
motion to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
Discussion 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $1,097.50 (30
minutes preparing the motion, as well as, two hours reviewing the opposition
and drafting a reply and appearing at the hearing at a rate of $415 per hour)
for each motion brought before the Court. 
However, given the lack of an opposition the Court finds
the reasonable amount of sanctions connected with each motion is $415 (a half
hour preparing the motion and another half hour to appear at the hearing), plus
reimbursement of the $60.00 filing fees, for a total of $950.00 in sanctions.
