Tentative Ruling 
 
This action concerns an alleged assault on the campus of
Mayfair High School, a high school in Bellflower Unified School District. 
On July 25, 2023, Plaintiff Jessica Jamilla Walker, through
her Guardian Ad Litem Shanda D. Bryaboy, filed an action against Defendants
Bellflower Unified School District (“Defendant District”),and Tori Christine
Sanchez, through her Guardian Ad Litem Natalie D. Monzon alleging: (1) general
negligence and (2) intentional tort.
On May 16, 2024, Defendant District served its Form
Interrogatories - General, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions,
Sets No. Two, and Request for Production of Documents, Set No. Three, on
Plaintiff Jessica Walker, a minor by her Guardian ad Litem Shanda D. Brayboy. 
To date, Plaintiff has not yet responded to the discovery
requests. 
However, the Court notes that on June 26, 2024, Counsel
Eric O. Ibisi was granted his motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
Therefore, the Court finds it would be unjust to rule on
this motion without first allowing Plaintiff to find new counsel. 
Accordingly, the three separate Motions to Compel Discovery
in this instant action are CONTINUED to Tuesday August 27, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in
Department SE-C.
