The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jessica Jamilla Walker, a minor, against the Bellflower Unified School District and Tori Christine Sanchez. The case concerns an alleged assault on the campus of Mayfair High School. The defendant has served discovery requests on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff has not responded. The plaintiff's former counsel, Eric O. Ibisi, has been relieved of his duties. The judge has decided to continue the motions to compel discovery until August 27, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to find new counsel. The judge believes it would be unjust to rule on the motions without giving the plaintiff the opportunity to find new representation.
