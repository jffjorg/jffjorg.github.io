Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Daisy Ferrer’s Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal is GRANTED. 
Defendant Pro X is awarded $1,519.15 in
reimbursement fees. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
On or around October 27, 2021, Plaintiff and Dealer entered
into a Retail Installment Sale Contract (“RISC”) for the purchase of a 2015
Audi, vin # WA1LGBFE6FD010678, (“Subject Vehicle”). The purchase came with a
warranty. Plaintiff alleges she began having problems with the Subject Vehicle.
 
On July 25, 2022, Plaintiff Daisy Ferrer (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint for damages against the dealership, bank and bond in this
matter. (Roberts Decl., ¶ 2.) On March 6, 2024, the Court set an Order to Show
Cause for Plaintiff’s Attorney’s failure to appear at a previous hearing. (Id.
at ¶ 3). On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel contends he appeared around
2:15pm for the March 6 hearing through LACourt Connect. (Id. at ¶ 4.) However,
the matter had already been called and the case had been dismissed without
prejudice. (Id. at ¶ 4.) 
 
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis added.)
(CCP §473(b).)
Discussion 
As preliminary matter, the motion is timely. the deadline
for moving to set aside default under Code of Civil Procedure §473 is six
months. Since the default was entered on March 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s notice of
motion must have been filed by September 6, 2024. Plaintiff’s motion is
accordingly timely as it was filed on March 12, 2024.
Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted a declaration stating it
was an inadvertent mistake that caused him to not attend the OSC re: Dismissal.
Namely counsel avers that he was in a jury trial all week that ended
approximately 3:30pm on March 6, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Counsel explains that the
stress of the jury trial, he simply forgot about the appearance and forgot to
attend the OSC. (Id. at ¶ 6.) The Court has discretion to grant the motion to
set aside default.
Given the timeliness of the motion and the declaration
stating that the mistake was inadvertent due to scheduling conflicts the Court
GRANTS the Motion to Set Aside Dismissal. 
Reimbursement of Fees  
“[W]enever relief is granted based on an attorney’s
affidavit of fault [the court shall] direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (CCP §
473(b).)
Pro X Motors’ Counsel contends Defendant incurred 1.0 hour
of attorney time on March 6, 2024 at the hearing where Plaintiff failed to
appear, and, incurred an additional 3 hours of attorney time in researching and
preparing this opposition. (Obeid Dec. ¶ 4.) Counsel for Pro X Motors charges
$375 per hour on this matter. (Obeid Dec. ¶ 4.) Pro X Motors also incurred
e-filing costs of $19.15 from OneLegal to e-file this Opposition. (Obeid Dec. ¶
4.) Thus, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to reimbursement of $1,500
in attorneys’ fees, and, $19.15 in costs for a total of $1,519.15. 
Plaintiff is ordered to complete reimbursement within 30
days after notice of this order is delivered.
