And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendant SG & AW. The court granted the motion, with 10 days leave to amend, due to the plaintiff's failure to state a cause of action against SG & AW. The court noted that SG & AW is only a party to the fourth cause of action for fraud, which survived a prior demurrer, and that SG & AW has raised a defense that it did not exist as an entity when the alleged fraud occurred. The court found that the plaintiff's theory of ratification of the actions of its principal, Wittekind, has not been pled and therefore the court is obliged to give the plaintiff a chance to plead it.
