STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for indemnification under Labor Code section 2802.
Plaintiff seeks to be indemnified for his legal fees in the related action Avraham
Bibi v. Roey Burg, et al. LASC Case No. 21STCV11739.
 
Plaintiff moves for a preliminary
injunction requiring Defendant to indemnify him for his legal fees in the
related lawsuit. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves for a preliminary
injunction requiring Defendant to indemnify him for his legal fees in the
related lawsuit. 
 
A party may request a preliminary injunction “by serving a
noticed motion,” as Plaintiff has in this case, only when the party
against whom the preliminary injunction is sought has appeared in the action.
(Cal. Rule of Court 3.1150(a).)  Here, however, the
Defendant in this action, ADB Group, Inc., has not yet made a general
appearance. Therefore, pursuant to Rule 3.1150, a preliminary injunction
against ADB Group must be sought by obtaining and serving an Order to Show
Cause re: Preliminary Injunction. (Id.) That order must be served in the
same manner as a summons and complaint. (Id.) Plaintiff has not done so,
and has therefore failed to give proper notice of the injunction he seeks. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.
This ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally proper request for a
preliminary injunction pursuant to the Rules of Court. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
