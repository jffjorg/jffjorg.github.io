roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiff
  - Defendant

significant_statements:
  - The court cannot conclude that, as a matter of law, no reasonable trier of fact could conclude plaintiff's protected activity contributed to the decision not to renew her contract.
  - The court cannot conclude that any reasonable trier of fact must find clear and convincing evidence that defendants would not have renewed plaintiff's contract even if she had not engaged in protected activity.
  - The same-actor inference has lost some of its persuasive appeal in recent years.
  - Citing a legitimate reason for the challenged action will entitle the employer to summary judgment only when the employee's showing, while sufficient to invoke the presumption, is too weak to sustain a reasoned inference in the employee's favor.
