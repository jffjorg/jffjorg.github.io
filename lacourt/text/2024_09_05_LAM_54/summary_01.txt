Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against the Defendants, Nectar, Inc. and Darren Saravis. The motion was filed by the Defendants, who claimed that they were surprised and did not receive notice of the default. The Judge found that the Defendants' counsel, Jan Sundberg, was negligent and failed to address the situation promptly when he learned the matter was in default. Despite this, the Judge granted the motion under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 473(b), which allows the Court to relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, or other proceeding taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
