BACKGROUND
 
 On October 2, 2023, Incentax, LLC
sued Nectar Inc., and its Chief Executive Officer Darren Savarris[1]
alleging six causes of action based on a breach of contract. Default judgment
was entered against Defendants on May 29, 2024. Defendants now move to set
aside the default and default judgment.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides: "The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect....” 
            
Judges must vacate dismissals, default entries, and default judgments
“whenever (1) an application is made no more than six months after entry of
judgment, (2) the application is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit
attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and (3)
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect in fact caused the
dismissal or entry of default.” (Benedict v. Danner Press  (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 927 (citing CCP
§473(b)). Also see Wagner v. Wagner (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 249, 258.)
                        
Where counsel seek relief alternatively under both the excusable and
attorney-fault provisions of Code of Civil Procedure Section 473 and confirms
that any act or omission leading to the entry of the default was done without
the client's knowing participation, relief is mandatory. (Solv-All v. Sup.
Ct. (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1012. Under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 473, "surprise" means “‘“some condition or situation in which
a party . . . is unexpectedly placed to his injury, without any default or
negligence of his own, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded
against.”’”  State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal. App. 4th 600, 611.)
 
            In December of 2023, Defendant
retained Avyno La, P.C., with attorney Jan Sundberg as lead counsel. At the
time, Sundberg was in settlement discussions with Plaintiff’s attorney, Amir
Benakote. Benakote filed a Request for Entry of Default on December 29, 2023,
after the parties had agreed that Sundberg was not required to file an answer. 
 
            On April 11, 2024, it was found that
Sundberg mis-calendared the matter. On April 19, 2024, Sundberg spoke with
Plaintiff’s new attorney, Lisa Spiwak. Spiwak informed Sundberg that default
had been entered in the case, but agreed to a stipulation to set aside if
Sundberg prepared a draft. Spiwak followed up with Sundberg on three separate
occasions, receiving no response. Spiwak then moved forward with default.
Sundberg claims that although Spiwak notified her that default had been entered
on April 19, 2024, Sundberg nor her client received notice.
 
            Sundberg’s handling of this matter
has hardly been exemplary. He took on the matter in December 2023 but did not
enter an appearance. While there may have been ambiguity as to whether the
parties agreed to defer an answer while they discussed settlement, Sundberg did
not address the situation promptly when he learned the matter was in default. Defense
counsel explains that personal emergencies impacted his ability to handle the
matter. In any event, Sundberg’s client should not be penalized for counsel’s
neglect. The Court grants the motion under Code Civ. Proc. §473(b).
