The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Maurice D. Pessah, counsel for the defendants Christopher Phelps, Salt's Cure, LLC, Shahryar Ravanshenas, and Highland Equities, LLC. The motion is granted for Shahryar Ravanshenas and Highland Equities, LLC, and counsel is required to file proof of service of the order on the clients within 5 days of the ruling. Counsel will be relieved upon filing of proof of service of the order. The motion is denied without prejudice for Christopher Phelps and Salt's Cure, LLC, as there is no proof of service indicating that these defendants were served with notice of the rescheduled hearings. The court will set an OSC re: legal representation of Defendant Highway Equities, LLC.
