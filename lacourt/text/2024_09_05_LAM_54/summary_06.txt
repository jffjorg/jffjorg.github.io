And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain paragraphs and lines in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Carlitos Dosouto against the defendants. The defendants, Carlton Property Investments LLC and R. Scott Tucker & Associates, are seeking to strike the prayer for punitive damages and certain paragraphs in the complaint. The judge has granted the motion as to the prayer for punitive damages, but denied the motion as to the other paragraphs and lines. The judge's ruling is based on the court's authority to strike irrelevant, false, or improper matter from a pleading, as well as its discretion to strike pleadings that are not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. The judge also considered the defendants' argument that certain paragraphs are conclusory, but found that they do not show that the paragraphs are improper. The judge's tentative ruling will be reconsidered at a hearing on September 5, 2024, at which time the parties may submit comments or objections.
