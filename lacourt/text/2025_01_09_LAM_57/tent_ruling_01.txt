  Case Number:  24STCV22624    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  57  The Court is granting the unopposed motion of Defendant Yaamava Resort & Casino ("Yaamava") to quash Plaintiff Perla Salvador's service on Defendant of the summons and complaint in this action and to dismiss the action.  The Court agrees with Yaamava that Plaintiff's complaint is barred under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity.  That is because Yaamava is owned and operated by a federally-recognized sovereign Indian tribe,  the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians ("the Tribe"), through an unincorporated subordinate agency that the Tribe governs. The Tribe is immune from suit under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity.  That immunity extends to Yaamava.  Plaintiff filed no brief in opposition arguing otherwise.
