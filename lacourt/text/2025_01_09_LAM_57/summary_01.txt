And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion of Yaamava Resort & Casino to quash service and dismiss the action brought by Perla Salvador. The Court finds that Yaamava is owned and operated by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, a federally-recognized sovereign Indian tribe, and therefore is immune from suit under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity. The Court agrees with Yaamava that the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity applies to the tribe and extends to Yaamava, making the complaint barred. The plaintiff did not file a brief in opposition to this argument.
