Here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions to be relieved as counsel filed by Counsel John W. Bussman on behalf of defendants Adrian Leyva, Erica Leyva, and Ori Textiles, Inc. The motions are unopposed and seek to withdraw as counsel due to a conflict that has arisen. The Court finds that the motions set forth an adequate basis for withdrawal and grants the motions. The Court notes that trial is currently set for May 4, 2026, and there is no showing that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. Therefore, the Court grants the motions and orders Counsel John W. Bussman to give notice of this ruling.
