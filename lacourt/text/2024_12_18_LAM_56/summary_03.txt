And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's earlier ruling denying the motion to disqualify the judge. The plaintiff argued that the court should reconsider the ruling because of new evidence, specifically a 5-Day Notice from Judicate West that Judge Crandall accepted a mediation involving Wood Smith. However, the court found that this evidence is not new or different from what was previously considered in ruling on the motion to disqualify. The court noted that it had already considered the arguments that Judge Crandall presided over other matters with Wood Smith, and therefore the new notice does not qualify as a new circumstance that the court did not previously consider.
