MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Dana Urick
(“Plaintiff”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Defendants
Bohm, Wildish, & Matsen, LLP (“Defendants”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an attorney-client
relationship.  On June 8, 2022, Plaintiff Dana Urick (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint alleging (1) negligence (legal malpractice); (2) breach of fiduciary
duty; and (3) breach of contract.  
 
On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a revised
motion to disqualify the Honorable James L. Crandall (Ret.). The Court heard
the motion and issued a ruling on October 28, 2024.  The Court denied the motion on the ground that
Plaintiff had not shown evidence of bias (see 10/28/24 Order re: Motion to
Disqualify/Recuse Judicial Reference) 
 
On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Denying the Motion to
Disqualify (the “Motion”). On December 5, 2024, Defendants filed an Opposition.
             
 
DISCUSSION
            A motion for reconsideration is used
to ask the court to modify, amend, or revoke its earlier order on a prior
motion to the court because of new or different facts, circumstances, or law. (Code
of Civil Procedure “CCP” § 1008, subd. (a).) Such an order may involve an
interim or final order (CCP § 1008, subds. (e), (h)), where an interim order is
an intermediate ruling of some kind that requires further proceedings before
the suit can be resolved, and where a final order is an order that finally
disposes of the suit (see People v. DeLouize (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1223,
1231 [differentiating between interim and final orders]).  
            
A motion for reconsideration may be
brought by a party or by the court on its own motion. (CCP § 1008, subds. (a),
(c).) The grounds for the motion vary depending on whether a party or the Court
is making the motion. (CCP § 1008, subds. (a), (c), (e).)  
 
            A party may move for reconsideration
based on: (1) new or different facts, (CCP § 1008, subd. (a); see e.g., In
re Marriage of LaMoure (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1473 [reconsideration
motion granted on new evidence]); (2) new or different circumstances, (CCP §
1008, subd. (a)); and (3) new or different law, (CCP § 1008, subd. (a); Baldwin
v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196.) However, a party
cannot move reconsideration based on the court’s erroneous order, i.e., the
court’s misinterpretation of facts or law. (See Jones v. P.S. Dev. Co.
(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 724, disapproved on other grounds by Reid v.
Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 531-532, 532 n. 4.) 
 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction
when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different
facts, circumstances or law.”  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499.)  Motions for reconsideration are restricted to
circumstances where a party offers the Court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Ibid.) 
 
Moreover, there is a strict requirement of
diligence, which means the moving party must present a satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence or different facts
earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) The burden under Section
1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of
newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party
could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at
trial.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)   
            
            Plaintiff argues that the October
28, 2024 Order should be reconsidered because there is new evidence. On October
30, 2024, Plaintiff received a 5-Day Notice from Judicate West which states
that Judge Crandall accepted a mediation involving Defendants counsel’s law
firm, Wood, Smith, Henning & Berman, LLP (“Wood Smith”). (Mot. p. 2:3-6.)
Plaintiff argues that this reinforces her previous assertions of bias and thus
the Court should reconsider the ruling denying the motion to disqualify.
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff has failed to present new facts or evidence because Judge Crandall’s involvement
with other Wood Smith matters was also the basis of Plaintiff’s motion to
disqualify. Defendants also note that the mediation Plaintiff was notified
about in the 5-Day Notice from Judicate West does not involve any of the same
lawyers that are representing Defendants in this matter. (Opp. p. 5:17-19.) 
 
            The purported new evidence which
Plaintiff presents as the basis for her Motion does not qualify as new or
different facts or circumstances within the meaning of CCP section 1008. In ruling
on Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify, the Court considered the arguments that Judge
Crandall presided over other matters with Wood Smith. Thus, the October 30
notice that Judge Crandall accepted a mediation involving Wood Smith is not a
new circumstance that the Court did not previously consider in ruling on the
motion. Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
