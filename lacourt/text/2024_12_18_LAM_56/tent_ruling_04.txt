BACKGROUND
            This action arises from breach of
contract and open account claims, in which Plaintiff Romex Textiles, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that, pursuant to agreements between Plaintiff and Defendants Adrian
Leyva, Erica Leyva, Juan Alberto Balbuena, Ori Textiles, Inc., Fernando Carmona
and Omar Perez (collectively “Defendants”), Defendants owe Plaintiff a principal
balance of $236,980.89. Plaintiff filed the operative complaint (the
“Complaint”) on October 12, 2023 alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of
contracts; (2) open account; (3) account stated; (4) goods sold and delivered
(quantum valebant); (5) conversion; (6) claim and delivery; (7) breach of
contracts; (8) open account; (9) account stated; (10) goods sold and delivered
(quantum valebant); (11) conversion; (12) claim and delivery; (13) breach of
contracts; (14) open account; (15) account stated; (16) goods sold and
delivered (quantum valebant); (17) conversion; (18) claim and delivery; (19)
breach of contracts; (20) open account; (21) account stated; (22) goods sold
and delivered (quantum valebant); (23) conversion; (24) claim and delivery; (25)
open account; (26) account stated; and (27) unjust enrichment-constructive
trust.
 
            On November 14, 2024, Counsel John
W. Bussman (“Bussman”) filed three motions to be relieved as counsel for defendants
Adrian Levya, Erica Leyva and Ori Textiles, Inc. (collectively, the “Motions”)
The Motions are unopposed.    
 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be changed at any time before or
after judgment or final determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both
client and attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of
either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”¿ (CCP § 284; California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) 3.1362.)¿ The withdrawal request may be denied if it
would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's
discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably.¿ (Mandell v.
Superior (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003)
112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)¿ 
¿ 
In making a motion to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362.¿ The motion must be made using mandatory forms:¿ 
¿ 

Notice of
     Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client
     (MC-051);¿ 


Declaration
     “stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of
     the attorney-client relationship” the reasons that the motion was brought
     (MC-052);¿and 


Proposed
     Order (MC-053).¿ 

¿ 
The forms must be timely filed and served
on all parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (CRC rule 3.1362.)¿ If these
documents are served on the client by mail, there must be a declaration stating
either that the address where client was served is “the current residence or
business address of the client” or “the last known residence or business
address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current
address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the
filing of the motion to be relieved.”¿ (CRC rule 3.1362 subd. (d)(1).)¿ 
 
The court has discretion on whether to
allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is generally permitted unless
there is a compelling reason to continue the representation.  (Heple v.
Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)   
 
            Bussman filed a Notice of Motion and
Motion (MC-051), Declaration in Support of Motion (MC-052) and Proposed Order (MC-053)
for all three clients. As reason for the Motions, Bussman states: “A conflict
has arisen that precludes further representation and requires counsel to
withdraw. Counsel requests an in-camera hearing if the court needs more
information.” (All MC-052, ¶ 2.) The forms were served on the respective clients
and Plaintiff via mail on November 14, 2024. (All MC-051, Proof of Service) Bussman
was unable to confirm that the addresses are current after mailing the motion
papers to the clients last known address, calling the clients’ last known
telephone number, and attempting to contact them through their last known email
address. (All MC-052, ¶ 3(b)(2).) Finally, there is no showing that withdrawal
would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings as trial is currently
set for May 4, 2026. Thus, the Court finds that the Motions set forth an
adequate basis for withdrawal.  
 
            John W. Bussman’s Motions to be
Relieved as Counsel for Adrian Levya, Erica Leyva and Ori Textiles, Inc. are
GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
