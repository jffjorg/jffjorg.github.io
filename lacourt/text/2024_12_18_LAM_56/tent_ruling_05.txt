BACKGROUND
             Petitioner has filed a petition for approval
of transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights (the “Petition”) belonging
to Real Party-in-Interest/Transferor Domingo Munoz (“Transferor”).
Specifically, Petitioner seeks the transfer of $1,457,611.20 in future annuity
payments belonging to Transferor which span payments to be paid between June 3,
2045 and May 3, 2068, the present discounted value of which is $318,547.23, to be
transferred in exchange for a $61,500.00 lump sum payment to Transferor. 
            
The original Petition was filed on October
11, 2024. The first amended petition (the “Amended Petition”) was filed on
November 21, 2024. Proof of service indicates that the Amended Petition was
served via mail on Transferor, the annuity issuer and the annuity owner on
November 21, 2024. 
 
On December 5, 2024, Petitioner filed a
notice of hearing for December 18, 2024. Proof of service indicates that the notice
of hearing was served via mail on December 4, 2024 on Transferor, the annuity
issuer and the annuity owner.
 
DISCUSSION
            A transfer of structured settlement payment rights is void unless a court
reviews and approves the transfer and finds that (a) the transfer of the
structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and in the best
interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of his or
her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies with the requirements of
Insurance Code (“Ins. Code”) sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not contravene
other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved the transfer
as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
Section 10136
Requirements
            No direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies
shall be effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer
shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee,
unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of the Insurance Code are
satisfied. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)
 
            The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10136 as follows (Ins. Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e)): 
            
            First, the transfer agreement
satisfies the disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section
10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer agreement is accompanied by a
disclosure addressed to Transferor and the disclosure contains all the statutorily
required language of section 10136, subdivision (b).) (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b); Amended Petition, Ex. A, Purchase and
Sale Agreement.)
 
Second, the
transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); Amended Petition, Ex. A, Purchase and Sale
Agreement) 
 
Third, the
transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of the contents
prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer agreement.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); Amended Petition, Ex. A, Purchase and Sale
Agreement.)
 
Fourth, Transferor
has not sought cancellation of the transfer agreement as of the date of this
hearing. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e); Amended Petition, Ex. F, Munoz Decl.,
¶ 18.)
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds that Petitioner’s proposed transfer of Transferor’s settlement
rights satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136, subdivisions
(a) through (e).
 


 
Section 10139.5
Requirements
A direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured
settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment
directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement payment rights
unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a final court order based
on express written findings by the court subject to Section 10139.5. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)
 
            Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)
The petition
satisfies the entirety of the findings requirement set out in Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the Court
expressly makes by the following language, are that: 
 
(1) The transfer
is fair and reasonable in the best interests of the payee, taking into account
the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents. Transferor is collecting $61,500.00
for future payment of $1,457,611.20, the discounted present value of which is $318,547.23.
Transferor is unmarried, employed as an event/ticket reseller earning
approximately $3,500.00 per month, has no minor children and if approved would
use the funds to pay for expenses incurred for his upcoming wedding, set up an
emergency fund for his family, and cover expenses needed to purchase a new home.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds.
(b)(1)-(15)]; see also Amended Petition, Ex. A, Purchase and Sale Agreement; Ex.
F, Munoz Decl., ¶¶ 3-6, 12.)
 
(2) The payee has been advised in writing
to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived,
in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); Amended Petition,
Ex. C, Statement of Professional Representation [Transferor was advised to
obtain independent professional legal, tax and financial advice about the transaction
and chose not to].) 
 
            (3) Petitioner has complied with the
notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), has
provided payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136 and the
transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); Ins.
Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e) discussion supra & Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f) discussion infra at “Second, …” & Amended
Petition Ex. A, Purchase and Sale Agreement, Ex. B, Disclosure Notice.)
 
            (4) The transfer does not contravene
any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            (5)
The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms
set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(5); Munoz Decl., ¶ 16 [Transferor has received and reviewed
copies of the Transfer Agreement, disclosures, and advisory statement].)
 
(6) The payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the right to cancel the transfer
agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); Munoz Decl., ¶ 18 [“I
understand that I have a right to cancel my agreement with CBC Settlement
Funding, LLC and I do not wish to exercise this right.”])
 


 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)
            Except
as noted below, the Amended Petition satisfies all the payee information
required from Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows ((Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)):
 
(1) Included the
payee’s name, age and address. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(1); Payee Decl.,
p. 1:4 [Domingo Munoz] & ¶ 2 [address].) The Insurance Code requires Transferor’s
age as well. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(1).) The Court would accept
sworn testimony as to Transferor’s age at the time of the hearing.
 
(2) Included the
payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of payee’s
spouse. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(2); Munoz Decl., ¶ 8 [“I am single.”].)
 
(3) Included the
names, ages, and place or places of residence of payee’s minor children or
other dependents, if any. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(3); Munoz Decl., ¶ 4
[“I have no minor children.”].)
 
(4) Included the
amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial resources. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); Munoz Decl., ¶ 6 [“I am currently employed as an
Event/Ticket reseller, earning approximately $3,500 per month”].) 
 
(5) Included
information permitting the determination of whether payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)(5); Munoz Decl., ¶ 8 [“I am not obligated by any court order
to pay child support”].)
The Court notes that there is
nothing in the declaration specifying that Transferor has no obligation for
spousal support. The Court would accept sworn testimony to that effect at the
time of the hearing. 
 
(6) Included
information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described
in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring
information only for petitions in last five years]; Munoz
Decl., ¶ 9 [three prior petitions, two approved, with case numbers and transfer
information provided].)

 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
            The
amended petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)
as follows (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)):
 
First, the
transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision
(f)(1), because Petitioner made the instant Petition and the Petition was
brought in the county in which the Payee resides. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(1); Amended Petition, p. 1 [showing
Petitioner CBC Settlement Funding brings this Petition]; Munoz Decl., ¶ 2 [showing a Los Angeles County
address.].) 
 
            Second,
except as noted below, the Petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(2).
 
            Formal notice of this transfer and a
copy of the Amended Petition itself was filed by Petitioner with the Court and
served on all interested parties no later than November 28, 2024—i.e., original
Petition, notice, Amended Petition, declaration in support of Petitioner’s
Petition, notice of case assignment, and proof of service were served on
Transferor, the annuity issuer, and the annuity obligor. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2) [notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its
authorization to be filed with the court and served on all interested parties within
20 days of hearing]; see also 11/05/24 Proof of Service].)
 
Further, except as noted below, the notice
and Petition have attached all the necessary documents required from this
subdivision. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and
petition: 
 
(A) Include a
copy of the instant petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside
of five years from the date of this petition. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(A) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is
framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information
about petitions in last five years]; Munoz Decl., ¶ 9 [three prior petitions,
two approved, with case numbers and transfer information provided].)
 
(B) Include a
copy of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(B);
Amended Petition, Ex. A, Purchase and Sale Agreement &, Ex. B, Disclosure Notice.)
 
(C) Include
information regarding Transferor’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); Munoz Decl. ¶¶ 3-4 [single; no minor children].)
 
(D) Include a
copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); Amended Petition, Ex. B, Disclosure Notice.)
 
(E) Include
copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and
underlying structured settlement agreement, if available, and if not available,
a showing of reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document
have been made, including making inquiry with Payee. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); Amended Petition, Ex. G [Affidavit of Due Diligence].) 
 
(F) Include
copies of the proofs of service made for notice of this petition. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); 11/05/24 Proof of Service, Amended Petition, p. 44
[11/21/2024 Proof of Service].)
 
(G) Include a
notification that any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or
otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel,
by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in the hearing.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(J); see 12/05/2024 Notice of Hearing; 11/19/24
Proof of Service.)
 
(H) Include a
notification of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the
manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition must be
filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s
notice, in order to be considered by the court. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(K); see 12/05/2024 Notice of Hearing)
 
(I) If the payee
entered into the structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the
date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide notice to the
payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement was created,
if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the attorney’s
address on file with the State Bar of California. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(L).) 
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g)
The Amended Petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees
bear the costs of transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g); Amended Petition,
Ex. A, Purchase and Sale Agreement [“The following expenses will be
deducted from the gross purchase price: [¶] Compliance and administrative fees:
$0.00 [¶] Filing and related expenses: $0.00” & Ex. B, Disclosure Notice [To figure the net amount we are
paying, we have charged you for the following expenses: Compliance and
Administrative fee: $0.00. Related Expenses fee: $0.00. For a total of $0.00 in
expenses.].) 
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h)
The Amended Petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (h) because, when it was filed,
Petitioner advised Transferor of his right to seek independent counsel and
financial advice in connection with this transfer petition and advised Transferor
of his right to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h); Amended Petition,
Ex. B, Disclosure Notice [Transferor was advised to seek independent advice]; Ex. C, Statement of
Professional Representation [Transferor does not wish to seek independent
professional representation]; Munoz Decl., ¶ 15 [“I hereby waive that advice
and do not wish to retain such an independent advisor”].)
 


 
Requirements
Conclusion
            The
Court (1) requests information regarding Transferor’s age; (2) seeks
confirmation that there are no spousal support obligations; and (3) seeks to
confirm that Transferor is aware of the economic consequences of this proposed
sale. The Court will take sworn testimony from Transferor on these issues at
the hearing, and based on that testimony will determine whether or not to grant
this Amended Petition. Transferor is ordered to be present, either in person or
virtually, at the hearing so that the Court may examine him as to the merits of
the First Amended Petition.
