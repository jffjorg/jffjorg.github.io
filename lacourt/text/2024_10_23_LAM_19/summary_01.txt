And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCP02366, a hearing on a motion for attorney fees. The hearing has been continued to November 22, 2024, and the Judge has made several orders to ensure the case is properly prepared. First, the Judge requires courtesy copies of all briefing filed by the parties. Second, the Judge finds that the submissions made by the Petitioner are insufficient to determine the reasonableness of the hourly compensation requested for each attorney. The Judge gives the Petitioner an opportunity to provide supplemental evidence and justification in support of the hourly rates requested. Additionally, the Judge orders the moving party to file a proposed judgment and to leave a blank for the amount of prejudgment interest. All supplemental evidence and documentation must be filed by November 14, 2024, and courtesy copies delivered to Department 19 by November 15, 2024. Counsel for Petitioner is also ordered to give notice to the Respondent's agent, general counsel, and Leonard Shulman, Esq.
