Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to find that the actions pending in Departments 50 and 58 are related. The plaintiff had alleged that the two cases were related, but the judge found that they did not meet the criteria for relation set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The judge noted that the cases did not involve the same parties, claims, or transactions, and that there would not be a substantial duplication of judicial resources if they were heard by different judges. The judge also noted that the defendant's actions in violating the Uniform Voidable Transaction Act were not related to the issues in the first case, BC663174.
