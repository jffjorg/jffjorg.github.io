Background of 21STCV37889 Lathern
v. Airport Center Dental Family
 
On
October 14, 2021, Plaintiff Valerie Lathern filed this action for medical
malpractice against Airport Center Dental Family and Joseph Sabet, D.D.S.
arising out of a root canal procedure. 
 
On
March 14, 2024, Sabet Dental Corporation filed a Notice of Related Case
involving 21STCV37889 and 24TRCV00388 Sabet Dental v. Lathern. The court
stamped the document with “Denied- The Inglewood filing is not Personal Injury
and cannot be heard in the Hub.”
 
On
May 13, 2024, Sabet Dental filed a new Notice of Related Case. On May 31, 2024,
Judge Ian C. Fusselman declined to relate the two cases, finding they “are not
related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).” 
 
On
June 12, 2024, the parties submitted a stipulation to relate the two cases and
transfer them to the Inglewood Courthouse. On July 17, 2024, Judge Fusselman
issued an order on denying the stipulation finding “Case Numbers 21STCV37889
and 24TRCV00388 are not related.”
 
This
case is currently pending in Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse with trial
set for October 28, 2024.
 
Background of 24TRCV00388 Sabet Dental v. Lathern
 
On February 2, 2024, Sabet Dental Corporation dba
Airport Center Family Dental sued Valerie Lathern in 24TRCV00388 asserting
causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) promissory fraud; (3) quantum
meruit; and (4) declaratory relief. The complaint alleges Lathern received
dental treatment from 2008 through April 2021 and “consistently made assurances
and promises to Sabet that she would settle her outstanding bills for the
dental services provided.” However, Lathern allegedly failed to pay for the
dental services rendered. 
 
This
case is currently pending in Department 8 of the Inglewood Courthouse with the
case management conference set for August 30, 2024. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants
request the Court take judicial notice of various court documents filed in the
two actions. The requests are GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) 
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The
Court Finds the Cases Are Related 
 
As noted above, Judge Fusselman issued
an order declining to relate 21STCV37889 and 24TRCV00388 on May 31, 2024.
Accordingly, the motion is properly brought in Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(h)(1)(D), LASC Local Rule 3.3(f)(3).)  

 
Defendants
contend the cases involve the same parties, arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, and events, “the factual nexus
between the cases is evident,” and the cases will require a substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Mot. at
9:2-19.) 
 
Cases are related when they (1)
involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise
from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events
requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of
law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to
the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).) 
 
The cases do not involve the same
parties as Joseph Sabet is not a party to 24TRCV00388. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(1).) However, the cases arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(2)), and are likely to require substantial duplication of judicial
resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) 
 
In 21STCV37889, Lathern alleges
Defendants committed malpractice during the course of a root canal performed at
Airport Center Family Dental and in 24TRCV00388 Defendants seek to recover for
unpaid services, including root canals. The reasonable value of the services
rendered by Defendants may be influenced by whether their services met the
standard of care, and the parties’ claims may serve as an offset. Additionally,
on June 7, 2024, Valerie Lathern filed an answer in 24TRCV00388, which asserted
a general denial and a single affirmative defense that “incorporates by
reference her complaint and the allegations set forth against Airport Center
Family Dental and Joseph Sabet.” Accordingly, the complaint in 21STCV37889 has
been expressly incorporated into 24TRCV00388. 
 
The Court finds 21STCV37889 and 24TRCV00388
are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300.
 
Motion to Transfer Between Districts
 
Standard

 
The
Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases
between its districts and departments. (Code Civ. Proc. § 402.) LASC Local Rule
2.3(b)(2) authorizes Department 1 to transfer civil cases from one judicial
district to another via a noticed motion on three enumerated grounds: (1) when
the case was filed in an improper district; (2) for the convenience of
witnesses; or (3) to promote the ends of justice.
(LASC Local Rule 2.3(b)(2).) 
 
Because
the same language appears in both LASC Local Rule
2.3(b)(2) and Code of Civil Procedure section 397(c), Department 1 applies the
case authority related to Section 397. Accordingly, a party acting under the
authority of Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 2.3(b)(2) bears the same
burden of proof if it seeks a district transfer. (See Lieberman v. Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 396, 401.) That
burden of proof calls for affidavits that contain more than generalities and
conclusions. (See Hamilton v Superior Court (1974) 37 Cal.
App.3d 418, 424.) Such affidavits or declarations, like those for change of
venue under Code Civ. Proc. section 397(c), should show the name of each
witness, the expected testimony of each witness, and facts showing why the
attendance of said witnesses at trial would be inconvenient or why the ends of
justice would be served by a transfer. (See
Stute v. Burinda (1981) 123 Cal. App.
3d Supp. 11, 17.) Convenience to non-party witnesses alone is the key to the
success of the motion, and not the convenience of parties or employees of
parties. (Ibid.) 
 
The
Cases Shall be Assigned to Department T in the Alhambra
Courthouse
 

Defendants’ motion also requests the
cases be assigned to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Central District. (Mot.
at 8:3-17; 10:6-11:15.) When two unlimited civil cases are related, they are
assigned to the department with the earliest filed case, which is Department T
of the Alhambra Courthouse. (See Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1).)
 
Defendants cite Code of Civil
Procedure sections 397(a), 396(b)(a), and 395.5 to argue the Alhambra
Courthouse is an improper venue. (Mot. at 10:10-11:6.) However, these sections
of the Code of Civil Procedure govern transfers between superior courts, not
different districts within one superior court. The Los Angeles Superior Court
is only one court. (See generally Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
1441, 1449 (“Even though a superior court is divided into branches or
departments, pursuant to California Constitution, article VI, section 4, there
is only one superior court in a county and jurisdiction is therefore vested in
that court, not in any particular judge or department. Whether sitting
separately or together, the judges hold but one and the same court.”).) Local
Rule 2.3 governs the assignment and transfer of cases between districts of the
Los Angeles Superior Court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 402; LASC Local Rule 2.3.)
 
While Defendants cite Local Rule 2.3(b),
(Mot. at 8:3-17), the motion does not demonstrate either case was initially
filed in an improper district or that a transfer is warranted either for the
convenience of witnesses or to promote the ends of justice. Defendants did not
meet their burden and the request to transfer the actions to the Central
District is DENIED.
 
The now related cases shall be
assigned to Department T in the Alhambra Courthouse.
