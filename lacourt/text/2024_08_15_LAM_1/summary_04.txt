And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to transfer and consolidate the two actions (Case No. 24STCV02587 and Santa Barbara Superior Court Case No. 24CV01682) for trial purposes. The two cases involve the same parties and underlying facts, and the judge finds that they share common questions of law and fact that are significant to the litigation. The judge also finds that the transfer and consolidation of the actions will promote the ends of justice by avoiding duplicative and inconsistent rulings, and will reduce the uncertainty and variation in the litigation, which would tend to aid settlement discussions. The judge orders the transfer of the Santa Barbara Superior Court case to the Los Angeles Superior Court for consolidation with the other case. The judge also consolidates the actions for trial purposes, but notes that this consolidation is without prejudice to the parties or assigned judicial officer determining that consolidation for all purposes is preferable or, at a later stage in the litigation, that consolidation for trial is no longer appropriate.
