And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Joseph Sabet and Airport Center Family Dental, have filed a motion to deem the cases related and request transfer to a proper venue. The court grants the motion in part. The cases, 21STCV37889 and 24TRCV00388, are related and will be assigned to Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse. The request to transfer the cases to the Central District is denied.

The court finds that the cases involve the same parties, arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events, and require the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact. The cases are likely to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.

The defendants' motion to transfer the cases to the Central District is denied because they did not meet their burden of proof. The court applies the Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rules and the Code of Civil Procedure to govern the assignment and transfer of cases between districts.

The parties have agreed to relate the cases and transfer them to the Alhambra Courthouse. The court orders that all hearings currently set in civil law case 24TRCV00388 be advanced and vacated. The defendants' request to reassign the related cases to the Central District is denied.
