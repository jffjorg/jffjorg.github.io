The motion is granted as to Requests Nos. 10, 21, 22, 24, 26, 34, 35, and 37, and denied as to Request No. 38. GM is ordered to provide further, Code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. Sanctions are awarded to Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,110.00 and are payable within 30 days of the date of the hearing. The ruling also addresses GM's objections to Plaintiffs' requests for production and finds that GM failed to meet its obligations under the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
