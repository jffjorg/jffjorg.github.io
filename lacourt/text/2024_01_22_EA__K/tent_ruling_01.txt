Responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production, Set One is DENIED in part
(i.e., as to Request No. 38) and GRANTED in part (i.e., as to Request Nos. 10, 21,
22, 24, 26, 34, 35 and 37). GM is to provide further, Code-compliant
responses within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. Sanctions are

Background   
Plaintiffs Ricky Trujillo and Gina Trujillo (“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
On April 16, 2022, Plaintiffs purchased
a new 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, VIN No. 3GCUDFEDXNG532475 (“subject vehicle”).
The subject vehicle suffers from various defects which have not been repaired
within a reasonable number of attempts.
On April 17, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against General Motors, LLC
(“GM”), Martin Automotive, Inc. dba Chevrolet of Glendora (“Glendora
Chevrolet”) and Does 1-40 for:
1.                 
Breach of Express Warranty
2.                 
Breach of Implied Warranty
3.                 
Failure to Repair
4.                 
Negligent Repair
On May 22, 2023, Glendora
Chevrolet’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is
set for January 22, 2024.
Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or] (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the
court for an order compelling GM to serve further responses to Plaintiffs’
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (i.e., Nos. 10, 21, 22, 24, 26,
34, 35, 37 and 38)[1] and to produce responsive
documents. Plaintiffs also seek sanctions against GM and/or its counsel of
record in the amount of $4,785.00.
Plaintiffs’ counsel
Lamont Freeman Jr. (“Freeman Jr.”) represents, and/or the accompanying exhibits
reflect, as follows:
On
May 12, 2023, Plaintiffs propounded the subject discovery on GM. (Freeman Jr.
Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) On June 16, 2023, GM served unverified responses. (Id.,
¶ 6, Exh. B). On July 15, 2023, GM served verifications. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh.
C). On July 31, 2023, GM produced some responsive documents. (Id., ¶ 7,
Exh. D). 
 
On August 23, 2023, Freeman Jr. sent GM’s
counsel a meet and confer letter, requesting therein that GM’s counsel provide
a written response thereto by September 6, 2023. (Id., ¶ 8, Exh. E.) Freeman
Jr. also requested, in an accompanying email, that the motion filing deadline
be extended to September 13, 2023. (Id.) GM’s counsel agreed to the
motion filing deadline extension but failed to respond to the August 23, 2023
meet and confer letter. (Id., ¶ 8). Freeman Jr. requested, on September
12, 2023 and again on September 13, 2023, a two-week extension as to the motion
filing deadline (with an extension to Plaintiff to September 15, 2023 to
respond to the August 23, 2023 meet and confer letter) but did not receive
approval as to same from Plaintiffs’ counsel until 2:56 p.m. on September 13,
2023. (Id., ¶¶ 9 and 10, Exh. F). Freeman Jr. advised Plaintiffs’
counsel in a 4:38 p.m. response that day that he had already spent “all day”
preparing the instant motion and would be filing it, but expressed a
willingness to meet and confer thereafter. (Id.)
At the outset, the court notes that Freeman Jr.’s August 23,
2023 meet and confer letter does not specifically reference Requests No. 38;
accordingly, the motion is summarily denied in this regard for insufficient
meet and confer. The court otherwise determines that GM’s aforesaid
correspondence constitutes a sufficient meet and confer effort under the Code.
Next, Plaintiffs’ counsel Alana Mellgren (“Mellgren”) represents, and/or the accompanying exhibits
reflect, that on September 19, 2023, GM’s counsel Jonathan Shugart (“Shugart”)
sent a letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel, advising therein, in relevant part, that
GM would supplement its document production “to include other customer
complaints within GM’s ESI database that are substantially similar to
Plaintiff’s complaint(s) concerning the alleged defects for vehicles purchased
in California of the same year, make and model as the Subject Vehicle” subject
to the entry of an attached proposed protective order (“SPO”). (Mellgren Decl.,
¶ 2, Exh. H). Plaintiffs’ counsel signed the proposed SPO and returned same to
GM’s counsel on September 25, 2023 (Id., ¶ 3, Exhs. I and J), but has
yet to receive any supplemental production. The motion, then, is summarily
granted as to Nos. 34, 35 and 37 on this basis.
The court addresses
the remaining requests (i.e., Nos. 10, 21, 22, 24 and 26) as follows:
Request No. 10 seeks all documents related to any alleged
misuse, abuse and/or lack of maintenance of the subject vehicle.
GM, in response, asserts that it has already produced
responsive documents. (Opp., 4:23-5:5). Plaintiffs’ reply brief appears to be
silent in this regard. Page 5 of GM’s September 19, 2023 letter identifies
certain Bates stamped documents as responsive to this request. GM, however,
should provide a further response incorporating this information. The motion,
then, is granted as to No. 10.
Request No. 21 seeks all documents related to GM’s rules,
policies or procedures since 2018 concerning its compliance with the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Request No. 22 seeks all documents related to procedures
used by GM since 2018 for responding to complaints by consumers regarding
vehicles manufactured or distributed by GM.
Request No. 24 seeks all documents that relate to policies,
procedures and/or instructions since 2018 that GM’s employees should follow in
responding to customer complaints regarding failure to repair vehicles under
GM’s warranty.
Request No. 26 seeks all documents describing any training
provided by GM to its authorized repair facilities in California regarding the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Defendant’s policies are relevant to a determination of
Defendant’s good faith. (See e.g. Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc.
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1105 (finding car manufacturer’s internal policy
relevant to whether it evidenced an “unreasonable and not a good faith effort
to honor its statutory obligations to repurchase defective cars.”).)  The documents are reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence regarding whether Defendant
knew of the defects at issue yet failed to repurchase the subject vehicle.  A defendant’s knowledge of the defect is
relevant to whether Defendant willfully violated the statute.  (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136; Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc.
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186 [“A decision made without the use of reasonably
available information germane to that decision is not a reasonable, good faith
decision.”].) 
GM refused to produce any documents in response to Requests
Nos. 21, 22, 24 and 26 on the basis that the requests were overbroad,
burdensome, oppressive, irrelevant, sought confidential, proprietary and trade
secret information and sought information protected by the attorney-client
privilege and/or work-product doctrine.
GM also refused to produce documents in response to many of
the aforesaid requests on the basis that certain terms contained therein (i.e.,
“relat[e]/ing to,” “concerning,” and “complaints,” “describe, refer, or relate
to,” “failure to repair vehicles” and “training”) were vague and ambiguous. The
court disagrees.
The court agrees that the requests are overbroad as to time. Plaintiffs
purchased the subject vehicle on April 16, 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 10). The
requests, then, are limited in time from April 16, 2021 to April 17, 2023
(i.e., the date Plaintiffs filed their complaint). The court also agrees that Requests
Nos. 22 and 24 are overbroad as to scope, inasmuch as they are not limited to
the defects and vehicle type at issue for California consumers. The
Song-Beverly Act and its lemon law provisions limits its application to goods
sold in California and has certain provisions that afford protections greater
than the requirements of the federal Magnuson Moss Act. (See Civil
Code §§ 1792, 1792.1; Atkinson v. Elk
Corp of Texas (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 212, 231.) As the statute’s
application to lemon law is for vehicles “sold in this state” such phrase is
interpreted to restricting the scope to goods sold in California. (California State Electronic Ass’n v. Zeos
Int’l Ltd. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1277.)  The court
determines that such a limitation is warranted.
GM claims that the requests are overly burdensome and not
proportional to the needs of this matter. However, “[t]he objection based upon
burden must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum of work required,
while to
support an objection of oppression there must be some showing either of an
intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the
burden is incommensurate with the result sought.” (West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In and For Los
Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) GM has not provided any such
evidence. At any rate, the court determines that GM’s concerns of overbreadth
and undue burden have been sufficiently addressed via the limitations imposed
above.
GM claims that documents Plaintiffs are seeking are confidential,
proprietary, and commercially sensitive trade secrets. Objections based on
confidentiality are not proper grounds for withholding responsive information.
(See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 23 [“We know of no case holding
that this is a proper ground for objection to an otherwise proper
interrogatory. Assuming that the information called for by this interrogatory
is of a confidential nature which defendants do not want to have included in a
public record, they presumably could have applied for a protective order. .
.”].) Further, GM did not seek a protective order. The court believes that any
confidentiality concerns may be adequately safeguarded by the stipulated
protective order Plaintiffs represent has been signed in this case. (Reply,
6:2-3).
Finally, although GM interposed an objection on the basis of the
attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine, GM has not met its
burden of justifying this objection. Any documents withheld from production on
this basis must be accompanied by a privilege log.
Further responses to Nos. 21, 22, 24 and 26 are warranted,
subject to the limitations identified above.
The motion, then, is granted in part (i.e., as to Requests
Nos. 10, 21, 22, 24, 26, 34, 35 and
37), subject to the limitations set forth herein, and denied in part (i.e., as
to Request No. 38). GM is to
provide further, Code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of the
notice of ruling.
Sanctions
Plaintiffs seek sanctions against GM
and/or its counsel in the amount of $4,785.00 [calculated as follows: 7 hours
preparing motion, plus 2 hours preparing reply, plus 1.5 hours attending
hearing at $450.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee].
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the
totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the total and reasonable
amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in
connection with the pending motion is $1,110.00 (i.e., 3 hours at $350.00/hour,
plus $60.00 filing fee). Sanctions are imposed against GM and its counsel on a
joint and several basis and are payable within 30 days of the date of the
hearing.
