Background
This action arises out of Defendant’s diagnosis, treatment, and
care of Demetrios Fotinatos (“Fotinatos”) (“Decedent”).  (See FAC ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to take
reasonable care in performing Decedent’s admission to the hospital, for which
he should have never been admitted, and subsequently treating him with Xanax,
on or about July 24, 2021, when he was over the age limit for being given Xanax
and Defendant was told that he had an adverse reaction to Xanax and he was not supposed
to take it.  (FAC ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges that prior to Decedent’s
admission, he would walk three miles a day, and he became a zombie after being
in Defendant’s care and never recovered to be how he was before being
admitted.  (FAC ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges as a result of Defendant’s
negligence, Decedent suffered injuries to his person and was transferred to
rehab where he was misfed while lying down, which ultimately resulted in his
death on October 24, 2021.  (FAC
¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges as a result of
Defendant’s negligence, he was subjected to continuous and unimaginable pain
and suffering and being unnecessarily subjected to take prescribed strong medication
because of the failure to diagnose him properly.  (FAC ¶11.) 
Plaintiff alleges Decedent’s health deteriorated after that and ultimately
resulted in his death.  (FAC ¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges Decedent sustained various
losses, including but not limited to pain, suffering, emotional distress.  (FAC ¶11.) 

 
Procedural History
Plaintiff filed her initial Complaint in pro per on October
25, 2022, alleging three causes of action against Defendant for (1) wrongful
death, (2) professional negligence, and (3) general negligence.
On October 26, 2023, this Court dismissed the Complaint without
prejudice pursuant to C.C.P. §583.150.
On October 27, 2023, attorney Kingsley Opia-Enwemuche (“Opia-Enwemuche”)
substituted in as counsel of record for Plaintiff. Thereafter, Opia-Enwemuche
filed a motion to set aside and vacate the dismissal pursuant to C.C.P. §473.
On March 6, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to set
aside/vacate the dismissal as to Plaintiff. 
(3/6/24 Minute Order.)
On May 17, 2024, this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint with 10 days leave to amend.  (5/17/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff filed the operative FAC on May 28, 2024, alleging three
causes of action against Defendant: (1) wrongful death and survival action
sounding in professional negligence; (2) professional negligence; and (3) loss
of consortium.
Defendant filed its demurrer on June 10, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her late opposition on July
24, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on
July 24, 2024.
Plaintiff filed her motion for trial preference on April 15,

opposition has been filed.
 
A.  
Defendant’s Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ causes of action for wrongful
death and survivor action and professional negligence on the basis the causes
of action fail to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and are
uncertain.  (Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§§430.10(e), (f).)  Defendant demurs to
Plaintiff’s cause of action for loss of consortium on the basis it is
uncertain.  (Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§430.10(f).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendant’s counsel declares that on May 19, 2024, he attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel by email.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶13.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that Plaintiff’s
counsel never responded to his meet and confer letter.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶14.)  Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is not sufficient
under C.C.P. §430.41(a) because it does not state that he met and conferred
with Plaintiff’s counsel confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference.  However, the failure to sufficiently meet and
confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (CCP § 430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.)  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
          
          Failure to State
a Claim
          Wrongful Death
and Survival Action (1st COA)
          A cause of action
for wrongful death requires the following elements: (1) a wrongful act or
neglect on the part of one or more persons; (2) causing the death of
another.  (Norgart v. Upjohn Co.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 404, citing CCP §377.60.)  
The statute of limitations for a survival action, “[i]n an
action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such
person’s alleged professional negligence, the time for the commencement of
action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the
plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have
discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first.”
(C.C.P. §§377.20(a), 340.5.) 
The statute of limitations for Plaintiff’s wrongful death cause of
action of expired one year after decedent’s death on October 24, 2021.  Thus, any survival claim on behalf of Decedent
had to be filed by or before October 24, 2022.  Plaintiff’s initial Complaint did not allege a
survival claim on behalf of Decedent.  Plaintiff’s initial Complaint alleged a
wrongful death claim on behalf of Plaintiff. 
A cause of action for wrongful death is distinct from a survival action
under C.C.P. §377.34.  (Quiroz v.
Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264 [“The damages
recoverable in [wrongful death] are expressly limited to those not
recoverable in a survival action under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34.”].)
Therefore, a survival action does not relate back to a timely filed wrongful
death action.  (Id. at pgs. 1278-1279.)  Here, the FAC’s cause of action for survival
is time-barred as a matter of law because it cannot relate back to the initial
cause of action only for wrongful death. Plaintiff’s initial Complaint alleges
Decedent was transferred to rehab, where he was “miss-fed while lying down,
which ultimately resulted in his death on October 24, 2021.”  (Complaint ¶GN-1.)  The initial Complaint does not allege that
Defendant caused Decedent’s death, but rather conduct at the rehab facility
caused Decedent’s death.
          Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action for wrongful death and
survival action is sustained without leave to amend as to the survival
action only.
 
Professional Negligence (2nd COA)
“The elements of a cause of action for medical malpractice are:
(1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the
profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of the duty; (3) a
proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury; and
(4) resulting loss or damage.”  (Lattimore
v. Dickey (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 959, 968.)
“On causation, the plaintiff must establish ‘it is more probable
than not the negligent act was a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff’s injury.’ ‘A
possible cause only becomes ‘probable’ when, in the absence of other reasonable
causal explanations, it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a
result of its action.’ ‘[C]ausation in actions arising from medical negligence
must be proven within a reasonable medical probability based on competent
expert testimony, i.e., something more than a “50-50 possibility.”’ ‘[T]he
evidence must be sufficient to allow the jury to infer that in the absence of
the defendant’s negligence, there was a reasonable medical probability the
plaintiff would have obtained a better result.’” (Belfiore-Braman v.
Rotenberg (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 234, 247, internal citations omitted.)
“The Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) contains
numerous provisions effecting substantial changes in negligence actions against
health care providers, including a limitation on noneconomic damages,
elimination of the collateral source rule as well as preclusion of subrogation
in most instances, and authorization for periodic payments of future damages in
excess of $50,000. While in each instance the statutory scheme has altered a
significant aspect of claims for medical malpractice, such as the measure of
the defendant’s liability for damages or the admissibility of evidence, the
fundamental substance of such actions on the issues of duty, standard of care,
breach, and causation remains unaffected.”  (Flowers v. Torrance Memorial Hospital
Medical Center (1994) 8 Cal.4th 992, 999.)
Plaintiff failed to allege a duty of care owed by Defendant to
Plaintiff; Plaintiff merely alleges a duty of care owed by Defendant to
Decedent.  An essential element of a
cause of action for medical negligence is a physician-patient relationship giving
rise to a duty of care.  (Mero v.
Sadoff (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1471.)  A third party does not ordinarily have
standing to bring a claim asserting a violation of someone else’s rights.  (Powers v. Ohio (1991) 499 U.S. 400,
410; People ex rel. Becerra v. Superior Court (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 486,
500-501.)  Plaintiff failed to assert
survivor claims in her initial Complaint, which would have given her standing
to assert a cause of action for medical negligence.  (C.C.P. §377.30; Grant v. McAuliffe
(1953) 41 Cal.2d 859; Brenner v. Universal Health Services of Rancho
Springs, Inc. (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 589.) 

Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of
action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Loss of Consortium (3rd COA)
A cause of action for loss of consortium requires the following
elements: (1) a valid and lawful marriage between the plaintiff and injured
party, at time of injury; (2) tortious injury to the plaintiff’s spouse; (3) loss
of consortium suffered by plaintiff; and (4) loss proximately caused by
defendant’s act.  (Vanhooser v.
Superior Court (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 921, 927.)
Plaintiff alleges she and Decedent were lawfully married at all
times relevant to this action.  (FAC
¶42.)  Plaintiff alleges as a result of
the aforementioned injuries and death of Decedent, Plaintiff has been deprived
of her spouse’s companionship, affection, love, sexual relations, conjugal
fellowship, physical assistance in maintaining the family home and comfort,
which deprivation has caused, and continued to cause Plaintiff to suffer
depression, emotional distress, loss of earning capacity, past, present, and
future, and other injuries, the full extent of which has not yet been
ascertained, but which will be stated according to proof at trial.  (FAC ¶43.)
Plaintiff fails to allege her loss was proximately caused by Defendant’s
act because she alleges Decedent’s death resulted from his transfer to rehab,
where he was mis-fed lying down.  (FAC
¶11.)  Further, Plaintiff was not granted
leave to amend her initial Complaint to add the instant cause of action.
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of
action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is sustained without
leave to amend as to the 1st (as to the survival action only), 2nd, and 3rd
causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Defendant’s Motion to Strike
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court
may, upon a motion made pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” 
(C.C.P. §436(a).)
 
Summary of Motion
Defendant moves to strike the following
portions of the FAC: (1) any and all references to Plaintiff as
“Successor-in-Interest” to the Estate of Demetrios Fotinatos as reflected on
Page 1:18, Pg 1, ¶1:1, Pg. 2, ¶¶2:1-11, Pg. 13:14-15; (2) Any and all
references to Plaintiff as the “representative of the other statutory
beneficiaries” including as a representative of Amalia Thanou, as reflected in Pg
1, ¶2:28; (3) Any and all references to “Plaintiff the Estate of Demetrios
Fotinatos” as reflected on Pg. 2, ¶¶2:1-11; (4) Amalia Thanou (62)
Stepdaughter, as reflected on Pg. 3, ¶6(b); (5) Step-daughter Amalia Thanou, as
reflected on Pg. 3, ¶7:5; (6) References to CACI No. 400, as reflected on Pg.
4, ¶13:10-18. (7) References to CACI 3921, as reflected on Pg. 5, ¶19; (8) References
to loss of consortium “suffered by decedent’s family” as reflected on Pg. 7,
¶22:4; (9) References to punitive damages, malice, oppression, despicable
conduct, fraud, as reflected on Pgs. 8-9, ¶30:24-21; (10) References to
punitive damages, as reflected on Pg. 10, ¶¶31-33:10-18; (11) References to
CACI 400, as reflected on Pgs. 10-11, ¶35:23-2; (12) References to CACI 3920,
as reflected on Pg. 11, ¶41:20-28; (13) References to “newly signed Assembly
Bill 35” as referenced on Pg. 12, ¶¶44-45:13-28; (14) Prayer for general
damages “in the amount of the jurisdictional $500,000 maximum, according to
proof,” as reflected on Pg. 13, ¶49, Pg. 15, ¶50:6-7, and Pg. 16:1-2; (15)
References to “Brandon Derdak, and Ashley Derdak” on Pg. 14:4; and (16)
References to non-economic damages in the amount of $500,000 as referenced on
Pg. 14:19-20.  (MTS, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P §§425.13, 435, 436.) 
 
Successor-in-Interest
Allegations
A
survival action may be brought by a successor-in-interest to the Estate and is
subject to the applicable statute of limitations of the underlying action.  (C.C.P. §377.20(a).) 
A
newly pled cause of action for survival does not relate back to the filing of
the original complaint for wrongful death; Plaintiff’s the survival action is
time-barred as a matter of law, as stated in the demurrer.  (Quiroz, 140 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1278-1279.)
The
FAC purports to substitute in (1) Plaintiff Markella Thanou “as successor in
interest” to the Estate of Demetrios Fotinatos (“Estate”), and (2) the Estate,
in an attempt to plead the survival cause of action on behalf of the Estate and
beneficiaries of the Estate.  A new
plaintiff cannot be joined after the statute of limitations has run where that
plaintiff seeks to enforce an independent right. (Id.; Branick v.
Downey Saving & Loan Association (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235; Diliberti v.
Stage Call Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1471.)  The new plaintiff, Markella Thanou as
successor in interest and the Estate, seeks to vindicate a survival claim.
Therefore, neither the survival claim, nor the newly substituted plaintiff relates
back to the filing of the initial Complaint and are time-barred. 
Inclusion
of Plaintiff as successor in interest and the Estate in the text of the FAC is
irrelevant, false, and improper and not in conformity with the law.  The prayer for damages the FAC also seeks
“funeral and burial expenses paid by Plaintiffs . . . Brandon Derdak, and
Ashley Derdak.”  (FAC, Pg. 14:3-5.)  These people are not Plaintiffs in this
action, nor are they identified anywhere in the FAC, and their inclusion in the
FAC is irrelevant, false, and improper and not in conformity with the law.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the FAC pertaining to
successors-in-interest is granted.
 
CACI
Jury Instructions
The
FAC references and quotes CACI jury instructions throughout the text of the
FAC. The text of CACI jury instructions is irrelevant and improper and not
filed in conformity with the law.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to strike the FAC’s references and quotes to CACI jury
instructions is granted.
 
Civil
Code §3333.2
The
FAC references A.B. 35, various history regarding this bill, and the current
version of Civil Code §3333.2 that went into effect for cases filed on or after
January 1, 2023.  Civil Code §3333.2 is
not retroactive.
Civil
Code §3333.2 states in pertinent part: “(g) This section shall be deemed
effective as of, and shall apply to all cases filed . . . on or after, January
1, 2023.”  (Civ. Code §3333.2(g).)
Plaintiff’s
initial complaint was filed on October 25, 2022, when the previous version of
Civil Code §3333.2 was in effect. The FAC’s references to A.B. 35, various
history regarding A.B. 35, the version of Civil Code § 3333.2 that went into
effect on January 1, 2023, and demands for noneconomic damages under the
current version of Civil Code §3333.2 are irrelevant, false, improper and not
filed in conformity with the law.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to strike the FAC’s references to A.B. 35 is granted.
 
Punitive
Damages
C.C.P. § 425.13 states, in part:
(a)     
In any action for damages arising out of the
professional negligence of any health care provider, no claim for punitive
damages shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court
enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive
damages to be filed. The court may allow the filing of an amended pleading
claiming punitive damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading
and on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented that the
plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the
plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to Section 3294 of the Civil Code . . .
 
(b)     
For the purposes of this section,
“health care provider” means any person licensed or certified pursuant to
Division 2 . . . of the Business and Professions Code.
 
(C.C.P. §425.13(a)-(b).)
Where the facts which give rise to
injuries and damages stem from the alleged professional negligence of a health
care provider, the MICRA statutes apply.  (See Business & Professions Code
§6164; Civil Code §§3333.1, 3333.2; C.C.P. §§340.5, 364, 667.7, 1295.)
Hospitals are “health care providers”
under the MICRA statutes. A hospital’s alleged negligent treatment of a patient
is professional negligence. (Flowers v. Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical
Center (1994) 8 Cal.4th 992, 998.)
The allegations of the FAC stem from
the manner in which Defendant provided medical care to Decedent.  Therefore, Plaintiff must obtain court
authorization by way of a noticed motion, prior to pleading punitive damages.
Plaintiff failed to follow the mandatory procedures before alleging punitive
damages. 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to
strike Plaintiff’s references to punitive damages, malice, fraud, oppression,
and despicable conduct from the FAC is granted. 

 
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to strike is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
C.   
Plaintiff’s Motion for Trial Preference
Legal
Standard
Parties
who are 70 years of age or older (or who reach that age during pendency of the
action) may be entitled to preference if they establish to the court’s
satisfaction that: (1) they have a “substantial interest in the action as a
whole”; and (2) their health is “such that a preference is necessary to prevent
prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.”  (C.C.P. §36(a), (c)(2).)
The
preference motion must be supported by a “declaration of the moving party” (or
presumably, the moving party’s attorney) “that all essential parties have been
served with process or have appeared.”  (C.C.P.
§36(c)(1).)
Trial
priority is not mandatory and absolute merely because one of the parties is age
70. The court has discretion to determine the extent of that party’s interest
and find as a matter of fact the risk posed of that party’s death or incapacity
if trial is delayed.  (C.C.P. § 36(a).)
 
Discussion
          Plaintiff’s motion and supporting
declaration demonstrates Plaintiff is entitled to a motion for trial
preference.  Plaintiff’s supplementary declaration
submits admissible evidence from her medical provider stating that she is
currently 94 years old.  (Supp.-Decl. of Thanou
¶6, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff’s
attorney declares she is currently in ill health as she suffers numerous
illnesses such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease,
Hypertension, has a pacemaker, has Hyperlipidemia, and suffers from Atrial
fibrillation, for which she is currently on various medications.  (Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s attorney declares on information
and belief that Plaintiff has a grave heart ailment and now has Cirrhosis of
the liver, due to her heart failure. 
(Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶8.)  Plaintiff’s
attorney’s evidence supporting these facts would sufficiently supplement
admissible evidence of Plaintiff’s advanced age.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference is granted.  The Court sets the trial of
this matter on November 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. and the Final Status Conference
on November 15, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.  Both
are in Dept. 71.  A reminder that trial counsel
are ordered to appear at the FSC in person and that trial notebooks must be
delivered to Dept. 71 two days prior to the FSC.
