[1] The Court notes Defendant has only made one
reservation for the two motions to compel calendar for today.  Each motion requires an individual
reservation made through the court reservation system (“CRS”) that requires a
$60.00 fee per reservation.  Defendant
owes this Court $60.00 in fees for the one extra reservation it failed to make
in the CRS for the second motion to compel. 
The instant ruling is not effective until Defendant makes its payment to
this Court.
