And here is the English-text summary:

The defendant, having won their summary adjudication motion on the plaintiff's trade secret claim, seeks attorneys' fees. The defendant argues that the plaintiff brought the action in bad faith, but the court disagrees, finding that a final judgment is not required to adjudicate the motion. However, the court concludes that it is better to decide the motion at the end of the case rather than mid-stream, as a full trial on the merits may shed light on the question of bad faith. The court also notes that the defendant intends to call live witnesses at the hearing, which is not typical of motions and confirms the court's conclusion that the motion is better deferred to the end of trial. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice to renewal at the conclusion of the case.
