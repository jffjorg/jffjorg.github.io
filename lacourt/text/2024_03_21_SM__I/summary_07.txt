Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the case, currently set for trial on March 25, 2024, will be stayed and the trial date vacated due to a motion filed by Buckley to disqualify the Judge. This is similar to a situation that occurred a year ago involving a different party, Pomerantz. The Judge believes that the motion should be handled in a similar fashion, which means that the case will be stayed until the motion is fully resolved, including any potential appellate review. The stay will toll the time to bring the matter to trial, and the parties will be required to agree to stipulate and avoid any potential prejudice caused by the delay. A status conference will be scheduled in approximately 90 days to re-set the trial date and determine whether the stay should be lifted.
