 Case Number:  22SMCV01274    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  I The court will discuss the matter with counsel.  Generally, the court does not give
continuances absent extraordinary cause. 
The reasons given here do not qualify. 
However, the court will look at its calendar and if it is likely to be
engaged in trial anyway, the court will discuss a possible continuance.  The court cannot, however, guarantee at this
time how long the continuance would be other than to say the new trial date
will be before mid-September 2025.
