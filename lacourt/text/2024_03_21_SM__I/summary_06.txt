```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the unopposed motion to compel arbitration, citing the moving party's failure to establish the existence of a binding arbitration agreement. The agreement, which includes a heading "ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES", does not appear to have been signed by the contractor, despite being signed by the plaintiffs. The judge notes that the clause concludes mid-sentence, with missing words, and that the court must assume that there is no agreement to arbitrate. The judge suggests that if the defendant can produce a copy of the agreement with the contractor's contemporaneous signature, the motion may be renewed. Alternatively, if the plaintiff agrees to arbitrate, the judge is prepared to accept the agreement.
