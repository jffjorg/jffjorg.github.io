 Case Number:  23SMCV02045    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  I The application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  There is no proof of service or declaration
of notice for the ex parte application as is required.  Further, plaintiffs have not stated what it
is that they did mean to do when they filed their notice of
dismissal.  In other words, it is one
thing to say that the dismissal was a typographic error; it is another thing to
say that the dismissing party has just changed her or his mind.
