And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to strike is denied. The Judge discusses the relationship between the moving party and Orange Team, and notes that the amended complaint superseded the original complaint, which means that a default of one is not a default on the other. The Judge agrees with Green Planet that the amended complaint had the effect of vacating the default, and that Green Planet has a right to answer once served. However, the Judge finds that the amended complaint made substantive changes to Green Planet's liability, and that Green Planet was served with the amended complaint, even if it was not served properly. The Judge notes that the test to determine whether an amendment is substantive or technical is sometimes a hard question, but finds that the balance tips in Green Planet's favor. The Judge also notes that California has a strong public policy favoring resolution on the merits. The Judge orders that the trial dates and discovery cut-offs remain as set, and that Green Planet has answered and therefore been able to participate in the case.
