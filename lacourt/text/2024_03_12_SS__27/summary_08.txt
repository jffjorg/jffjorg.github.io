  - Defendant: DAVID M ODEGARD
  - Judge: Hon. Lee S. Arian
Significant Statements:
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
  - "Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information."

Summary:
The Judge grants the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the plaintiff's action without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests, file opposition to the motion to compel, and pay the sanctions imposed. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has abandoned the case and that terminating sanctions are warranted.
