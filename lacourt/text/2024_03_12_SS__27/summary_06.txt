And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company, has moved to strike references to and the prayer for punitive damages in the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Brian Mendoza, alleges that he was accosted, maced, and assaulted by Ralphs' security and seeks punitive damages for alleged malice and oppression. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support punitive damages.

The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint lacks specificity in alleging malice and oppression. The plaintiff's allegations are filled with legal conclusions and fail to demonstrate with specificity who is the managing agent that ratified the security guard's conduct and how they ratified the conduct. The plaintiff may seek leave to amend at a later time if they uncover facts through discovery that will support punitive damages.

Therefore, the defendant's motion to strike is granted without leave to amend.
