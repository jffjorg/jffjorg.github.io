Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant's motion for leave to take Plaintiff's deposition and has ordered Plaintiff to attend her deposition within 30 days. The Judge has also granted Defendant's motion for sanctions in the amount of $1750, which Plaintiff and her counsel are ordered to pay jointly and severally.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff has failed to attend her noticed deposition 7 times, despite multiple attempts by Defendant to schedule the deposition. The Judge notes that Plaintiff's attorney has unilaterally canceled the scheduled deposition 5 times, which has caused Defendant to incur additional attorney fees. The Judge concludes that Defendant's motion to compel deposition is justified and that Plaintiff's history of unilaterally canceling scheduled depositions warrants the imposition of sanctions.
