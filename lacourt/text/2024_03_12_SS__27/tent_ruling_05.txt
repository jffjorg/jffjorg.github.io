On January 19, 2024, Defendants Sanford Sigal and
Cindy Sigal, Trustees of the Sigal Family Trust UA, filed a motion to strike
punitive damages and allegations in the complaint relating to punitive damages
that are substantially similar to those requested in the current motion. Sigal’s
motion to strike was granted on February 27, 2024 with leave to amend, and Plaintiff
intends to amend the Complaint. At this time, the present motion appears moot
and is therefore DENIED.
