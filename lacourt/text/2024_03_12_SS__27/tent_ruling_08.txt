IS GRANTED 
Background 
On August 24, 2022, Plaintiff
filed the current boat accident action against Defendants. On June 13, 2023,
Defendants served (1) Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) Special
Interrogatories, Set One; and (3) Requests for Production, Set One to
Plaintiff. Plaintiff did not respond to these discovery requests. Consequently,
On September 14, 2023, Defendants filed its motion to compel initial responses
to the discovery requests at issue. Plaintiff did not file an opposition to
Defendants’ MTCs. On November 17, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff to provide
initial responses to the three separate sets of discovery by December 4, 2023,
and sanctioned Plaintiff and his counsel $1,750 payable to Defendants by the
same date. To date, Defendants have not received any discovery responses or
payment of the sanctions. Defendants now move the court to impose a terminating
sanction against Plaintiff for failing to comply with the Court's November 17,
2023 order and seek sanctions in the amount of $1,141.65. No opposition was
filed.
 
Legal Standard 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030
gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).) “[T]the trial court has
broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction, and we must uphold the
trial court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.” (Dept. of
Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191,
overturned on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493, 516 n. 17.) 
 
A violation of a discovery order
is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)  A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.) "A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) While the court
has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be
appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Ibid.) Discovery sanctions are not to
be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See
Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other
grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967,
971].)  
 
Analysis 
Terminating sanctions are warranted in the present
case, as it appears Plaintiff has abandoned the case. Plaintiff did not respond
to Defendants' first set of discovery requests. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition to Defendants’ motions to compel initial responses. When the Court
ordered Plaintiff to respond and imposed a monetary sanction on November 17,
2023, Plaintiff failed to provide any responses or pay the sanctions. In fact,
since filing the complaint on August 24, 2022, there has been no record of
Plaintiff submitting any filings to the Court. Now, even faced with a motion
for terminating sanctions, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. It appears
that Plaintiff has abandoned the case and no lesser sanctions would prevent further
misconduct.
 
Therefore, Defendants' motion for terminating sanctions
is GRANTED. Plaintiff's action against Defendants is hereby dismissed without
prejudice. The request for monetary sanctions is denied, as the imposition of
terminating sanctions adequately serves the ends of justice.
