BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿ 
On January 25, 2021, Plaintiff
filed the present premises liability case. On November 18, 2021, Plaintiff
served Defendant with Special Interrogatories Set One. Plaintiff then gave Defendant
numerous extensions. On September 22, 2022, defense counsel stated that they
would provide the discovery responses at issue, but none were provided.
Plaintiff reached out again on November 2, 2023, and defense counsel stated
that he would look into it, but no explanation or responses were provided.
Plaintiff now moves the court, compelling Defendant to provide initial
responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One. No opposition to the
motion was filed.   
¿ 
 ANALYSIS    
¿ 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿ 
¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿ 
¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Defendant did not serve timely
initial responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories Set one despite Plaintiff
giving Defendant numerous extensions. Plaintiff latest inquiry was in November
2023, but Defendant failed to provide an explanation or discovery responses.
Since no opposition was filed, Defendant failed to show that discovery
responses were ever served before the date of the hearing.¿ 
¿ 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel is GRANTED and Defendant GLENOAKS BUSINESS PARK is hereby
ORDERED to provide discovery responses without objections within 30 days of
today.
