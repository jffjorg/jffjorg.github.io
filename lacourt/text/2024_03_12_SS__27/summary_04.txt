Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Arctic's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication in its entirety. The motion was filed by Arctic against Costco, the cross-complainant, and sought to dismiss various causes of action related to a slip and fall incident that occurred at a Costco warehouse.

The judge found that Arctic failed to meet its initial burden of proof in several respects. Specifically, the judge found that Arctic's evidence did not demonstrate that Costco's discovery responses were factually devoid, and that Arctic's own declarations and exhibits did not establish that Arctic's employees were competent to repair the drip pan system. The judge also found that Arctic's motion for summary adjudication as to Costco's cause of action for comparative negligence was denied because the contractual indemnity clause did not apply to the facts of the case.

The judge also found that Costco had raised various triable issues of material fact, including whether Arctic had repaired the drip pan system and whether Arctic's various unsuccessful repairs of the drip pan system had caused the slip and fall incident at issue. The judge concluded that a trial was necessary to resolve the disputes between the parties.

The judge ordered that the parties submit to the tentative ruling by email by the hearing date, and that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue. The judge also noted that if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the judge may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
