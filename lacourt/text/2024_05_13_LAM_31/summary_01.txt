And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the defendant's alleged false statements and submission of a fraudulent invoice were material. The court found that the defendant's alleged false statement about the accident was not material because CIGA already assumed the defendant was at fault. The court also found that the defendant's submission of a fraudulent invoice was not material because the plaintiff withdrew the request for property damages. The court denied the plaintiff's request for continuance, finding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its request.
