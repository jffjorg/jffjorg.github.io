MOTION
Plaintiff Global Plumbing
& Fire Supply (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Ritecon
Plumbing and Patrick Kim (“Kim”) (collectively, “Defendants”) to Form
Interrogatories, set one (“FROG”).  Defendants
have not opposed the motion.
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories unsatisfactory, the propounding party
may move to compel further responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.)  
In response to
FROG Nos. 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8, Kim responded “N/A.”  (See Declaration of Catherine R. Finamore, Exhibit
A, pp. 3-5.)  Defendants’ response is
improper. (See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1984) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783-784.)  Defendants must further
respond.  
In FROG No. 15.1,
Plaintiff asks Defendants to state all facts in support of their affirmative
defenses.  In response, Kim states, in
pertinent part, he “does not have any new information to assert to support
those defenses at this time, but reserves its right to assert such defenses at
trial.”  (See Finamore Decl., Exhibit A,
p. 8.)  Defendants cannot fail to provide
responsive information while at the same time stating they have the right to
assert these defenses at trial.  If
Defendants have no responsive information, Defendants must unequivocally so
state.  
For the same
reason, Defendants’ response to FROG No. 17.1 is improper.  In that response, Kim states he “does not
have enough information at this time . . . ,” but “[d]iscovery and
investigation is continuing.”  (See Finamore
Decl., Exhibit A, p. 11.)  Kim adds, “To
be determined.”  (Ibid.)  Defendants cannot unilaterally extend the
time to provide responsive information to Plaintiff.  Defendants must provide any responsive
information they have now.  
Finally, Defendants’
responses are unverified.  “Unsworn
responses are tantamount to no responses at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  Accordingly,
Defendants must serve verifications to the responses.  Therefore, the motion to compel further responses
is granted.
The Court
concludes Defendants’ failure to properly respond to the discovery is an abuse
of the discovery process and awards sanctions. 
Based on the evidence before the Court, the Court concludes Defendants
bear responsibility for the failure to serve proper responses.  As such, the Court imposes sanctions against
Defendants in the amount of $2,000, which represents four hours of attorney
time to prepare the motion and attend the hearing at $485 per hour, plus the
filing fee.  Defendants are to pay $2,000
in sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel, within 30 days.
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
