And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court notes that the defendants argue that certain of the plaintiff's claims are time-barred. However, the plaintiff's operative complaint alleges that he was misled by Lotas and Stoyanchev into believing his 5% ownership interest remained fully vested until at least 2022, and that he was never notified that his equity interest had been relinquished. The plaintiff only learned on May 12, 2023, that Lotas and Stoyanchev took the position that he was not a lawful member of the company and was not entitled to receive any distribution. The court finds that these allegations are sufficient to ward off the defendants' statute of limitations challenge to the claims.
