[1]The
Court notes Defendants contend certain of Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred.  In the operative complaint, Plaintiff alleges
he understood his 5% ownership interest remained fully vested; he was “strung
along” by Lotas and Stoyanchev into at least 2022; and at no time did Lotas and
Stoyanchev tell him he did not have an equity interest in the Company.  (See e.g., First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 44-51.)  Plaintiff adds that for the first time on May
12, 2023, Lotas and Stoyanchev took the position he was not a lawful member of
the Company; Plaintiff’s vested interest had been relinquished; and Plaintiff
was not entitled to receive any distribution. (Id,. ¶ 52.)  For pleading purposes, such allegations are
sufficient to ward off Defendants’ statute of limitations challenge to the
claims.
