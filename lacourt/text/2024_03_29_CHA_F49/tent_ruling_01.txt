  Case Number:  23CHCV02683    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    3/29/24     Case    Name:  Luis Pullido v. North Hills    Village Apts., LLC, and Does 1-50     Case    # 23CHCV02683      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 29,  2024    MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV02683    Motion  filed: 11/3/23   MOVING PARTY: specially appearing Defendant North  Hills Village Apts., LLC (“North Hills” or “specially appearing Defendant”)  RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court quashing service of the summons and complaint upon  Defendant North Hills.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from an incident where Plaintiff allegedly  fell due to damaged flooring improperly maintained by Defendant at 15115  Parthenia Ave. #235, North Hills, CA 91343 (“Subject Premises”).   On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff Luis Pullido (“Plaintiff”) filed  his Complaint against Defendants North Hills and Does 1-50, alleging negligence  and premises liability.    On November 3, 2023, specially appearing Defendant North Hills filed  the instant Motion to Quash Service.   No opposing papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 subdivision (a)  provides, “A  defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any  further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a  notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash  service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him  or her.”    Until  statutory requirements are satisfied, the court lacks jurisdiction over a  defendant. (Honda Motor Co. v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th  1043, 1048; Schering Corp. v. Superior Court. (1975) 52  Cal.App.3d 737, 741.) A defendant is under no duty to respond in any way to a  defectively served summons. It makes no difference that defendant had actual  knowledge of the action. Such knowledge does not dispense with statutory  requirements for service of summons. (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200  Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466; Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53  Cal.App.4th 801, 808 [notice does not substitute for proper service].) “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper  service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of  jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective  service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) A  proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server  invokes a presumption of valid service.   (See American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390;  see also Evid. Code § 647.) This presumption is rebuttable. (See id.) The party seeking to defeat  service of process must present sufficient evidence to show that the service  did not take place as stated. (See Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1428  (Yadegar); cf. People v. Chavez (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1483 [“If some fact be presumed, the opponent of that fact bears  the burden of producing or going forward with evidence sufficient to overcome or  rebut the presumed fact.”].) Merely denying service took place without more is  insufficient to overcome the presumption.   (See Yadegar, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at 1428.)   A.     Motion to  Quash Service   North Hills moves to quash service of the summons and  complaint by Plaintiff on the basis that it was improperly served. (Mot., at  3.)   Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service on December 4, 2023, and  a second Proof of Service on January 18, 2024. In both Proof of Service,  Plaintiff claims that substituted service was made on November 28, 2023, by  leaving the documents with John Doe. (12/4/23 Proof of Service, ¶ 5b, 1/18/24  Proof of Service, ¶ 5b.) Plaintiff asserts that copies of the documents were  also served by mail to North Hills on December 1, 2023 (12/4/23 Proof of  Service by Mail), whereas the January 18, 2024, Proof of Service by Mail  indicates that copies of the documents were served by mail to “Anil Mehta,  authorized agent for service of process,” on October 10, 2023. Code of  Civil Procedure section 416.10 provides, in part, that “A summons may be served on a  corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint by any of the  following methods: (a) To the person designated as agent for service of  process[.] (b) To the president, chief  executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice president, a  secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a  controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a person authorized  by the corporation to receive service of process. (c) If the corporation  is a bank, to a cashier or assistant cashier or to a person specified in  subdivision (a) or (b). (d) If authorized by any provision in Section  1701, 1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,  inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in  effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain  applicable), as provided by that provision.”    Code of Civil Procedure section  415.20 subdivision (a) sets forth, in part, that “In  lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the person  to be served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or 416.50,  a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint during  usual office hours in his or her office or, if no physical address is known, at  his or her usual mailing address, other than a United States Postal Service  post office box, with the person who is apparently in charge thereof, and  by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class mail,  postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the  summons and complaint were left.” (Underlines added.) Here, North Hills argues that personal service to “Anil  Mehta, Agent for Service” is impossible because on the day of the alleged  service, its Agent for Service was Mr. Ritesh Desai (Mot., at 3, Ex. “B”) instead  of Anil Mehta, who had died prior to the purported service. (Mot., at 3, Desai  Decl., ¶ 5.)  Mr. Desai has been listed  as the appropriate Agent for Service with the Secretary of State since at least  August 17, 2023, predating the purported service of process. (Desai Decl., ¶  5.)    Furthermore, North Hills contends that Plaintiff’s  substituted service does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20  subdivision (a), which mandates both “leaving a copy of [documents] ... in the  office” and “mailing a copy of [documents] to the person [to whom the documents  were left].” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (a).) North Hills argues the  copies of documents were improperly mailed to North Hills, a corporation.  (Mot., at 3.) Even though Plaintiff filed a second Proof of Service on January  18, 2024, which explicitly lists “Anil Mehta” as the person to whom the mailing  was addressed, this does not establish compliance as the addressee is a  deceased person.    Consequently, the Court finds that North Hills has  sufficiently rebutted the presumption of proper service as established by the  Proof of Service filed by Plaintiff. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by  proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service. (See Summers v.  McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) However, Plaintiff has not met the burden as no responses  have been filed by Plaintiff. Since Plaintiff does not oppose the instant  Motion, and as such, fails to demonstrate the service of process was made in  compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 416.10 or 415.20.   Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Quash Service.   CONCLUSION   The Motion to Quash Service is GRANTED.   Moving party to give notice.
