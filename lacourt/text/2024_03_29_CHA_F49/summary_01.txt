And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, North Hills Village Apts., LLC, and granted its motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Luis Pullido, allegedly fell due to damaged flooring at the defendant's property, and the defendant claims that the service of process was improperly made. The judge found that the defendant had sufficiently rebutted the presumption of proper service and that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of proof. The judge noted that the defendant's Agent for Service, Anil Mehta, had died prior to the purported service and that the plaintiff's service did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 416.10 and 415.20. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion to quash service and ordered that the summons and complaint be returned to the plaintiff.
