English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer (a motion to dismiss the complaint) is overruled. The plaintiffs, Min-Hsiung Chien, Nancy M. Chien, Stan Chien, and Allen Chien, brought a lawsuit against the defendants, Navigators Real Estate, Inc. d/b/a Pinnacle Real Estate Group and Qing Guan, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty, committed financial elder abuse, and made negligent and fraudulent representations.

The judge ruled that the plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state causes of action for elder abuse, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation. The judge also ruled that the defendants' demurrer was based on improper arguments and failed to address the sufficiency of the pleadings.

The judge ordered the defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days.
