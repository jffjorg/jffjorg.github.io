Agency vs. Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority.; Case
No. 22STCV06315
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff West Coast Add It
Up Ad Agency
Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint
I.
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff West Coast Add It Up Ad Agency
(Plaintiff) appears to be alleging that it entered some type of agreement with
Defendant Los Angeles County MTA (Defendant) for the usage of the Tap App. Plaintiff’s
Second Amended Complaint (SAC) does not include the specific terms of the
agreement or have the agreement attached to the SAC. It does, however, include
quotes from a string of emails that are purported to be about the TAP app,
though there is no specific indication from the quoted emails that any kind of
formal agreement was entered. 
            No causes of action are indicated in
the body of the SAC, though common count, common law/equity, and quantum meruit
are listed on the first page of the SAC.
Defendant filed its demurrer Plaintiff’s SAC on August 10, 2023.
Plaintiff opposes the demurer. 
II. ANALYSIS 
A. The Demurrer
As a
general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
Where a
demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
1. Entire
First Amended Complaint
            Defendant
demurs to Plaintiff’s entire SAC on the basis that the complaint fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant,
impermissibly pleads a causes of action for quantum meruit and common count
against a public entity, fails to comply with basic pleading rules, and fails
to plead whether Plaintiff complied with the Government Tort Claims Act.
            As
with the previous iteration of Plaintiff’s complaint, there is no Civil Cover
Sheet Addendum and Statement of Location. (L.A. Sup. Ct. Rule 2.3(a).) No
causes of action are identified or numbered. (Cal. Rules of Court. Rule 2.112.)
Finally, there is no prayer for relief or demand for judgment. (CCP §
425.10(a)(2).)
            Next,
a public entity cannot be sued on theories of quantum meruit or common count
because of the need to limit a public entity’s contractual obligations, and
because public entities cannot be a party to a contract that is implied in fact
or implied in law. (Katsura v. City of
San Buenaventura (2007) 155
Cal.App.4th 104,109-110 (citing Janis v. California State Lottery Com.
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 824, 830).)
            Finally, there is no indication that
Plaintiff complied with the Government Tort Claims Act before filing this action
against Defendant. (Gov. Code § 911.2.) Though Plaintiff appears to claim that
this is not necessary based on the causes of action that are being pled.
However, Plaintiff cites no legal authority for this assertion, and Plaintiff
would still need to provide allegations that a claim has been presented to the
public entity and has been acted on or rejected by the public entity. (Gov.
Code § 910 et seq.)
            The Court sustains Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s entire SAC.

SAC is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
