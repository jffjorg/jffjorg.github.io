And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering an unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint in a case filed on January 12, 2023. The Plaintiffs claim that they have learned new information through discovery that requires them to amend and assert additional facts and claims. The trial is set for July 22, 2024. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs' counsel sought a stipulation regarding amending the complaint, but received no response. Despite the lack of opposition to the motion, the Judge takes the opportunity to remind the parties to behave in a manner that does not place unnecessary burdens on the parties and the Court.

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, citing the liberal policy of allowing amendments at any stage of litigation, and the lack of prejudice to the Defendants. The Judge also notes that the Defendants would not be prejudiced by allowing the Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint at this stage of the case, and that no opposition to the motion has been filed.
