## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiffs' motion to file a first amended complaint.  

The plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on January 12, 2023. They now wish to amend their complaint based on new information discovered during the discovery process.  Although the plaintiffs attempted to get the defendants' agreement to amend the complaint, they did not receive a response. Therefore, they filed this motion. 

The judge noted that leave to amend is generally granted liberally, especially this early in the case.  Since the trial is still over ten months away, the defendants would not be prejudiced by the amendment.  Furthermore, the defendants did not oppose the motion. 



For these reasons, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request to file a first amended complaint.

The ruling indicates that the motion will be granted, allowing the Plaintiff to file the amended complaint.
