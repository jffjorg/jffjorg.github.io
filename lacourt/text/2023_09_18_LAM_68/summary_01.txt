Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to the plaintiff, West Coast Add It Up Ad Agency's, Second Amended Complaint. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, impermissibly pleads causes of action against a public entity, and fails to comply with basic pleading rules.

The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The plaintiff is given 20 days to amend and file a Third Amended Complaint. The court notes that the plaintiff's complaint lacks specific allegations, including the terms of the alleged agreement, and that the plaintiff has failed to comply with basic pleading rules.

The court also notes that a public entity, such as the defendant, cannot be sued on theories of quantum meruit or common count, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act. The court's decision is based on California law and precedents, including Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. and Katsura v. City of San Buenaventura.
