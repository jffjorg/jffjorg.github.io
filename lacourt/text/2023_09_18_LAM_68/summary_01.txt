Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to the plaintiff, West Coast Add It Up Ad Agency's, Second Amended Complaint. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, impermissibly pleads causes of action against a public entity, and fails to comply with basic pleading rules.

The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The plaintiff is given 20 days to amend and file a Third Amended Complaint. The court notes that the plaintiff's complaint lacks specific allegations, including the terms of the alleged agreement, and that the plaintiff has failed to comply with basic pleading rules.

The court also notes that a public entity, such as the defendant, cannot be sued on theories of quantum meruit or common count, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act. The court's decision is based on California law and precedents, including Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. and Katsura v. City of San Buenaventura.

The plaintiff has 20 days from the date of service of this order to amend and file a third amended complaint.

**English Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is tentatively ruling in favor of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) and sustaining their demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by West Coast Add It Up Ad Agency.  The Judge finds that the complaint is deficient because it fails to adequately state a cause of action, lacks necessary procedural elements (like a Civil Cover Sheet Addendum, numbered causes of action, and a prayer for relief), and improperly attempts to sue a public entity under theories of quantum meruit and common count. Furthermore, the Judge finds no evidence that the Plaintiff complied with the Government Tort Claims Act. However, the Judge is granting the Plaintiff leave to amend their complaint within 20 days to address these deficiencies.

**Companies:**

* West Coast Add It Up Ad Agency 
* Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA)

**Subject Matter:**

*  Alleged agreement for usage of the TAP App.

**Facts:**

* Email quotes are included, but they don't explicitly confirm a formal agreement.

**Disputes:**

* Defendant demurs to Plaintiff's SAC, challenging its sufficiency.

**Law:**

* **Demurrer Standard:** Defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.
* **Government Tort Claims Act:**  Plaintiff failed to demonstrate compliance with the Act before filing.
* **Quantum Meruit and Common Count:**  These theories are inapplicable to public entities.

**Judge's Findings:**

* The SAC lacks formal causes of action, a Civil Cover Sheet Addendum and Statement of Location, and a prayer for relief.
*  Plaintiff cannot pursue quantum meruit or common count claims against a public entity.
*  Plaintiff failed to show compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act.

**Order:**

* Defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
* Plaintiff has 20 days to file a Third Amended Complaint.




**English Summary:**

The Judge determined that Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint doesn't adequately state a legal claim against the Defendant, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). 

Specifically, the complaint lacks:

* A clear description of the agreement with LACMTA regarding the TAP App.
* A proper identification of legal claims.
* Required court-mandated documents.
*  Compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act, which governs lawsuits against public entities. 

While the Judge sustained the demurrer (meaning the complaint was rejected), they allowed Plaintiff 20 days to revise and resubmit the complaint, potentially addressing these issues.
