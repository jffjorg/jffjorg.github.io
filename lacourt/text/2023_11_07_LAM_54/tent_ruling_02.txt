BACKGROUND
 
On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff Lawana Denise
Redman sued Defendants Centre of Positive Essentials, Inc., and Jeanne Steen,
individually and as administrator of the Estate of Mary B. Steen, asserting
causes of action for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing; (3) fraud; (4) negligence; (5) UCL violations;
and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
Plaintiff, a former tenant of
Defendants, alleges Defendants unlawfully charged Plaintiff excess rent and
then threatened to evict Plaintiff.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A non-prevailing party may make a
motion to reconsider and enter a different order under the following
conditions: (1) brought before the same judge that make the order sought to be
reconsidered; (2) made within 10 days after service upon the party of the
notice of entry of the order; (3) based on new or different facts,
circumstances or law than those before the court at the time of the original
ruling; (4) supported by a declaration stating the previous order, by which
judge it was made, and the new or different facts, circumstances or law claimed
to exist; and (5) the motion must be made and decided before entry of
judgment.  (CCP § 1008.)
 
Defendants move for reconsideration of
the Court’s September 12, 2023 decision overruling their demurrer. Defendants
assert that the demurrer of Jeanne Steen, individually and as administrator of
the Estate of Mary B. Steen, should be sustained because Plaintiff failed to
file a creditor’s claim against the estate under Probate Code § 9351. Defendants also that request the Estate itself be dismissed from
the action because an estate cannot be sued.
 
The Court overruled the demurrer on these grounds because Defendants did
not provide judicially noticeable documents showing that a creditor’s claim was
not filed. On demurrer, the Court cannot consider extrinsic evidence presented
in the briefing without judicially noticeable evidence substantiating the
extrinsic evidence. While the moving papers for this motion again do not
include evidence or a request for judicial notice, on October 30, 2023, Defendants
filed a request for judicial notice of the probate docket of the Estate showing
that Plaintiff did not file a creditor claim. 
 
The Court will reconsider its prior ruling; Plaintiff has presented judicially
noticeable evidence showing a creditor’s claim was not filed. Defendants are
correct that the Estate itself is not a legally cognizable entity. 
 
Defendants’ motion is GRANTED. Defendant Jeanne Steen’s demurrer is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Defendant Estate’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend.
