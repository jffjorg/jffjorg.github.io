“A defendant, on or before the last day of
his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good
cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (CCP §
418.10(a)(1).)  “When a motion to quash is properly brought, the
burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)
A non-resident
defendant may be subject to either general or specific jurisdiction. (See Elkman
v. National States Insurance Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.)  General jurisdiction exists when a defendant
is domiciled in the forum state or his activities there are substantial,
continuous, and systematic. (F. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2005)
130 Cal.App.4th 782, 796.) Specific jurisdiction involves a 3-part test in
California. California courts adopt the same test as the test used by the court
in Boschetto v. Hansing (9th Cir. Cal. 2008) 539 F.3d 1011,1016: (1) The
nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the
forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the
privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits
and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or
results from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of
jurisdiction must be reasonable.” Panavision International, L.P. v. Toeppen
(9th Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 1316, 1320 [applying California law].).” (Jewish
Defense Organization, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles County (Rambam)
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054.)
 
Specially Appearing Defendants
Gabrielle Pickle, Katherine Walters, and 3rd Shift Media LLC move to
quash service of summons on the ground that this Court does not have personal
jurisdiction over them. The incident in this action occurred in New Mexico.
Pickle declares that she is a resident of Georgia and has not visited California
in the last four years. Walters declares that she is a resident of Pennsylvania
and also has not visited California in the last four years. Ryan Dennett-Smith,
a managing member of 3rd Shift, declares that 3rd Shift
is a Georgia corporation and has not conducted any business in California.
Plaintiff has not opposed these motions.
 
 Specially Appearing Defendants have
established the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. The motions are
GRANTED.
