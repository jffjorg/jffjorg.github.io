And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the court's previous decision overruling their demurrer. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to file a creditor's claim against the estate under Probate Code § 9351, and that the estate itself is not a legally cognizable entity. The court finds that the plaintiff did not file a creditor's claim, and that the estate is not a viable party to the action. The court sustains the demurrer of the defendant Jeanne Steen with leave to amend, and sustains the demurrer of the estate without leave to amend. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a first amended complaint within 20 days, and the defendants are ordered to file and serve a response within 20 days thereafter.
