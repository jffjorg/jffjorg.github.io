The judge has granted the motions to quash service of summons filed by the specially appearing defendants, Gabrielle Pickle, Katherine Walters, and 3rd Shift Media LLC. The defendants argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them, and the judge has found that they have established this fact. The incident in the action occurred in New Mexico, and the defendants are residents of Georgia and Pennsylvania, with no business conducted in California. The plaintiff has not opposed the motions. The judge has ruled that the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and the motions are granted.
