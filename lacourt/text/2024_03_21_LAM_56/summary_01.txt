And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David Hokanson vs. Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation. The case involves a petition to confirm an arbitration award, which was filed by the defendant on February 6, 2024. The arbitration award was issued on July 14, 2023, and the petition was unopposed. However, the court finds that the petition and arbitration award do not comply with the service requirements, specifically the service of the petition, notice of hearing, and arbitration award. Therefore, the petition is continued to April 22, 2024, to allow the defendant time to file proof of service and comply with the statutory requirements.
