And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a demurrer to a lawsuit filed by Joe Stojkov against several defendants, including 634 Huntley, LLC, Dustin Pourbaba, and others. The lawsuit claims that the defendants breached a contract and a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that they were negligent in performing work on a property.

The judge has considered the moving party's arguments and has decided to sustain the demurrer as to the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This means that the plaintiff will need to amend the lawsuit to make it clearer what specific conduct by the defendants constitutes a breach of the covenant.

The judge has also decided to overrule the demurrer as to the third cause of action for negligence. This means that the lawsuit will move forward with this cause of action.

The judge has given the parties 20 days to amend the lawsuit if necessary, and has set a hearing to consider the lawsuit further.
