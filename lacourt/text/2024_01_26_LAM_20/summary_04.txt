significant_statements:
  - The law of summary judgment provides courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve their dispute.
  - The moving party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue.
  - Courts "liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party."
  - The power of the Regents to operate, control, and administer the University is virtually exclusive.
  - Policies established by the Regents as matters of internal regulation may enjoy a status equivalent to that of state statutes.
```

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication and summary judgment on the first and second causes of action (retaliation and discrimination claims) due to the existence of triable issues. The motion is granted as to the seventh cause of action (damages for inventor's share) because it is not based on a statute. The judge also denies the defendant's motion on the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action (FEHA harassment, retaliation, and failure to prevent misconduct) due to the existence of triable issues.
