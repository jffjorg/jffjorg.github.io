The tentative ruling addresses a motion by Jeremy J. Osher and Boren Osher & Luftman, LLP to withdraw as counsel for Defendant Wendy Seretan. Seretan opposes the withdrawal, alleging that counsel are seeking to cover up their own mistakes. The judge notes that the determination to grant or deny an attorney's motion to withdraw lies within the court's discretion, considering whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. The motion meets the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, and given the irreconcilable differences between Seretan and her counsel, the court will grant the motion.
