The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents filed by the plaintiff, Yerik Berry, against the defendants, United Moving Cars, Juan Carlos Acosta Martinez, and MA Guadalupe Acosta. The defendants argue that the motion is untimely, but the judge rules that it was filed within the 45-day time limit.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories—General and Form Interrogatories—Employment, ordering the defendants to provide verified supplemental responses without objections within 30 days.

Regarding the motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, the judge advances the hearing from October 3, 2023, to October 2, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part, ordering the defendants to provide verified supplemental responses to certain requests for production of documents within 30 days. The judge denies the motion with respect to one specific request for production of documents.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel, Dariush G. Adli, Esq., in the amount of $4,800, based on 12 hours of counsel fees at $400 per hour, plus three filing fees of $60 each. The judge finds that the defendants engaged in gamesmanship and abused the discovery process, warranting sanctions.
