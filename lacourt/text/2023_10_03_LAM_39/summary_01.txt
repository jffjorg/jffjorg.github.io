And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Steve Javidzad and Laleh Javidzad (Plaintiffs) against Eric Adler, Adler Construction, Inc., and Adler Ventures, Inc. (Defendants). The Plaintiffs are seeking damages for a wrongful eviction from a property in Beverly Hills, while the Defendants are seeking sanctions against the Plaintiffs for failing to comply with discovery requests.

The judge has denied the Defendants' motion to compel responses to their requests for production (RPD) (Set Two) as moot, since the Plaintiffs finally served their responses on September 20, 2023. However, the judge has granted the Defendants' request for sanctions against Plaintiff Steve Javidzad in the amount of $1,667.60, finding that the failure to comply with the discovery request until after the motion was filed constitutes an abuse of the discovery process warranting sanctions.

The judge has also advanced the Defendants' motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories from October 11, 2023, to October 10, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Finally, the judge has ordered Plaintiff Steve Javidzad to pay the sanctions amount within 30 days.
