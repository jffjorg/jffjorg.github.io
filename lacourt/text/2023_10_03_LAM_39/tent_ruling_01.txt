  Case Number:  22STCV28104    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  39 Steve Javidzad, et
al. v. Adler Construction, Inc., et al.
Case No.
22STCV28104
Motion to Compel
Responses to RPD (Set Two)
 
            Plaintiffs
Steve Javidzad and Laleh Javidzad (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this
wrongful eviction case against Eric Adler; Adler Construction, Inc. (“Adler
Construction); and Adler Ventures, Inc. (“Adler Ventures”) (collectively,
“Defendants”).  Plaintiffs allege that
they rented a property in Beverly Hills with a monthly rent of $12,500 from
Defendants.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
wrongfully entered the property on September 2, 2021, and changed the locks,
constituting an unlawful eviction. 
Defendants filed a cross-complaint alleging a cause of action for breach
of contract, trespass, intentional misrepresentation, and civil extortion.  Defendants allege that Plaintiffs stopped
making rental payments in December 2019, and then falsely claimed not to be
able to pay the rent due to the pandemic. 
 
 
            Defendant
Adler Ventures (“Defendant”) served Requests for Production (“RPD”) (Set Two)
upon Plaintiff on May 23, 2023, via email, meaning that the deadline was June
26, 2023.  Plaintiff’s counsel argues
that there was confusion over the deadline because Defendant’s counsel served
an amended proof of service dated June 5, 2023, via email, meaning that the
deadline was July 7, 2023, but Defendant’s counsel requested responses on or
before July 11, 2023, at 5:00 p.m., and filed this motion before the deadline,
on July 11, 2023, at 3:48 p.m.  
 
            Regardless
of whether the deadline was June 26 or July 7 or July 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel did not serve responses until September 20, 2023, which were attached
the opposition to the motion.  Therefore,
the motion is denied as moot, leaving only the issue of sanctions.  Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of
$1,667.60 against Plaintiff Steve Javidzad. 
The Court finds that the failure to comply with the discovery request
until after the motion was filed constitutes an abuse of the discovery process
warranting sanctions.  The Court finds
that the requested amount is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.  Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s
request for sanctions.
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court denies Defendant’s motion to
compel responses to RPD (Set Two) as moot.
 
            2.         The Court orders Plaintiff Steve
Javidzad to pay Defendant Adler Ventures, by and through counsel, sanctions in
the amount of $1,667.60 within thirty (30) days.
 
            3.         The Court advances Defendant’s motion
to compel further responses to form interrogatories from October 11, 2023, to
October 10, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.  
 
            4.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
