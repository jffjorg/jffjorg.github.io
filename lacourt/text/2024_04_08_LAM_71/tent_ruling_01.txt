          Plaintiff Delia M.
Ibarra, Trustee of the Ibarra Family Trust (“Ibarra”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed
for an order enforcing the settlement agreement between Plaintiff and
Defendants Alejandro Trinidad and Elsa Yanira Castillo (collectively, “Trinidad”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) that was entered into on May 18, 2023.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Background
          On February 21,
2019, Plaintiff filed her complaint against Defendants alleging six causes of
action: (1) quiet title (adverse possession); (2) prescriptive easement; (3)
breach of quiet enjoyment; (4) private nuisance (Civ. Code §1714); (5) negligence;
and (6) negligent infliction of emotional distress.
On or about May 1, 2019, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint
alleging six causes of action: (1) willful trespass; (2) negligent trespass;
(3) declaratory relief (C.C.P. §1060); (4) quiet title; (5) private nuisance;
and (6) negligence.  
On or about July 26, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulated
Settlement wherein Plaintiff agreed to purchase a lot line adjustment/easement
through which she would receive from Defendants the disputed parcel of land to
maintain at her sole cost and discretion in exchange for payment to Defendants
in the total sum of $45,000.  (Decl. of
Avakian ¶6.)
After retaining new counsel, on July 8, 2022, the parties filed a
stipulation with the Court to set aside the Stipulated Settlement and to
re-open the case, and that any and all discovery (including expert discovery)
and law and motion deadlines be reset consistent with a new trial date. The
stipulation included a provision permitting the parties to file amended
pleadings. The stipulation was adopted by the court on or about July 11, 2022.  (Decl. of Avakian ¶7.)
On November 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a verified Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) against Defendants alleging five causes of action: (1) nuisance;
(2) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (3) negligence; (4) equitable easement;
and (5) quiet title based on the Agreed Boundary Doctrine.
On January 11, 2023, Defendants filed a verified First Amended
Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”) against Plaintiff alleging six causes of action.
On January 12, 2023, Defendants filed a verified Answer to the
TAC. On March 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a verified Answer to the FAXC and
demand for jury trial. 
On May 18, 2023, the parties participated in a mediation with Hon.
Jaime R. Corral (Ret.) The parties reached a settlement and a detailed
“Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release” (“SAMR”) was executed by all parties
and their respective counsel of record.  (Decl.
of Avakian ¶11; Exh. A.)
Pursuant to the terms of the SAMR, Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendants
a total of $14,000.00, including $3,000.00 for a permanent easement that will
run with the land and be recorded with the Los Angeles County Clerk Recorder
for the disputed parcel of land and $11,000 for their loss of use and enjoyment
of the disputed parcel of land. Additionally, Plaintiff agreed to relocate a
portion of the metal and wood fence that is encroaching near the front of the
Trinidad Property. (Decl. of Avakian ¶12.)
According to the SAMR, counsel for Plaintiff agreed to prepare the
grant of permanent easement to be recorded with the County. All monies due to Defendants
are due to be paid within 30 days of the recording of the easement.
Additionally, Plaintiff was to begin relocation of the metal and wood fence also
within 30 days of the recording of the easement and said relocation is to be
completed by December 31, 2023.  (Decl.
of Avakian ¶13.)
On August 4, 2023, the proposed grant of permanent easement was
circulated to all counsel by Plaintiff’s counsel. After sending a follow up
email on August 23, 2023, on August 24, 2023, Defendants’ counsel provided
approval of the proposed easement with revisions. Said revisions were adopted by
all counsel for the parties and the final easement was circulated for signature
on September 25, 2023. (Decl. of Avakian ¶14, Exh. B.)
On September 29, 2023, and October 18, 2023, respectively, Plaintiff’s counsel followed up
with Defendants’ counsel to impress upon him that time was of the essence
because Plaintiff required sufficient time (approximately two months) to
relocate the metal and wood fence per the terms of the SAMR following the
recording of the easement. As of the filing of this motion, Plaintiff has not
heard back from Defendants.  (Decl. of Avakian
¶15, Exh. C.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on December 8, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
 
          Motion to Enforce Settlement
          C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as follows: “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”
Plaintiff submitted evidence
Plaintiff and Defendants entered into the SAMR, which was signed by both
parties on May 18, 2023.  (Decl. of Avakian ¶11,
Exh. A.)  Pursuant to the terms
of the SAMR, Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendants a total of $14,000.00, including
$3,000.00 for a permanent easement that will run with the land and be recorded
with the Los Angeles County Clerk Recorder for the disputed parcel of land and
$11,000 for their loss of use and enjoyment of the disputed parcel of land.  Additionally, Plaintiff agreed to relocate a
portion of the metal and wood fence that is encroaching near the front of the
Trinidad Property.  (Decl. of Avakian
¶12.)  The parties agreed the SAMR would be
enforceable in accordance with C.C.P. §664.6 and that the Court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce it.  (Decl. of Avakian ¶11,
Exh. A at §2.11.)  Plaintiff submitted
evidence Defendants have failed to execute the final agreed upon Grant of Permanent
Easement, which would allow Plaintiff to file the document with the Los Angeles
County Clerk Recorder.  (Decl. of Avakian
¶¶14-15, Exhs. B, C.)  
Plaintiff is entitled to an
order enforcing the SAMR and retains jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to
C.C.P. §664.6.  The Court orders
Defendants execute the final agreed upon Grant of Permanent Easement within 15
days of this ruling to allow Plaintiff to file the Grant of Easement with the
Los Angeles County Clerk Recorder. 
Further, the Court grants Plaintiff an extension of time of at least two
(2) months to relocate the front portion of metal and wood fence pursuant to
the terms of the SAMR. 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to enforce the SAMR is granted.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to
enforce the SAMR is granted.  
The Court orders Defendants execute
the final agreed upon Grant of Permanent Easement so Plaintiff within fifteen
days of this ruling.  The Court grants
Plaintiff an extension of time of at least two (2) months to relocate the front
portion of metal and wood fence pursuant to the terms of the SAMR.
Moving Party to give notice.
