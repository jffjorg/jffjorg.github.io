 Hearing Date:  April 8, 2024



 
Plaintiff Swamp Capital LLC’s unopposed
motion to compel arbitration is denied.
 
Plaintiff Swamp Capital LLC (“Swamp”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed
for an order compelling Defendants to arbitration on the basis Defendants are
bound by a written agreement to arbitrate the subject matter of the Complaint.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §1281.2.)  
 
Background
On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed its initial complaint against
Defendants H.O.T.N. Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”), H.O.T.N. Club, Inc. (“Club”),
Libra Hollywood, LLC (“Hollywood”), Libra Crenshaw, LLC (“Crenshaw”), Zaremy
Inc. (“Zaremy Inc.”), J. Mills, Inc.’s (“Mills
Inc.”), PMOrdonez Company (“PMO Co.”), BAU Inc. (“BAU Inc.”), John Greenwood
(“Greenwood”), Howard J. “Josh” Mills (“Mills”), Pedro Ordonez (“Ordonez”), and
Bradley Ulisky (“Ulisky”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging (1) breach of contracts; (2) fraud; (3) conversion; and
(4) appointment of a receiver.  Plaintiff
filed its operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) on December 21, 2023.
On November 28, 2023, this Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to
compel arbitration on the basis Plaintiff failed to meet its burden to prove
the existence of a valid arbitration agreement with Defendants.  (See 11/28/23 Minute Order, pg. 6.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on April 2, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
The Court denies Plaintiff’s motion on the basis the motion was filed
in violation of C.C.P. §1005(b), which states that “[u]nless otherwise ordered
or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served
and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. The moving and
supporting papers served shall be a copy of the papers filed or to be filed
with the court.”  (C.C.P. §1005(b),
emphasis added.)  Plaintiff’s motion was
filed on April 2, 2024, to be heard on April 8, 2024, less than 16 court days
before this hearing.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to compel arbitration is denied.  
Moving Party to
give notice.
