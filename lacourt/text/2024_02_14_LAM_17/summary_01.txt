Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Mansour Hashem's motion for reconsideration of the Court's October 18, 2023 Order. The Order partially granted Plaintiff Jacob Reich's request for an order of assignment, directing 40% of rents to Plaintiff. The Judge found that Defendant has not presented any new facts or law that would warrant reconsideration, nor has he presented any new evidence to corroborate his claims. The Judge specifically noted that Defendant failed to attach any corroborating evidence to support his claims, including his alleged payment of alimony, reduced income, and blocked sale of a property. The Judge also found that the Court did consider income that goes toward Defendant's maintenance of the properties when deciding to assign 40% of rental income. As a result, the Judge denied Defendant's motion for reconsideration.
