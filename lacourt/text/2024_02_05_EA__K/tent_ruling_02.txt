[1]              The instant petition (consisting of
the notice, memorandum of points and authorities and Declaration of Igor
Fradkin] was filed on August 17, 2023 (originally mail-served August 15, 2023
to Corina Weaver Carl Warren & Company, P.O. Box 116, Glendale, CA 91209
for County of Los Angeles [“County”], to 500 W. Temple St., Ste. 358, Los
Angeles, CA 90012 for County and to Government Claims Program Office of Risk
and Insurance Management, P.O. Box 989052 – Department of General Services,
West Sacramento, CA 95798-9052 for State of California [“State”]). On September
6, 2023, Petitioner filed a supporting declaration, which was mail-served to
the above addresses (and also to the City Clerk’s Office, 505 S. Garey Ave,
Pomona, CA 91766) on September 5, 2023. On September 15, 2023, Petitioner filed
a proof of service, which reflected personal service of the foregoing documents
on County on September 7, 2023 at 500 W. Temple St. Ste. 358, Los Angeles, CA
90012-3551. This appears to be the address of the Chief Executive Office for
County. On September 19, 2023, Petitioner filed a second proof of service,
which reflected personal service of the foregoing documents on the City Clerk’s
Office for the City of Pomona [“City”] on September 12, 2023. On September 25,
2023, Petitioner filed a third proof of service, which reflected personal
service of the foregoing documents on State on September 14, 2023.
 
On December 8, 2023, a “Notice of Hearing of Petition”
was filed, wherein the court scheduled a hearing on the instant petition for
February 5, 2024; notice was given to Petitioner’s counsel, who was ordered to
give notice of the hearing by serving a copy of said notice on all parties to
the action and to file a proof of service thereof. There is nothing on ecourt reflecting
that Petitioner provided notice of the February 5, 2024 hearing date to City,
County and State, although County has filed an opposition and State has filed a
Case Management Statement and a “Notice of Remote Appearance” for the instant
hearing date.

part, as follows: “Except as provided in Sections 946.4 and 946.6, no suit for
money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action
for which a claim is required to be presented . . . until a written claim
therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the
board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . ..”

The amount claimed if it totals less than ten thousand dollars . . .If the

be included in the claim. However, it shall indicate whether the claim would be
a limited civil case.”


[4]              County’s counsel Kevin J. Engelien
has attached Petitioner’s Declaration executed May 16, 2023 submitted
concurrently with Petitioner’s Late Claim for Damages as Exhibit A to his
accompanying declaration; said declaration states, in relevant part, that “It
was my, TRVEINO’s, understanding that claim forms must be submitted within six
months of the injury. . .” (Emphasis added).
