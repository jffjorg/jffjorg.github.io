Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a petition for relief from claims filing requirements. The petitioner, Ruby Trevino, alleges that she slipped and fell on liquid at the L.A. County Fair in Pomona on May 20, 2022, and seeks relief from the requirements of Government Code § 945.4. The petitioner claims that she mistakenly miscalendared the deadline for filing her claim and only retained counsel on January 9, 2023. However, the court finds that the petitioner has not shown that her failure to present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court determines that a reasonably prudent person would have taken steps to present the claim within the six-month deadline, and therefore denies the petition.
