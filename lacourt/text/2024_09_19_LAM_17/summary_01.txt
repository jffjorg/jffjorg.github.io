Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange's motion for summary judgment in this case. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Sandra Greene and Defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange over a claim for water damage to a roof. Plaintiff alleged that the damage was caused by a windstorm, while Defendant argued that there was no evidence to support this claim.

The Judge found that Defendant's investigation of the claim was reasonable and that there was no evidence to support Plaintiff's claim. The Judge noted that Plaintiff's roofer, David Glover, reported that the damage to the roof was caused by a windstorm, but that Defendant's investigation found no evidence of a windstorm-created opening to the roof. The Judge also found that Plaintiff did not allow Defendant to inspect the roof until after repairs were completed, which made it difficult for Defendant to investigate the claim.

The Judge concluded that Defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted because there was no triable issue of material fact and that Defendant's denial of the claim was reasonable. The Judge noted that Plaintiff had not submitted any evidence to support her claim and that Defendant's investigation was reasonable.
