And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving a foreclosure and a plaintiff who is alleging misrepresentations. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to identify the names of the people who made the alleged misrepresentations, which is a crucial piece of information. The judge cites a previous case, Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., which held that a plaintiff must identify the names of the people who made misrepresentations in loan documents. The judge also addresses defendants' argument that the plaintiff is judicially estopped from raising claims that were not raised in the plaintiff's bankruptcy action. The judge finds this argument unpersuasive, as the plaintiff's claim did not arise until after the bankruptcy discharge date.
