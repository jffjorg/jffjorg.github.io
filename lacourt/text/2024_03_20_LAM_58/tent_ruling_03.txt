[1]           The pleadings here go beyond mere
failure to allege who made the alleged misrepresentations. In the foreclosure
context, the court in Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 394 found that the “primary omission in the allegations is that
plaintiff does not identify the names of the people he spoke to nor their
authority to speak. In our view, this omission falls comfortably in the realm
of information that lies more in the possession of defendants.” (Id. at
403–404 [citing Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
230, 248 [“ ‘While the precise identities of the employees responsible ... are
not specified in the loan instrument, defendants possess the superior knowledge
of who was responsible for crafting these loan documents’ ”]].) 


[2]           Defendants also argue that Plaintiff
is judicially estopped from raising these claims which were not raised in
Plaintiff’s bankruptcy action. This argument is undeveloped as to any specific
cause of action and unpersuasive. Specifically, as argued in opposition, the
FAC does not demonstrate that Plaintiff’s claim had accrued or that he was
aware of the claims he held at the time of the bankruptcy discharge on January
28, 2022. (RJN Ex. 16.)
