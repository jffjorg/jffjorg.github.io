On November 17,
2022, Defendants Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company, as Trustee, On Behalf of the Holders of WAMU Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2005- AR11, and National Default Servicing Corporation (Defendants)
demurred to all causes of action in the FAC. Defendants also filed a motion to
strike. Plaintiff Robert Zuckerman (Plaintiff ) opposed the demurrer
and motion to strike. 
 
            The demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint is sustained in its entirety. The motion to strike is moot. 
 
            Defendants’ request for judicial
notice of Exhibits 1-22 is granted. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c), (d).)
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
Defendants
demur to the First Amended Complaint on the grounds that the pleadings are
barred by judicial estoppel, and Plaintiff has failed to state a claim.
 
First Cause
of Action for Wrongful Foreclosure:
 
            Defendants first argue that
Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for wrongful foreclosure because
Plaintiff has not adequately alleged tender.
            “The basic
elements of a tort cause of action for wrongful foreclosure track the elements
of an equitable cause of action to set aside a
foreclosure sale. They are: ‘(1) the trustee or mortgagee caused an
illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to
a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the
sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or
harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale,
the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was
excused from tendering.’” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 394, 408.)
“A valid
and viable tender of payment of the indebtedness owing is essential to an
action to cancel a voidable sale under a deed of trust.” (Karlsen v.
American Sav. & Loan Assn. (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 112, 117.) That is, the tender requirement applies to
“any cause of action for irregularity in the sale procedure,” including wrongful
foreclosure, quiet title, rescission, and declaratory relief. (Abdallah v.
United Savings Bank (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1101, 1109; see McElroy v.
Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 388, 394.) Moreover,
“[i]t is well settled in California that a mortgagor cannot quiet his title
against the mortgagee without paying the debt secured.” (Shimpones v.
Stickney (1934) 219 Cal. 637, 649; see Aguilar v. Bocci (1974) 39
Cal.App.3d 475, 477-478 [mortgagor “cannot clear his title without satisfying
his debt”].)
On or about
April 27, 2005, Plaintiff, executed a promissory note in the principal amount
of $1,400,000 (Note) and granted a Deed of Trust (Deed of Trust) in favor of
Washington Mutual Bank. (FAC ¶ 11.) The Note and Deed of Trust were eventually
assigned to Defendant Deutsche Bank, who became the Beneficiary under the Deed
of Trust. (FAC ¶ 12.) On November 15, 2017, a Notice of Default was recorded
against the Property. (FAC ¶ 13.)
The FAC
alleges that on March 16, 2022, Plaintiff authorized an attorney named Scott
Souder to negotiate on behalf of his client, Transcoast Financial, Inc., to
“purchase of the Note for cash to avoid foreclosure.” (FAC ¶ 25.)
            In support of his tender
allegations, Plaintiff relies on allegations that that this new potential
lender, Transcoast Financial, Inc., offered $50,000 to postpone the sale, (FAC
¶¶  2(c)(ix), 49) or that Plaintiff
“would have been ready, willing, and able” to tender the amount due (FAC ¶ 34).
 
            These allegations are insufficient to allege tender,
which requires unconditional offer to tender all amounts due by the borrower. (Arnolds
Mgmt. Corp. v. Eischen (1985) 158 Cal.App.3d 575, 580 (“[a] tender must be
one of full performance and must be unconditional to be valid”); Onofrio v.
Rice (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 413, 424 [the borrower must pay, or offer to
pay, the secured debt, or at least all of the delinquencies and costs due for
redemption, before commencing the action]; Mack v. Golino (1950) 95
Cal.App.2d 731, 735 [finding tender was not made where plaintiff alleged she
was “still ready, willing and able to perform said restitution”].)
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues he
is entitled to the benefit of the “unfairness” exception to the tender rule because
he was told the foreclosure sale was postponed.
It is true
that “a tender may not be required where it would be inequitable to impose such
a condition on the party challenging the sale.” (Lona v. Citibank, N.A.
(2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 89, 113.) For example, in Humboldt Savings Bank v.
McCleverty (1911) 161 Cal. 285, the defendant’s deceased husband borrowed
$55,300 from the plaintiff bank secured by two pieces of property. The
defendant had a $5,000 homestead on one of the properties. (Id. at p.
287.) When the defendant’s husband defaulted on the debt, the bank foreclosed
on both properties. In response to the bank’s argument that the defendant had
to tender the entire debt as a condition precedent to having the sale set
aside, the court held that it would be inequitable to require the defendant to
“pay, or offer to pay, a debt of $57,000, for which she is in no way liable” to
attack the sale of her $5,000 homestead. (Id. at p. 291.)
Plaintiff
further argues Defendants’ oral promise/representation to postpone the
foreclosure sale is both an enforceable promise and actionable. (FAC ¶¶ 27-28.)

 
Plaintiff’s
reliance on Defendants’ alleged promise of postponement fails to excuse the
tender requirement or otherwise constitute consideration or promissory/equitable
estoppel . 
 
            Specifically, in the foreclosure
context, courts have held “[a]s a general rule, a gratuitous oral promise to
postpone a foreclosure sale or to allow a borrower to delay monthly mortgage
payments is unenforceable.” (Garcia v. World Savings, FSB (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1031, 1039; Raedeke v. Gibraltar Sav. & Loan Ass’n.
(1974) 10 Cal.3d 665; Nguyen v. Calhoun (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 428,
438-440.) 
            Plaintiff’s opposition notes that in the cases cited by Defendant,
the courts found that the exception to this general rule applied. For example,
in Raedeke, the court determined that there was consideration arising
from “Plaintiffs’ alleged procurement of a responsible, prospective purchaser
at Gibraltar’s request would constitute good consideration for Gibraltar’s
promise, since such procurement was not originally part of the bargain between
plaintiffs and Gibraltar, and constituted both detriment to plaintiffs (through
the expenditure of time and energy negotiating with possible purchasers) and
benefit to Gibraltar (through the potential substitution of a solvent purchaser
in place of plaintiffs, rendering foreclosure unnecessary). Such detriment and
benefit each would constitute ‘good consideration for a promise’ in this
state.” (Raedeke v. Gibraltar Sav. &
Loan Assn., supra, 10 Cal.3d at 673.)
Here,
however, the FAC – in contrast to the allegations in Raedeke – does not
allege postponement based on any purported agreement from this new
alleged seller. (FAC ¶¶ 26-28.) In fact, the allegations, all based on
information and belief, are unclear as to which party the email offer was even
sent, and do not allege any acceptance of this offer by any party. (FAC ¶ 26.) 
 
Plaintiff
further claims that “just like in Raedeke and Nguyen, Plaintiff,
procured at his own expense and to his own detriment and for Defendants’
benefit, third party Transcoast Financial to serve as a “potential substitution
of a solvent purchaser in place of plaintiffs, rendering foreclosure
unnecessary.”” (Opp. 8:14-17.) However, the allegations do not show that the
detriment occurred in reliance by any promise by Defendants. Rather,
Plaintiff alleges he incurred this detriment and then Defendants allegedly
promised to postpone the sale. Plaintiff has also not alleged facts showing
promissory estoppel (Raedeke v. Gibraltar Sav. & Loan Assn., supra,
10 Cal.3d at p. 672, fn. 1 [“ ‘Under [the doctrine of promissory estoppel,] a
promisor is bound when he should reasonably expect a substantial change of
position, either by act or forbearance, in reliance on his promise, if
injustice can be avoided only by its enforcement. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]”].)
Finally,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not alleged “defendants caused an illegal,
fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of the property pursuant to a power of
sale in a mortgage or deed of trust.” (Chavez v. Indymac Mortgage Services
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1052, 1062.) That is, to the extent Plaintiff relies on
purported violations of the Homeowners Bill of Rights (HBOR), these allegations
cannot support an equitable claim overturning a foreclosure sale, as the only
remedy available for these statutory violations where the Property has sold is
damages. (See Civ. Code, § 2924.12(b) [“After a trustee's deed upon sale has
been recorded, a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or
authorized agent shall be liable to a borrower for actual economic damages…”];
see also Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872,
905 [stating, under the HBOR, “those facing foreclosure may seek an injunction,
while those who have lost their homes may seek treble actual damages or
statutory damages of $50,000.”].) Thus, these statutory violations cannot
support an equitable cause of action
to set aside a foreclosure sale.
            The demurrer to the first cause of
action is sustained. 
            
Second
Cause of Action for Violation of HBOR:
 
            In a shotgun approach, Plaintiff
alleges violations of Civil Code sections 2923.4, 2923.6 and 2924.11, 2923.55, 2924.9,
and 2924.10.
 
            Specifically, the second cause of
action in the FAC alleges:
 
“Defendants have violated the letter and purpose of various statutory
provisions of the “Homeowners Bill of Rights,” including but not limited to,
Cal. Civ. Code §§ 2923.4 (failure to “ensure that, as part of the nonjudicial
foreclosure process, borrowers are considered for, and have a meaningful
opportunity to obtain, available loss mitigation options, . . . such as loan
modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure”), 2923.6 and 2924.11
(failure to pause the foreclosure process while making loan modification
decision and providing adequate time and ability to appeal a denial of a loan
modification request), 2923.55 and 2924.9 (failure to properly and timely
notify Plaintiff of loss mitigation options), and 2924.10 (failure to timely
and adequately notify Plaintiff regarding status and deadlines for his loan
modification application).” (FAC ¶ 38.)
            As the demurrer argues, Plaintiff was required to plead specific
facts to support these statutory violations. (See Fisher v. San Pedro
Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604 [applying “the general
rule that facts in support of each of the requirements of a statute upon which
a cause of action is based must be specifically pled”].) 
            Here, Plaintiff does nothing more
than restate the statutory language itself. Further, the reply points to
specific defects in the pleadings as it relates to specific statutory violations
(Reply 5:11-8:11); while these arguments are well taken, the Court need not
rely on this level of analysis where the allegations are entirely conclusory. (FAC
¶¶ 2, 11-30.)
 
            The demurrer to the second cause of
action is sustained.
 
Fourth
Cause of Action for Fraud and the Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent
Misrepresentation:
The
elements of intentional misrepresentation “are (1) a misrepresentation, (2)
knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.” (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 217, 230–231.)
            On
demurrer, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s fraud allegations are insufficient
to state a claim and not pled with the request specificity.  
            Here,
the FAC alleges Plaintiff was orally informed that the trustee’s sale
would be postponed, and Plaintiff justifiably relied on this representation.
(FAC ¶¶ 47-53.)
As a
preliminary matter, the FAC does not even allege the conclusory elements of a
fraud cause of action and fails to allege any knowledge of falsity or intent to
deceive.  
Moreover,
the elements of fraud are not alleged with the requisite specificity. Generally, “[i]n California, fraud must be
pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) “This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, where, to whom, and by
what means” the alleged fraud occurred. (Id.) [1] The purpose of the particularity
requirement is to “separate meritorious and nonmeritorious cases, if possible
in advance of trial.” (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 184.) 
Plaintiff fails
to plead with specificity the element of detrimental reliance. For example, in Glaski
v. Bank of America (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079, the plaintiff alleged he
detrimentally relied on forged documents and lost his home as a result. (Id.
at p. 1091.) The court determined this allegation was “insufficient under the
rules of law that require fraud to be pled specifically” because it “is a
general allegation of reliance and damage. It does not identify the particular
acts [the plaintiff] took because of the alleged forgeries. Similarly, it does
not identify any acts that [the plaintiff] did not take because of his reliance
on the alleged forgeries.” (Ibid.)
The fraud
claim here fails for similar reasons. 
            Further, the negligent misrepresentation claim merely repeats
the allegations underlying the fraud cause of action. (FAC ¶¶ 56-60.) 
The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1) the defendant made a false
representation as to a past or existing material fact; (2) the defendant made
the representation without reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (3)
in making the representation, the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff;
(4) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (5) the
plaintiff suffered resulting damages. (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 792.) “Under California law, negligent
misrepresentation is a species of actual fraud and a form of deceit.” (Wong
v. Stoler (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1388.) 
Thus, the FAC’s
failure specifically to allege detrimental reliance also renders the negligent
misrepresentation claim deficient. Further, under both the fraud claim and the negligent
representation claim, there are no allegations showing resulting damages. That
is, “[t]o the extent plaintiff was damaged, it was by the foreclosure sale
itself, not by any representation about the sale being postponed.” (Majd v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1308.) 
The
demurrer to the causes of action based on misrepresentations is sustained.
Sixth Cause of Action
for Financial Elder Abuse:
The Elder
Abuse Act makes certain enhanced remedies available to a plaintiff who proves
abuse of a person who is an elder (age 65 or older) or dependent adult. (Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15610.27.) Financial abuse occurs when a person or entity
“[t]akes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property
of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or
both.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1).) Such a claim must be
alleged with particularity. (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.) In addition, the “plaintiff must demonstrate by
clear and convincing evidence that defendant is guilty of something more than
mere negligence; he or she must show reckless, oppressive, fraudulent, or
malicious conduct.” (Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 31.)
A taking is
for a “wrongful use” when a party “knew or should have known that [its] conduct
is likely to be harmful to the elder ... adult.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, §
15610.30, subd. (b).) “Undue influence consists: [¶] 1. In the use, by one in
whom a confidence is reposed by another, or who holds a real or apparent
authority over him, of such confidence or authority for the purpose of
obtaining an unfair advantage over him; [¶] 2. In taking an unfair advantage of
another's weakness of mind; or, [¶] 3. In taking a grossly oppressive and
unfair advantage of another's necessities or distress.” (Civ. Code, § 1575.)
            In Stebley v. Litton Loan Servicing, LLP
(2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 522, plaintiffs alleged that the lender violated Civil
Code section 2923.5 by filing a notice of default without fully and fairly
exploring alternatives to foreclosure. In ruling on the lender’s demurrer, the
court held that plaintiff’s allegation was insufficient to support a claim for
wrongful foreclosure and that, absent an allegation of wrongful foreclosure,
plaintiffs could not allege a cause of action for financial elder abuse. (Id.
at pp. 525–526, 528.) The court explained, “Plaintiffs correctly point out that
bad faith or intent to defraud is no longer required in elder or dependent
adult abuse cases. [Citation.] But they still must allege at least a ‘wrongful
use’ of property. [Citation.] As we held in an analogous case, ‘It is simply
not tortious for a commercial lender to lend money, take collateral, or to
foreclose on collateral when a debt is not paid.... [A] commercial lender is
privileged to pursue its own economic interests and may properly assert its
contractual rights.’ ” (Id. at pp. 527–528.) 
            For the reasons addressed in Stebley, the elder
abuse claim also fails: Plaintiff has failed to allege a taking for a wrongful
use where the claims underlying this cause of action – wrongful foreclosure and
fraud – also fail. 
            The
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is sustained.
Third Cause
of Action for Cancellation of Deed:
 
“To
prevail on a claim to cancel an instrument, a plaintiff must prove (1) the
instrument is void or voidable due to, for example, fraud; and (2) there is a
reasonable apprehension of serious injury including pecuniary loss or the
prejudicial alteration of one’s position.” (U.S. Bank National Assn. v.
Naifeh (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 767, 778.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s cancellation of deed claim is entirely derivative of the defective
wrongful foreclosure cause of action. (FAC ¶ 43 [“However, by virtue of their
wrongful foreclosure alleged above, Defendants’ claims are without any right
and Defendants do not have any right, title or interest in the Property.”].) 
Thus, this
claim fails for the same reasons as the wrongful foreclosure claim. The demurrer to this cause of action is
sustained.
Seventh Cause of Action for Unfair Business
Practices:
            
The UCL defines unfair competition
as “any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200.) A business practice need only satisfy one of the three
criteria—unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent—to be considered unfair competition. (McKell
v. Wash. Mut., Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1470-1471.) 
            Here, the FAC alleges a violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200 on the grounds that Defendants “engaged
in unfair business practices in violation of sections 17200, et seq. of the
California Business and Professions Code” “[b]y wrongfully foreclosing against
Plaintiff’s Property, as alleged above, in violation of provisions of the
Homeowners Bill of Rights (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 2923.4, 2923.55, 2924.9, 2924.10,
2923.6, and 2924.11) and financial elder abuse in violation of the Elder Abuse
and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§
15610.30 and 15657.5)[.]” (FAC ¶ 67.)
            This claim is entirely derivative of Plaintiff’s other
substantive causes of action, and thus “stand or fall depending on the fate of
the antecedent substantive causes of action.” (Krantz v. BT Visual Images
(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 164, 178; Aleksick v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 1176, 1185.) 
            The demurrer to the seventh cause of action is sustained.[2]

Legal Standard for Motion to
Strike
 
            “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) “Immaterial” or “irrelevant” matters
include allegations not essential to the claim, allegations neither pertinent
to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or a demand for judgment
requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3).)
 
Discussion
 
            Based on the ruling on the demurrer,
the motion to strike is moot.
 
Conclusion
 
            The Demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint is sustained in its entirety. The motion to strike is moot. Plaintiff
shall have leave to amend. An amended complaint shall be filed and served by April
22, 2024.
