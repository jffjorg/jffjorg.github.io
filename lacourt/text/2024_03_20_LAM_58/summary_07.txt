And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Attorney Jeremy Alberts to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Genesis Health Services Inc. dba Fountain Hospice. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the working relationship between Attorney Alberts and the client. The judge found that Attorney Alberts complied with the mandatory forms and rules of court, including providing adequate explanation for the withdrawal and confirming the service of notice to the client. The judge also found that no prejudice would result from granting the motion, as there is sufficient time before the trial date for the client to retain new counsel. Additionally, the judge rejected Plaintiff Yem's objection that she is entitled to Attorney Alberts' "file" as an owner and director of Genesis Health Services, as this has no bearing on the grounds for granting the motion.
