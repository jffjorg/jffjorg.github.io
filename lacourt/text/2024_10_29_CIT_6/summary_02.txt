And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua Liang against Plaintiff Yuzheng Chen. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not yet filed the Second Amended Complaint, and therefore, the Court is unable to review its allegations and determine whether it is subject to demurrer or motion to strike. As a result, the Court denies the demurrer and motion to strike without prejudice to refiling after the Plaintiff files the Second Amended Complaint. The Court orders the Plaintiff to file the Second Amended Complaint within 5 court days and the Defendants to give notice of the Court's ruling within 5 calendar days.
