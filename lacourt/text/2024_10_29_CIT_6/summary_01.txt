And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendants, Dean Edward Hines and the Estate of Lila Lee Hines. The plaintiff, David Guzman, is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $872,025.00, including damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment as to the Estate, and a judgment will be entered in favor of the Estate. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment as to Dean, but only to the extent of $5,000.00 in damages.

The judge's decision is based on several defects in the plaintiff's default judgment package, including the failure to check the box to request a court judgment, incomplete paragraphs in the requests for entry of default judgment, and excessive attorney fees. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's damages claim exceeds the amount requested in the complaint, and that the plaintiff has not provided evidence of having first attempted mediation or of the defendant's refusal to mediate. Finally, the judge notes that the plaintiff's prejudgment interest calculation is incomplete and that some of the documents submitted contain sensitive financial information that should have been redacted.
