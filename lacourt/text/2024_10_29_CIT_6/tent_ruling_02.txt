TENTATIVE
RULING           
The Court DENIES the demurrer and motion to strike without
prejudice to refiling after Plaintiff files the Second Amended Complaint with
the Court. 
Plaintiff is ordered to file with the Court the Second Amended
Complaint within 5 court days of this Order. 
            Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua
Liang are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar
days of this order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a breach of contract case. On October 6, 2023, plaintiff Yuzheng
Chen (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Longji Guan (Longji), Xiuhua
Liang (Xiuhua), Bingwei Guan, Yudan Li (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1
through 4, alleging one cause of action for breach of contract. 
On March 11, 2024, following the Court’s sustaining of Defendants
Guan and Li’s demurrer to the complaint, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint (FAC) against Defendants, alleging one cause of action for breach of
contract. On May 7, 2024, the Court sustained the demurrer of Defendants
Bingwei Guan and Yudan Li to the FAC without leave to amend and dismissed them
from this action with prejudice. On August 5, 2024, the Court sustained the
demurrer of Longji and Xiuhua to the FAC with 20 days’ leave to amend, and
denied the motion to strike as moot. 
On September 25, 2024, Longji and Xiuhua (collectively, Moving
Parties) demurred to and moved to strike the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). On
September 30, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the motions. 
LEGAL
STANDARD – Demurrer 
A
demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other
pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function
of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for
purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id., at pp. 993-994.) 
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) 
A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of
the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are
incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as
surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]) 
A
demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of
action, or affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd.
(a); Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong
v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046-1047.) 
DISCUSSION –
Demurrer 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a), Moving Parties were required to meet and confer before
bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds
Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (Hwang Decl., ¶¶ 3-12.) 
Analysis 
The Court notes that there is no SAC on file with the
Court, nor did Moving Parties provide a copy of the SAC with their moving
papers. Thus, the Court is unable to review the allegations of the SAC and
determine whether it is subject to demurrer.  

Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the demurrer without
prejudice to refiling after Plaintiff has filed the SAC with the Court.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD – Motion to Strike 
“Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may
serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this
time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in subdivision (e).”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).) “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any
pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.” (Id., § 436.) 
DISCUSSION
– Motion to Strike 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section
435.5, subdivision (a), Moving Parties were required to meet and confer telephonically
or in person before bringing this motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5,
subd. (a).) The Court finds Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and confer to be
sufficient. (Hwang Decl., ¶¶ 3-12.) 
Analysis 
For the same reasons set forth above regarding the demurrer, the
Court is unable to review the allegations of the SAC and determine whether it
is subject to a motion to strike. 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the motion to strike without
prejudice to refiling after Plaintiff files the SAC with the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the demurrer and motion to strike without
prejudice to refiling after Plaintiff files the Second Amended Complaint with
the Court. 
Plaintiff is ordered to file with the Court the Second Amended
Complaint within 5 court days of this Order. 
            Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua
Liang are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar
days of this order.
