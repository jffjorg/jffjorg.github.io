  Case Number:  22PSCV00471    Hearing Date:   October 29, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
David Guzman’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants: Dean Edward Hines, Estate of Lila Lee Hines 
TENTATIVE RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment is DENIED as to Defendant Estate and a judgment will be entered in
favor of Defendant Estate. Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is
DENIED without prejudice as to Defendant Dean subject to the limitation of
$5,000.00 in damages.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On May 17, 2022, plaintiff David Guzman (Plaintiff)
filed this action against defendants Dean Edward Hines (Dean), Estate of Lila
Lee Hines (Estate) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 50, alleging
causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied warranty of good
faith and fair dealing, intentional misrepresentation, and declaratory relief. On
September 26, 2023, default was entered against Defendant Dean. On November 16,
2023, default was entered against Defendant Estate. On August 30, 2024, after
the Court denied Plaintiff’s prior request for entry of default judgment
without prejudice, Plaintiff resubmitted the default judgment package. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $872,025.00,
including $720,000.00 in damages, $174,405.00 in interest, $7,500.00 in
attorney fees, and $525.00 in costs. The Court still finds multiple defects
with Plaintiff’s default judgment package. First, Plaintiff did not check the
box to request a court judgment and did not complete paragraph 2 on the
requests for entry of default judgment. (Requests for Entry of Default Judgment
(8/30/24), ¶ 2; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a).) Plaintiff also
did not complete the memorandum of costs on paragraph 7 of the requests for
entry of default judgment. (Requests for Entry of Default Judgment (8/30/24), ¶
7; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(4).) 
Second,
as previously stated, Plaintiff’s principal damage request still grossly exceeds
the amount requested in the complaint. “The purpose of [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 580 is to require the plaintiff to provide notice of the maximum amount
of the defendant's potential liability.” (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v.
Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1174.) Here, Plaintiff’s complaint seeks
damages in an amount in excess of the unlimited jurisdiction, which in 2022 was
$25,000.01. However, rather than giving defendants notice of their maximum
liability, Plaintiff’s complaint instead purports to provide notice of their
minimum liability. Other than stating that damages will be at least $25,000.00,
the prior minimum jurisdictional limit for an unlimited civil case, Defendants
have no better notice than pleadings which seek “damages according to proof,”
which is what Plaintiff prays for here. (Id.; see Becker v. S.P.V.
Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494; Compl., p. 11, ln. 26.) The complaint
otherwise only mentions Plaintiff having paid a deposit of $5,000.00. (Compl.,
¶ 14, 26.) Indeed,
nothing in the complaint would give Defendants any reason to suspect that a
default judgment could be entered for damages of $720,000.00. Thus, the ceiling on Plaintiff’s
damages claim as presently alleged is apparently $5,000.00. “[A] prayer for damages according to
proof passes muster under section 580 only if a specific amount of damages
is alleged in the body of the complaint. [Citation.]” (Becker v. S.P.V. Constr. Co., supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 494,
italics added.) The other deposit of $88,973.05 is not alleged in the complaint,
so the Court cannot award it. (See generally, Compl.; Guzman Decl., ¶ 3, Ex.
B.) 
Third, Plaintiff
still has not provided the basis for recovery of attorney fees. The subject
contract appears to predicate recovery of attorney fees on the parties having
first attempted mediation. (Compl., Ex. A, ¶ 22, subd. (A), ¶ 25.) Plaintiff has
not provided any evidence of having first attempted mediation before bringing
this lawsuit or of Defendants’ refusal to mediate after a request has been made,
nor does the complaint allege any such facts. Also, given the damage
calculation issues noted above, the Court finds the amount of attorney fees
requested to be excessive. (See Local Rule 3.214; Guzman Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Fourth,
Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation does not provide the per diem
rate, the date of the breach from which it was calculated, or the last date of
the calculation. (Guzman Decl., ¶ 10; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd.
(a)(3).) 
Fifth,
the Court also notes that the documents Plaintiff submitted contain sensitive
financial information that should have been redacted per Rule 1.201 of the
California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.201; Guzman Decl., Ex.
B.) 
Finally,
Plaintiff has not presented any evidence establishing that Defendant Estate is
liable to Plaintiff under the subject contract, as Defendant Dean is the only
one to sign the contract. (Compl., Ex. A.)           
CONCLUSION           
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED as to Defendant Estate and a
judgment will be entered in favor of Defendant Estate. Plaintiff’s request for entry
of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice as to Defendant Dean subject to
the limitation of $5,000.00 in damages.
