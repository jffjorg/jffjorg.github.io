And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel compliance with the plaintiff's discovery requests, specifically Request for Production, Set Two. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to produce the requested documents, including medical records, despite repeated requests and assurances of compliance. The court concludes that the plaintiff's failure to produce the documents is a misuse of the discovery process and has prejudiced the defendant's ability to prepare for trial.

The court has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations has caused unnecessary delay and prejudice, and the requested sanctions are reasonable given the circumstances. The court orders the plaintiff to comply with the discovery order and pay the sanctions within 20 days of the ruling.
