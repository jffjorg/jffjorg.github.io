  Case Number:  23AHCV00396    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE FOR REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION – SET TWO
and GRANTING MONETARY SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
            This is a
sexual assault action brought by Plaintiff Jane Doe 8004 (“Plaintiff”) against
Defendant Ron Thorn (“Defendant”). On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed this
action asserting claims for (1) Sexual Assault, (2) Sexual Battery, and (3) Gender
Violence. Defendant filed an answer to the complaint on September 15, 2023.
 
On November 5, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion to compel compliance for Request for Production - Set Two,
arguing that Plaintiff failed to provide adequate responses to discovery
requests. On November 27, 2024, Defendant filed a reply, emphasizing
Plaintiff’s failure to oppose the motion. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.320 provides in relevant part, “If a party filing a response to a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling…thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.320(a).)   
            The
court shall impose a monetary against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.320(b).)   
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a), “[t]he court may
impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of
this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under Section
2023.010, an example of the misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”
 
            III.      DISCUSSION
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff
to comply with Requests for Production, Set Two, or, alternatively, seeks
evidentiary sanctions. Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in the amount
of $5,983.34.
 
Defendant asserts that the
requested documents, which include Plaintiff’s medical records, are essential
to evaluate her claims of emotional distress and physical injury. Plaintiff
placed her medical condition at issue by alleging emotional distress in her
complaint and identifying relevant medical providers in responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Despite multiple extensions and assurances, Plaintiff
has failed to produce the requested documents, prejudicing Defendant’s ability
to prepare for trial. (Motion, pp. 2-4; Gutierrez Decl., ¶¶ 2-9.)
Defendant initially served Requests
for Production (RFP), Set Two, on May 17, 2024. Plaintiff’s initial responses,
served on July 10, 2024, included partial document production. Defendant’s
counsel met and conferred regarding deficiencies, and Plaintiff’s former
counsel agreed to supplement the responses by August 18, 2024. On August 16,
2024, Plaintiff served supplemental responses, stating that additional records
had been requested from the hospitals and would be provided upon receipt.
However, no additional documents have been produced to date. (Gutierrez Decl.,
¶¶ 6-9; Exs. D-F.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
delays continued despite multiple extensions and accommodations. Plaintiff’s
document production deadline was October 30, 2024, following her counsel’s
substitution. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s failure to produce the
documents reflects bad faith and constitutes misuse of the discovery process.
(Motion, pp. 5-7; Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 9.)
The Court finds that Defendant has
demonstrated good cause to compel Plaintiff’s compliance with Request for
Production, Set Two. The Court concludes that Plaintiff must comply with the
production of documents. 
However, while the Court grants the
motion to compel compliance, the request for evidentiary sanctions is DENIED.
The Court finds that evidentiary sanctions are unwarranted at this time.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion
to compel compliance with RFP Set Two. 
Monetary Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030(a) provides that:
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one
unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the
discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.
If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court
shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”
Defendant requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $5,983.34 for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with
discovery obligations. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff failed to produce
documents despite repeated requests and assurances of compliance, characterizing
Plaintiff’s actions as a stalling tactic designed to hinder Defendant’s ability
to adequately prepare for trial and conduct necessary discovery. Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s conduct demonstrates a blatant disregard for the
discovery statutes, causing unnecessary delay and prejudice. (Motion, pp. 6-7.)
Defendant seeks sanctions totaling
$5,983.34, consisting of $5,890.00 in attorney’s fees and $93.34 in costs.
Defendant’s counsel declares that the requested fees are based on 9.67 hours
spent on the meet-and-confer process, 7.89 hours drafting the motion, 4.0 hours
anticipated for preparing a reply and reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition, and 2.0
hours for attending the hearing. Defendant clarifies that sanctions are sought
solely against Plaintiff, as the failure to respond appears to rest entirely
with Plaintiff and not Plaintiff’s prior counsel. (Motion, p. 7; Gutierrez
Decl.¶¶ 10-14)
The Court agrees that Plaintiff’s
failure to comply with discovery obligations constitutes a misuse of the
discovery process under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.
However, the Court finds that the total sanctions requested by Defendant are
excessive, particularly given Plaintiff’s failure to file an opposition.
The Court finds that an hourly rate
of $250 is reasonable but adjusts the time allocations for Defendant’s counsel
to reflect the procedural posture of the case. The Court grants 2.0 hours for
meet-and-confer efforts, 1.5 hours for drafting the motion, and 1.0 hour for
attending the hearing, resulting in an award of $1,125. 
Accordingly, the Court grants
Defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel compliance and further GRANTS
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00.
Plaintiff is to comply with this
discovery order and pay sanctions within 20 days of this ruling. 
Defendant is to give notice.
