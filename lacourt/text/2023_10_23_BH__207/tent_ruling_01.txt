MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Tent
123 (“Plaintiff”) filed an unlawful detainer complaint on October 4, 2022.  Defendant Fethi Sahman (“Defendant”) vacated
the premises in December 2022.  
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for leave to file a first amended complaint for damages only.  Defendant has not opposed the motion for
leave to amend.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Amendments to Pleadings: General Provisions
 
            Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any
party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”
 
            To wit,
without notice to the other party the Court has wide discretion to allow either
party (i) to add or strike the name of a party or (ii) to correct a mistake in
the name of a party or a mistake in any other respect “in furtherance of
justice” and “on any terms as may be proper.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1); see also Marriage of Liss (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1429.) Alternatively, after notice to the other party, the Court has wide
discretion to allow either party to amend pleadings “upon any terms as may be
just.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1). Similarly, Code of
Civil Procedure section 576 states “Any judge, at any time before or after
commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as
may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference
order.”
 
            Judicial
policy favors resolution of all disputed matters between the parties and,
therefore, leave to amend is liberally granted. (Berman vs. Bromberg
(1986) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945; Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489 [this has been an established policy in California
since 1901] (citing Frost v. Whitter (1901) 132 Cal. 421, 424; Thomas
v. Bruza (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 150, 155).) The Court of Appeal in Morgan
v. Superior Court held “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting
of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v.
Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530, citations omitted.)
Moreover, “it is an abuse of discretion for the court to deny leave to amend
where the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [opposing
party did not establish harm by the delay in moving to amend the complaint].)
 
            “The court
may grant leave to amend the pleadings at any stage of the action.” (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023)
¶ 6:636 (hereafter Weil & Brown).) Denial of a motion to amend is rarely
justified if the motion is timely made and granting the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party. (Id. at ¶ 6:639, citations omitted.)
However, if the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay
has prejudiced the opposing party, the judge has discretion to deny leave to
amend. (Id. at ¶ 6:655, citations omitted. Absent prejudice, any claimed
delay alone is not grounds for denial. “If the delay in seeking the amendment
has not misled or prejudiced the other side, the liberal policy of allowing
amendments prevails. Indeed, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave in such
a case even if sought as late as the time of trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:653
(citing Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565).)
“Prejudice exists where the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along
with loss of critical evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of
discovery, etc. . . . But the fact that the amendment involves a change in
legal theory which would make admissible evidence damaging to the opposing
party is not the kind of prejudice the court will consider.” (Weil &
Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:656, citations omitted.)
 
            “Even if
some prejudice is shown, the judge may still permit the amendment but impose
conditions, as the Court is authorized to grant leave ‘on such terms as may be
proper.’” (Weil & Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:663, citation
omitted.) For example, the court may cause the party seeking the amendment to
pay the costs and fees incurred in preparing for trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:664
(citing Fuller v. Vista Del Arroyo Hotel, 42 Cal.App.2d 400, 404).)
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324: Procedural
Requirements
 
            Pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading before
trial must:
 
“(1) Include a
copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleadings, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and
(3) State what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are
located.”
 
            In
addition, under Rule 3.1324(b), a motion to amend a pleading before trial must
be accompanied by a separate declaration that specifies the following:
 
“(1) the effect
of the amendment;
(2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) when the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
(4) the reasons
why the request for amendment was not made earlier.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Here, the
Court finds that Plaintiff’s motion fails to comply with Rule 3.1324(b).  Plaintiff has not provided any declaration in
support of the motion.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Therefore,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend without prejudice for
failure to comply with Rule 3.1324(b).
 
            The Court
orders Plaintiff to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of
service of such.
