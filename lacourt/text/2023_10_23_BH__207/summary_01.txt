And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint for damages only. The motion was filed without opposition from Defendant, but the judge denied the motion because Plaintiff failed to provide a declaration in support of the motion, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b). The judge notes that the Court has wide discretion to allow a party to amend a pleading, and that denial of a motion to amend is rarely justified if the motion is timely made and granting the motion will not prejudice the opposing party. However, in this case, the Court finds that Plaintiff's motion fails to comply with the procedural requirements, and therefore denies the motion without prejudice.
