And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add new defendants and causes of action, but the proposed amendments are improper because they seek to revive causes of action that have been stricken and/or dismissed with prejudice. The court has previously granted leave to amend the complaint to revive certain claims, but the proposed amendments exceed the scope of that grant. The court will not grant leave to amend the complaint to add new unspecified defendants and causes of action on the eve of trial, as this would prejudice the defendants.
