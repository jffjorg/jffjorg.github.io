And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application by the Defendant, Immaculate Roofing Company, Inc., to continue the trial date and all related dates due to extraordinary circumstances. The Defendant's counsel contracted COVID-19 and his spouse contracted COVID-19 and suffered a heart attack, making it impossible for him to prepare for trial. The Court has granted the application and reset the deadline for the case to proceed to trial to December 29, 2025. The Court has also set new dates for a final status conference and trial, and has adjusted the discovery and motions deadlines accordingly. The Defendant's counsel is required to provide notice and file proof of the new dates with the Court.
