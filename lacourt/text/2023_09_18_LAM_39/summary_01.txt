And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial date and all related dates. The defendant's counsel had previously scheduled a deposition for August 17, 2023, but it was rescheduled due to the plaintiff's counsel's unavailability. However, the defendant's counsel then contracted COVID-19, and his spouse contracted COVID-19 and suffered a heart attack, making it impossible for him to be available for trial. The judge finds that these circumstances constitute good cause for granting the defendant's application. The judge sets a new trial date for May 21, 2024, and re-sets the deadline for the case to proceed to trial for December 29, 2025. The judge also orders that the discovery and motions deadlines be adjusted based on the new trial date.

English Text Summary:

The judge granted the Defendant's request to postpone the trial.  The Defendant's lawyer had requested a delay due to a series of unfortunate events: the lawyer contracted COVID-19, and shortly after, their spouse contracted COVID-19 and suffered a heart attack. The judge found these circumstances to be "good cause" for a continuance. The original trial date and related deadlines are vacated. The new trial date is set for May 21, 2024, with a Final Status Conference on May 10, 2024. The five-year deadline to bring the case to trial is recalculated to December 29, 2025, accounting for the time the case was in default. Some discovery deadlines will remain tied to the old trial date, while others (depositions of parties, expert designation, and expert discovery) will be based on the new trial date. An Order to Show Cause regarding sanctions was discharged.
