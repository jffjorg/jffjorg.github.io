v. Immaculate Roofing Company, Inc.
Case No.
19STCV20880
Order Re-Setting
Five Year Date
Defendant’s Ex Parte
Application to Continue Trial Date and all Related Dates
 
            Plaintiff Juan
Carlos Chavez (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment action against Immaculate
Roofing Company, Inc. (“Defendant”) on June 14, 2019.  Default was entered on September 3, 2019, and
a default judgment was entered on February 7, 2020.  The Court (Murphy, J.) granted a motion to
set aside the default/default judgment on March 19, 2021.  The time period of September 3, 2019, to
March 19, 2021—which is 563 days—shall be excluded from the five-year deadline,
per Code of Civil Procedure section 583.240. 
Therefore, the deadline for this case to proceed to trial is December 29,
2025.  Defendant’s counsel stipulated
to this deadline in open court.  
 
            Defendant’s
counsel noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for August 17, 2023.  (Declaration of S. Marin Keleti, ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel then informed him that
she was not available and suggested that the deposition be rescheduled to a
date between August 28 through August 30, 2023. 
(Id., ¶ 4 & Exh. #2.) 
Defendant’s counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel to reschedule the deposition
but never received a response to multiple voicemail messages.  (Id., ¶ 5.)  Then, on September 7, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel contracted COVID-19.  (Id., ¶ 9.)  Three days later, on September 10, 2023,
Defendant’s counsel’s spouse contracted COVID-19 and suffered a heart
attack.  (Ibid.)  Defendants’ counsel has been caring for his spouse:
“Remotely coordinating with doctors, nurses, and hospital support staff, and reporting
on progress to family has taken up many of my waking hours, and my preoccupation
with my spouse’s condition has wreaked havoc on my ability to be productive.”  (Ibid.) 
It is clear that Defendant’s counsel will not be available for trial on the
current trial date through no fault of his own. 
These circumstances constitute good cause to grant Defendant’s ex parte
application.    
 
            Based upon the
foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Defendant’s ex parte application to continue
the trial date and all related dates is granted.
 
            2.         The Court discharges the Order to Show
Cause re: Sanctions.
 
            3.         The Court advances and vacates all
dates.
 
            4.         The Court re-sets the deadline for this
case to proceed to trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 is December
29, 2025.  
 
            5.         The Court sets the following dates,
which are the first available dates:
 
                        Final
Status Conference:                    May
10, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
                        Trial:                                                   May 21, 2024, at 9:30
a.m.  
 
The discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the former
trial date (October 3, 2023) except for the following, which shall be based on the
new trial date: (1) Depositions of the parties, (2) Expert designation
deadlines, and (3) Expert discovery.  
 
            6.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide notice
and file proof of such with the Court.
