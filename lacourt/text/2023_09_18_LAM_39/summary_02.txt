The court denies the motion with respect to the first cause of action for breach of contract, but grants it with respect to the second cause of action for conversion. The court finds that the fee splitting agreement between Yates and Vartazarian incorporates the agreement between Plaintiff and Yates by reference, and therefore Vartazarian is bound by the terms and conditions of the underlying agreement. The court also finds that the simple failure to pay money owed does not constitute conversion, and therefore grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the second cause of action. The court denies leave to amend, as it is clear that no amendment would be successful.

## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Defendants in a lawsuit brought by Plaintiff Marvin Kay. 

The Court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding Plaintiff's breach of contract claim. This claim stems from an agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Gregory A. Yates for Yates to handle a personal injury case and split the attorney fees. The Court finds that Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that Defendants, including Yates' practice and Steve Vartazarian, are bound by the terms of this agreement. 

However, the Court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding Plaintiff's conversion claim. The Court states that simply failing to pay money owed does not constitute conversion, and Plaintiff's claim is essentially an attempt to seek additional damages on a breach of contract claim.

**Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Kay is ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the case of Marvin Kay v. Gregory A. Yates, et al. The case involves a dispute over attorney's fees from a settled personal injury case (Miramontes v. UPS) that was originally handled by attorney Edward Steinrecher.  After Steinrecher's death, Marvin Kay, as the administrator of Steinrecher's practice, entered into an agreement with Gregory Yates to handle the case, with Kay to receive a portion of the fees. Yates later brought in Steve Vartazarian.  Kay alleges he wasn't paid the agreed-upon fees after the Miramontes case settled and is suing for breach of contract and conversion.

The Judge denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the breach of contract claim, finding that the alter ego allegations are sufficient to assert the claim against Yates and his practice, and that the interpretation of the fee splitting agreement requires further evidence. However, the Judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the conversion claim, stating that a simple failure to pay money owed is not conversion and denies leave to amend. The Judge believes the conversion claim is an attempt to seek treble damages and attorney's fees on a breach of contract claim.

  - "This cause of action is nothing more than an obvious attempt to seek treble damages and attorney’s fees on a breach of contract claim."

summary: |
  The judge's tentative ruling partially grants and partially denies the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The breach of contract claim (first cause of action) against Yates and his practice survives, with the judge finding the alter ego allegation sufficient and indicating that the interpretation of the fee-splitting agreement involving Vartazarian might require extrinsic evidence, making it suitable for summary judgment, not dismissal at this stage.  However, the conversion claim (second cause of action) is dismissed without leave to amend, as the judge finds it to be merely a restatement of the breach of contract claim, and California law doesn't generally allow conversion claims for simple failure to pay a debt. The judge vacated a future conference.  The Defendants' attorney is ordered to provide notice of the ruling.
