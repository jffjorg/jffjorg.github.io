And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendants Gregory A. Yates, et al. and has issued a tentative ruling. The court denies the motion with respect to the first cause of action for breach of contract, but grants it with respect to the second cause of action for conversion. The court finds that the fee splitting agreement between Yates and Vartazarian incorporates the agreement between Plaintiff and Yates by reference, and therefore Vartazarian is bound by the terms and conditions of the underlying agreement. The court also finds that the simple failure to pay money owed does not constitute conversion, and therefore grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the second cause of action. The court denies leave to amend, as it is clear that no amendment would be successful.
