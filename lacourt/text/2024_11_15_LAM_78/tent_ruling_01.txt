  Case Number:  23STCV26029    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ LORILEE HOUSE, et al., Plaintiff(s), vs. WILSHIRE LAW FIRM, PLC, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 23STCV26029 Hearing Date: November 15, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO WAIVE ARBITRATION FEES and COSTS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE LIFT ARBITRATION STAY  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Lorilee House and Harold House (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this professional malpractice action against defendants Wilshire Law Firm, PLC and Bobby Babak Saadian (collectively, “Defendants”) for (1) legal malpractice, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) fraud. On December 29, 2023, the court granted Defendants’ motion to compel this matter to arbitration and to stay the action. On June 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking an order relieving Plaintiffs from payment of arbitration fees and costs and directing Defendants to pay the full arbitration fees, or in the alternative lifting the stay. On October 31, 2024, at the Evidentiary Hearing 402 EC and Order to Show Cause Re: Hearing on Plaintiffs’ Ability to Pay Arbitrator Fees, the Court allowed Plaintiffs to file a supplemental declaration by November 8, 2024, with no other additional briefing permitted. On November 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their supplemental declaration in support of their motion.  II. LEGAL STANDARD California has a long-standing policy of ensuring access to the justice system to address grievances, without regard to financial means. (Weiler v. Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Services, Inc. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 970, 978 [232 Cal.Rptr.3d 155, 161, 22 Cal.App.5th 970, 978].) This policy supports the courts’ power to consider the financial situation of a party to determine if bearing arbitration costs would result in that party effectively being deprived of any forum to resolve their claims. (Ibid.) “If sufficient evidence is presented on these issues, and the court concludes the party's financial status is not a result of the party's intentional attempt to avoid arbitration, the court may issue an order specifying: (1) the arbitration shall continue so long as the other party to the arbitration agrees to pay, or the arbitrator orders it to pay, all fees and costs of the arbitration; and (2) if neither of those occur, the arbitration shall be deemed ‘had’ and the case may proceed in the superior court.” (Weiler v. Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Services, Inc., supra, 22 Cal.App.5th at p. 981.)  III. DISCUSSION On September 3, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to lift the stay for the limited purpose of the Court conducting an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ ability to pay the arbitrator fees. Based on the representations made at the Evidentiary Hearing 402 EC and Order to Show Cause Re: Hearing on Plaintiffs’ Ability to Pay Arbitrator Fees on October 16, 2024 and October 31, 2024 regarding Plaintiffs’ hospitalization, the Court requested supplemental declarations to rule on the motion. Previously, the Court examined Roldan v. Callahan & Blaine (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 87, in addition to other cases regarding the supporting evidence necessary to demonstrate indigency, such as Aronow v. Superior Court (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 865, 885 [“[T]he trial court has discretion to decide [plaintiff]'s ability to pay arbitration fees and can do so upon declarations with supporting exhibits or after conducting an evidentiary hearing.”] and Hang v. RG Legacy I, LLC (2023) 88 Cal. App. 5th 1243, 1255 [court found sufficient a declaration that a plaintiff was unable to pay the arbitration fees and was ‘penniless’ was supported by a letter from the Social Security Administration, recent statements demonstrating the balance of the trust accounts, and a declaration that the plaintiff had no other assets or property]. The Court previously found that Plaintiffs’ initial declarations were insufficient due to the general assertions and lack of evidence. (Min. Order, Sept. 3, 2024.) Plaintiffs’ supplemental declarations now provide they have a combined Social Security and Pension income of $3,336.16 per month (Lorilee & Harold Decls. ¶ 7). Plaintiffs also provide copies of ACH deposits from SAG-AFTRA Federal Credit Union indicating a pension income of around $3,526.16 per month from August 2024 to October 2024 (Lorilee & Harold Decls. ¶ 8; Exh. 1), a letter from Social Security Administration providing that Lorilee’s social security benefit payment is $2,220.00 per month and that Harold’s is $930.00 per month beginning December 2023 (Lorilee & Harold Decls. ¶ 8; Exh. 1), and letter from their doctor regarding Lorilee’s mental issues to be excused from court hearings for six months (Lorilee & Harold Decls. ¶ 9; Exh. 2). Defendants did not oppose the motion. The Court will grant the motion. At the prior hearings on this matter, Defendants’ counsel indicated that Defendants would agree to pay Plaintiffs’ share of the arbitration costs. Pursuant to this representation, the arbitration shall continue so long as the Defendants agree to pay.  IV. CONCLUSION Plaintiffs’ motion to be relieved from payment of arbitration fees and costs and directing Defendants to pay the full arbitration fees is GRANTED.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: November 14, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
