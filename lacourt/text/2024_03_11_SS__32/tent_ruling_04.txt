TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


March
  11, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV05598




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Deem Matters Admitted




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Yaelin Estrada 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Yaelin Estrada
(Defendant) moves to deem admitted matters in the Requests for Admissions, Set One
served on Plaintiff Isaac Garcia Contreras (Plaintiff). No opposition has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond
waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief
from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The
Discovery Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of
service of a proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section
2033.220. The courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual
compliance with all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not
to be given the stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in
substantial compliance. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Additionally, RFA responses must be examined in their
entirety. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.) 
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿
However, objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant asserts that she served Requests for Admissions, Set One
on Plaintiff’s then-counsel on June 7, 2023. (Collins Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) On
June 27, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s attorney’s motion to be relieved
as counsel. Plaintiff is currently self-represented. Notice of this motion was
mailed to the address indicated on the order to relieve counsel. As of the date
of filing this motion, no responses have been served. (Id. ¶ 18.) Since no
responses have been served and Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, the
motion to deem admitted is granted. 
 
Defendant does
not request monetary sanctions, however, since sanctions are
mandatory, the Court awards $60 to Defendant for the cost of filing this
motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Deem Matters Admitted in Request
for Admissions, Set One, is GRANTED. 
 
The Court further orders monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Isaac
Garcia Contreras in the amount of $60. Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to
counsel for Defendant within 30 days of the date of this order.
 
Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
