(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390)
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390)
