And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem matters admitted in the requests for admission, set one, served on the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admission, and the defendant did not request monetary sanctions. However, the court awarded the defendant $60 for the cost of filing the motion as monetary sanctions are mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280. The judge ordered the plaintiff to pay the monetary sanctions to the defendant's counsel within 30 days of the date of the order.
