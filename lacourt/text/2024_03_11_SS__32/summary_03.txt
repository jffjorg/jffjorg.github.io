And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel production of an incident report. The report was created by the defendant's employee, Alex Torres, in response to a fall allegedly caused by the defendant's employees. The defendant claims that the report is protected by the attorney-client privilege, as it was created for the purpose of providing information to the defendant's attorneys for potential litigation. The report was transmitted to the defendant's insurance company, Argo Group US, which then transmitted it to attorneys for defense of a potential lawsuit. The judge finds that the defendant has shown that the dominant purpose for creating the report was to provide to attorneys for defense of a potential lawsuit, and therefore the attorney-client privilege applies. The judge declines to address the plaintiff's arguments surrounding the work product doctrine or the defendant's argument that the plaintiff waived her right to make this motion by failing to meet and confer on the December 16, 2022 privilege log.
