And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Jameelah Budhan's counsel, Lauren A. Landau, to withdraw as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the judge orders counsel to file an updated proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing that includes information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party. Counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service of such. The judge conditionally grants the motion pending counsel's filing and service of the updated form.
