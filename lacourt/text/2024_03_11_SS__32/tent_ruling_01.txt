RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


March
  11, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV35034




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Joshua Messler




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Joshua Messler (“Plaintiff”) moves for terminating sanctions
against Defendants Ara Karapetian and Narine Petrossian (“Defendants”) for
failure to comply with the Court’s November 21, 2023 discovery order. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions
imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and
for violating various discovery statutes].) 

 
DISCUSSION
 
In this case, default judgment was initially entered against
Defendants Gor Karapetian, Ara Karapetian, and Narine Karapetian on March 9,
2022. Then, the Court granted Defendants Ara Karapetian and Narine Petrossian’s
(“Defendants”) motion to set aside the default judgment. (Min. Order, 4/12/23.)
Defendants filed their answer on June 27, 2023. 
 
On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendants with Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production, Set One. On November 21, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’
counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel. Defendants have not appeared with
new counsel and therefore remain self-represented. 
 
On November 21, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s unopposed motion
to compel Defendants’ late discovery responses. Defendants did not appear at
the hearing. The Court ordered Defendants to provide verified responses,
without objection, within 30 days and imposed monetary sanctions. (Min. Order,
11/21/23.) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendants have not served any responses, in
violation of the Court’s discovery order. (Beckerman Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
The Court finds that Defendants have not complied with the November
21, 2023 order. Prior to the Court relieving counsel, Defendants failed to
maintain contact with their counsel.[1]
After the Court relieved counsel, Defendants have made no contact with the
Court and have not participated in the case in any way. Notice of this motion
was mailed to the address provided in the order relieving Defendants’ counsel.  Accordingly, the Court grants the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. Defendants’
answer, filed on June 27, 2023 is stricken and the default judgment entered on
March 9, 2022, is reinstated. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
