And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was set for July 10, 2024. The trial will now be held on October 8, 2024. The motion was granted based on the Defendant's showing of good cause, specifically the need for additional discovery, including the subpoenaing of medical records and independent medical examination. The judge considered various factors, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The judge concluded that the interests of justice are best served by granting the continuance, allowing the parties to complete the necessary discovery.
