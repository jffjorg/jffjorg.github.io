Background
On March 1 2022, Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Adam Derek Espinoza, Isaias Ortega, and Does 1 through 10
for subrogation recovery.  Defendant Isaias Ortega (“Defendant”)
filed his answer on June 24, 2022.
 
On February 16, 2023, Plaintiff served by mail Form
Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant Isaias Ortega (“Defendant”). Plaintiff
has yet to receive responses.
 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set 1) served on Defendant.  
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even
if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and] substantially
resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses … the trial court
retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On February 16, 2023, served by mail Form Interrogatories (Set
One) on Defendant. (Tapper Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff has yet to receive responses.
(Id., ¶ 3.)
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Plaintiff has met the requirements for the requested
relief.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set 1) served on Defendant Isaias Ortega.
 
Given
the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses,
and the economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions,
the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $337.50 calculated based on 1.5 hours
of attorney work, multiplied by attorney’s hourly billing rate of
$225.00.  (Id., ¶ 4.)
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set 1) served on Defendant Isaias Ortega.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Isaias Ortega to serve code
compliant, verified, written responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (Set
1), without objection, within 30 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS  Defendant Isaias Ortega to pay
sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Plaintiff in the amount of $337.50
within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
