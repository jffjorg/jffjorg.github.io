And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. The plaintiff failed to respond to these discovery requests, and the defendant filed a motion to compel responses. The judge also grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $370, which is calculated based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable hourly billing rate of $185. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified, code-complaint, written responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 14 days of notice and to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice.
