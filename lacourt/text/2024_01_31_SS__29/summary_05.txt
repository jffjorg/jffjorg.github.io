Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against it. The defendant, County of Los Angeles, argues that it was not properly served with the summons and complaint, and that the clerk's entry of default was void. The judge agrees, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which allows the court to set aside any void judgment or order. The judge also notes that the defendant has demonstrated a meritorious case and has articulated a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. The judge orders the clerk to set aside the default judgment and grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default.
