And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to continue the trial date from March 11, 2024, to October 15, 2024. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Ramiro Martinez Gomez, who requested a continuance to September 9, 2024, due to ongoing discovery issues, including the depositions of witness Oliver Villamil and DAMCO's person most knowledgeable, as well as the inspection of Defendant's truck/trailer/container. The court found that Plaintiff had shown good cause for a continuance based on the necessary discovery that needs to be conducted and the availability of counsel. The court also considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d), including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The court granted the motion and continued the trial date to October 15, 2024, and reset the final status conference and all deadlines accordingly.
