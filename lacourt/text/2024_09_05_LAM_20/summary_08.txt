And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Vlaze Media Networks, Inc.'s motion to reconsider its ruling on the AT&T consent form. The Defendant, Anastasiia Arseneva, argues that the consent form does not have a temporal limitation for outgoing calls and texts, contrary to the Court's previous ruling. The Court denies the motion, finding that the "customer information" section of the consent form does indicate a relevant time period for all records, specifically February 20, 2022 to March 5, 2022. However, to appease Arseneva, the Court instructs Zambrano to add a note to the outgoing information section clarifying that the same time period applies. Counsel is strongly encouraged to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
