And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication brought by Behavioral Health Services, Inc. (Defendant). The Defendant seeks to dismiss all remaining causes of action brought by Robert Valencia and Brandie Garcia (Plaintiffs) in connection with the death of Justin Reed Valencia, who died of an overdose at a 24-hour rehabilitation center operated by the Defendant.

The judge has granted the motion as to the abuse-based claims, finding that there is no evidence of neglect or reckless conduct by the Defendant. The judge has also denied the motion as to the negligence-based claims, finding that the Defendant failed to carry its burden of showing that it acted with reasonable care.

The judge has denied the motion as to the neglect per se and wrongful death claims, finding that these claims are not independent causes of action and cannot be summarily adjudicated.

The judge has overruled objections and has given notice to counsel to submit on the tentative ruling.
