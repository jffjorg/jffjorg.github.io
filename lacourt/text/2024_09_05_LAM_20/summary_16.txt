And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike the entirety of a complaint filed by the defendants, Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P., and Theta Holding IV, Inc., against the plaintiffs, DONE! Ventures, LLC and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. The defendants argue that the complaint arises from protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(e), which protects acts in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.

The judge concludes that the defendants have carried their burden to show that the complaint arises from protected activity, specifically the enforcement of a judgment and the filing of abstracts of judgment. The judge also finds that the defendants have demonstrated that the complaint has no minimal merit, and therefore grants the motion to strike the complaint.

The judge notes that the defendants have repeatedly attempted to challenge the validity of a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, which has been rejected by the court multiple times. The judge finds that the defendants' claims are without merit and that there is no possibility of them prevailing on their claims.

The judge grants the motion to strike the complaint and orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
