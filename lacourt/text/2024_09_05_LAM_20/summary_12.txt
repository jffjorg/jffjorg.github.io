And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's request to file a late demurrer. The defendant had filed an answer on January 18, 2023, and is now seeking to file a demurrer to resolve the action. However, the court believes that a demurrer has been forfeited since an answer has already been filed, and the defendant has the option to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings instead. The court is citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(a)(1) and 438(f)(2) in support of its decision. The judge is encouraging counsel to submit on the tentative ruling or appear remotely through LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
