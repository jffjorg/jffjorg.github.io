And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants, Ronald Massman and DHX-Dependable Hawaiian Express, Inc. (DHX), to the second through fourth causes of action in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC). The demurrer argues that the second cause of action for breach of a 1991 oral contract is barred by a two-year statute of limitations, that the third cause of action for fraud is barred by the economic loss rule, and that the fourth cause of action for unjust enrichment fails.

The judge finds that the statute of limitations is a factual issue in this case and cannot be resolved at this stage. The judge also finds that the economic loss rule does not apply to the fraud claim, and that the unjust enrichment claim is not necessarily a cause of action, but rather a principle underlying various legal doctrines and remedies.

The judge overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to file an answer within 20 days. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for judicial notice.

In addition, the judge denies the defendants' motion to strike the FAC's alter ego allegations.

Finally, the judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
