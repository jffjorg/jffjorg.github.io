And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in an employment action. The plaintiff, Victoria White, seeks to compel initial responses to her interrogatories from the defendants, Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi. The defendants claim they were surprised by the motion because the parties had agreed to engage in settlement discussions and pause discovery. However, the court finds that there was an agreement to pause discovery and have the plaintiff's counsel initiate settlement discussions. The court will compel responses within 30 days, but will not award sanctions. The defendants can still assert objections. The court encourages counsel to submit on the tentative and to appear remotely through LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
