And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant, Candelario Flores, is valid and enforceable. The agreement requires Flores to pay the plaintiffs $67,500. Flores has filed a judgment lien, but the court will not take this into account in calculating the payment. The court finds that the plaintiffs have a right to enforce the settlement agreement and will enter a judgment in their favor. The court will not award attorneys' fees to either side.
