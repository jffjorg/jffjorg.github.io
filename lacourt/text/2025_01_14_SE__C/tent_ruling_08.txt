TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Substitute Marielena Cazarez ad litem for August J. Gomez, in place of deceased
Plaintiff, Gustabo Gomez, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiffs to give
notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law action. On December 11, 2023, Plaintiffs
Gustabo Gomez and Marielena Cazarez (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against
Defendant FCA US, LLC (“Defendant”). 
 
Plaintiffs now move to substitute August J. Gomez, as son
and successor-in-interest to deceased Plaintiff Gustabo Gomez, through his Guadian
ad litem and mother, Marielena Cazarez.
 
No opposition has been filed as of January 10, 2025.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31 provides that the
decedent’s personal representative or, if none, the decedent’s successor in
interest may continue a decedent’s pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30;
see Adams v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 71, 78-79.) A
successor in interest is the beneficiary of the decedent’s estate or other
successor in interest who succeeds to a cause of action or to a particular item
of the property that is the subject of the cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
377.11.) Section 377.33 provides that the court in which an action is continued
may make any order concerning parties that is appropriate to ensure proper
administration of justice, including the appointment of the decedent’s
successor in interest as a special administrator or guardian ad litem.¿¿ 
¿ 
Section 377.32 provides that a person who seeks to commence
such an action as the decedent’s successor in interest must file an affidavit
or declaration providing certain information, including the decedent’s name,
date and place of decedent’s death, and statements regarding whether the estate
has been administered and that the affiant or declarant is the successor in
interest on decedent’s claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32, subd. (a).) A
certified copy of the decedent’s death certificate must also be attached to the
affidavit or declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32, subd. (c).)¿
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff Marielena Cazarez submits a declaration in support
of this motion stating the following:
 
1.   
Decedent’s name is Gustabo Gomez. (Cazarez
Decl., ¶ 3.)
2.   
Decedent passed away on December 12, 2023, in
Los Angeles, California. (Cazarez Decl., ¶ 4.)
3.   
No proceeding is now pending in California for
administration of the Decedent’s estate. (Cazarez Decl., ¶ 5.)
4.   
August J. Gomez is Decedent’s
successor-in-interest, as defined in Code of Civil Procedure section 377.1, and
Marilena Cazarez is the Guardian ad litem of August J. Gomez. (Cazarez Decl., ¶
6.) Decedent died without a will. (Cazarez Decl., ¶ 6.)
5.   
No other person has a superior right to commence
the action or proceeding or to be substituted for the decedent on the pending
action or proceeding. (Cazarez Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
A certified copy of Decedent’s death certificate is attached
to the declaration. (Cazarez Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1.)
 
The Court finds that Decedent died intestate and was
unmarried at the time of his death. (Cazarez Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1.) Under Probate
Code section 6402, subdivision (a), August J. Gomez qualifies as Decedent’s
successor-in-interest as his son.
 
Having met all the requirements set forth in Code Civ.
Proc., § 377.11, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Substitute Marielena Cazarez ad litem for
August J. Gomez, in place of deceased Plaintiff, Gustabo Gomez, is
granted.¿¿
