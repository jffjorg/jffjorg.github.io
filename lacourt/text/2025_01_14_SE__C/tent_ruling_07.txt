Background
 
This is a conversion action. On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff
El Greco Wholesale Grocers Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Arturo Adame, Miguel Diaz, Lucy’s Enterprises, Inc., and Does 1 to
25. The Complaint alleges that Defendant Arturo Adame, a former employee of
Plaintiff, stole 2,720 wooden pallets from Plaintiff and sold the pallets to
Defendant Lucy’s Enterprises, Inc. and its owner, Defendant Miguel Diaz. The
Complaint alleges the following causes of action: 1) Conversion, 2) Unjust
Enrichment, 3) Fraud by Concealment, 4) Common Count: Had and Received, and 5)
Common Count: Goods and Services Rendered.
 
On December 5, 2023, Defendants Miguel Diaz and Lucy’s
Enterprises, Inc. (“Defendants”) served on Plaintiff its Requests for
Admission, Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production. (Lipana Decl., ¶ 2, Exhs. 1-4.) Plaintiff’s responses were due on
January 8, 2024. (Lipana Decl., ¶ 3.) Although the parties met and conferred
several since January 2024, and despite assurance from Plaintiff’s counsel that
discovery would be served, Plaintiff did not respond to the discovery requests
as of the date of these Motions. (Ibid.)
 
Defendants now move to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, in the
“Motion to Compel Discovery Responses.” Defendants also move to deem the
Requests for Admissions admitted. Defense counsel also seeks sanctions for the
two Motions filed. 
 
The Motions are unopposed as of January 10, 2025.
 
Discussion
 
The Court finds the notice for the Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses is directed toward a non-party, Robert Weimer, Jr., and not
toward Plaintiff El Greco Wholesale Grocers Inc. 
 
The Court, on its own motion, continues the hearings on the
Motion to Compel Discovery Requests and the Motion to Deem Requests for
Admissions Admitted to March 18, 2025, in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m.
Defendants are ordered to correct the Notice to properly name Plaintiff and to
file proof of service for the corrected Notice and related Motion.
