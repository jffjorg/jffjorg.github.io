Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production Nos. 45-46. The Plaintiff sought to compel further responses from the Defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (VGA), regarding documents showing VGA's knowledge of consumer complaints regarding and warranty repairs performed on vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff has shown good cause for producing the requested documents, and that VGA is amenable to producing them. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff's Motion was premature, as VGA indicated it would follow up regarding Request Nos. 45-46, but VGA has not yet filed proof that responses were served prior to the hearing.

The judge declines to award sanctions against VGA, as the Plaintiff hastily filed the Motion without allowing VGA to respond regarding Request for Production Nos. 45-46. The judge notes that the parties have met extensively regarding discovery, but that the Plaintiff prematurely filed the Motion.
