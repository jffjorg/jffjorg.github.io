And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of El Greco Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Adame et al., Case No. 23NWCV02839. The plaintiff, a wholesale grocer, filed a conversion action against defendants Miguel Diaz, Lucy's Enterprises, Inc., and Arturo Adame, alleging that a former employee stole 2,720 wooden pallets and sold them to Lucy's Enterprises, Inc. The defendants served discovery requests on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendants have moved to compel discovery responses and deem requests for admissions admitted.

The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to compel discovery responses and the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted to March 18, 2025. The defendants are ordered to correct the notice to properly name the plaintiff and to file proof of service for the corrected notice and related motion. The court has also ordered the defendants to give notice.

The judge notes that the notice for the motion to compel discovery responses is directed toward a non-party, Robert Weimer, Jr., and not toward the plaintiff.
