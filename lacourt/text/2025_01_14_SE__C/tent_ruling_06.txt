TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff Samantha
Ruiz’s Motion to Compel Further is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is DENIED.  
 
Plaintiff to give
notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law action. On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff
Samantha Ruiz (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Volkswagen Group of
America, Inc. (“VGA”) and Volkswagen of Downtown LA dba LAD-V, LLC (“LAD-V”).
On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint
(“FAC”). The FAC alleges Defendants failed to repair or replace Plaintiff’s 2021
Volkswagen JETTA CITY. The FAC alleges the following causes of action: 1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act-Breach of Express
Warranty, 2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act-Breach of Implied Warranty, 3)
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2, and (4) Negligent Repair. 

 
On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff propounded on VGA its
Requests for Production (Set One). (Thomas Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A; Paeng Decl., ¶ 4.)
VGA provided verified responses and documents in response on January 30, 2023.
(Thomas Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. B; Paeng Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. B.) On March 8,
2024,¿Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to VGA, outlining the
deficiencies in its responses to the Requests for Production (Set One). (Thomas
Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. C; Paeng Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. C.) On March 13, 2024, Defendant
responded to Plaintiff’s letter, refusing to respond to certain requests,
including Nos. 45-46. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. D.)  In March and April 2024, the parties continued
to meet and confer, through which some discovery issues were resolved—yet the
issue regarding Request Nos. 45-46 remained. (Thomas Decl.,  ¶ 11, Exh. E). On April 15, 2024, the parties
met and conferred telephonically—the parties agreed VGA would produce certain
discovery, but that VGA would follow up with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding
supplementing its responses to Request Nos. 45 and 46, among others. (Paeng
Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. D, p. 2.) On May 6, 2024, VGA produced supplemental responses,
which did not include responses to Request Nos. 45-46. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 7; Paeng
Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff filed the instant motion two days later. (Paeng Decl., ¶
8.)
 
On July 23, 2024, this matter was transferred to new counsel
for VGA. (Paeng Decl., ¶ 10.) On December 27, 2024, VGA’s counsel informed
Plaintiff’s counsel that VGA will produce documents in response to Request Nos.
45-46 and requested to Plaintiff to withdraw the Motion. (Paeng Decl., ¶ 10;
Exh. E.) Plaintiff declined to withdraw the Motion. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses from VGA to
the Requests for Production (Set One), Nos. 45-46, which relate to documents
showing Defendant’s knowledge of regarding and warranty repairs performed on
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. Plaintiff also
requests sanctions.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP Section 2031.310 allows a party who has requested
production of documents and received unsatisfactory responses to move for an
order compelling further responses. A motion under this section must (1) set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand and (2) be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).) CRC Rule 3.1345 requires
the moving party to file a separate statement showing good cause. 
 
To establish good cause, the burden is on the moving party
to show: (1) relevance to the subject matter and (2) specific facts justifying
discovery. (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (National Union Fire Ins. Co.
of Pittsburgh, Penn.) (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117; see also Kirkland
v. Sup. Ct. (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
A motion¿to compel further responses to requests for
production “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under section
2016.040.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented in the motion.¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) On March 8,
2024,¿Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to VGA, outlining the
deficiencies in its responses to the Requests for Production (Set One). (Thomas
Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. C; Paeng Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. C.) On March 13, 2024, VGA responded
to Plaintiff’s letter, refusing to respond to certain requests, including Nos.
45-46. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. D.) In March and April 2024, the parties met
and conferred via email and telephone, through which some discovery issues were
resolved—yet the issue regarding Request Nos. 45-46 remained. (Thomas Decl.,  ¶ 11, Exh. E). On April 15, 2024, the parties
agreed that VGA would follow up regarding supplementing its responses to
Request Nos. 45-46. (Paeng Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. D, p. 2.) On May 6, 2024, VGA
served supplemental responses and documents responsive to certain requests but
did not address Request Nos. 45-46. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. E). Plaintiff
filed this Motion two days after VGA’s supplemental responses. (Paeng Decl. ¶  9.) The Court finds the parties have met
extensively regarding discovery, but that Plaintiff prematurely filed this
Motion where VGA indicated it would follow up regarding Request Nos. 45-46.
 
Discussion
 
The following requests for production are at issue: 
 
Request for
Production No. 45: All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of 2021
Volkswagen JETTA CITY vehicles regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT
VEHICLE was presented to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair
during the warranty period.
 
Request for
Production No. 46: All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2021
Volkswagen JETTA CITY, vehicles regarding any of the components that YOU or
YOUR authorized repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty.
 
Plaintiff argues that VGA’s objections regarding
overbreadth, vagueness and ambiguity, and privilege are without merit because
they are stated generally. VGA’s objections pertaining to trade secrets and
third-party privacy can be mitigated through the Stipulation and Protective
Order in place, and through redaction. Plaintiff argues VGA’s objection to MacQuiddy
v. Mercedes-Benz USA (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1045-46 is misguided
because in that case, the VGA has already admitted it failed to comply with the
Song-Beverly Act, and the court held plaintiff’s discovery requests were only “peripherally
related” to undisputed issues. Here, VGA has not admitted fault, and
Plaintiff’s requests are relevant to disputed issues. Thus, MacQuiddy does
not apply. Plaintiff argues that the discovery sought by Requests for
Production Nos. 45-46 are relevant because they seek information regarding VGA’s
knowledge of consumer complaints regarding and warranty repairs performed on
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. Plaintiff
argues information regarding other vehicles is routinely sought in Song-Beverly
Act cases to show whether VGA willfully chose not to disclose the Subject
Vehicle’s defects.
 
In opposition, VGA argues that Plaintiff has failed to
establish good cause for further responses. VGA argues that discovery regarding
complaints and repairs of other vehicles is irrelevant to the question of
whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act. VGA further argues that the Court should limit discovery based on
the amount in controversy, which is relatively low. 
 
VGA further argues that it has continued to meet and confer
with Plaintiff and has provided supplemental responses. VGA argues Plaintiff
demonstrates no good cause or any right to the discovery at issue. Yet VGA
further argues that the Motion is moot because, “VWGoA (VGA) will have served
supplemental responses and produced supplemental documents that are responsive
to RFP Nos. 45 and 46” prior to the hearing. (Mot, p. 4, lines 26-28; Paeng
Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that, as of January 7, 2025, VGA
has not served responses. Plaintiff argues that VGA’s substantive arguments in
opposition should not be considered because VGA claims to have already produced
these documents. The arguments should thus be considered waived.
 
The Court is hesitant to find this Motion moot where VGA has
not yet filed proof that responses were served to Request for Production Nos.
45-46 prior to this hearing. The Court finds Plaintiff has showed good cause
for producing such documents. Considering VGA has claimed it will have produced
the documents prior to this hearing, the Court finds VGA is amenable to
producing such documents. The Court thus agrees with Plaintiff that any
substantive arguments opposing the Motion to Compel Further have been waived.
(See Paeng Decl., ¶ 11.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Request for Production Nos. 45-46.Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 subdivision (h)
states, “[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
 
The Court acknowledges Plaintiff’s argument that sanctions
should be awarded where VGA has delayed in providing the discovery and filed an
unsuccessful opposition. But the Court declines to award sanctions where
Plaintiff hastily filed the Motion without allowing VGA to respond regarding
Request for Production Nos. 45-46. (See Paeng Decl., ¶¶ 7-10.) On April 15,
2024, the parties agreed that VGA would follow up regarding supplementing its
responses to Request Nos. 45-46. (Paeng Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. D, p. 2.) On May 6,
2024, VGA served supplemental responses and documents responsive to certain
requests but did not address Request Nos. 45-46. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. E). The
Court finds Plaintiff filed this Motion soon after VGA provided supplemental
responses without further attempt to meet and confer as to Request Nos. 45-46. Under
these circumstances, the Court finds an award of sanctions would be unjust.
