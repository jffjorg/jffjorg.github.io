TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Attorney Gene J. Goldsman’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is CONTINUED to January 28, 2025 in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m. 
 
Counsel to give notice. 
 
This is a personal injury action. Attorney Gene J. Goldsman,
counsel for Plaintiff Daniel Mark LaRose, filed a Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel. The Motion remains unopposed.
 
On December 3, 2024, the Court heard the Motion. The Court
found that the requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel were met.
The findings are reproduced in the following: 
 
Attorney Gene Goldsman filed a Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel. (See Form MC-0510.) Attorney
Goldsman also filed a Proposed Order. (See Form MC-053.) The attorney
declaration demonstrates goood cause for withdrawal based on a breakdown of
communication. (Goldsman Decl., ¶ 2.) Attorney Goldsman states that Plaintiff
LaRose was served the client by mail at the client’s last known address with
copies of the motion papers served with this declaration, which was confirmed
by mail in the past thirty (30) days. (Goldsman Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
However, the Court continued the hearing on this Motion to
today’s date to allow counsel to submit notice to his client of all
continuances granted via ex parte application—specifically, the Final
Settlement Conference and the trial dates. Counsel was also ordered to give
notice of this Motion’s continuance.
 
Counsel has not submitted notices of the pertinent
continuances. Accordingly, the Motion is CONTINUED to January 28, 2025 in
Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m. Counsel is ordered to submit notice to his client
of continuances of the final settlement conference, the trial dates, and this
Motion before the continued hearing date.
