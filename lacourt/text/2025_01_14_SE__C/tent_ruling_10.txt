TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant’s Demurrer
to the Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
Defendant to give
notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a quiet title action. On February 28, 2024,
Plaintiff Patrick S. Ferrill filed this action against Defendant Terri Newsom
as personal representative of the Estate of Karrinne Dodd (“Decedent”) and Does
1 to 10. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff recently found and recorded a
Quit Claim Deed, dated February 13, 2013, that granted the Decedent’s
residential property located at 15406 Dumont Ave, Norwalk, CA 90650, legally
designated as LOT 96 OF TRACT NO. 16224, IN THE CITY OF NORWALK, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES,
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AS PER MAP RECORDED IN BOOK 388, PAGE 6-12, IN THE OFFICE
OF THE COUNTY RECORDER OF SAID COUNTY (“Subject Property”) to Plaintiff. The
Complaint alleges the Estate of Decedent is currently being probated according
to a fraudulent will in Probate Case No. 21STPB08875. The Complaint alleges one
cause of action to quite title to the Subject Property in favor of Plaintiff.
 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application
for preliminary injunction restraining Defendant from selling, disposing of,
interfering, or committing waste upon the Subject Property. On March 14, 2024,
the Court denied the ex parte application, finding that the Probate Court has
complete jurisdiction over claims to property of the estate. (See 3/14/24
Minute Order.) In response to Plaintiff’s argument that the matter should be
heard in this Court because the Probate Court found Plaintiff had no standing,
this Court found Plaintiff’s only remedy is to appeal that decision, not to
file an action in this Court. (Ibid.) 
 
Defendant now demurs to the Complaint based on the grounds
that the Court has no subject matter jurisdiction over the action to quiet
title. 
 
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the
evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court
assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is
whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  
  
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969)
70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)

 
Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice of the
Probate Court action, entitled Estate of Karrinne Dodd, Case No. 21STPB08875
(“Probate Action”).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a) requires the parties to meet and
confer “in person or by telephone.” Defense counsel did not address
meet and confer efforts in the declaration in support of the Demurrer. Although
the Court finds the meet and confer requirement has not been met, the Court
will assess the merits of the Demurrer in interests of judicial efficiency.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant argues, in line with the Court’s March 13, 2024
Minute Order, that this Court has no jurisdiction over this action to quiet
title. Defendant argues that the Probate Action was filed on September 13,
2021, before this action. (Orloff Decl., ¶ 1.) On December 15, 2023, the
Probate Court granted an order confirming sale of the Subject Property. (Orloff
Decl., ¶ 1, Exh. A.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the probate court did
not have jurisdiction over the property because it transferred to Plaintiff by
deed in 2013, as alleged in the Complaint. (Compl., ¶ 12, Exh. A.) Plaintiff
argues the probate court only has jurisdiction limited to property that is part
of the estate at the time of decedent’s death. Plaintiff argues that the
Probate Court has determined Plaintiff does not have standing, but that
Plaintiff is not barred from seeking equitable relief in Civil Court. 
 
In reply, Defendant objects on the grounds that the
opposition is untimely—the opposition was due on December 31, 2024, but was
filed on January 2, 2025. Defendant argues that the issue of whether the
Subject Property was transferred in 2013 should properly be heard by the
Probate Court, because such Court has jurisdiction to determine whether real
property is part of an estate. Plaintiff should seek relief from the Probate
Court, not from this Court.
 
“It is the general rule in California that the superior
court sitting in probate has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the persons
and share that each has in the estate of a decedent.” (Howard v. Bennett
(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 546, 548.) The Probate Court has complete and exclusive
jurisdiction over property of the estate, all persons claiming interests in the
decedent’s estate, and all matters involved in a complete and effective
administration of the estate, which include the probate of wills. (See Prob.
Code, § 7050; see also Morrison v. Kaufman (1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 280,
281; Colden v. Costello (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 363, 370.) 
 
The Court sustains the demurrer on the grounds that this
Court has no jurisdiction over this matter under Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10, subdivision (a). The Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction
over claims of interest in the decedent’s estate. (See Prob. Code, § 7050.) 
 
Consistent with the Court’s decision on Plaintiff’s ex parte
application, the Court finds the only appropriate remedy for Plaintiff is to seek
appellate relief from the Probate Court’s decision that Plaintiff lacked
standing, not to file a new action in this Court. (See 3/14/24 Minute Order.)
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Complaint without leave to amend.
