And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Raul A. Sahagun in a quiet title action filed by Patrick S. Ferrill against Terri Newsom, as personal representative of the Estate of Karrinne Dodd. The plaintiff alleges that he recently found and recorded a Quit Claim Deed granting the Subject Property to himself and is seeking to quiet title to the property. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the court has no jurisdiction over the matter.

The court granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the Probate Court action, entitled Estate of Karrinne Dodd, Case No. 21STPB08875. The court also noted that the parties failed to meet and confer, but decided to assess the merits of the demurrer in the interests of judicial efficiency.

The court sustained the demurrer, finding that this court has no jurisdiction over the matter under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (a). The Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims of interest in the decedent's estate, and the plaintiff should seek relief from the Probate Court, not from this court. The court denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for preliminary injunction and found that the only appropriate remedy for the plaintiff is to seek appellate relief from the Probate Court's decision that the plaintiff lacks standing, not to file a new action in this court.
