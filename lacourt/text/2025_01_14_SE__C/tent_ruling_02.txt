Background
             
This is a breach of contract
action. On September 13, 2022, Plaintiff Kaizou Group Inc. (“Plaintiff” or
“Cross-Defendant”) filed this action against Defendants Sang “Tony” Pan, Julie
Pan (“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100. The Complaint alleges the parties entered
into an agreement (“Contract”), in which Plaintiff would provide Defendant with
goods. The Complaint alleges Defendants breached the Contract by receiving the
goods but failing to make payments on Plaintiff’s invoices from the period of
November 24, 2021 to June 2, 2022. The total amount owed to Plaintiff is
allegedly $703,484.00. The Complaint alleges the following causes of action: 1)
Breach of Contract and 2) Common Counts.
 
On January 24, 2024, Defendants Sang
“Tony” Pan and Julie Pan (“Defendants” or “Cross-Complainants”) filed a
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff, Shang Yang Zhao a/k/a Shangyang Zhao a/k/a
Noble Zhao (“Cross-Defendants”), and Roes 1 to 20. The Cross-Complaint alleges
Cross-Complainants allegedly paid for the goods in the amount of $1,081,940.00.
The Cross-Complaint alleges Cross-Defendants falsified some invoices and failed
to credit payment made by Cross-Complainants in the amount of $72,548.00.
Cross-Complainants have allegedly overpaid in the amount of at least $305,908.00.
The Cross-Complaint alleges the following causes of action: 1) Conversion, 2) Money
Had and Received, 3) Common Counts—Open Book Account, 4) Unjust Enrichment, 5) Accounting,
and 6) Declaratory relief.
 
On July 17, 2024,
Cross-Complainants’ counsel sent notices of deposition and request for
documents for Cross-Defendant Kaizou Group Inc.’s Personal Most Knowledgeable
(PMK) and Cross-Defendant Shang Yang Zhao, both to be held on August 8, 2024.
(Park Decls., ¶ 3, Exhs. 1-2.) On July 30, 2024, Cross-Defendants’ counsel
stated August 8, 2024 would not work, but that counsel would respond with an
alternative date. (Park Decls., ¶ 4.) Cross-Defendants’ counsel also stated the
PMK was “tentatively Huajun Zhang.” (Ibid.) On August 8, 2024, Cross-Defendants’
counsel suggested a date of August 30, 2024, which was past the discovery
cutoff at the time—trial was to be held on September 20, 2024, but is now set
for March 24, 2025. (Ibid.) Cross-Complainants’ counsel contacted Cross-Defendants’
counsel multiple times regarding confirmation of the August 30 deposition date,
a more definite identification of the PMK, and a waiver of the discovery
deadline. (Park Decls., ¶¶ 5-6, Exh. 3.) Cross-Defendants’ counsel refused to
waive the discovery deadline, arguing Cross-Complainants’ counsel did not
provide alternative dates prior to the deadline. (Park Decls., ¶ 6, Exh. 3.) Cross-Defendants’
counsel was otherwise unresponsive. (Ibid.)
 
Cross-Complainants now move to
compel the depositions of Cross-Defendant Kaizou Group Inc.’s PMK and
Cross-Defendant Shang Yang Zhao and to compel production of documents at such
depositions. Cross-Complainants also seek sanctions.
 
No oppositions have been filed as of January 10, 2025.
 
Legal Standard
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action. . .without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 subd.
(a).)¿ 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel deposition must be “accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The parties have
met and conferred, and Cross-Complainants’ counsel has been thereafter unresponsive.
(See Park Decls., ¶¶ 4-6, Exh. 3.) The Court finds the meet and confer
requirement has been met.
 
Discussion
 
The Court first discusses the request for production of
documents at the depositions. A motion to compel deposition must “set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 subd., (b)(1).) 
 
The Court finds Cross-Complainants failed to demonstrate
specific facts showing good cause to support the production of documents. Thus,
the Court denies the Motions to the Compel to the extent they demand production
of documents at the depositions.
 
As to the deposition, the Court finds Cross-Defendant Kaizou
Group Inc.’s PMK and Cross-Defendant Shang Yang Zhao failed to attend their depositions
noticed for August 8, 2024. (Park Decls., ¶ 3, Exhs. 1-2.) Although
Cross-Defendant suggested an alternative discovery date of August 30, 2024,
that date was past the discovery cut-off deadline at the time. (Park Decls., ¶ 4.)
Cross-Defendants refused to waive the discovery cut-off deadline and failed to
provide alternative dates, despite Cross-Complainants attempts to meet and
confer. (Park Decls., ¶ 5-6.) The Court finds Cross-Defendants failed to appear
for their noticed depositions. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motions to
Compel to the extent they seek to compel Cross-Defendant Kaizou Group Inc. to
identify its PMK and compel depositions of such PMK and Cross-Defendant Shang
Yang Zhao. 
 
Sanctions
 
If a party deponent fails to appear or fails to produce materials
designated in the deposition notice, monetary sanctions may be imposed, “unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (g)(1), 2025.480, subd. (j).) Sanctions
may be awarded even though no opposition to the motion was filed, the opposition
to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the
moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1030(a).)
 
Cross-Complainants’ counsel seeks sanctions in total sum of $2,268.91
against each Cross-Defendant Shang Yang Zhao and his counsel for 4 hours in
preparation of this Motion and an expected 1.5 hours for the reply and hearing
at a rate of $400.00, plus motion fees and e-filing fees. Cross-Complainants’
counsel seeks sanctions in total sum of $1,068.91 against each Cross-Defendant Kaizou
Group Inc. and its counsel for 2 hours in preparation of this Motion and an
expected 1.5 hours for the reply and hearing at a rate of $400.00, plus motion
fees and e-filing fees. 
 
Because no opposition was filed, the Court reduces sanctions
by .75 hours for each motion. Cross-Defendant Shang Yang Zhao and his counsel
are ordered to pay $1,968.91 in sanctions. Cross-Defendant Kaizou Group Inc.
and its counsel are ordered to pay $1,168.91 in sanctions.
