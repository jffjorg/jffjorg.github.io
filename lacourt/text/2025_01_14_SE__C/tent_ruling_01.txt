TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Robert
Avetsian’s Motion to Deposit a Negotiable Instrument into the Court Registry
Investment System is DENIED.
 
Defendant to give
notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a debt collection action. On August 9, 2024,
Plaintiff CITIBANK N.A. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant
Robert Avetsian, in pro per, (“Defendant”) to recover non-payment of credit
card debt of $27,971.91. The Complaint alleged two causes of action for 1) Open
Book Account and 2) Account Stated. 
 
Non-jury trial was held on June 14, 2024 in Department P.
Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $28,545.91, for
damages plus costs. 
 
Defendant now moves to deposit a negotiable instrument into
the Court Registry Investment System to resolve the debt.
 
The Motion is unopposed as of January 10, 2025.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant seeks to deposit a
negotiable instrument, a bill of exchange drawn upon by the U.S. Treasury, into
the Court Registry Investment System. Defendant cites 28 U.S.C. §§ 2041 and
2042.
 
The Court finds Defendant’s Motion
is inappropriate in this Court. According to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
Rule 67, and 28 U.S.C §§ 2041 and 2042, parties may deposit funds into the
Court Registry Investment System for cases involving monetary judgments,
pursuant to a court order. Such statutes are applicable in federal courts, but
not in state courts such as this Court. Defendant has cited no other authority
regarding deposits of negotiable instruments in California state courts to
satisfy a debt judgment. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to
Deposit a Negotiable Instrument into the Court Registry Investment System is denied.
