The Judge, Raul A. Sahagun, has issued a tentative ruling continuing a hearing on Attorney Gene J. Goldsman's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Daniel Mark LaRose. The Motion remains unopposed. The Judge had previously heard the Motion on December 3, 2024, but continued the hearing to today's date to allow Counsel to submit notice to his client of all continuances granted via ex parte application. However, Counsel has not submitted these notices, and therefore the Motion is continued to January 28, 2025 in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m. Counsel is ordered to submit notice to his client of the continuances before the continued hearing date.
