And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Jacob Maymudes' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint and his motion to bifurcate his equitable cause of action. The judge grants the motion for leave to file the First Amended Complaint, which is deemed filed as of the date of entry of this order. The judge notes that amendment is proper in this case, as there is no perceived prejudice to the defendant and the proposed addition of a new claim for declaratory relief is evident. The judge also denies the motion to bifurcate, finding that it is premature and should be considered at the Final Status Conference.
