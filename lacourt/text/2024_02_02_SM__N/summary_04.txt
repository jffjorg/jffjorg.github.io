Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the anti-SLAPP motion hearing and for permission to conduct limited discovery. The plaintiff, Star DeMarc, seeks to continue the hearing on the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion to allow more time to prepare a meaningful opposition and to conduct discovery to obtain evidence of uninhabitable conditions. However, the judge has determined that the plaintiff has failed to show good cause for continuing the hearing and that the claims at issue are limited solely to those arising out of the defendant's filing of an unlawful detainer lawsuit and the service of a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. The judge has also determined that the evidence sought by the plaintiff is not relevant to the anti-SLAPP motion and that the plaintiff has not limited her discovery requests to only what is necessary to oppose the motion.
