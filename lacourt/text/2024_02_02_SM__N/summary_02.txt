And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and/or adjudication for unlawful detainer. The plaintiff, Val-Chris Investments, Inc., is seeking to evict the defendants, Aveta Parsazad, Benjamin Emein, Denise Lane, Orit Ambuehl, Robert Ambuehl, and Victor Lane, from the property at 1991 Stradella Road in Los Angeles. The defendants have not filed an opposition to the motion, which can be considered a concession that the motion is meritorious.

The plaintiff has established that it owns the property after a nonjudicial foreclosure sale and has perfected its title. The defendants were served with a Notice to Quit on September 8, 2023, and have failed to vacate the property. The evidence shows that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the plaintiff's claim for unlawful detainer, and the defendants have failed to create a triable issue.

Accordingly, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and/or adjudication for unlawful detainer. The plaintiff shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
