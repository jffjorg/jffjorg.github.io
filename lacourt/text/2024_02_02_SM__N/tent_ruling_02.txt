Analysis
Plaintiff moves
for summary judgment or adjudication as to its complaint on the ground that
there is no triable issue of fact as to Plaintiff’s claim for unlawful detainer
for failure to vacate the property after a nonjudicial foreclosure sale. Defendants Aveta
Parsazad, Benjamin Emein, Denise Lane, Orit Ambuehl, Robert Ambuehl, and Victor
Lane (“Defendants”) have not filed oppositions to Plaintiff’s motion. While the
moving party generally bears the initial burden of proof on its motion, and
lack of opposition will not automatically entitle the moving party to prevail
on its motion, a party’s failure to file an opposition can be considered a
concession that the motion is meritorious. (See Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
The
purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
 
“On a
motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party
to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material
fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has
no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of
action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant
. . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
“If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr.
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
“Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “[T]he court must consider all of the evidence set
forth in the papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an
objection) . . . in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary
judgment.” (Avivi, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see
also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
 
In the
complaint, Plaintiff alleges that it owns the property at 1991 Stradella Road,
Los Angeles, California 90077; Plaintiff obtained ownership of the property
after a properly noticed and conducted nonjudicial foreclosure sale on July 20,
2023; Plaintiff thereafter perfected its title; Defendants are currently in
possession of the property without any right or claim to occupancy or
possession; Plaintiff served Defendants with a Three/Thirty/Ninety Day Notice
to Quit on September 8, 2023; more than three days have passed since the notice
was served; and Defendants remain in possession of the property. (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 9-13.)
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1161a, subdivision (b)(3), “a person who holds over
and continues in possession of a manufactured home, mobilehome, floating home,
or real property after a three-day written notice to quit the property has been
served upon the person, . . . may be removed therefrom . . . [w]here the
property has been sold in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under
a power of sale contained in a deed of trust executed by such person, or a
person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been
duly perfected.” Thus, Plaintiff must establish that the property was sold in
accordance with Civil Code section 2924, Plaintiff has perfected title to the
property, and Defendants have held over and continued in possession of the
property after the three-day notice to quit was served.
 
Plaintiff
provides undisputed evidence that on June 20, 2022, borrower Stradella Equity
Holdings, LLC, by its signatory member Aveta Parsazad, borrowed $540,000.00,
secured by the property at 1991 Stradella Road in Los Angeles, with a Deed of
Trust recorded on title on June 27, 2022. (Pl.’s UMF No. 1.) Plaintiff was
identified on the Deed of Trust as the lender/beneficiary. (Ibid.) On March 2, 2023, the agent for
the trustee recorded a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of
Trust against the property, indicating a default of $68,723.50 as of March 1,
2023, and a Notice of Trustee’s Sale was recorded by the agent on June 5, 2023,
indicating that the subject property would be sold, and the estimated debt was
$687,788.83. (Pl.’s UMF Nos. 2, 3.) On July 20, 2023, the unpaid debt stood at
$682,664.21, and a nonjudicial foreclosure sale occurred on the same date, with
Plaintiff purchasing the property by placing the highest bid of $625,000.00.
(Pl.’s UMF No. 4.) The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale was recorded on September 7,
2023, and included a recital regarding the notice of default and notice of
sale. (Pl.’s UMF Nos. 5, 6.) On September 8, 2023, a Notice to Quit was
prepared and served by leaving the documents with a competent member of the
household and mailing thereafter. (Pl.’s UMF No. 8.) Plaintiff filed this
action on September 12, 2023, more than three days after serving the notice.
(Pl.’s UMF No. 10.) However, Defendants remain in possession of the property
and continue to claim the right to possess the property, and when Defendants
Denise Lane, Victor Lane, Robert Ambuehl, and Orit Ambuehl had Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admission deemed against them, it was admitted that they refuse to
leave the property, they have no lease agreements, no one is renting the
property, and Aveta Parsazad continues to occupy the property. (Pl.’s UMF Nos.
9, 11, 12.) 
 
This
evidence allows Plaintiff to show there is no triable issue of material fact as
to its claim for unlawful detainer, and Defendants have failed to oppose the
motion and create a triable issue. Accordingly, Plaintiff
Val-Chris Investments, Inc.’s Motion
for Summary Judgment and/or Adjudication for Unlawful Detainer is GRANTED. Plaintiff Val-Chris Investments, Inc. shall
prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
