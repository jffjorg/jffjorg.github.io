And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to acknowledge and/or declare the original filing date nunc pro tunc. The Plaintiff, Robert Johnson, had filed a complaint on September 22, 2023, but it was rejected on September 26, 2023 due to a transmission error. The Plaintiff then moved the Court to declare the original filing date nunc pro tunc, but the Court found that the error was not a clerical error and that the Plaintiff did not provide a basis for amending the filing date. The Court also noted that the Plaintiff did not move under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) and did not provide an affidavit of fault. Therefore, the Court denied the Plaintiff's motion.
