The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.'s demurrer to complaint and motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's complaint. The Defendant filed these motions on June 18, 2024, directed at the original complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Aderiyike Lawal. However, the Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on or before the date for filing opposition, making the original complaint superseded and the Defendant's motions to strike moot. The Judge has therefore ordered that the Defendant's demurrer and motion to strike are taken off calendar as moot and directs the Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
