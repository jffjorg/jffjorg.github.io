And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on defendant Belinda Candelaria's motion for an order apportioning costs of partition, including reasonable attorney's fees. The motion was filed on February 20, 2024, and the court considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with the motion. The defendant is seeking an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $48,544, while the plaintiff, Robert Del Real, is seeking an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $38,966.66. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that he has served the opposition papers on the defendant due to a defective proof of service, and therefore, the defendant has not been served with the opposition. The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing to ensure that the defendant is served with, and may reply to, the plaintiff's opposition. The hearing is continued to January 13, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 53.
