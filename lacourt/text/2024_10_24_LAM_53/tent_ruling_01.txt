  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for order apportioning
  costs of partition, including reasonable attorney’s fees
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Belinda Candelaria 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Robert Del Real, in his capacity as successor trustee
of the Paul Ramos Trust dated June 21, 2018
Motion for Order Apportioning Costs of Partition, Including Reasonable
Attorney’s Fees
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants defendant
Belinda Candelaria’s request for judicial notice.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Belinda Candelaria (“Defendant”) filed the pending motion
for an order apportioning costs of partition, including reasonable attorney’s
fees, on February 20, 2024, moving the court for an order apportioning to
Defendant attorney’s fees in the amount of $48,544. 
In his opposition papers, and pursuant to the parties’ stipulation and
the court’s order filed on May 13, 2024, plaintiff Robert Del Real, in his
capacity as successor trustee of the Paul Ramos Trust dated June 21, 2018
(“Plaintiff”), requests that the court award him attorney’s fees in the amount
of $38,966.66.  (Sibbison Decl., ¶ 6; May
13, 2024 Stip. & Order, pp. 1:24-2:5 [stipulating that Plaintiff’s
opposition to Defendant’s motion shall include Plaintiff’s request for
attorney’s fees and costs].) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that he has served the
opposition papers on Defendant because the proof of service attached thereto is
defective. 
Plaintiff’s proof of service states that the opposition papers were
served on counsel for Defendant by email at the email address
“nmccall@schauerlaw.com.”  (Opp., p. 26:11,
26:19-21 [proof of service of opposition].)  However, this appears to be an incorrect email
address for Defendant’s counsel.  While
the court notes that Defendant’s filings do not set forth counsel’s email
address, Defendant has attached copies of emails exchanged between counsel,
which show that Defendant’s counsel’s email address is “nmccall@rschauerlaw.com.”  (McCall Decl., Ex. A, PDF pp. 7 [September 1,
2023 email listing counsel’s email address in signature line], 8 [August 28,
2023 email listing counsel’s email address in signature line] [emphasis
added].) 
Thus, Plaintiff has not shown that he has served Defendant with his
opposition papers, which request an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to the
parties’ stipulation and the court’s order thereon, on Defendant at her
counsel’s correct email address. 
Moreover, Defendant has not filed reply papers with the court, such that
it appears that Defendant might not have been served with Plaintiff’s
opposition. 
The court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion in order to ensure
that Defendant is served with, and may reply to, Plaintiff’s opposition to this
motion. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendant Belinda Candelaria’s motion for order apportioning costs of
partition, including reasonable attorney’s fees, is continued to January 13,
2025, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendant Belinda
Candelaria to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 24, 2024
