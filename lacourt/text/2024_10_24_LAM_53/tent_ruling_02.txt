(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 10, and for Monetary
Sanctions
 
The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with the motion to compel further responses to requests for
production of documents, set 11. 
The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with the
motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set 10.  No opposition papers were filed in connection
with that motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court overrules plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s evidentiary objection, filed on September 13, 2024, to
the declaration of Susanna Chenette. 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET 11
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Yang
Lu (“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 11, numbers 154-160, and (2) awarding monetary
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $7,621.65.[1]
As a threshold matter, the
court notes that, in opposition, Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not meet
and confer in good faith before filing this motion as required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  The court has reviewed the meet and confer
correspondence exchanged between counsel and finds that Plaintiff has shown
that it made “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040; Chan Decl., Ex. C [December 5, 2023 meet
and confer letter discussing issues with responses to document demands], Ex. D
[December 12, 2023 response letter stating that Defendant’s counsel “s[aw] no
need to submit supplemental responses as each of [the] objections are valid and
warranted”].)  The court therefore rules
on the merits of Plaintiff’s motion.
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further response to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 11, number 154 because Defendant’s representation of her
inability to comply with that demand is not incomplete, inadequate, or evasive since
it substantially complies with section 2031.230 by stating that (1) Defendant
is unable to comply with the demand because the requested category has never
existed, and (2) a diligent search and reasonable inquiry was made in an effort
to comply with the demand.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(2), 2031.230.) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 11, numbers 155-159 because (1) the objections in the responses
are without merit, and (2) to the extent that Defendant has attempted to assert
her inability to comply with those demands, such representations are incomplete
since they do not state all information required by section 2031.230.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (a)(2),
(a)(3).) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further response to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 11, number 160 because the court finds that the request is
overbroad since it calls for the production of documents and information that is
neither relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
In light of the mixed results
of the court’s ruling, the court finds that the circumstances presented would
make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies (1) Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions against Defendant, and (2) Defendant’s request
for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $35,268.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h), 2023.050,
subds. (a)(1), (c); Opp., p. 6:1-4.) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET 10
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling Defendant to
serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set 10, number
17.1, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the amount of $4,369.15.[2]
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 10, number 17.1 (as to Requests for
Admission, numbers 106-113) based on the court’s June 28, 2024 order granting
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to those Requests
for Admission.  (Mot., p. 3:22-25
[asserting that the subject interrogatory responds to Requests for Admission,
Set Nine]; June 28, 2024 Order, p. 5:3-8 [ordering Defendant to serve further
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set Nine, numbers 106-113].)
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions against Defendant unjust and therefore denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)

Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel further responses to requests for

complete answers to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s Form Interrogatories,
Set 10, number 17.1 as to Requests for Admission, Set Nine, numbers 106-113, which
comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days
of the date of service of this order. 
            The court denies plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.’s request for monetary sanctions. 
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
