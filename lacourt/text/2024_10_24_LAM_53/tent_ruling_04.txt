  Order RE:

  defendant’s
  demurrer to complaint
(2)  
  defendant’s
  motion to strike portions of complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Keurig Green
Mountain, Inc.        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        n/a
(1)  
Demurrer
to Complaint
(2)  
Motion
to Strike Portions of Complaint
Defendant Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“Defendant”) filed the pending
demurrer and motion to strike on June 18, 2024, directed to the Complaint filed
by plaintiff Aderiyike Lawal (“Plaintiff”). 
Plaintiff timely filed, at least nine court days before the hearing on
Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike, the operative First Amended
Complaint in this action.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 472, subd. (a) [“A party may amend its pleading once without leave of
court . . . after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the
demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike”], 1005, subd. (b) [all opposition papers shall be served and
filed at least nine court days before the hearing].) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike, directed
to the superseded Complaint, are moot.  (Hardell
v. Vanzyl (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 960, 968 [“‘Because there is but one
complaint in a civil action [citation], the filing of an amended complaint
moots a motion directed to a prior complaint’”] [internal citation omitted].)
The court therefore orders that defendant Keurig Green Mountain,
Inc.’s demurrer and motion to strike are taken off calendar as moot. 
            The court orders defendant Keurig
Green Mountain, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
