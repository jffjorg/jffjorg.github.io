Plaintiff alleges that in May 2007, she applied to CitiMortgage, Inc. for a refinance loan. (SAC ¶12.) In June 2007, CitiMortgage, Inc. approved Plaintiff’s loan for $310,000 secured by her home located at 26438 W. Kipling Place, Stevenson Ranch, CA 91381. (SAC ¶13.) In October 2014, CitiMortgage, Inc. executed a Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust transferring its interest in Plaintiff’s deed of trust to Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”). (SAC ¶14.) In May 2021, FNMA transferred its interest in the deed of trust to MTGLQ Investors, LP (“MTGLQ”). (SAC ¶15.) In May 2021, MTGLQ transferred its interest to  U.S. Bank Trust National Association as trustee of Tiki Series IV Trust (“USB”). (SAC ¶16.)In December 2019, Plaintiff began experiencing financial difficulties which worsened in 2020, rendering her unable to pay her installment payments to USB by and through their loan servicing agent, SN Servicing Corporation (“SNSC”). (SAC ¶¶17-18.) In January 2022, USB, SNSC, and a foreclosing trustee, Prestige Default Services, LLC (“Prestige”) placed the subject property in foreclosure proceedings. (SAC ¶19.) In May 2022, the foreclosing parties recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office, scheduling the sale for June 28, 2022. (SAC ¶20.) The sale was postponed to July 27, 2022. (SAC ¶21.) On July 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Chapter 13 voluntary bankruptcy petition to reorganize her debt and proposed to pay Defendants in installments over 60 months. (SAC ¶23.) In November 2022, USB, SNSC, and their bankruptcy counsel Ghidotti Berger LLP (“Ghidotti”) filed a Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay on the grounds that Plaintiff had failed to make her post-petition mortgage payments. (SAC ¶24.) USB represented there was no foreclosure action scheduled. (SAC ¶25.) Plaintiff’s counsel represented that Plaintiff was current with her mortgage payments. (SAC ¶26.) USB withdrew its Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay. (SAC ¶27.) In February 2023, Plaintiff failed to file her 2020 and 2021 income tax returns to the Chapter 13 Trustee, causing her case to be dismissed without prejudice. (SAC ¶28.) Throughout February 2023, Plaintiff and her counsel monitored the status of the foreclosure sale by calling the number listed on the Notice of Trustee Sale and through the online service, PropertyRadar, which showed the February 28, 2023 foreclosure sale was cancelled. (SAC ¶29.) In reliance on these representations, Plaintiff waited to file a second Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition on February 28, 2023. (SAC ¶30.) While giving notice of the petition to Defendants, Plaintiff discovered the house had been sold to Redwood Holdings, LLC (“Redwood”) in a foreclosure sale on the morning of February 28, 2023. (SAC ¶32.)Defendants alleged that they continued the foreclosure sale multiple times and provided written notice of the continuances via First-Class Mail. (SAC ¶36.) Plaintiff alleges that the tracking numbers for these notices do not exist. (SAC ¶¶37-38.) Plaintiff alleges she never received written notice regarding the new sale date and no public declaration of postponement. (SAC ¶39.) At the time of the sale, the fair market value of the subject property was $1.2 million. (SAC ¶43.) The property sold for $737,000 to Redwood. (SAC ¶43.) Defendant Meiyu Chen submitted a succeeding bid pursuant to Civ. Code, section 2924m in the sum of $751,000 and was issued a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale by USB and Prestige.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On March 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint. On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. On July 10, 2023, Defendants USB and SN Servicing Corporation filed a demurrer.On September 11, 2023, Defendant Meiyu Chen filed her demurrer and motion to strike.On October 17, 2023, the Court sustained USB and SN Servicing Corporation’s demurrer with leave to amend. The date for leave to amend would be discussed during the hearing scheduled January 30, 2024.DISCUSSION I. DemurrerDefendant Chen demurs to Plaintiff’s SAC on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to support each of her causes of action.A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).)a. Meet and ConferA party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a).) “The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a)(2).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., sections 430.41 (a)(4).)Here, Chen’s counsel testifies he discussed this demurrer and motion to strike with Plaintiff’s counsel and about the tender rule. (Rothman Decl., ¶2.) Chen satisfies meet and confer requirements.b. Judicial NoticeChen requests that the Court take judicial notice of the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale and related order showing the subject property was sold to Chen for $751,000 at public auction on February 28, 2023. The request is granted.c. DiscussionChen demurs to the SAC on the grounds that (1) the SAC does not allege that Plaintiff tendered the secured debt, (2) the cause of action for fraud is not pled with specificity, (3) the cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has no merit because it is based on information provided by a third party, and (4) the quiet title cause of action has no merit because Plaintiff has not alleged that she tendered the secured debt.The Court previously sustained a demurrer filed by USB and SN Servicing Corporation. Like USB and SN Servicing Corporation, Chen here demurs to the SAC on the grounds that the SAC fails to allege that Plaintiff tendered the secured debt. The tender rule applies to each cause of action because each claim is implicitly integrated with the foreclosure proceedings that Plaintiff is claiming were wrongful. Additionally, Chen demurs to the causes of action for fraud, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, to quiet title, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief on substantially the same grounds as USB and SN Servicing Corporation. The Court will adopt the same analysis as the October 17, 2023 ruling on the demurrer filed by USB and SN Servicing Corporation. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained in its entirety for the same reasons as articulated in the demurrer filed by USB and SN Servicing Corporation.Chen makes an additional argument that the cause of action for injunctive relief has no merit because Chen was a bona fide purchaser for value at the trustee sale. “The elements of bona fide purchase are payment of value, in good faith, and without actual or constructive notice of another's rights.”  (Gates Rubber Co. v. Ulman (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 356, 365 (emphasis in original).) “The absence of notice is an essential requirement in order that one may be regarded as a bona fide purchaser.”  (Id.)  A foreclose sale to a bona fide purchaser cannot be set aside “based on irregularities in the foreclosure sale process, except in the case of fraud.”  (Melendrez v. D & I Investment, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1256.)  “[A] bona fide purchaser is not chargeable with the fraud of his predecessors and takes a title purged of any anterior fraud affecting it and free from any equities existing between the original parties.”  (Id.) at 1256-57.  “The general unassailability of foreclosures promotes twin policies: [1] that a properly conducted sale be a final adjudication of the rights of the creditor and debtor and [2] that the sanctity of title of a bona fide purchaser be protected.”  (Id.) at 1257.  A bona fide purchaser of real property has constructive notice of only those matters that could be located by a diligent title search. (Vasquez v. LBS Financial Credit Union (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 97, 108.) Here, the Court took judicial notice of the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale for the February 2023 foreclosure sale showing Chen purchased the subject property for $751,000. Additionally, the SAC alleges that in February 2023, Plaintiff’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case had been dismissed. Although Plaintiff and her counsel monitored the status of the foreclosure sale, there are no allegations that Plaintiff recorded anything that would have given prospective buyers notice of her interest in the property. It is reasonable to infer that Chen had no notice of any further interest Plaintiff may have had in the property. Therefore, Chen is a bona fide purchaser, and the foreclosure sale may not be set aside. In any case, injunctive relief is not a standalone cause of action, but a remedy. Because the demurrer was sustained as to the first four causes of action, the demurrer is sustained as to this cause of action.II. Motion to StrikeChen also moves to strike the demands for damages and punitive damages in the SAC. Because Chen’s demurrer was sustained in its entirety, the motion is denied as moot.DATED: January 30, 2024__________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
