Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for summary adjudication filed by Hooman Enterprises, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Long Beach Industrial Partners, LLC (Defendant). The motion is granted because the Court finds that the Plaintiff was entitled to exercise the option to purchase the property and that the Defendant failed to honor the option. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff was not required to be in full possession of the premises when exercising the option, and that the Defendant's argument that full possession is the only consideration for granting the option is unpersuasive. The Court further finds that the extrinsic evidence presented by the Plaintiff uniformly favors their interpretation of the Lease and Addendum, and that the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff was in breach of the contract by performing unpermitted construction work is unpersuasive.
