And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to tax costs filed by Plaintiffs Flats Management Group, LLC and Simon A. Management, LLC as to LACMTA, which is not entitled to claim costs as a non-prevailing party, and in the amount of $17,579.51 as to the other defendants, leaving an overall cost award of $159,855.38.

The judge also grants the motion to tax costs filed by the defendants Skanska Traylor Shea, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, and City of Beverly Hills as to all costs sought against the defendants Skanska Traylor Shea and the City of Beverly Hills, and as to LACMTA in the amount of $10,349.00, leaving a costs award of $17,574.68.

The judge ruled that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties as to LACMTA, as they have obtained a "net monetary recovery" against that defendant, and therefore are entitled to recover their costs against that defendant. The judge also ruled that the other defendants are prevailing parties "as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant," and are therefore entitled to recover their costs against Plaintiffs.

The judge further ruled that costs incurred by prevailing defendants must be reasonably necessary to their conduct of the litigation, and that the prevailing defendants can recover their reasonable costs, at least as to those costs incurred on or before May 24, 2023, when nonsuit was entered in their favor.
