And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Bob Yari, Dennis Brown, Persik Productions, Inc., YFG Services, Inc., Stratus Film Company, LLC, Bob Yari Music, LLC, Schizophrenic Productions, LLC, BY Equities LLC, and Davand Holdings, LLC, have moved for attorney fees in the amount of $49,601.55. The court grants the motion. The defendants have prevailed in litigation and are entitled to fees under the operating agreement. The court rejects the plaintiffs' arguments that the fee provision in the operating agreement only applies to disputes between the company and members, or among members, and that the defendants have not presented evidence that any attorney fees were actually incurred. The court also finds that the fee invoices are reasonably specific and do not prevent effective analysis of the fees incurred.
