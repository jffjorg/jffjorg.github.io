[1] The Court notes the causes of action as numbered in
Defendant’s notice of motion do not correspond to the causes of action numbered
in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  Plaintiff’s
cause of action for religious discrimination in violation of FEHA is the 2nd
cause of action (not the 1st cause of action). 
Plaintiff’s cause of action for retaliation in violation of FEHA is the 3rd
cause of action, and Plaintiff’s cause of action for violation of the Labor
Code is the 4th cause of action (not the 2nd and 3rd causes of action,
respectively).  Plaintiff’s cause of
action for failure to accommodate in violation of FEHA is the 5th cause of
action (not the 4th cause of action). 
Finally, Plaintiff’s cause of action for failure to prevent
discrimination in violation of FEHA is the 6th cause of action (not the 5th
cause of action).
 


[2] Counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant are admonished
for not including the procedural history of the causes of action and the effect
of the stipulation on the remaining causes of action in the Complaint.  This omission from counsels’ papers wasted
judicial resources, particularly in light of the fact this matter was
reassigned to a new judicial officer after the stipulation was granted.


[3] The Court notes the case cited in Defendant’s reply, Jackson
v. City of Los Angeles (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 769, involves a similar disciplinary
proceeding and provision of the City of Los Angeles Charter, but does not
address the issue presented here of whether Plaintiff’s failure to appear at
the Board hearing precludes him from asserting the instant cause of action.
