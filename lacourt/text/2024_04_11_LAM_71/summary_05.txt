And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge notes that the causes of action in the Defendant's notice of motion do not correspond to the causes of action in the Plaintiff's Complaint. The judge clarifies the causes of action, stating that the 2nd cause of action is for religious discrimination, the 3rd for retaliation, the 4th for violation of the Labor Code, the 5th for failure to accommodate, and the 6th for failure to prevent discrimination.

The judge admonishes counsel for not including the procedural history of the causes of action and the effect of the stipulation on the remaining causes of action in the Complaint, which wasted judicial resources. The judge also notes that a case cited by the Defendant, Jackson v. City of Los Angeles, involves a similar disciplinary proceeding, but does not address the issue presented in this case.
