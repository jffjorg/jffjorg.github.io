And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted against the defendant, Rob Bonta, Acting as California Attorney General for the State of California. The plaintiff, Sophia Henry, has not properly served the summons and complaint on Bonta, and therefore cannot serve discovery on him. The judge notes that the plaintiff has filed a motion to compel answers to interrogatories from Bonta and another defendant, but takes that motion off calendar due to the lack of proper service. The plaintiff must properly serve the summons and complaint before serving discovery on any defendant.
