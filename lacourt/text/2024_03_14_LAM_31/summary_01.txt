Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, PLM Lender Services, Inc., and Secured Income Fund-II, LLC, to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Bay Area Development Co. The defendants argue that the allegations against them are uncertain and unclear. The judge agrees and sustains the demurrer, but grants leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff is ordered to serve and file a Second Amended Complaint within 20 days of the order. The judge finds that the allegations against the defendants are uncertain and unclear because they do not explain how the defendants frustrated the satisfaction of the forbearance agreement if the plaintiff intended to obtain the $100,000 from escrow but the house was to close after the expiration of the forbearance agreement. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's argument that the defendants would be flexible with meeting payment deadlines is unpersuasive. The judge concludes that the demurrer must be sustained, but leave to amend is granted.
