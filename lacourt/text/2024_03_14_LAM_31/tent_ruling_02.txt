MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Sophia Henry
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
 
On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff, Sophia Henry, filed this
action against Defendant Rob Bonta, acting as California Attorney General for
the State of (“Bonta”) , among other defendants, arising from the denial of
Plaintiff’s Paid Family Leave claim. 
Plaintiff is self-represented. 
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for an
order establishing admissions in the Requests for Admissions, Set One, against Bonta.
 
 
This motion is improper. 
“Every section of the Discovery Act pertaining to any method of discovery
enumerated in § 2019.010 et seq. is subject to a holding period after service
on a defendant (or requires that the party to whom the discovery is directed
has been served with the summons and complaint). [California Shellfish, Inc.
v. United Shellfish Co. (1997) 56 CA4th 16, 22, 64 CR2d 797, 799].”  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 8:39.6.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has not affected proper service of the
summons and complaint on Bonta.  (See
Notice of Rejection Default/Clerk’s Judgment, 3/05/24.)  Because Plaintiff has not properly served
Bonta with the summons and complaint, Plaintiff may not serve discovery on
Bonta, let alone file a motion to compel answers to discovery, or as here, deem
requests for admissions admitted against Bonta. 

 
            Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED without prejudice.  Plaintiff
must properly serve the summons and complaint prior to serving discovery on
Defendant Bonta, or on any other defendant named in this matter. 
            The court
further notes that Plaintiff has filed a motion to compel answers to
interrogatories from Defendant Bonta and Defendant Ana M. Lasso, acting as
Director of Department of General Services of Risk and Insurance Management for
State of California, Employment Development Department.  That motion is scheduled for April 18,
2024.  Given that Plaintiff has not
properly served any defendant in this action, the court takes the April 18,
2024, motion off calendar. 
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.
