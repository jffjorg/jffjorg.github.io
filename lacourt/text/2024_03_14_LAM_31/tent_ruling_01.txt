RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Bay
Area Development Co.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND 
 
            On October
4, 2022, Plaintiff, Bay Area Development Co., filed this action against
Defendants Secured Income Fund-11, LLC (“Secured Income”); PLM Lender Services,
Inc. (“PLM Lender”); Mo Taxon; and Fedora Taxon.  The operative complaint is the First Amended
Complaint (FAC).  The FAC alleges causes
of action for (1) Intentional Interference with Contract, (2) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Declaratory Relief, (4) Unjust
Enrichment, (5) Breach of Implied Terms of Written Forbearance, (6) Breach of
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (7) Interference with
Contract, and (8) Declaratory Relief.  The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes
of Action are asserted against Secured Income and PLM Lender only.
 
            The FAC
alleges as follows.  Plaintiff obtained a
loan in the amount of $725,000 from Secured Income, the repayment of which was
secured by a Deed of Trust recorded against the real property located at 419
North Highland Ave., Los Angeles, CA.  Within
two years, Plaintiff defaulted on its obligations owing on the loan.  In August 2021, Plaintiff, Secured Income,
through its agent, PLM Lender, entered into a forbearance agreement whereby the
latter agreed to refrain from foreclosing for a period of ninety (90) days.  On July 13, 2022, the parties entered into
another forbearance agreement providing for the foreclosure to remain on hold
until at least August 1, 2022.  
 
Later in July 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written
agreement with a third-party buyer of the Property, which would have resulted
in the balance owing on the Loan being paid in full.  In order to buy time for the sale to close
before the foreclosure sale, Plaintiff negotiated a further postponement on the
foreclosure sale by offering to immediately pay down the balance due by
$100,000.  PLM Lender accepted the
agreement.  Pursuant to the agreement,
the parties executed a new (third) forbearance agreement which provided in
relevant part that (1) PLM Lender must be in receipt of the (third) signed forbearance
agreement before August 2, 2022; and (2) PLM must be in receipt of the sum of
$100,475 on or before August 2, 2022. 
Satisfaction of both terms would trigger a postponement of the
foreclosure sale.  However, Plaintiff did
not return the signed forbearance agreement nor tender the payment before the
forbearance deadline.  On August 4, 2022,
Secured Income and PLM Lender proceeded with the foreclosure sale and sold the
subject property for half its value.  Plaintiff
alleges the failure to tender the $100k payment was due to Secured Income and
PLM Lender proceeding to foreclosure before Plaintiff could convince the
buyer/escrow to release $100,000 to Plaintiff. 
As a result, Plaintiff lost equity of approximately one million
dollars.  
 
On October 27, 2023, PLM Lender and Secured Income (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed this demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.
 
            Plaintiff
filed an opposition.  Defendants replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿ “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.¿ We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also
consider matters which may be judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)¿ Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 452.)¿ In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific
factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)¿¿  
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)¿“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”¿(Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual allegations
sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a
demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to
amend.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)¿¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION 
 
Meet and Confer  
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party Regarding Meet and
Confer, 10/27/23.)  
 
Analysis 
 
            The FAC alleges
the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action against Defendants only.  Defendants argue the allegations asserted
against them are uncertain.  The court
agrees.  The gravamen of Plaintiff’s
claims against Defendants is that Defendants frustrated the third-party sale of
the subject property by proceeding with the foreclosure sale before Plaintiff
could secure $100,000 from the third-party sale so that Defendants could
provide the money to satisfy the forbearance agreement.   As
alleged, return of a signed forbearance agreement and payment of the $100,000 by
August 2, 2022 was required to postpone the foreclosure sale long enough to
permit the pending third-party sale of the subject property.  (FAC, ¶ 49.) Plaintiff did not return a
signed forbearance agreement by August 2, 2022. 
(FAC, ¶ 51.)  Plaintiff did not tender
the $100,000 payment by August 2, 2022. 
(Id.)   Plaintiff did not
satisfy the terms of the agreement.  Under these allegations, any defendant would
be hard-pressed to understand what allegations they are called to answer.  Plaintiff does not explain how Defendants
frustrated the satisfaction of the forbearance agreement if Plaintiff intended
to obtain the $100,000 from escrow but the house was to close after the
expiration of the forbearance agreement.  Hence, the uncertainty.  
 
            Plaintiff argues
it was understood Defendants would be flexible with meeting payment deadlines
and had every reason to believe there would not be any problem if payment were
received on August 3 or 4, 2022. 
However, Defendants proceeded to the foreclosure sale without notifying
Plaintiff that the forbearance agreement had not been completed.   
 
Plaintiff’s argument is unpersuasive.  First, these allegations do not appear
anywhere in the FAC and therefore may not be considered in ruling on this
demurrer.  Second, the allegations clearly
state the terms of agreement: return of the signed agreement and payment of
$100,000 by August 2, 2022.  Plaintiff
did not comply with those terms.  As
pleaded, the Demurrer must be sustained, but leave to amend is granted. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Defendants PLM Lender’s and Secured Income’s demurrer to the
First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED.  Leave
to amend is GRANTED.  
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to serve and file its Second Amended Complaint within 20 days of
this order.  
 
Defendants to give notice.
