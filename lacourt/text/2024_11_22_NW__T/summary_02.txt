And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of whether the case will proceed to a jury trial or a bench trial. There are two remaining viable claims: the third claim for UCL (Unfair Competition Law) against all defendants and the fifth claim for Intentional Interference with Prospective Econ Adv against Doe 1 only. The demurrer did not place into issue the fifth claim for interference, and the plaintiff failed to identify Doe 1 in a Doe Amendment. The judge concludes that the UCL claim is the only claim that could go to trial and that it requires a bench trial due to its equitable remedies. The plaintiff argued that the UCL claim is for damages and not equitable in nature, but the judge finds this contention to be incorrect and unsupported by legal authority.
