 Case Number:  23VECV02529    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02529
Barkhordari v Eshagian
On the OSC
re: Jury v Bench Trial for 23VECV02529 Barkhordari v Eshaghian, there are two
remaining viable COAs as a result of the 11/15/23 ruling on the demurrer:  the third COA for UCL against ALL Defendants
and the fifth COA for Intentional Interference with Prospective Econ Adv
against Doe 1 only.  The demurrer did not
place into issue the fifth COA for Interference. 

Plaintiff
never filed a Doe Amendment identifying Doe 1. 
Doe Defendants will be dismissed prior to trial. Interference does not
appear to be a viable trial issue.

Whether the
matter is to go to jury or bench trial hinges on the third COA for UCL because
the procedural standing of the case appears to show that the UCL COA is the
only claim that could go to trial.  As
argued by Defendant, UCL's remedies are equitable in nature: restitution and
injunctive relief.  UCL requires a bench
trial, as cited in Defendant's case law. 


Plaintiff
argued that the UCL COA is for damages and not equitable in nature.  Plaintiff failed to present any legal
authority to support such a contention.  Plaintiff’s
contention is incorrect.  UCL remedies
are always equitable.
