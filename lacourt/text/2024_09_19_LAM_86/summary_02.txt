And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to compel compliance with subpoenas. The first motion is to compel Nonparty FirstLegal to comply with a subpoena duces tecum, which requests the deposition transcript of Robin Cannon, former president of Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles. The judge denies this motion because the subpoena was not served personally, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 1987. The second motion is to compel Nonparty Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to comply with a subpoena duces tecum, which requests the technical evaluation of the Carver Middle School Artificial Turf Soccer Field Joint Use Agreement between the Los Angeles School District and Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles. The judge denies this motion because the subpoena was not served personally, and LAUSD's requested technical evaluation is confidential under Education Code § 35401(c).
