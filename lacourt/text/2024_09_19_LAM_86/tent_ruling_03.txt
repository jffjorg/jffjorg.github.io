[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Paul John Denham petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent George
Gascon to review his conviction of murder and attempted murder, pursuant to
petitioner’s January 13, 2021 and February 1, 2021 applications to the Los
Angeles County District Attorney Office’s Conviction Integrity Unit. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Petitioner’s
Underlying Conviction
            
On
February 6, 1998, petitioner Paul John Denham was convicted of murder and
attempted murder in People v. Denham, Los Angeles Superior Court Case
No. NA031090. (Pet. ¶ 7; Ans. ¶ 7.) County of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department
employees
Dale Higashi and Michelle Lepisto provided forensic analysis and evidence
during petitioner’s criminal proceeding. (Resp. RJN Ex. 2 at 90-104.) Mr.
Higashi testified that a bullet recovered as evidence bore markings consistent
with having been fired from a firearm recovered from Mr. Denham, while Ms.
Lepisto testified that yellow duct tape used to make a homemade silencer was an
exact match for a roll of yellow duct tape recovered from petitioner. (Resp.
RJN Ex. 2 at 121-22, 126-28 [HT 92:6-93:20, 97:25-99:27].) Petitioner appealed
his conviction, which was affirmed with modifications by the Second District
Court of Appeal. (Resp. RJN Ex. 3 at 145-46.)
 
B.          
Petitioner’s
Post-Conviction Challenges and Requests for Discovery
 
Since
having been convicted, petitioner has filed 21 appellate challenges to his
conviction or the denial of his repeated requests for post-conviction
discovery. (Resp. RJN Exs. 4-24.) This includes several petitions for writ of
mandamus challenging orders issued by Judge Laura Laesecke, denying his
requests for post-conviction discovery. (Resp. RJN Exs. 20, 22, 23.)
 
Review
of minute orders in petitioner’s underlying criminal matter further confirms
that petitioner has been engaged in extensive post-conviction litigation
leading up to his filing of the instant Petition, as well as civil litigation
to obtain additional evidence. On September 22, 2020, petitioner filed a
request for the appointment of counsel to investigate and, if appropriate, file
a motion for DNA testing. (Resp. RJN Ex. 25 at 276.) Counsel was appointed and,
following investigation, filed the motion on February 16, 2021. (Resp. RJN Ex.
25 at 276-77.) On May 4, 2022, at the request of petitioner’s counsel, the
motion for DNA testing was withdrawn. (Resp. RJN Ex. 26 at 280.) 
 
On
June 16, 2022, petitioner also filed a motion for disclosure of reports, in
which petitioner sought chain of custody reports, lab reports, police reports,
firearms identification reports, and photographs, as well as notes prepared in
connection with scientific testing and the location of biological and physical
evidence. (Resp. RJN Ex. 26 at 280.) The motion was denied. (Resp. RJN Ex. 27
at 285.) In ruling on the motion, the criminal court expressly noted that the
motion referenced a previously denied motion pursuant to Penal Code section
1054.9, which Judge Laesecke refused to entertain and revisit. (RJN Ex. 26 at
280-81.) At the same time, the criminal court granted petitioner’s request to
view and copy trial exhibits from his underlying criminal matter. (Resp. RJN
Ex. 27 at 285.) On October 18, 2022, the criminal court ordered the release of
ballistic evidence for testing. (RJN Ex. 28.)
 
On
July 7, 2022, petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate in the matter Paul
John Denham v. George Gascon, LASC Case No. 22STCP01938. (Resp. RJN Ex.
29.) On September 26, 2023, the Petition was granted. (Resp. RJN Ex. 30.)
Respondent produced responsive documents on October 10, 2023, consisting of documents
reflecting criminal matters prosecuted by Judge Laesecke at the time she was a Deputy
District Attorney for Los Angeles County, in which either Mr. Higashi or Ms.
Lepisto had testified. (Resp. RJN Exs. 30, 31.)
 
C.          
Conviction
Integrity Unit
 
            Respondent George Gascon is the
District Attorney for Los Angeles County (“LADA”). (Ans. ¶ 3.) On December 7,
2020, respondent ratified Special Directive 20-13, which announced policies
governing the Conviction Integrity Unit (“CIU”). (Pet. ¶ 9; Ans. ¶ 9.) 
 
The
CIU conducts “strategically collaborative, good-faith case reviews designed to
ensure the integrity of challenged convictions, remedy wrongful convictions,
and take any remedial measures necessary to correct injustices uncovered,
within the bounds of the law.” (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 321.) “The CIU has a broad
mandate to review a wide range of issues relating to wrongful convictions but
shall prioritize claims of actual innocence brought by individuals who are
currently in custody.” (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 322.)
 
Special
Directive 20-13 provides that the CIU “will operate independently from litigation
units in the office….” (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 321.) “The CIU shall be an
independent unit that reports directly to the District Attorney or his designee.”
(Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 322.) “The CIU has a broad mandate to review a wide range
of issues relating to wrongful convictions but shall prioritize claims of
actual innocence brought by individuals who are currently in custody. The CIU
shall not reject any case because…an appeal is pending [or] the case is in
active litigation….” (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 322.) 
 
Under
Special Directive 20-13, the CIU “shall accept for review” cases where (1) the
applicant was prosecuted by LADA, (2) there is a claim of actual innocence or
wrongful conviction, and (3) the CIU identifies one or more avenues of investigation
that have the potential to substantiate the applicant’s claims. (Resp. RJN Ex.
32 at 322-23.) 
 
The
CIU also may undertake review “in the interests of justice,” which “may” be met
where the applicant alleges and/or the CIU concludes that further investigation
is warranted. (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 323.) The CIU may not reject an application
based on high-risk factors without meaningful review and investigation. (Resp.
RJN Ex. 32 at 323-24.) High-risk factors include claims that the conviction was
obtained via fabricated evidence, the concealment of exculpatory evidence,
misconduct at trial, or where defense counsel presented no evidence to counter
the prosecution’s case at trial. (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 324-25 [Nos. 4 and 16].)
 
D.          
Resentencing
Unit
 
The
Resentencing Unit (“RU”) was formed to undertake independent review of all
existing sentences for persons who have already served 15 years or more in
prison. (Resp. RJN Ex. 33 at 336.) All persons who have served 15 years or more
of their sentence are entitled to an expedited review of their current
sentence. (Resp. RJN Ex. 33 at 340.) Per statistics available as of December
2020, there were 9,364 such cases prosecuted by LADA. (Resp. RJN Ex. 33 at 335,
340, 344.) Beginning in 2022, the RU expanded its mission to include
independent review of all existing sentences for persons who have already
served 10 years or more in prison. (Resp. RJN Ex. 34 at 350, 354.) Relying on
the same December 2020 data, this expanded the pool of cases requiring
independent RU review to 14,487. (Resp. RJN Ex. 33 at 335, 340, 344.) Consequently,
the RU prioritizes reviews for persons convicted as minors and adults over the
age of 50 who are incarcerated for a non-violent felony. (Resp. RJN Ex. 35 at 357.)
 
 
E.          
Petitioner’s
Request for Conviction Review
 
On
January 13, 2021, petitioner submitted an application to respondent to
investigate his 1998 criminal conviction. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. B to Ex 1
at 31-103.) Petitioner asserted that his conviction resulted from the false
testimony of Long Beach Detective Bryan McMahon and Los Angeles County
Sheriff’s Department criminal forensic experts Michelle Lepisto and Dale
Higashi, as well as the concealment of exculpatory evidence which was belatedly
disclosed from 2013-2015. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. B to Ex 1 at 32-33.) 
 
On
February 1, 2021, petitioner supplemented his request. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 &
Ex. C to Ex 1 at 105-07.) Petitioner noted that his criminal conviction is
“borne from official misconduct” “requiring meaningful review and investigation”
“as outlined in [respondent’s] Special Directive.” (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex.
C to Ex 1 at 106.) Petitioner argued that “physical evidence…has the potential
to substantiate [petitioner’s] claim of actual innocence because favorable
results will show: [¶] (A) The state’s criminalist altered crime scene evidence
on silencer to manufacture a match with [petitioner] that otherwise would not
exist, then introduced false testimony; [¶] (B) State’s ballistician introduced
false testimony regarding [ballistics] from [petitioner] matching crime scene
ballistics; and [¶] (C) Lead detectives manufactured handwritten document and
introduced false testimony that they discovered the document in [petitioner’s]
belongings. The document inferred that [petitioner] planned flights into the
Los Angeles area to commit the murder.” (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. C to Ex 1
at 105-06.) Petitioner asserted that his case was prosecuted with LADA and that
he is “actually innocent of the 1995 attempted murder and March 1995 murder of
Edward Weinman that [he] was convicted of in 1998.” (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex.
C to Ex 1 at 105.)
 
F.          
Resentencing
Unit’s Independent Review
 
On
March 4, 2021, respondent directed a letter to petitioner advising him that his
case was being considered for resentencing pursuant to Special Directives
providing for an “unprecedented effort to re-evaluate and resentence thousands
of cases.” (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. D to Ex 1 at 109.) However, respondent
advised petitioner of “an enormous backlog of existing cases from the prior administration,”
and stated that petitioner would be contacted once his case fell within the
list of cases being prioritized. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. D to Ex 1 at 109.)
A similar letter followed in July 2021. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. D to Ex 1
at 111.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
May 23, 2023, petitioner Paul John Denham filed a verified Petition for Writ of
Mandate. On January 18, 2024, respondent filed an Answer.
 
            On
March 13, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On April 19, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On May 15, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. 
 
            On
June 18, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the instant Petition. The
Court ordered respondent to file a sur-reply to address two issues: (1) whether
voluntarily instituting Special Directive 20-13 created any ministerial duty;
and (2) if any ministerial duty was created, whether respondent failed to
perform it. The Court also allowed petitioner to file a response to the
sur-reply. 
 
            On
July 12, 2024, respondent filed a sur-reply. On July 29, 2024, petitioner filed
a response to the sur-reply. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
CCP
§ 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.” “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is
that an agency has failed to act as required by law.” (California Assn. for
Health Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 696, 705.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally
bears the burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v.
State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency's action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law.” (Ideal
Boat & Camper Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301,
311, citing Pomona Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 578, 584.) In independently reviewing legal questions, “An
administrative agency's interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is
entitled to consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) An agency is presumed to have regularly
performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Evidentiary
Matters
 
Respondent’s
requests for judicial notice are ruled on as follows:
            
Exhibits
1, 3-28, and 30
– GRANTED (Evid. Code § 452(d).)
 
            Exhibits 2 and 29 – GRANTED,
but only for the existence of the documents and not the truth of the matters
asserted therein. (See Evid. Code § 452(d); Sosinsky v. Grant
(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1564-69.)
 
Exhibits
32-35 – GRANTED
(Evid. Code § 452(b).)
 
Petitioner’s
evidentiary objections are ruled on as follows:
 
Nos.
1 and 2 –
OVERRULED because arguments in respondent’s opposition is not evidence that is
subject to striking. (See Hebberd-Kulow Enterprises,
Inc. v. Kelomar, Inc. (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 272, 283 [“An attorney's argument in pleadings is not evidence”].)

 
No.
3 – OVERRULED because
information relating to petitioner’s criminal conviction is relevant background
information.
 
            No. 4 – OVERRULED because
information and exhibits relating to petitioner’s post-conviction challenges
are relevant to background of proceedings.
 
            Petitioner’s requests for judicial
notice as to Exhibits 1-3 are GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d). 
 
B.          
Merits
            
Petitioner
seeks traditional mandate relief under CCP § 1085. (Pet. ¶ 4; Opening Br. at
6:19-27.) A writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is
available when: (1) the petitioner has “no plain, speedy, and adequate
alternative remedy”; (2) the respondent has “a clear, present and usually
ministerial duty to perform”; and (3) the petitioner has “a clear, present and
beneficial right to performance.” (Conlan v. Bonta (2002) 102
Cal.App.4th 745, 751-52.)
 
“A ministerial act is an
act that a public officer is required to perform in a prescribed manner in
obedience to the mandate of legal authority and without regard to his own
judgment or opinion concerning such act’s propriety or impropriety, when a
given state of facts exists.” (CV Amalgamated LLC v. City of Chula Vista
(2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 265, 279, quoting Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County
Union High School Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916, internal quotations
omitted.) “‘Discretionary acts are those wherein there
is no hard and fast rule as to the course of conduct that one must or must not
take and, if there is a clearly defined rule, such would eliminate discretion.’
[Citation.]” (Redwood Coast Watersheds Alliance v. State Bd. of Forestry and
Fire Protection (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 962, 970.) “A ‘published
procedure’ adopted by a public entity which provides that the public entity
will do a certain thing (such as calculate, in a particular manner, a bid with
an apparent discrepancy in it) can provide the basis for a ministerial duty
that may be enforced by means of a writ of mandate.” (Galzinski v. Somers
(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 1164, 1172, citing Pozar v. Department of
Transportation (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 269.) 
 
Under
Special Directive 20-13, the Conviction Integrity Unit “shall accept for
review” cases where (1) the applicant was prosecuted by LADA, (2) there is a
claim of actual innocence or wrongful conviction, and (3) the CIU identifies
one or more avenues of investigation that have the potential to substantiate
the applicant’s claims. (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 322-23.) The first two elements to
obtain review by the CIU are not in dispute. (See Opp. at 6:15.)
Petitioner was prosecuted and convicted by LADA. (Pet. ¶ 7; Ans. ¶ 7.) Petitioner
also claims that he is actually innocent and wrongfully convicted based on fabricated
evidence and concealment of exculpatory evidence. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. B
to Ex 1 at 32-33; Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. C to Ex 1 at 105-06.)
 
With
respect to the third element to obtain review, respondent contends that
petitioner fails to identify a ministerial duty because the third element
requires the CIU to exercise its discretion in determining whether “one or more
avenues of investigation…have the potential to substantiate” petitioner’s
claims of actual innocence and wrongful conviction. Respondent also argues that
the district attorney exercises discretion in implementing Special Directive
20-13. (See Gov. Code § 26500.5 [“The district attorney may
sponsor, supervise, or participate in any project or program to improve the
administration of justice”].) Respondent is correct insofar as the third
element is discretionary in that the CIU is charged with identifying whether
one or more avenues of investigation have the potential to substantiate
petitioner’s claims.  (See Resp.
RJN Ex. 32 at 323.)  It is
well-established that this Court “could not compel the [government entity]
through mandamus to exercise its discretion in any particular manner.” (Los
Angeles Waterkeeper v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 230, 278.)
 
However,
it is also true that “a court may issue a writ of mandamus to compel some
action when an agency has failed to exercise its discretion at all.”  (Los Angeles Waterkeeper, 92
Cal.App.5th at 278, emphasis in original.) 
Here, respondent has made no decision on whether to accept petitioner’s
case for review at all. Petitioner sent his applications for conviction review
on January 13, 2021 and February 1, 2021. (Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. B to Ex 1
at 31-103; Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. C to Ex 1 at 105-06.)  For over three and one-half years, respondent
has failed to act.  (Denham Decl. ¶ 2
& Ex. D to Ex 1 at 109 [March 2021 letter]; Denham Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. D to
Ex 1 at 111 [July 2021 letter].)
 
The
Court recognizes that Special Directive 20-13 does not identify a timeframe for
acceptance or rejection of review.  Were
it otherwise, surely this Court could command respondent to make a decision in
accordance with the required time frame. (State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Workers'
Comp. Appeals Bd. (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 349, 370 [“[W]here an
administrative body is required to act within a specified time and it fails to
do so, a writ of mandate will lie to compel the body to act”]; see, e.g.,
California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd.
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1148 [holding that time limits of Government Code §
18671.1 “are directory” and “may be enforced by petition for writ of mandate to
compel the Board to hear and decide a case”].)
 
Nonetheless,
even though the absence of any mandated time frame would seem to render the
timing within which respondent must make its determination discretionary,[1]
the exercise of such discretion is not unbounded. A traditional writ of mandate
is available not just to enforce ministerial duties but also “when a public
agency has abused its discretion in carrying out a discretionary function.” (CV
Amalgamated LLC v. City of Chula Vista (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 265, 279.)
“Mandamus may also issue to correct the exercise of discretionary legislative
power, but only where the action amounts to an abuse of discretion as a matter
of law because it is so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary.” (Ellena v.
Department of Ins. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 198, 206.) Thus, while the
determination of which requests for conviction review merit consideration or
are entitled to priority involves the exercise of discretion, respondent cannot
delay exercising such discretion in perpetuity.
 
Here,
respondent has failed to act for years, and respondent’s only proffered reason
for that failure is the claim that it is awaiting the outcome of petitioner’s request
for DNA testing pursuant to Penal Code section 1405. (Carrillo Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.)  That stated reason is based on a demonstrably
false premise.  As petitioner points out
in response to respondent’s sur-reply, his counsel withdrew the DNA request on
May 4, 2022. (Resp. RJN Ex. 26 at 280.)  Accordingly,
given the multi-year delay and erroneous explanation for the failure to act,
the Court concludes under the circumstances that respondent’s decision to delay
acting on petitioner’s applications is arbitrary, capricious, and entirely
without evidentiary support.[2]
(See Alameda Health System v. Alameda County Employees' Retirement Assn.
(2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 1159, 1177.)


 
V.      Conclusion
 
For
the foregoing reasons, in light of respondent’s failure to exercise its
discretion whether to accept petitioner case for review within a time frame
that is not arbitrary or capricious, the Court concludes that petitioner has
demonstrated a basis for issuance of a traditional writ of mandate.[3]

 
The petition is GRANTED.  Judgment shall issue in accordance herewith,
directing issuance of a writ of mandate requiring respondent to make a
determination whether to accept petitioner’s case for review in accordance with
Special Directive 20-13 within 90 days.
