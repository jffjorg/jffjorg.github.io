FOR RIGHT TO ATTACH ORDER

Case:                           Teichman
Enterprises, Inc. v. 4Front California Capital Holdings, Inc. et al. (23STCV23660)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Teichman Enterprises, Inc.’s Renewed Applications
for Right to Attach Orders Against: (1) 4Front California Capital Holdings,
Inc.; and (2) 4Front Ventures Corporation, Inc. are DENIED. 
 
On 3/21/24, the Court heard plaintiff’s applications for
right to attach orders against defendants 4Front California Capital Holdings,
Inc. and 4Front Ventures Corporation, Inc. The Court denied the applications
because plaintiff did not set forth the basis on which it calculated the
proposed amount of attachment. Plaintiff now files renewed applications against
the same defendants setting forth how it calculated the $2,923,293.62 it
proposes to be attached.  
 
CCP § 1008(b) allows a party to file a renewed motion “upon
new or different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (CCP § 1008(b).) The supporting affidavit must
show “what ‘new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed’
[citation] to justify the renewed application, and show diligence with a
satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new or different information
earlier.” (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire
Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 833, citing CCP § 1008(b).) 
 
The renewed applications do not comport with the
requirements of CCP § 1008(b). The supporting declaration makes no reference to
the prior applications, nor the order made thereon. (See generally Teichman
Decl.) The supporting declaration also does not state what new or different
facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. The Master Lease (dated
12/1/18), Addendum to the Master Lease (dated 1/17/19), Escrow Agreement (dated
1/28/19), Expansion Amendment (dated 3/21/19), First Amendment to the Master
Lease (dated 5/22/20), and Second Amendment to the Master Lease (dated 5/10/23),
pursuant to which plaintiff calculated the amount owed by defendants, existed
prior to the hearing on plaintiff’s previous applications. (See Teichman
Decl. ¶¶ 4-36 & Exs. 1-6; Memo. at 3:18-4:19 [table showing calculation of
proposed amount of attachment].) Accordingly, the Court does not have
jurisdiction under CCP § 1008(b) to reconsider the denial of the prior right to
attach applications. (See CCP § 1008(e) [“This section specifies the
court’s jurisdiction with regard to applications for reconsideration of its
orders and renewals of previous motions, and applies to all applications to
reconsider any order of a judge or court, or for the renewal of a previous
motion, whether the order deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or
final”].) 
 
Even if the Court had jurisdiction to hear a renewed motion,
whether to grant the motion would still be within the Court’s discretion. (Film
Packages, Inc. v. Brandywine Film Productions, Ltd. (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d
824, 830.) Because petitioner’s counsel does not provide any reason why the
failure to explain how it calculated its proposed amount of attachment in the
prior applications was excusable, the Court would decline to exercise such
discretion. Unlike, for example, the second application for a right to attach
order in Film Packages, where the applicant presented transcripts of
depositions taken after the prior attachment hearing (Film Packages, 193
Cal.App.3d at 829), the information plaintiff finally presents to this Court to
establish the requested amount of attachment in the renewed application was
readily available when
plaintiff made the prior failed applications. When denying
the prior applications, the Court explained:
 
“[I]t is plaintiff’s burden to set
forth the basis on which its damages can be computed. Instead, plaintiff merely
states in conclusory fashion the amount off unpaid rent and license fees
without reference to the contract or any meaningful computation from which this
Court could determine to what attachment, if any, plaintiff may be entitled.”
 
(3/21/24 Ruling at 4.) 
Plaintiff cannot return six-months later with neither acknowledgment nor
explanation of the prior shortcomings and why plaintiff is entitled to a second
opportunity.
 
The applications are DENIED.
