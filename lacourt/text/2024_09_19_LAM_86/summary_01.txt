And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Receiver's motion to terminate the Lease Agreement between the Receiver and the Tenants. The Receiver has been unable to sell the Property due to the Tenants' refusal to vacate the property, and the Lease Agreement is not commercially reasonable or beneficial to the operation of the Receivership Estate. The Judge has declined to consider the Tenants' opposition to the motion, which was filed three court days before the hearing. The Judge has determined that the Receiver is authorized to terminate the Lease Agreement and has granted the motion in part. The Judge has also ordered the termination of the Lease Agreement as of November 16, 2024, which is 120 days from the date of delivery of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw to the Los Angeles Housing Department.
