And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling considers the arguments presented by the Respondent regarding the processing of review requests by the Commission for the Investigation of Unlawful Conduct (CIU). The Respondent argues that the CIU cannot immediately process all review requests and must evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis. The Judge notes that this delay is arbitrary and capricious, as the CIU is required to pay special attention to cases where the applicant claims the conviction was obtained from fabricated evidence or the concealment of exculpatory evidence. The Respondent also argues that petitions for habeas corpus provide an adequate remedy at law, and since a writ of traditional mandate is available, the petitioner is not required to resort to a writ of habeas corpus.
