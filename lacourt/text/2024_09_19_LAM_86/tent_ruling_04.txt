[1]           As respondent rightly points out, the CIU “cannot
immediately process all review requests and instead must evaluate each request
on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the request/claim merits
consideration or is entitled to priority.” (Carrillo Decl. ¶ 8.) 
 


[2]           Indeed, the arbitrary and capricious
nature of this delay is underscored by the command in respondent’s Special
Directive 20-13 that the CIU “pay special attention” to cases where the
applicant claims the conviction was obtained from fabricated evidence or the
concealment of exculpatory evidence (Resp. RJN Ex. 32 at 323-24), which is what
petitioner claims here.
 


[3]           As an alternative basis for denying
the petition, respondent argues that petitions for habeas corpus provide an
adequate remedy at law. “As an extraordinary remedy, a writ of habeas corpus is
not available when an alternative remedy is available.” (Villery v.
Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 407,
415–16.) Because a writ of traditional mandate is available, petitioner is not
required to resort to a writ of habeas corpus.
