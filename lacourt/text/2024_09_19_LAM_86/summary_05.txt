And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's renewed applications for right to attach orders against the defendants. The plaintiff had previously applied for right to attach orders against the defendants, but the applications were denied because the plaintiff did not provide a basis for calculating the proposed amount to be attached. The plaintiff has now filed renewed applications, but the supporting declaration does not comply with the requirements of CCP § 1008(b), which requires a party to show what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff's failure to explain how it calculated the proposed amount of attachment in the prior applications was not excusable, and therefore the Court will not exercise its discretion to grant the renewed applications. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's applications are denied.
