 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 21, 2022, Plaintiff Fred Loya Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Isaac H. McIver
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for: (1) Subrogation
Claim; and (2) Indebtedness. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following: on November 23, 2019,
Plaintiff had in effect an insurance policy with Auri Rocha Rocha (the
“Insured”) providing automobile insurance. (Complaint, ¶ 8.) Defendant
rear-ended the Insured. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) Due to Defendant’s negligence,
Plaintiff made payments under the Insured’s policy for the repair of the
property in the sum of $10,545.63. (Complaint, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff demands
judgment against Defendant in the sum of $10,545.63. (Complaint, ¶ 11.)  
 
On June
21, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.  
 
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed Motions Compelling
Answers to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One and Deeming Requests for
Admission, Set One, as admitted with an accompanying Motions for Sanctions. 
 
            On February 7, 2024, the Court
granted the motions. (02/07/24 Minute Order.) As to the request for admissions,
the Court indicated that “Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the
Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against Defendant.” (02/07/24 Minute
Order at p. 4.) The Court also ordered Defendant to serve responses to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories within 20 days of service of the Court’s
order, and ordered Defendant and his counsel, jointly and severally, to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel in the sum of $1,920.00. (02/07/24
Minute Order at p. 6.) 
 
            On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. The motion is made on the
grounds that Defendant has admitted to the truth of all pertinent issues and,
as such, there are no triable issues of act as to liability or damages. 
 
            On June 6, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on the motion for summary judgment. (06/06/24 Minute Order.) Having
reviewed and considered the moving papers, the Court found that “proof of
service of the instant motion to [b]e defective.” (06/06/24 Minute Order at p.
1.) The Court noted that the proof of service stated that “the documents were
served on the interested Parties on 11/17/2021 and service executed on
11/17/2021.” (06/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) Due to the defective proof of
service, the Court’s tentative ruling was to deny the motion. (06/06/24 Minute
Order at p. 1.) 
 
The Court continued the hearing on the motion for summary
judgment to July 9, 2024 to allow “[c]ounsel for Plaintiff/Moving Party to
provide proof to the Court that the instant Motion was properly served upon the
interested Parties.” (06/06/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court ordered
Plaintiff’s counsel “to file supplemental papers addressing the deficiency
identified by the Court this date with respect to proper proof of service of
the motion, at least 5-court days prior to 07/09/2024. Failure to do so may
result in the motion being denied.” (06/06/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court
ordered Plaintiff’s counsel to give notice. (06/06/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served a notice of continuance as to the motion. (See 06/13/24 Notice of
Motion for Summary Judgment.) However, Plaintiff has not complied with the
Court’s June 6, 2024 minute order. Plaintiff has failed to file supplemental
papers showing that the instant motion was served upon the interested parties.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Summary
Judgment   
A.               
Legal Standard 
            The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow
a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support
for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the
need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843. Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence and uncontradicted
by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.” Adler v. Manor Healthcare
Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119. “The function of the
pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67. 
In the context of a
motion for summary judgment, “[a] plaintiff or cross-complainant has met his or
her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that
party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to
judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)
“Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exist as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 
“The summary
judgment statute [is] not intended nor can it be used as a substitute for
existing methods in the trial of issues of fact.” Travelers Indemn. Co. v.
McIntosh (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 177, 182. The summary judgment “procedure is
drastic and should be used with caution.” House v. Lala (1960) 180
Cal.App.2d 412, 415. “Any doubt in granting summary judgment should be
exercised against the moving party.” Ibid.
B.        Discussion   
            “Subrogation
is the insurer’s right to be put in the position of the insured, in order to
recover from third parties who are legally responsible to the insured for a
loss paid by the insurer.” Plut v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2000) 85
Cal.App.4th 98, 104, citation omitted. “Where a subrogation provision
exists, an insurer may recoup its payments directly from the tortfeasor or from
the proceeds of the insured’s action against a tortfeasor.” Ibid., citation
omitted. 
            Plaintiff
presents the following undisputed material facts: on or about November 23,
2019, Plaintiff had in effect an insurance policy with Auri Rocha Rocha. (UMF
No. 1.) Defendant negligently rear-ended the vehicle of Plaintiff’s insured.
(UMF No. 2.) As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant’s negligence,
Plaintiff made payments under the Insured’s policy for the repair of the property
in the sum of $10,543.63. (UMF No. 3.) There is now due and owing from
Defendant to Plaintiff the total sum of $10,543.63. (UMF No. 4.) 
            Although
Plaintiff has presented the aforementioned undisputed material facts, the Court
cannot grant the motion for summary judgment as Plaintiff failed to “file
supplemental papers addressing the deficiency . . . with respect to proper
proof of service of the motion.” (06/06/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court
reminds Plaintiff that “[d]ue process requires a party . . . be given adequate
notice . . . .” Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481. 
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with
the Court’s June 6, 2024 minute order, the instant motion for summary judgment
is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
