 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from an automobile accident which occurred on December 24, 2022. On
December 14, 2023, Plaintiffs Robert Avagyan and Emily Avagyan, minors by and
through their guardian ad litem, Anahit Yeghiazaryan filed a Complaint
against Defendants Jesse T.J. Leaver (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 20, alleging
causes of action for: (1) motor vehicle; and (2) general negligence. 
 
On February
7, 2024, the Court appointed Anahit Yeghiazaryan as guardian ad litem for
minor plaintiffs. 
 
On February
23, 2024, Anahit Yeghiazaryan filed notice that the parties had reached a
conditional settlement agreement. 
 
On
February 29, 2024, Parent and Guardian Ad Litem Anahit
Yeghiazaryan (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petitions to Approve Compromise
of Pending Action (the “Petitions”) on behalf of Claimants Emily Avagyan and
Ryan Avagyan (collectively “Claimants”).
 
On April 22, 2024, Petitioner filed
respective Order Approving Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with Disability forms (Form MC-351) and
Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account forms (Form MC-355) as to each claimant.
 
 
On April 23, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the
Petitions due to: (1) Petitioner failing to file Proposed Orders on Form
MC-351; (2) Petitioner failing to file Proposed Orders to Deposit Funds Into
Blocked Accounts on Form MC-355; and (3) the Declarations of Armen Kiramijyan
failing to address the factors under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b). (04/23/24
Minute Order at p. 6.) The Court also noted that no proofs of service were
filed as to the Petitions. (04/23/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court’s minute
order provides that “[a]t least 16 court days before the next scheduled
hearing, Petitioners must file and serve supplemental papers addressing the
issuance of service of the Petitions on Defendant/Respondent as well as the
other deficiencies noted above. Failure to do so will result in the Petitions
being placed off calendar or denied.” (04/23/24 Minute Order at p. 7.) 
 
On May
24, 2024, proofs of service were filed concerning the Petitions. However, the
Court notes that the respective proofs of service merely state that the
“Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability” was served on
Defendant. (See 05/24/24 Proofs of Service.) However, the proofs of service do
not indicate which petitions were served. As such, the Court cannot
ascertain whether Defendant was served with the petition as to only Claimant Emily
or Claimant Robert. 
 
On May
24, 2024, counsel for Plaintiffs, Armen Kiramijyan (“Kiramijyan”) filed a
declaration in support the request to approve the amount of attorney’s fees and
costs as to each of the Petitions.  The
Declaration, which was signed and filed on 5/24/2024, does not accompany a
proof of service.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Petitions
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise  
A.               
Legal Standard 
            “When
a minor, a person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions, or a person for
whom a conservator has been appointed is a party, that person shall appear
either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem
appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a
judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).) “The
purpose of section 372 is to protect the minor involved in litigation by adding
an extra layer of scrutiny to the settlement of the minor’s claims.” Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1339.  
B.        Discussion  
Defendant has offered to settle this
matter in the amount of $25,000.00. (Petitions, ¶¶ 10(b)-(c).) The gross amount
of settlement pertaining to each of the respective Claimants is $25,000.00 and
attorney’s fees in the sum of $6,250.00 are requested to be paid from the gross
amount of the settlement as to each of the Claimants. (Petitions, ¶¶ 16(a), and
16(e).) 
Claimant Emily’s medical expenses to
be paid from the proceeds of settlement amounts to $4,295.00. (Petition as to
Claimant Emily, ¶ 16(b).) Cost expenses as to Claimant Emily are $10.89.
(Petition as to Claimant Emily, ¶ 16(d).) Thus, Claimant Emily will receive a
net balance of $14,444.11. (Petition as to Claimant Emily, ¶ 16(f).) 
Claimant Robert’s medical expenses to
be paid from the proceeds of settlement amounts to $3,795.00. (Petition as to
Claimant Robert, ¶ 16(b).) Cos of expenses as to Claimant Robert are $10.89.
(Petition as to Claimant Robert, ¶ 16(d).) Thus, Claimant Robert will receive a
net balance of $14,944.11. (Petition as to Claimant Robert, ¶ 16(f).) 
The Court finds that the requested
attorney’s fees, which amount to 25% of the total settlement offered to each of
the Claimants, are fair and reasonable. The Court has reviewed the May 24, 2024
Declaration of Attorney Kiramijyan and find that such declarations comply with
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955 as to each of the Petitions.  However, the Declaration does not accompany a
proof of service.  
The funds are proposed to be deposited
at Wells Fargo Bank located at 900 N. San Fernando Boulevard, Burbank, CA 91504.
(Petitions, ¶ 18(b)(2); Petitions at Attachment 18(b)(2).) 
Also, Petitioner has now filed Forms
MC-351 and MC-355 as to each of the Petitions. 
The Court, however, finds that the
proofs of service filed concerning service of the Petitions do not indicate
exactly which of the Petitions was served on Defendant.  As well, the Declaration of Attorney
Kiramijyan does not accompany a proof of service. The Court must ensure that
Defendant receives proper notice of each of the instant Petitions and
supporting Declaration. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
           Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the hearing
on the Petitions to August 21, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. in this department so
that Petitioner can serve both Petitions and supporting Declaration onto
Defendant. Petitioner is ordered to file compliant
proofs of service showing that each of the Petitions listing each minor and
Declaration was served on Defendant and such proofs of service are to be filed
at least 16 court days prior to the continued hearing date. 

 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
