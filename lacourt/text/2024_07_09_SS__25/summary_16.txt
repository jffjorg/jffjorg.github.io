And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to reclassify the case from a limited civil jurisdiction action to an unlimited civil jurisdiction action. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging dental malpractice and seeking damages for past and future medical treatments, pain and suffering, and emotional distress. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the damages in this case overlap with the damages in a related case. The judge found that it is possible that the plaintiff's damages will exceed the jurisdictional limit of $35,000.00 and granted the motion to reclassify the case. The plaintiff is ordered to pay a reclassification fee of $140.00.
