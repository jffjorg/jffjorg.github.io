And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted in part Plaintiff's motion to deposit the bond amount with the court, cancel and exonerate the bond, discharge liability, for attorney fees and costs, and to be dismissed. The court has also denied without prejudice Plaintiff's requests to cancel and exonerate the bond, be released and discharged from all liability, for attorney fees and costs, and to be dismissed from the action with prejudice. The court found that Plaintiff can deposit the bond amount with the court, but denied Plaintiff's request to cancel and exonerate the bond because the purpose for which the bond was given has not been satisfied. The court also denied Plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs because Plaintiff has not made the requisite showing for all of its requested relief.
