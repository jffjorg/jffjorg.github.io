Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns the petitions to approve the compromise of pending action for minor claimants Robert and Emily Avagyan. The claimants, who are 6 and 5 years old, respectively, have agreed to settle their claims against the defendant, Jesse T.J. Leaver, for $25,000.00 each. The settlement proceeds will be deducted for medical expenses, cost expenses, and attorney's fees, leaving each claimant with a net balance of $14,444.11 and $14,944.11, respectively. The court finds that the requested attorney's fees, which amount to 25% of the total settlement offered to each of the claimants, are fair and reasonable. However, the court notes that the proofs of service filed concerning service of the petitions do not indicate exactly which of the petitions was served on the defendant, and the declaration of attorney Kiramijyan does not accompany a proof of service. Therefore, the court continues the hearing to August 21, 2024, at 10:00 A.M. in this department so that petitioner can serve both petitions and supporting declaration onto the defendant.
