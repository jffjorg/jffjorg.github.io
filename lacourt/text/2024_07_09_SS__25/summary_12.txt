And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's amended motion for leave to amend the complaint to include a claim for punitive damages and to reclassify the case under unlimited jurisdiction. The motion was deficient because it did not comply with the California Rules of Court and did not include a proposed amended pleading. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's request for leave to amend was moot in light of the court's previous ruling. Additionally, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to reclassify the case without prejudice, as the motion did not provide any reasoned argument or citations to authority in support of reclassification.
