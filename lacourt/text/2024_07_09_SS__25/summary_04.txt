And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's previous order. The plaintiff had filed a motion for summary judgment on March 18, 2024, arguing that it had proven a subrogation claim for negligence and was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judge had previously ordered the plaintiff to provide proof of service of the motion, but the plaintiff failed to do so. The judge is reminding the plaintiff that due process requires adequate notice, and the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order means that the motion for summary judgment is denied. The judge is ordering the plaintiff to give notice.
