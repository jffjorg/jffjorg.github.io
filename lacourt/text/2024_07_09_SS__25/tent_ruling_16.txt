 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from alleged dental malpractice. On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff
Reah Sybirski (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for Dental Medical Malpractice
against Defendant Nikou Zarabian (“Defendant”). The Complaint is handwritten
and is set forth on pleading paper. 
 
On October
10, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.   
 
On March
21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint
and to Reclassify Case Under Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction. 
 
On May 7,
2024, the Court entered an order relating the instant action to Reah
Sybirski v. Vladimir Polyakov., LASC Case No. 23STLC05562 (the “Polyakov
Action”), with the Polyakov Action being deemed the lead case. (05/07/24 Minute
Order.)  
 
On May 9, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court continued
the motion in part and denied the motion in part. (05/09/24 Minute Order at p.
4.) The Court continued the hearing on the motion for leave to amend to June
20, 2024, so that Plaintiff could file and serve a supplemental declaration in
compliance with Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. (05/09/24 Minute Order at p.
4.) As to Plaintiff’s request for reclassification, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s request to reclassify this action to an unlimited jurisdiction
action. (05/09/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On May
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Amended Motion for Leave to
File a First Amended Complaint and to Reclassify Case Under Unlimited Civil
Jurisdiction (the “Amended Motion”). Pursuant to the Amended Motion, Plaintiff
seeks an order granting leave to file a First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff also
seeks an order reclassifying this case under unlimited civil jurisdiction on
the grounds that: (1) damages exceed the jurisdictional limits of the Court;
and (2) pursuant to CCP § 1008(a), the Court inadvertently overlooked the
majority of the damages included in the proposed First Amended Complaint and
the motion is timely made. 
 
On May
20, 2024, this action was reassigned from Department 26 to Department 25 at
Spring Street Courthouse.  
 
On June
11, 2024, Defendant filed and served an opposition to the Amended Motion, to
which Plaintiff replied on June 12, 2024.   
 
On June
20, 2024, after hearing oral argument and taking the motion for leave to amend
under submission, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for Leave to
File a First Amended Complaint. (06/20/24 Minute Order.) The Court ordered
Plaintiff to file a clean copy of the proposed First Amended Complaint by July
9, 2024. (06/20/24 Minute Order.) 
 
As to the Amended Motion to Reclassify Case Under Unlimited
Civil Jurisdiction, the Court continued the hearing on such motion to July 9,
2024. (06/20/24 Minute Order at pp. 2-3.) The Court ordered the parties to
submit supplemental briefs by the end of the day on July 2, 2024. (06/20/24
Minute Order at p.3.) The parties were ordered to meet and confer via telephone
regarding damages by the end of the day on June 28, 2024. (06/20/24 Minute
Order at p. 3.)  
 
On July 2, 2024, Defendant filed and served a declaration
of its counsel, Shirley Carpenter Bridwell, Esq. in opposition to Plaintiff’s
motion to reclassify this action as unlimited. Also, on July 2, 2024, Plaintiff
filed and served a supplemental brief in support of her motion for
reconsideration and to reclassify this case under limited jurisdiction. 
 
Given that the Court has already granted Plaintiff’s motion
for leave to amend, the Court’s analysis below will only address whether: (1)
reconsideration of the Court’s ruling on the motion to reclassify is warranted;
and (2) reclassification of this action is appropriate.  
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            As to
reclassification, Plaintiff argues that reclassification of this case under
unlimited jurisdiction is necessary and submits invoices to the supplemental
brief.  
 
OPPOSITION
 
            Defendant
asserts that the motion to reclassify was denied and was not continued to June
20, 2024. Defendant further argues that the damages that Plaintiff is claiming
in this case overlap with the damages claimed in the related case in Reah
Sybirski v. Vladimir Polyakov, LASC 23STLC05562. 
 
 
 
 
REPLY
 
            On reply, Plaintiff
argues that the request to reconsider reclassification under unlimited
jurisdiction should be granted in its entirety.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Discussion

A.        Request
for Reconsideration 
            Although
the Court previously denied Plaintiff’s request to reclassify this action as an
unlimited civil jurisdiction action pursuant to its May 9, 2024 order,
Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider its May 9, 2024 order which denied her
request to reclassify this action. 
            Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(a) “requires
that a motion for reconsideration be based on new or different facts,
circumstances, or law.” New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212. “A party seeking reconsideration must also provide a
satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier
time.” Ibid. “A trial court’s ruling on a motion for reconsideration is
reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.” Ibid., citation omitted.  
            California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 1008(a) provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has been made
to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order .
. . [may] make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.” “The party
making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) A trial court has discretion with respect to
granting a motion for reconsideration. New York Times Co. v. Superior Court,
supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212. 
            “The burden under section 1008 is
comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly
discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13, citation
omitted. A “party seeking reconsideration must provide not only new
evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that
evidence at an earlier time.” Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th
1338, 1342. “If the trial court believes reconsideration is warranted, it
can amend, modify or revoke its previous order.” Glade v. Glade (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457, citation omitted. In the context of motions for
reconsideration, there is “a strict requirement of diligence.” Garcia v.
Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.    
B.        Appropriateness
of Reclassification  
            “The
plaintiff . . . may file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed
for that party to amend the initial pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040,
subd. (a).) “The court, on its own motion, may reclassify a case at any time.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) “A motion for reclassification does
not extend the moving party’s time to amend . . . or otherwise respond.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) Where a motion for reclassification is filed
after the time for a party to amend its initial pleading, “the court shall
grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification only if both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The case is incorrectly classified. (2)
The moving party shows good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b)(1)-(2).) 
“[A] civil case in which the damages claimed are less than $25,000 or
less is a limited civil case.” AP-Colton LLC v. Ohaeri (2015) 240
Cal.App.4th 500, 505. “In a limited civil action, the judgment cannot
exceed $25,000.” Ibid. “For reclassification of a case from a limited
civil case to an unlimited civil case, a fee shall be charged as provided in
Section 70619 of the Government Code. This reclassification fee shall be in
addition to any other fee due for that appearance or filing in a limited civil
case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.060, subd. (a).) “The fee for reclassification
of a case from a limited civil case to an unlimited civil case under Section
403.060 of the Code of Civil Procedure is one hundred forty dollars ($140).”
(Gov. Code § 70619.) 
“[A] matter may be reclassified as a limited civil action when (i) the
absence of jurisdiction is apparent before trial from the complaint, petition,
or related documents, or (ii) during the course of pretrial litigation, it
becomes clear that the matter will necessarily result in a verdict below the
superior court’s jurisdictional amount.” Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005)129
Cal.App.4th 266, 276, internal quotations omitted. “[T]he test [is] . . .
whether lack of jurisdiction is clear . . . [or] virtually unattainable.” Id.
at p. 277, citation omitted, internal quotations omitted. “This standard
involves an evaluation of the amount fairly in controversy, not an adjudication
of the merits of the claim, and . . . requires a high level of certainty that
[the] damage award will not exceed $25,000.” Ibid. “The [trial] court
may believe it highly unlikely that plaintiff will recover the amount demanded,
but this is not enough to defeat jurisdiction, unless it appears to a legal
certainty that plaintiff cannot recover the amount [of the] demand[].” Ibid.
“[T]he superior court must deny the motion to reclassify the case as limited
(and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil court) unless it appears to a
legal certainty that the plaintiff’s damages will necessarily be less than
$25,000.” Ibid.  
Effective January 1, 2024, a limited civil action is an action where the
amount in controversy does not exceed $35,000. (Code Civ. Proc., § 85, subd.
(a).) “A civil action or proceeding other than a limited civil case may be
referred to as an unlimited civil case.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 88.)  
Analysis
as to Reclassification
The
Court may, on its own motion, reclassify an action at any time pursuant to CCP
§403.040(a). 
Defendant’s counsel, Shirley Carpenter Bridwell (“Bridwell”), states the
following: Plaintiff was recently granted leave to file her First Amended
Complaint and such pleading claims that Defendant failed to properly diagnose
and treat her dental condition. (Bridwell Decl., ¶ 2; Ex. A.) Plaintiff claims
damages as a result of Defendant’s treatment of her teeth 2, 4, and 31 for
infection and possible fractures. (Id., ¶ 2; Exs. A-B.) Plaintiff’s past
medicals are $7,879.00, which is well below the $35,000.00 to reclassify this
case to unlimited. (Id., ¶ 3.) Defendant’s counsel then sets forth
Plaintiff’s estimated future costs, which overlap between what Plaintiff is
claiming in this action and the Polyakov Action. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4.) The
reason given for the overlap of future medicals in this case and the Polyakov
Action is that Plaintiff is not in control of treatment she is still receiving,
but there is no reason why the future medicals in this case cannot be
determined by only treatment required to fix teeth 2, 4, and 31 for infection
and possible fractures. (Id., ¶ 6.) In the Polyakov Action, Plaintiff is
claiming damages to tooth 3 as well, and is claiming infection caused by
Defendant and Dr. Polyakov, which means there is an overlap between what
Plaintiff is claiming in damages in both cases. (Id., ¶ 7.) Defendant
argues that there is an overlap between the future damages in this action and
the Polyakov Action and thus Plaintiff’s calculation of future damages is
questionable. (Id., ¶¶ 8-9.) Defendant’s counsel attests that Plaintiff
fails to show that her damages will exceed $35,000.00 in this action. (Id.,
¶ 9.) 
In her declaration in support of the motion, Plaintiff declares that her
current and future damages exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court. (Sybirski
Decl., ¶ 2.) Specifically, Plaintiff states that her past medical totals
$10,264.00; future medical totals $20,250.00; pain and suffering is greater
than $80,000.00; and emotional distress is greater than $80,000.00. (Id.
¶ 2(a)-(d).) Plaintiff declares that she has not included any damages from
any other action in her damages claimed in the instant action. (Sybirski
Decl. in Support of Supplemental Brief, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff states that her damages
in this action alone, and not for any other action she has filed, exceed
$35,000.00. (Id., ¶ 1.) Plaintiff attests that her “damages include at
least $10,264 in past medical, at least $20,250 in future medical, [and] at
least $80,000 in pain and suffering and emotional distress damages.” (Id.)
Dr. Jay Reznick, D.M.D., M.D., informed Plaintiff that if her laser treatments
proved unsuccessful, she would need to have the crowns, implants, and bone
grafts completed on teeth numbers 2, 4, and 31. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4.) 
            The Court finds that
reclassification of this action from a limited civil jurisdiction action to an
unlimited civil jurisdiction action is appropriate. The proposed First Amended
Complaint indicates that due to the alleged negligent dental work of Defendant,
Plaintiff will incur estimated future treatments exceeding $20,250.00.
(Bridwell Decl., Ex. A at ¶ 24.) Plaintiff alleges that she has already paid
Defendant $5,799.00 for the dental procedures. (Bridwell Decl., Ex. A at ¶ 12.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant negligently performed dental work on her three
molars. (Bridwell Decl., Ex. A at ¶¶ 6, 12, 25-34.) Plaintiff also paid
$2,080.00 to another dental provider for infection removal procedures due to
Defendant’s alleged negligent dental work. (Bridwell Decl., Ex. A at ¶ 21.) Plaintiff
alleges that she has sustained mental, physical, and nervous pain due to
Defendant’s actions in an amount that exceeds $80,000.00. (Bridwell Decl., Ex.
A at ¶ 31.) 
            Based on the proposed First Amended
Complaint—which the Court granted Plaintiff leave to file—the Court finds that
it is possible that Plaintiff’s damages will exceed $35,000.00. The Court
acknowledges the defendant’s argument that the damages in this case overlap
with the damages in the related case.  Plaintiff
disputes this and declares that she has not included any damages from any other
action in this instant action. The Court reminds the parties that “[t]he
[trial] court may believe it highly unlikely that plaintiff will recover the
amount demanded, but it is not enough to defeat jurisdiction, unless it appears
to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot recover the amount [of the] deman[d].”
Maldonado v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 397, 401, emphasis in
original. Therefore, it does not appear, to legal certainty, that Plaintiff
cannot recover more than $35,000.00.  
            Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for reclassification. 
II.        Conclusion 
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Amended Motion to Reclassify
Case Under Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction is GRANTED.
 
 The Court reclassifies this action from a limited civil
jurisdiction action to an unlimited civil jurisdiction action. Plaintiff is
ordered to pay the reclassification fee of $140.00 pursuant to CCP § 403.060(a)
before this action will be reclassified to an unlimited civil jurisdiction
matter.  
 

            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
