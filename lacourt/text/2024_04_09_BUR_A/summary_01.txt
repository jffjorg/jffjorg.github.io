And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer hearing in a case where Precise MRI Corporation (plaintiff) is suing Edward Shkolnikov dba EFS Law Center (defendant) for breach of contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, declaratory judgment, unjust enrichment, and legal malpractice. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to pay amounts owed under 34 medical liens and rendered medical services for the defendant's clients. The court notes that the defendant's filing did not include a motion to strike, and the case involves complex legal issues related to contract law, conversion, and fiduciary duties.

The court rules that the defendant's demurrer is overruled as to the second and fifth causes of action, sustained with 20 days' leave to amend for the seventh and eighth causes of action, and sustained without leave to amend for the third, fourth, sixth, and ninth causes of action. The court also notes that the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to exercise skill, prudence, and diligence in rendering legal services, but this duty does not extend to non-clients.
