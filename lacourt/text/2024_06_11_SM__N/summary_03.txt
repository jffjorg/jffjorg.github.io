This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Mike Khattab's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories Against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ahmedshah Patail and Defendant/Cross-Complainant Shams Virjee. The court finds that the defendants failed to respond to the interrogatories within the designated timeframe and therefore waives all objections. The court orders the defendants to serve code-compliant responses to the interrogatories without objections within 30 days of the entry of this order.

Additionally, the court grants Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Mike Khattab's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants in the reduced amount of $435.00. The court finds that the defendants' failure to respond to the interrogatories warrants the imposition of monetary sanctions. The court orders the defendants to pay the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the entry of this order.

The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court. The court finds that the defendants failed to act with substantial justification and that the imposition of the sanction is just.
