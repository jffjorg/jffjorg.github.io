And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for determination of good faith settlement. The defendants, Wedgewood Village Pharmacy, LLC, Wedgewood Connect, LLC, and Wedgewood Village Pharmacy Intermediate Holdings, LLC, have agreed to settle with the plaintiffs, Rose Lynch and Michael Lynch, for an amount that is not disclosed. The judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith, as the defendants have demonstrated that the settlement amount is within the reasonable range of their proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiffs' injuries. The judge also grants the defendants' motion for an order sealing the settlement details, as the parties have agreed to keep the terms of the settlement confidential. Any other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors are barred from asserting claims against the defendants based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
