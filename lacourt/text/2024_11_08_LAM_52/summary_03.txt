And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by defendants Jesus R. Cuevas and Legacy Escrow Inc.

As to Cuevas' motion to quash service of summons, the court finds that plaintiff Sherry McAllister failed to file a timely opposition and did not meet her burden of showing valid service on Cuevas. Therefore, the court grants Cuevas' motion and quashes service of summons on the first amended complaint.

As to Legacy Escrow Inc.'s demurrer to the first amended complaint, the court finds that plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support the causes of action (breach of written contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraudulent misrepresentation). Specifically, the court finds that plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts to apprise Legacy of the basis for the causes of action. Therefore, the court sustains Legacy's demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend.
