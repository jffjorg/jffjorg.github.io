  Case Number:  24STCV05798    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff WF Chateau Partners LLC’s Motion to Strike or Tax Costs
            Plaintiff
WF Chateau Partners LLC moves to strike or tax the memorandum of costs filed by
defendant Michael Niro.
Timeliness
            Plaintiff
contends the court should strike the entire memorandum of costs because he did
not timely serve and file it.  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1) provides, “A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice
of entry of judgment or dismissal.”  
The
clerk served notice of dismissal by mail on August 12, 2024.  Doing so extended the deadline to serve and
file a memorandum of costs by five days. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1013; Nevis Homes LLC
v. CW Roofing, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 353,
354–355.)  Defendant therefore had until
September 3, 2024, to serve and file the memorandum of costs. 
The proof of service included on the memorandum of costs (form MC-010,
p. 2) defendant served it by mail on September 2, one day before the
deadline.  But defendant filed it on
September 4, the day after the deadline.
The
court will exercise its discretion not to strike the memorandum of costs as
untimely.  “ ‘[I]t [is] settled that the
time limitation” for serving and filing a memorandum of costs is “not
jurisdictional in character and that a trial court has broad discretion in
allowing relief from a late filing where, as here, there is an absence of a
showing of prejudice to the opposing party.’ ” 
(Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th
1301, 1304.)  Plaintiff has shown no
prejudice.  Defendant served the
memorandum of costs on plaintiff within the time allowed.  That defendant filed the memorandum one day
after the deadline caused no prejudice to plaintiff. 
Specified Items
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, the prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs.  (§ 1032(b).)  Section 1033.5, subdivision (a) sets forth a
list of allowable costs.  Section 1033.5,
subdivision (b) lists costs that are not allowable.  If the items on a memorandum of costs appear
proper on their face, the prevailing party has produced prima facie evidence
the costs were reasonable and necessary (Seaver
v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557; Doe v. Department of Children & Family
Services (2019) 37 Cal.app.5th 675, 693), and the burden is on the party
seeking to tax costs to show otherwise. 
(Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128; Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 836, 855 [if the claimed costs are expressly allowable, “ ‘the
burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or
unreasonable’ ”].)  
            Plaintiff
moves to tax $16,669 in attorney fees claimed in the memorandum of costs.  Defendant conceded that the amount of
attorney fees should be decided by noticed motion.  On October 17, 2024, the court granted defendant’s
motion for attorney fees in part and awarded him $9,967.50 in fees.  The court will therefore tax the fees
included in the memorandum of costs.    
            Plaintiff
moves to tax defendant’s filing and motion fees of $775.  “Filing, motion, and jury fees” are allowed
as costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(1).)  Defendant states he paid
$775 to file a petition for writ of mandate with the Court of Appeal.  (Niro Decl.) 
As the court stated when reducing the lodestar on defendant’s motion for
attorney fees, both petitions for writ of mandate “were unnecessary and
unsuccessful.”  (Oct. 17, 2024 minute
order, p. 2.)  The court will therefore tax
the $775 defendant claims for filing fees.
            Plaintiff
also moves to tax $108.90 for models, enlargements, and photocopies of
exhibits.  Recoverable costs include “[m]odels,
the enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic presentation
of exhibits, including costs of rental equipment and electronic formatting, may
be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).)  Defendant asserts, “The $108.90 was for the
copying of exhibits.”  (Niro Decl.)  Though defendant succeeded on demurrer before
trial, the court sustained the demurrer on August 12, 2024, the same day as the
final status conference.  The trial was
scheduled for August 20.  Defendant
reasonably incurred costs to copy exhibits. 
Had the case proceeded to trial, those copies would likely have been
reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact. 
Defendant may recover these costs. 
   
            Finally,
plaintiff moves to tax $126.50 in fees for electronic filing or service.  The court exercises its discretion to award
those costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (c)(4).)  Those costs were “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation” (id., subd. (c)(2)) and
“reasonable in amount” (id., subd. (c)(3)).  
Disposition
            Plaintiff
WF Chateau LLC’s motion to strike or tax costs is granted in part as to
$775 in filing fees and $16,669 in attorney fees claimed in the memorandum of
costs by defendant Michael Niro.  The
court hereby taxes the memorandum of costs by $17,444.  Defendant Michael Niro shall recover $234.50
in costs from plaintiff WF Chateau Partners LLC in addition to the $9,967.50 in
attorney fees the court awarded defendant on October 17, 2024.  Defendant therefore shall recover a total of
$10,202 in costs and attorney fees from plaintiff.
