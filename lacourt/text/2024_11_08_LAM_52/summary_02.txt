Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by EIG Management dba Ecostar Remodeling & Construction to the first amended complaint filed by Pablo Ruiz Roja and Long Nguyen. EIG Management has requested judicial notice of three exhibits, which the court has granted. The defendant has also filed a special demurrer, arguing that the second action is barred due to the pendency of the first action. The court has found that the two actions are identical and that a judgment in one action would serve as res judicata or claim preclusion for the other. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer and entered an interlocutory judgment in favor of EIG Management. The action is hereby stayed pending resolution of the first action in San Bernardino Superior Court.
