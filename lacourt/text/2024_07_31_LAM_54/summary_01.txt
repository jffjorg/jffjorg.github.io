And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Maurice Leiter has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shuolin Wen v. Qingzhou Zhu, et al. The judge has sustained the demurrers of the defendants with 30 days leave to amend. The demurrers were filed by Skybox Holdings 81, the individual defendants Sisley Wong and Xiaodan Zhang, and JPMorgan Chase, N.A.

The plaintiff, Shuolin Wen, sued the defendants for breach of contract, fraud, and money had and received. The defendants argued that the complaint was uncertain and failed to state a claim. The judge agreed and sustained the demurrers.

The judge found that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts against Skybox Holdings 81 for any of the causes of action. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegation that he and Skybox agreed to a loan was insufficient and that the FAC (First Amended Complaint) failed to differentiate which defendants were liable on which contracts.

The judge denied the motion to strike as moot. The hearing is scheduled for July 31, 2024.
