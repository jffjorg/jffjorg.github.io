I.           
INTRODUCTION
On May 20, 2022, plaintiff Maritsa
Herrera (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant American Honda Motor
Company, Inc. (“Defendant”). On January 23, 2023, having taken the matter under
submission on January 9, 2023, this action was ordered to arbitration by the
Honorable Colin P. Leis. 
On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion for sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98
after Defendant failed to pay the fees due to the arbitral provider, JAMS. 
On January 26, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition brief. 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
reply brief. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.98(a)(1) provides: “In an employment or consumer arbitration that
requires, either expressly or through application of state or federal law or
the rules of the arbitration provider, that the drafting party pay certain fees
and costs during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or
costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30
days after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the
arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right
to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result
of the material breach.” (CCP § 1281.98(a)(1).) If the drafting party
materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default, the employee
or consumer may unilaterally withdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in
a court of appropriate jurisdiction. (CCP § 1281.98(b)(1).) The employee or
consumer may bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all attorney's
fees and all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding. (CCP §
1281.98(c)(1).) The recovery of arbitration fees, interest, and related
attorney's fees shall be without regard to any findings on the merits in the
underlying action or arbitration. (Id.) The court shall also impose
sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99, which
includes “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by
the employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.” (CCP § 1281.99(a).)

 
III.       
DISCUSSION
As an initial matter, the Court
addresses Defendant’s argument that Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98
(hereinafter, “CCP Section 1281.98”) is inapplicable because the parties agreed
that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) would apply. Defense counsel Jeanette
C. Suarez attaches a copy of the arbitration provision which is partially cut
off. The provision states that “[a]ny arbitration under this Arbitration
Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act . . . and not by any
state law concerning arbitration.” (Suarez Decl., Ex. 1.) 
State rules of procedure apply in state
court proceedings except where such rules would defeat the purposes of the
federal law. (See Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l Secur. Corp. (1996)
14 Cal.4th 394, 409-410.) Multiple state courts have held that Section 1281.98
is not preempted by the FAA because it does not frustrate the objectives of the
FAA. (Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 629.) Therefore,
Section 1281.98 applies and the Court proceeds to analyze the merits of
Plaintiff’s motion. 
On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
initiated arbitration with JAMS. (Manno Decl., ¶ 5.) On August 3, 2023, JAMS
sent an invoice to defense counsel for the amount of $11,000 as the deposit for
arbitration services (“August 3 Invoice”). (Manno Decl., Ex. 2.) On August 21,
2023, a JAMS representative sent a follow-up email regarding the arbitration
deposit to counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant. (Manno Decl., Ex. 3.) In an
invoice dated September 6, 2023 but sent on September 7, 2023, JAMS sent
another invoice to defense counsel stating that the deposit was “due upon
receipt”, even though Plaintiff did not agree to extend the due date for the
arbitration fees (“September 6 Invoice”). (Manno Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.) Four days
later, on September 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed JAMS and Defendant
that Plaintiff would be withdrawing from arbitration. (Manno Decl., ¶ 10.) On
October 4, 2023, JAMS closed the arbitration. 
In its opposition brief, Defendant
emphasizes that any delay was in no way intentional. Ms. Suarez declares that
on or about July 7, 2023, Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani, LLP (“GRSM”)
substituted in as counsel for Defendant and that counsel was unaware of the
August 3 Invoice because it was sent to Defendant’s former counsel and JAMS was
not provided notice of GRSM’s substitution until August 21, 2023, at which
point JAMS sent the September 6 Invoice to GRSM. 
Intentionality is irrelevant when
determining whether a party is in default under Section 1281.98. (Williams
v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1054, 1074 [302
Cal.Rptr.3d 803, 819], review denied (Mar. 29, 2023 [citing Espinoza v. Superior
Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 775-78].) Courts must construe Section
1281.98 strictly and without regard to fault. (Id. at p. 1075.) It is
undisputed that Defendant failed to pay the arbitration fees on time. The
motion is therefore GRANTED. 
The Court next addresses the issue of
sanctions. Plaintiff requests a total of $10,868 in sanctions for 28.6 hours of
work. Plaintiff’s counsel lists tasks including:
- 7.8 hours reviewing Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration, stipulating to stay the proceedings, conducting
research, and preparing an opposition.
- 2.6 hours reviewing Defendant’s
reply, preparing for the Motion to Compel Arbitration hearing, and attending
the Motion to Compel Arbitration hearing.
- 1.7 hours reviewing arbitration
services, meeting and conferring with Defendant regarding the arbitration
company and initiating arbitration, setting up a JAMS account, initiating
arbitration on March 14, 2023, and notifying Defendant.
- 0.7 hours reviewing and compiling all
documents requested by JAMS,
- 1.2 hours corresponding with JAMS
regarding arbitration, reviewing letters from JAMS regarding arbitration, and
reviewing JAMS’ Minimum Consumer Standards.
- 1.2 hours reviewing the suggested
arbitrators, preparing a wish list and strike list of arbitrators, preparing correspondences
to JAMS, and assignment of arbitrator.
- 1.9 hours reviewing the client’s file
in preparation for the Post Arbitration Conference on July 18, 2023, attending
said Post Arbitration Conference, reviewing tasks and deadlines regarding the
outcome of the Post Arbitration Conference, and drafting and serving of the
Notice of Ruling.
- 2.9 hours researching relevant Code
section due to Defendant’s failure to pay the arbitration deposit, drafting of
letter of withdrawal, correspondence with JAMS regarding withdrawal from
arbitration, and determining the status of the case in light of the closure of
arbitration.
- 3.6 hours preparing the instant
motion.
- 5 hours to review Defendant’s
opposition, prepare a reply, and prepare for and attend the hearing on this
motion. 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff should
only recover the cost to prepare this motion because only this motion was the
“result of [its] material breach.” (Opp., p. 4.) The Court disagrees. Section
1281.98 (c)(1) provides, in relevant part, that the employee may bring a motion
to recover “all attorney’s fees and all costs associated with the abandoned
arbitration proceeding.” (CCP § 1281.98(c)(1).) Section 1281.98(c)(2) requires
a court to order the drafting party “to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of
the material breach.” Both provisions must be given effect. (CCP § 1281.98(c).)

Nevertheless, fees and costs cannot be
“associated with [an] abandoned arbitration proceeding” before the order to
arbitrate exists. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for fees and costs incurred to
oppose Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is denied. Furthermore, the
Court reduces Plaintiff’s recovery to the reasonable amount of $5,320,
consisting of 4 hours for initiating arbitration services, reviewing suggested
arbitrators, corresponding with JAMS (reduced from 4.8), 1 hour for preparing
for the Post Arbitration Status Conference (reduced from 1.9), 5 hours for researching
and preparing this motion (reduced from 5.5), and 4 hours to review Defendant’s
opposition brief, draft a reply brief, and prepare for and attend the hearing
(reduced from 5 hours), for a total of 14 hours at Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate
of $380. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED and
Defendant is ordered to pay $5,320 for Plaintiff’s reasonable expenses and
costs within 10 days of the date of this order.
The Court also schedules a trial
setting conference for ____________ at ______ in Department 3 of the Alhambra
Courthouse.
