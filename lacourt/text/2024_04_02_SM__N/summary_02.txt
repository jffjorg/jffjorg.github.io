And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their second amended complaint. The plaintiffs sought to add a new cause of action for retaliation, add a new defendant, and include a request for attorney fees in the eighth cause of action. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs had known of the events underlying their proposed new cause of action since 2021 and that the plaintiffs had failed to provide sufficient information to support their motion. The court found that the plaintiffs' motion was not justified because they had failed to provide sufficient information to support their claim of retaliation and had not explained why they had waited over a year to move to amend their complaint. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had failed to state why they had not sought to amend their complaint earlier.
