And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The defendants, Samuel Wrobel and Deborah Wrobel, had argued that the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was improper. However, the judge found that the notice was valid and that the defendants had been given an alternative to pay the rent or vacate the premises. The judge also found that the plaintiff, Behzad Pourebrahim and Roya Pourebrahim, had properly pled a claim for unlawful detainer. The defendants are ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within five days of the entry of this order.
