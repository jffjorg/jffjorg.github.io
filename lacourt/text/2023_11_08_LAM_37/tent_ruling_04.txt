Background
 
On
June 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed this representative PAGA action against Harbor
UCLA Medical Center Guild, Inc.; ATC Healthcare Services LLC (“ATC”) and Does 1
to 100. 
 
On
September 18, 2023, Defendant ATC moved to dismiss or stay the action based on
forum non conveniens. Plaintiff opposes the motion. The matter is now before
the court. 
 
Motion to Dismiss Due to Forum Non Conveniens
I.         Legal Standard
 
A
defendant may move to stay or dismiss an action on grounds of inconvenient
forum.¿(CCP § 418.10(a)(2).)¿¿The doctrine of forum¿non¿conveniens¿is
codified in Code of Civil Procedure, section 410.30. (Animal Film, LLC v.
D.E.J. Prods., Inc.¿(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 466, 471 (Animal Film).)¿Code
of Civil Procedure, section 410.30, subdivision (a) provides: “[w]hen a court
upon motion of a party or its own motion finds that in the interest of
substantial justice an action should be heard in a forum outside this state,
the court shall stay or dismiss the action in whole or in part on any
conditions that may be just.”¿(CCP § 410.30(a).)¿¿ 
 
“In
applying the traditional forum non¿conveniens¿analysis, the trial court must
engage¿in a two-step process, on which the defendant bears the burden of
proof.¿[Citation.]¿¿In the first step, the court must determine whether a
suitable alternative forum exists.¿[Citation.]¿¿If the court finds that a
suitable alternative forum exists, it must then balance the private interests
of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining the action in
California. [Citation.]”¿ (Animal Film, supra, 193 Cal.App.4th at
p. 472.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The
Court may take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United
States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially
notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky
v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendant
ATC requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
A March 1, 2023 complaint filed Turesa
Wilcox v. Harbor UCLA Medical Center Guild, Inc., et al., No.
23STCV04472 (Los Angeles Cty. Sup. Ct. Mar. 1, 2023), a true and correct copy
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
 
2)    
An April 15, 2023 notice of removal
filed Turesa Wilcox v. Harbor UCLA Medical Center Guild, Inc., et al.,
Case No. 2:23-cv-02802 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2023), a true and correct copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
 
3)    
An August 14, 2023 order entered in Turesa
Wilcox v. Harbor UCLA Medical Center Guild, Inc., et al., Case No.
2:23-cv-02802 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2023), a true and correct copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit C.
 
4)    
An August 28, 2023 first amended
complaint entered in Turesa Wilcox v. Harbor UCLA Medical Center Guild,
Inc., et al., Case No. 2:23-cv-02802 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2023), a true and
correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D.
 
Defendant ATC’s request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Defendant ATC requests that this present
action be stayed or dismissed pursuant to CCP § 410.30 because Plaintiff had
already filed a class action complaint for unpaid wages on March 01, 2023, in “Wilcox
1” entitled Turesa Wilcox v. Harbor UCLA Medical Center Guild, Inc., et
al., (LASC Case No. 23STCV04472). (RJN Ex. 1.) 
 
Plaintiff has now filed this present
action, Wilcox II, after ATC removed Wilcox I to federal court in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California
(“Central District”). (RJN Ex. 2.) Defendant ATC argues that because Plaintiff
may amend Wilcox I to add a PAGA claim, this action is duplicative
litigation, there is a risk of inconsistent rulings, and the interest of
substantial justice supports a finding that the action should be heard in
another forum and this action should be stayed or dismissed. 
 
A.        Defendant
ATC’s Motion is Timely 
 
CCP § 418.10(a)(2) provides that “[a]
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion . . . [t]o stay or dismiss the action on the ground of
inconvenient forum.”  
 
Accordingly,
Defendant ATC was not required to file a demurrer along with its motion to
dismiss or stay the action due to forum non conveniens. ATC represents that on
July 26, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel granted ATC a 15-day extension to fila
responsive pleading. (Reply at p. 7.) Five days before the responsive pleading
was due, Wilcox 1 was removed to federal court, leading ATC to have a
new basis to demurrer to Wilcox II. Because the parties could not
meaningfully meet and confer within the statutory period, ATC filed CIV-141
seeking an automatic 30-day extension to file a responsive pleading. (CCP §
430.41(a)(2).) Defendant ATC filed this Motion on September 18, 2023, on the
last day of its time to plead. (CCP § 418.10(a)(2); see also Olinick v. BMG Entertainment (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th
1286, 1296.) 
 
The
Motion is timely, and the court will consider the motion on its merits. 
 
B.        An
Alternative Forum is Appropriate
 
“Forum
non conveniens is an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a
court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of
action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly
tried elsewhere.” (Stangvik v. Shiley Inc. (1991) 54 Cal.3d 744, 751 (Stangvik).)
 The moving party bears the burden of proof on a motion for forum non
conveniens. (Id. at p. 751.) The first part of the analysis in determining
whether an action should be dismissed or stayed due to being filed in an
inconvenient forum is whether a suitable alternative forum exists.¿ (See id.
at p. 752; National Football League v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co.
(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 902, 918.)¿ 
 
“The threshold issue of
suitability of the alternative forum is . . . determined by a two-pronged test:
There must be jurisdiction over the defendant and the assurance that the action
will not be barred by a statute of limitations.”  (Shiley Inc. v.
Superior Court (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 126, 133.) The alternative forum is
“suitable” if its law provides a remedy for the claim sued upon. It is
sufficient that the action can be brought, although not necessarily won, in the
alternative forum. (Guimei v. General Elec. Co. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th
689, 696; Roman v. Liberty Univ., Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.4th 670, 683.)
 
Defendant ATC
sufficiently shows that the Central District where Wilcox I is being
heard is a suitable alternative forum for Plaintiff’s representative PAGA
action. The parties have already participated in a discovery plan pursuant to
Rule 26(f) in Wilcox I. Moreover, the Central District has original
jurisdiction over wage-and-hour claims asserted in Wilcox I that arise
out of the same facts as Wilcox II’s PAGA claims. Moreover, PAGA’s
one-year statute of limitations for PAGA claims does not bar the Central
District from adjudicating Plaintiff’s PAGA claim. Thus, the Central District
remains a suitable form for this action. 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff
fails to show that Central District refused to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s PAGA claim. Although there is a presumption in
favor of plaintiff’s choice of forum, the presumption is not conclusive and all
parties in this action are residents of California. (Stangvic, supra,
54 Cal.3d. at p. 756.) Here, all witnesses, documents, and evidence are located
in California, the forum state of both Wilcox I and Wilcox II. 
 
Defendant ATC has shown
that the Central District is a suitable forum for Plaintiff’s present action
and Plaintiff has failed to rebut this showing. 
 
C.        Both Private and Public Interest Weigh
in Favor of Alternative Forum 
 
The
second factor the court considers is the private and public interests of the
litigation, including “the enforceability of the ensuing judgment expeditious and
relatively inexpensive,” including (1) “the ease of access to sources of
proof,” (2) the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses,” and (3) the
availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses.” (Stangvik,
supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 751.) “The public interest factors include” (1)
“avoidance of overburdening local courts with congested calendars,” (2)
“protecting the interests of potential jurors so that they are not called upon
to decide cases in which the local community has little concern,” and (3)
“weighing the competing interests of California and the alternate jurisdiction
in the litigation.” (Ibid.)
 
Defendant ATC asserts
that the Central District is the appropriate forum because the parties can
easily access any sources of proof and face minimal costs arising from
obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and because the facts in this case arose
from Wilcox I, the parties will rely on the same evidence. Moreover, the
forum for both Wilcox I and II remains Los Angeles County. The Central
District will also apply California substantive law to Plaintiff’s PAGA claims
if Plaintiff chooses to amend the Complaint in Wilcox I to add a PAGA
claim. Lastly, Defendant ATC asserts that it may be prejudiced if this action
proceeds and is not stayed or dismissed because there is a risk of inconsistent
rulings. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff fails to show that public interest factors weigh against
staying or dismissing this action. Plaintiff argues that keeping this present
action would lessen the congestion at the Central District and reduce
additional administration of the case, but state courts are also similarly
congested and judicial economy favors that finding that the Central District is
adequately equipped to handle this case and has already expended resources in
adjudicating Wilcox I. Moreover, discovery is underway in Wilcox I which
will encompass the same facts and evidence as Wilcox II. Secondly, the
judicial pool of both the Central District and this court is the same such that
the interests of the public are adequately represented. In adjudicating the PAGA
claim, the Central District will apply California substantive law. Therefore,
Plaintiff fails to show that the private interest and public interest weigh in
favor of denying Defendant ATC’s motion. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant ATC’s motion is granted, and the action is dismissed. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant ATC’s
Motion to Dismiss is granted. 
 
Defendant to give
notice.
