I.         Legal Standard
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including
attorneys’ fees, as a matter of right.¿ (CCP §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.)¿Attorney’s fees
may be recovered as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (CCP §
1033.5(a)(10).)¿The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides
for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿ (Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP,
§§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿ The court, upon notice and motion by a party,
shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs
of the suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code § 1717(a),
(b).)¿¿¿ 
“It is well established that the determination of what constitutes
reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court,
whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”¿ (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)¿The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿(Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided.¿ (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49
(discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award).)¿ The factors
considered in determining the modification of the lodestar include “(1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.”¿ (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266,
271.)¿¿¿ 
 
In challenging attorneys’ fees as excessive because too many hours
of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence.¿ (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins.
Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿ General arguments that
fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.¿(Ibid.)¿¿¿
 
II.        Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s counsel requests
attorney’s fees in the sum of $4,469.50. Plaintiff’s counsel asserts they are
entitled to collect attorney’s fees pursuant to the attorney’s fees provision
in the “Cost of Collection” section of the Revolving Line of Credit-Credit
Agreement and Security Agreement (“Contract”). (Lopez Decl. ¶¶ 8,9, Ex. 1.) The
court agrees. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing rate
for this matter is $225.00 per hour based on 22 years of practicing civil
litigation. (Rocha Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel was also assisted by Jason
Meyer, an associate who also has a billing rate of $225.00 per hour. (Id.
¶ 6.) A copy of Plaintiff’s counsel billing statement attests to Plaintiff’s
incurring $4,649.50 in attorney’s fees through June 8, 2023, in relation to
this action. (Id. ¶ 13, Ex. A, B.) 
 
Having reviewed the billing
records, the court finds that Plaintiff’s hourly billing rate is reasonable and
that hours billed in this matter were also reasonable and necessary incurred in
litigating this action. 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion is
granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees in the sum of
$4,649.50 is granted. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
