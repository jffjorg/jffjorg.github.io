Summary:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling granting Defendant ATC's Motion to Dismiss Due to Forum Non Conveniens. The Judge finds that the Central District of California, where Wilcox I is being heard, is a suitable alternative forum for the plaintiff's representative PAGA action. The Judge weighs the private and public interests of the litigation and finds that both parties will benefit from the action being stayed or dismissed in favor of the alternative forum.
