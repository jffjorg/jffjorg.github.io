And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between HECTOR PENA and GUADALUPE MAXIMO (plaintiffs) and AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC. (defendant). The plaintiffs purchased a 2022 Honda HR-V with express and implied warranties, but have experienced issues with the vehicle and failed to produce it for inspection on multiple occasions. The defendant has moved to compel the plaintiffs to produce the vehicle for inspection, and the court has granted the motion. The court has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiffs in the amount of $1,470.00 for the time and expenses incurred in preparing the motion.

The court has denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions against the defendant, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion. The court has also denied the plaintiffs' requests to compel further responses to special interrogatories, finding that the requests are overbroad, vague, and ambiguous, and that the defendant's objections have merit.

The court has ordered the plaintiffs to produce the vehicle for inspection within 30 days of the hearing, and has denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The case is set for trial on March 24, 2025.
