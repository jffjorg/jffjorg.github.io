Hearing
date:  August 13, 2024
Moving
Party:  Defendant American Honda Motor
Co., Inc.
Responding
Party:  Plaintiffs Hector Pena and
Guadalupe Maximo 
Motion
to Compel Vehicle Inspection and Request for Monetary Sanctions 
The Court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
The motion is GRANTED
and the Court orders Plaintiffs to produce the Subject Vehicle for inspection.
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.
Background
Plaintiffs
Hector Pena and Guadalupe Maximo (collectively herein “Plaintiffs”) are
asserting causes of action for (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of
Express Warranty; and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Implied
Warranty against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc (“Honda”)
On
January 29, 2022, Plaintiffs purchased a 2022 Honda HR-V for which Defendant
Honda provided express and implied warranties. Subsequently, Plaintiffs began
to experience issues with the vehicle and delivered it to an authorized repair
facility on numerous occasions thereafter. Despite these visits, Defendant was
unable to conform the vehicle to its applicable warranties. Thus, Plaintiffs
filed the underlying complaint, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly
Act.  
On
June 22, 2023, AHM served Plaintiffs with a Notice of Vehicle Inspection
(“Notice”) via electronic service. (See Declaration of Monica Y. Hernandez
[“Hernandez Decl.”], ¶ 3, Ex. A.) The vehicle inspection was properly noticed
for August 30, 2023. (Id.) However, Plaintiffs did not serve a response
to the Notice. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs then did not produce the
Subject Vehicle for inspection on the date August 30, 2023. (Hernandez Decl., ¶
5.) 
On
January 5, 2024, Honda proposed March 11, 13, 14, and 15, 2024 as potential dates
based on AHM expert’s availability at the time. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel indicated they would reach out to Plaintiffs and their
expert “to see [i]f the dates provided work.” (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. C.)
However, Plaintiffs did not provide an update on whether the proposed dates
work thereafter. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 8.)
On
January 18, 2024, Honda reached out to Plaintiffs’ counsel to follow up on
whether any of the proposed dates worked. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. D.)
Plaintiffs provided no response. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 10.) 
On
January 25, 2024, Honda reached out to Plaintiffs’ counsel to again follow up
on whether any of the proposed dates worked. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. E.)
Plaintiffs again did not respond. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 12.) 
On
February 21, 2024, AHM followed up again and asked Plaintiff to confirm a
vehicle inspection date. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. F.) Plaintiffs responded,
“Unfortunately, the dates mentioned in your email won’t work with plaintiff or
our expert. We’ll seek further availability”. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. G.)
Plaintiffs did not provide any response or available dates thereafter.
(Hernandez Decl., ¶ 15.) 
By
March 19, 2024, Plaintiffs had still failed to confirm a new date for the
vehicle inspection, (Hernandez Decl., ¶¶ 16-17.)
Thus,
on March 19, 2024, Defendant Honda filed the instant
Motion to Compel Vehicle Inspection and Request for Monetary Sanctions, as well
as a Proposed Order and the Declaration of Defense Counsel, Monica Y.
Hernandez. 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
Limited Opposition, as well as the Declaration of Plaintiffs’ Counsel, Keishunn
Johnson. 
O July 17, 2024, Defendant Honda filed
its Reply.
Motion to Compel Vehicle Inspection
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that …
[a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] … [a]
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[;
or] … [a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general.”¿ Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310 (a). 
Analysis
Meet and Confer 
Defendants have satisfied their
requirement to meet and confer by attempting to coordinate and confirm a date
for inspection with Plaintiffs. (See Hernandez Decl., Exs. A-G.) Plaintiffs
have failed to respond to Defendant’s email correspondence. (Id.) Thus,
Defendant Honda has met its requirement to meet and confer before filing the
instant motion to compel. 
Vehicle
Inspection
Defendant Honda moves the Court to issue
an order compelling Plaintiffs to produce the 2002 Honda HR-V (VIN:
3CZRU5H53NM726944 (“Subject Vehicle”) for inspection on the grounds that Honda
must be afforded the opportunity to inspect the Subject Vehicle to assess
Plaintiffs’ claims and prepare a defense in advance of the trial date. (Mot.,
pg. 3.) Honda further asserts that Plaintiffs’ failure and/or refusal to
schedule a vehicle inspection unnecessarily frustrates the discovery process in
violation of the Discovery Act and causes undue prejudice to Honda. (Id.)
The Court agrees and finds that Defendant must be afforded the opportunity to
inspect the vehicle to construct a proper defense. Given Plaintiffs elected to
bring the instant action, Plaintiffs must comply with the discovery process
necessary to progress the proceedings on their own causes of action. The Court
further finds that despite Plaintiffs’ ostensible agreeableness to produce to
the Subject Vehicle, Plaintiffs have not engaged with Defendants in good faith and
have obstructed efforts to coordinate and confirm a date for the underlying
inspection. 
On Limited Opposition, Plaintiffs claim
the instant motion is moot because Plaintiffs offered August 2, 2024, for the
vehicle inspection to proceed. (Johnson Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) Moreover,
Plaintiffs contend there is still sufficient time to allow the parties to
continue meeting and conferring as to an agreeable date given trial is not
until March of 2025. On Reply, Defendant responds that given the instant motion
was filed on March 19, 2024, after 11 months of Plaintiffs acting in a manner
inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ discovery obligations and failing to produce the
vehicle or confirm the date, the instant motion is not moot because it was
necessitated by Plaintiffs’ obstruction. (Reply, pg. 2.) Plaintiffs failed to
serve a response or produce the Subject Vehicle for inspection on August 30,
2023, without substantial justification. 
The Court agrees with Defendant Honda. If
Plaintiffs have made an offer to produce to the vehicle for inspection
subsequent to Defendant’s filing of instant motion instead of before it, such
offer does not render the instant motion moot. Indeed, it demonstrates the
instant motion was effective in eliciting Plaintiffs’ compliance with the
discovery process. Furthermore, the exhibits of email correspondence evidence
Plaintiffs’ evasive responses or in some cases, complete lack of response and
cooperation with Defendant’s efforts to confirm an instant date. Thus, the
Court orders Plaintiff to produce the Subject Vehicle for inspection within
thirty (30) days of the hearing on this Motion, if Plaintiffs have not done so
already.
Sanctions
Where the court grants a motion to compel, sanctions shall
be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction
would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h), 2030.300,
subd. (d); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
Defendants
request sanctions in the amount of $1,470.00 for Defendant’s time expended
preparing the instant motion and reply. Counsel Hernandez’s hourly rate is $350
per hour, and she declares she spent 2.2 hours preparing the moving papers and
anticipated spending another 2 hours to prepare the reply brief and attend the
hearing. The Court finds Counsel’s rate reasonable and finds Defendant acted
with substantial justification in filing the instant motion. Thus, Honda’s’
request for monetary sanctions is granted against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’
Counsel, jointly and severally, to be paid within ten (10) days of the hearing
on this Motion.
It is so
ordered.

(Hernandez Decl., ¶ 15.)

Hearing
date:  August 13, 2024
Moving
Party:  Plaintiffs Hector Pena and
Guadalupe Maximo 
Responding
Party:  Defendant American Honda Motor
Co., Inc.
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories From Defendant 
The Court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
The motion is DENIED
as to both Requests 46 and 48 on the grounds that Defendant Honda’s objections
are SUSTAINED. Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is DENIED.
Background
Plaintiffs
Hector Pena and Guadalupe Maximo (collectively herein “Plaintiffs”) are
asserting causes of action for (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of
Express Warranty; and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Implied
Warranty against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc (“Honda”)
On January 29, 2022, Plaintiffs purchased
a 2022 Honda HR-V for which Defendant Honda provided express and implied
warranties. (Declaration of Angelica Zamudio (“Zamudio Decl.,” ¶ 2.) Subsequently,
Plaintiffs began to experience issues with the vehicle and delivered it to an
authorized repair facility on numerous occasions thereafter. (Ibid.)
Despite these visits, Defendant was unable to conform the vehicle to its
applicable warranties. (Ibid.) Thus,
Plaintiffs filed the underlying complaint, alleging violations of the
Song-Beverly Act. (Ibid.) 
On September 7, 2023, Plaintiffs sent
Defendant a First Set of Special Interrogatories. (Zamudio Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.)
On October 24, 2023, AHM served its responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatories Set One. (Zamudio Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. B.) On November 27, 2023,
Plaintiffs initiated the meet and confer process by sending a letter to AHM
that specified the deficiencies in AHM’s responses. (Zamudio Decl., ¶ 5; Ex.
C.) On December 19, 2023, the parties met and conferred telephonically and narrowed
the Requests for Production in dispute to RFP Nos. 46 and 48. (Zamudio Decl., ¶
6; Ex. D.) On January 18, 2024, the parties met and conferred again
telephonically regarding RFP Nos. 46 and 48 and agreed to a Motion to Compel
deadline of January 26, 2024. (Zamudio Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. E). 
Thus, on January 26, 2024, after failing
to reach resolve, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories (“SROGs”), Set 1, along with a Request for
Sanctions, a Separate Statement, a Proposed Order, and the Declaration of
Angelica Zamudio (“Zamudio Decl.”). 
On July 31, 2024, Defendant Honda filed
its Opposition, along with its Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Separate Statement. 
On August 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
Reply.
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Special Interrogatories
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response
to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
¶ (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. ¶
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  
“Notice of motions to compel further responses to discovery
must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).) 
The motions must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b), 2031.310, subd. (b), 2033.290, subd.
(b).)   
“Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that
all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)). 
Analysis
Meet and Confer 
Plaintiffs have satisfied their meet and
confer requirement. Plaintiffs’ Counsel, Angelica Zamudio, declares the parties
met and conferred telephonically for a final time on January 18, 2024, before
filing the instant motion on January 26, 2024. (Zamudio Decl., ¶ 6.) Thus, the
meet and confer requirement is met. 
Request Nos. 46
and 48
The interrogatories at issue for this
motion seek information regarding the repairs per thousand vehicles sold for
2022 Honda HR-V vehicles; and the five symptoms and components with the highest
repair rates per thousand for 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles. 
No. 46:  State the repairs per thousand vehicles sold
(R/1000) for 2022 Honda HR-V Vehicles– DENIED.
Defendant
objects on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ Request here is overbroad, vague, and
ambiguous, as well as overly broad in scope and unduly burdensome in requesting
such a quantum of work required for production. Thus, Defendant maintains in
Opposition that the request is improper and imposes an unreasonable burden on
Defendant that is incommensurate with the result sought. (Sep. State., pg. 9.)
The Court agrees. Plaintiff’s request is unclear as to what “state the repair”
means and requesting Defendant produce such information on the basis of a
thousand vehicles is unduly burdensome in relation to the requests likelihood
to lead to admissible evidence.      
Defendant’s
response is sufficient and its objections have merit.
No. 48:  Identify in order the five components with
the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles, and the
corresponding repairs per thousand.– DENIED.
Defendant provides
the same objections as to Request No. 46, objecting on grounds that the request
is overbroad, vague, ambiguous, overly broad in scope, and unduly burdensome.
Thus, the Court reiterates its findings from Request No. 46, further noting
that Plaintiff’s Request is overly broad in both time and scope. Defendant
argues that such a burden is only valid when that burden is demonstrated to
result in an injustice. The Court agrees there is no such showing here and that
the request is unclear in meaning.
            Defendant’s
response is sufficient and its objections have merit.
Sanctions
Where the court grants a motion to compel further
responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2031.310, subd. (h), 2030.300, subd. (d); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
Plaintiffs
request sanctions against Defendant Honda in the amount of $1,830.00 due to the
time Plaintiffs have expended attempting to meet and confer and prepare the
instant motion.  For the foregoing
reasons, the Court concludes Defendant Honda acted with substantial
justification in opposing the instant motion. 
Thus, Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is denied. Defendant
Honda does not request sanctions for the costs of defending the instant motion.
As such, the Court declines to impose monetary sanctions on either party. 
It is so
ordered.
