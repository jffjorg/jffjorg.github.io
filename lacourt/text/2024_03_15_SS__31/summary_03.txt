And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff had failed to produce her 2017-2022 tax returns as ordered, and the defendants had moved for sanctions as a result.

The judge has denied the defendants' request for terminating sanctions, finding that while the plaintiff's failure to produce the tax returns was a serious violation, it did not warrant such a drastic measure. Instead, the judge has granted the defendants' alternative request for issue and evidentiary sanctions, precluding the plaintiff from introducing evidence related to loss of earnings, loss of future earning capacity, and income related to her former employment encompassing the years 2017-2022.

The judge has also granted the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, ordering the plaintiff and her counsel to pay $3,060 in attorney's fees and costs. The judge has given the parties an opportunity to meet and confer to resolve the issue, and has set a hearing date for March 15, 2024.
