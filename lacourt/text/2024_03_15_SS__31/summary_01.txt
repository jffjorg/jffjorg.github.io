And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Sheraton's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against defendants Towne Park, LLC and Mile Hi Valet Service, Inc. The Sheraton seeks to file a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory relief, and breach of contract, alleging that defendants are responsible for a motor vehicle v. pedestrian accident that occurred in a parking lot. The Sheraton argues that it delayed seeking leave to file its cross-complaint because it was participating in two mediations in the hope of settling the case, but the court is not persuaded by this argument. The court finds that the Sheraton has not demonstrated that it would be in the interest of justice to grant leave to file the cross-complaint, given the protracted delay and the fact that the trial is now only three and a half months away. The court notes that the Sheraton has not met its burden of demonstrating that it would be in the interest of justice to grant leave to file the cross-complaint, and that the defendants will be prejudiced by the delay.
