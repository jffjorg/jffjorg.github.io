And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, Laura Zhou, who is only 6 years old. The petition was filed by ZHEN ZHOU, et al. (Plaintiffs) and proposes a settlement agreement with TINGTING YOU, et al. (Defendants) for a total amount of $550,000. However, the judge finds that the petition is defective in several ways, including the absence of Attachment 11b(6) and incorrect disposition of net proceeds in Item 18. The judge orders the petitioner to file a new petition curing these defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date. The judge also excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and her parent, and allows Counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
