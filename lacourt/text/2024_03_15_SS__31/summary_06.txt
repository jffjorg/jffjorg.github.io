And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Jeffrey L. O'Malley against defendant Special Service For Groups, Inc. and others. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were negligent in providing a safe environment at a housing for the homeless, where another resident, Cassandra Brown, threw scalding hot water on the plaintiff's body. The defendant demurred to each cause of action, arguing that they fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently plead that the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff, or properly plead a basis for liability against the defendant for injuries arising from a third-party tortfeasor. The defendant's only involvement, according to the complaint, is that it is involved in implementing plans for the homeless to obtain housing, and there are no allegations of any acts or omissions performed by the defendant to state a cause of action for negligence.

The court also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional tort, finding that the complaint does not properly plead any intentional tort, and there is no indication of any intentional conduct on the part of the defendant arising from the hot-water-throwing incident.

The court gives the plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint at the hearing, but unless the plaintiff's counsel can show how the causes of action can be cured to state a cognizable claim against the defendant, the demurrer will be sustained without leave to amend.
