BACKGROUND Cross-Defendant American Guard Services, Inc. ("AGS”) contends it propounded (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for inspection and production of documents, set one, on plaintiff Justin Biggers (“Plaintiff”) on August 9, 2023. After not receiving responses, AGS’ counsel met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel’s paralegal, who stated that they could not locate Plaintiff and are unable to provide responses. Plaintiff’s counsel has withdrawn from the matter, and Plaintiff has not served responses to date. AGS therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery.  The instant motions were served on Plaintiff in pro per. The motions are unopposed.   II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)   Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, AGS’ unopposed motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to AGS’ (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (2) demand for inspection and production of documents, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of March 2024      Hon.
