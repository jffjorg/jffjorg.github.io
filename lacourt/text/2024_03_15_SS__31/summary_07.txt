And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of American Guard Services, Inc. (AGS) in their unopposed motions to compel initial discovery responses from plaintiff Justin Biggers. AGS propounded discovery requests on August 9, 2023, but Biggers failed to respond despite being properly served. Biggers' counsel withdrew from the case, and Biggers has not served responses to date. The judge found that AGS met the requirements for a motion to compel, which includes proper service, expiration of the time to respond, and failure to provide a timely response. The judge granted the unopposed motions and ordered Biggers to serve verified responses to AGS' discovery requests without objections within 30 days.
