 Case Number:  21STCV46427    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 03/15/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 21STCV46427 ZHEN ZHOU, et al. vs TINGTING YOU, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Laura Zhou, Age 6 RECOMMENDATION: Deny  TENTATIVE¿  The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and her parent. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $550,000,  with $50,000 being apportioned to Laura Zhou (“Claimant”). Claimant is not a party to this action. However, Claimant is a recipient to the settlement agreement between the parties to resolve all claims related to the underlying incident. If the settlement is approved, $12,500 will be used for attorneys’ fees. The net balance of $37,500 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The petition filed on February 15, 2024 is denied for the following reasons:  First, Attachment 11b(6) (reasons for the apportionment of the settlement payments between the claimant and each other plaintiff) is absent from the petition.  Second, Petitioner proposes that the net proceeds be deposited into a blocked account. However, Petitioner is requested to carefully review Item 18 to ensure that the correct disposition is indicated. Petitioner here marks Item 18(a)(3) without first marking Item 18(a). However, there does not appear to be any guardianship of the estate of Claimant for 18(a) to be appropriate. Petitioner, through Counsel, is to carefully review the petition and consider whether Item 18(b) and the corresponding 18(b)(2) would be more accurate under these circumstances. Additionally, Petitioner must provide an Attachment 18 that specifies the name, branch, and address of the depository.  Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
