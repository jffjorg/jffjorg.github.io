And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Anthony Clark Chavis, Jr. to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff propounded form interrogatories on June 30, 2022, but the defendant failed to respond. Although the defendant's counsel has been unable to locate the defendant, the judge finds that the defendant's silence is not a sufficient reason to avoid responding to the discovery requests. The judge orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories without objections within 15 days.

The judge also awards the plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $400 for attorney's fees and $61.65 for a motion filing fee. The judge imposes sanctions of $461.65 on the defendant, to be paid within 20 days.

The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email. If no objections are submitted, the parties should appear remotely or in person for oral argument on March 15, 2024.
