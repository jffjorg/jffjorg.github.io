And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in a case brought by Pablo H. Durelli. The case arises from Durelli's purchase of a 2019 Hyundai Ioniq, and he is suing Hyundai Motor America and DTHLA Motors, LLC for various claims, including breach of warranty. Hyundai Motor America argues that Durelli agreed to arbitrate his claims through an arbitration agreement, but the judge has found that the agreement is not enforceable. The judge has also found that the arbitration agreement only applies to disputes related to the "connected services" offered by Hyundai Motor America, and not to Durelli's warranty claims. As a result, the judge has denied Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration and has allowed the case to proceed to trial.
