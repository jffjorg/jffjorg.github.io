And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for an order directing that the defendant has waived any and all objections to the plaintiff's production of documents and general form interrogatories. The defendant is also sanctioned, jointly and severally with its counsel, in the amount of $2,800, due within 30 days of the entry of this order. The defendant failed to comply with the court's discovery order and has not provided any discovery responses or paid any portion of the monetary sanctions awarded. The judge concludes that the defendant's failure to oppose the motion indicates that the defendant is either unwilling or unable to litigate the action, and therefore takes it as a concession on the merits.
