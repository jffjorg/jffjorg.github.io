And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order. The defendant had argued that the court's order was in error and that reconsideration was warranted. However, the judge found that the defendant's arguments were not based on new facts or law and were therefore untimely. The judge also noted that a motion for reconsideration cannot simply ask the court to reevaluate its previous decision, but must be based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion and the court's previous order will stand.
