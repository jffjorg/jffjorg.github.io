  TITLE OF CALIFORNIA, et al.   

 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV23067
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  November 14, 2024




 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is GRANTED. 
 
On 9/25/2023,
Plaintiff James Reynolds (Plaintiff) filed suit against Stewart Title of
California, and Steve M. Lessack (collectively, Defendants), alleging: (1)
sexual harassment (quid pro quo; hostile work environment; and perceived sexual
orientation); (2) retaliation; (3) failure to prevent; and (4) wrongful
termination.
 
On
10/14/2024, Plaintiff moved for leave to file a filed amended complaint (FAC). 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend to add a fifth cause of action for breach of written employment
contract. 
 
The
policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion
to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
 
Here,
trial is not until 9/8/2025, and Plaintiff’s new cause of action relates to the
same employment contract which supports his preexisting tort claims. Plaintiff’s
motion is adequately supported by a proposed amended pleading and a substantive
explanation as to why the new allegations are necessary. Accordingly, the Court
finds no meaningful prejudice would result from granting leave to amend. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
