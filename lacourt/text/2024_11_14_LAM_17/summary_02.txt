And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend to file a filed amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff, James Reynolds, filed a lawsuit against Stewart Title of California and Steve M. Lessack alleging sexual harassment, retaliation, failure to prevent, and wrongful termination. The plaintiff seeks to add a new cause of action for breach of written employment contract. The judge finds that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and that the plaintiff's motion is adequately supported by a proposed amended pleading and a substantive explanation as to why the new allegations are necessary. The judge also finds that granting leave to amend would not result in meaningful prejudice to the defendants. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend.
