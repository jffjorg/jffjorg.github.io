  vs.
 
LINDA J. MAULTSBY, et al.        
  


 Case
  No.:  23STCV25626   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 14, 2024




 
Defendant’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
On 10/20/2023, Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401 K. Plan
(Plaintiff) filed an unlawful detainer action against Linda J. Maultsby
(Defendant).
 
On 9/30/24, Defendant moved for reconsideration of the
Court’s 9/18/2024 order overruling Defendant’s demurrer. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), a motion for
reconsideration must be brought “within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.”  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) 
 
Discussion  
 
            Defendant argues that
reconsideration of the Court’s 9/18/2024 Order is warranted because Plaintiff’s
FAC was filed without leave of Court, and because the previous ruling was in
error. 
 
            As to the first contention, Defendant
seeks reconsideration of the 9/18/2024 demurrer ruling based
on her argument that her demurrer to the original complaint—not the FAC— was
taken off calendar in error when she did not appear at the hearing on those
demurrers. However, first, this is not a new fact, as this procedural action
was known at the time of the 9/18/2024 hearing, nor has Plaintiff identified
any new law not known at the time. Second, the 9/18/2024 ruling concerned Defendant’s
demurrer to the FAC. As such, Defendant’s argument that the Court purportedly
erred when it vacated her demurrers to the original complaint and deemed the
FAC valid on 3/4/2024 is untimely. (CCP § 1008, subd. (a).) 
 
            As
to the second contention, Defendant expressly asks the Court to reconsider the
“actual grounds pleaded and arguments made in demurrers to the FAC and reply
papers.” (See Motion, 2: 10.) However, a motion for reconsideration
cannot simply ask the Court to “reevaluate” or “reanalyze” pre-existing factual
and/or legal issues and/or arguments previously made. (See Crotty v. Trader
(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 765, 771.) The Court considered all submitted moving
papers when reaching its 9/18/2024 ruling. Accordingly, the Court may not
properly reevaluate its substantive decision, unless there are some new facts
or law which would warrant such reconsideration. Defendant has not identified
any applicable new facts or law. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
