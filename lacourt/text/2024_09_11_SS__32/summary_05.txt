Here is a summary in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel (Nathalie E. Corral and Ashley A. Laiken) to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Maliyah McKnight. Counsel is seeking to withdraw from the case due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and communications.

The judge has denied the motion because Counsel failed to provide a service list with the moving papers, which is required by California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Additionally, Counsel failed to provide evidence that Plaintiff has consented to electronic service.

The judge has ordered Counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proofs of service.
