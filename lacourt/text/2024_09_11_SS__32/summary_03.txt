And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Andrew Gutierrez, has moved to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One. The plaintiff, Daniel Gomez, has failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests. The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses in the past, and the plaintiff has been given multiple extensions to provide responses. The plaintiff has finally served discovery responses, but they are still deficient.

The court finds that the plaintiff has not made a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information requested in the interrogatories. The plaintiff's responses are evasive and incomplete, and the defendant is entitled to further responses.

The court also finds that the plaintiff's responses to the demand for production of documents are incomplete and inadequate. The plaintiff has failed to comply with the demand and has not produced all requested documents.

The court grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the interrogatories and demand for production of documents. The plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses within 10 days.

The court also awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $1,561.53. The defendant is entitled to notice and proof of service of the sanctions.
