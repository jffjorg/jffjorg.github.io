BACKGROUND
 
On
June 29, 2021, Plaintiff Daniel Gomez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendant Andrew Gutierrez (“Defendant”) for negligence based on
a motor vehicle accident.
 
On October 9, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One. (Hakopian
Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) Plaintiff did not provide timely responses. On April 16,
2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel responses. (Min. Order,
4/16/24.) 
 
Defendant then granted a further extension for Plaintiff to provide
responses by June 14, 2024. (Hakopian Decl. ¶ 5.) On June 19, 2024, Plaintiff
served discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. C.) Defendant asserts the
responses are deficient. 
 
Defendant now moves to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 4.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 10.1,
10.2, 11.1, 11.2, and 20.2. Defendant also moves to compel further responses to
Demand for Production of Documents, Set One numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10,
11, 15, and 16.
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
On August 12, 2024 and August 13, 2024, Defendant scheduled and
appeared for an informal discovery conference (“IDC”). Plaintiff failed to
appear at either IDC and the IDC requirement was met. (Min. Order, 8/12/24,
8/13/24.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I. Compel
Further Response to Form Interrogatories
 
            A.
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(a) provides that
“on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that
any of the following apply:¿ 
¿ 
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete.¿ 
(2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.¿ 
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or
too general.”¿ 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(b)(1).) “Unless notice of this motion
is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).)¿¿ 
¿ 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(d).)¿¿¿
 
B.
Discussion
 
Here,
Defendant seeks to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
numbers 4.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1, 11.2, and
20.2.
 
Number
4.1 asks for information regarding insurance policies in effect at the time
of the incident. Plaintiff appears to have partially answered the interrogatory
but has not answered multiple subparts to the interrogatory. “If the responding
party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an
interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good
faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or
organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (c).)
 
Plaintiff
responded that he “cannot recall any other information regarding my car
insurance at the time of the accident.” However, this does not show that
Plaintiff made a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information.
Moreover, the response does not address whether other insurance policies, such
as medical expense coverage, were in effect. 
 
For
the reasons set forth in Defendant’s separate statement, the motion to compel
further is granted. 
 
Numbers
6.4 to 6.7 seek information on health care providers, medications, other
medical services required by the incident, and future treatment. 
 
Numbers
7.1 to 7.3 seek information on property damage, estimates or evaluations
for the damage, and repairs. 
 
Numbers
10.1 to 10.2 seek information on injuries before the incident that involve
the same body parts at issue, and any physical, mental and emotional
disabilities. 
 
Numbers
11.1 to 11.2 seek information on past claims for personal injuries and for
workers’ compensation benefits. 
 
Number
20.2 seeks information on the vehicles involved in this incident. 
 
Plaintiff
has not responded fully to each of these interrogatories and fails to show that
he made a reasonable and good faith effort to procure the information
requested. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (c).)
 
For
the reasons set forth in Defendant’s separate statement, the motion to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is granted.
 
Defendant
seeks $1,021.02 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of
record, representing an hourly rate of $160.17 and the $60 filing fee. The
Court finds sanctions are warranted, but the amount requested is excessive
given the lack of opposition. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in the
amount of $860.85 (5 hours of attorney time, plus the filing fee).
 
II. Compel
Further Responses to Demand for Production 
 
Defendant also moves to compel further responses to Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, and
16.
 
            A. Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a) provides that
on receipt of a response to a request for production of documents, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses if:¿ 
¿ 
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.¿ 
(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive.¿ 
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too
general.¿¿ 
 
A response
consisting of an objection must specify with particularly the document being
objected to, and, if based on privilege, must provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of this claim, including
if necessary, a privilege log. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240 (b), (c).) 
¿ 
The motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause
for the discovery and include a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b).) 
 
“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).)¿¿¿ 
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310 (h).) 
 
“A statement that the party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with
the particular demand shall state that the production, inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in
whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category
that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no
objection is being made will be included in the production.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.220.) “If only part of an item or category of item in a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is objectionable, the response shall
contain a statement of compliance, or a representation of inability to comply
with respect to the remainder of that item or category.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240(a).)  
 
“A representation of inability to comply with the
particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the
inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230.) 
 
B. Discussion
 
            Plaintiff’s response to demand
number 1 appears to agree to produce said documents, but fails to state that the production, inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in
part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the
possession, custody, or control of that party. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.220.)
The response further fails to demonstrate the Plaintiff has made a diligent
search and reasonable inquiry to obtain responsive documents.
 
            The
responses to demand numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, and 16 state
there are no responsive documents, but fail to comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230.  
 
            Demand
number 9 is nonresponsive and makes no statement that Plaintiff will
produce said documents. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.220.) 
 
            For the
reasons set forth in Defendant’s separate statement, the motion to compel
further responses to Demand for Production, Set One is granted. 
 
Defendant requests $860.85 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel, representing an hourly rate of $160.17 and the $60 filing
fee. The Court finds sanctions are warranted, but the amount requested is
excessive given the lack of opposition. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions
in the amount of $700.68 (4 hours of attorney time, plus the filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION

Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One numbers 4.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7,
7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1, 11.2, and 20.2. Plaintiff shall provide
further responses within 10 days of this order.
