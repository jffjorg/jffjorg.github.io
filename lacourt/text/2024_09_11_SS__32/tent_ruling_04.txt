Petition
  for Minors Compromise

OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed
  



 
 
The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, Austin Villatoro, age 11, filed on July 8, 2024.
The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following reasons. 
 
First, Petitioner has written the incorrect courthouse
address on the front of the petition and proposed order, and therefore has
provided insufficient notice. Petitioner must provide the correct address in a
future petition. 
 
In the previous petition filed January 11, 2024,
Petitioner asserted that Claimant hurt his head, but was not treated.
Petitioner was instructed to provide medical records or a report confirming
Claimant’s condition. (Min. Order, 3/21/24.) In the instant petition,
Petitioner now asserts that Claimant did not sustain any injuries that
necessitated medical treatment, and provides no records. (See item 6.) The
Court requires a parent declaration attesting to Claimant’s recovery and
condition. 
 
Petitioner should not include Claimant’s settlement in
items 11b(1) and 11b(5) as those values should only reflect “persons other than
claimant.” 
 
The values in 17f should reflect the attorney
compensation, and not the net settlement amounts to the plaintiffs. 
 
Attachment 18b(5) appears to be incorrect, since based on
the net settlement amount, $750 should be paid to Claimant’s parent. 
 
In the proposed order (MC-351), 1b should be completed
instead of 1a since this is not an expedited petition. Item 6 should contain
the gross settlement amount ($1,000), and item 8b(2) should contain the
information in attachment 18b(5). 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.

OPPOSING PARTY:

The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, Manuel Galeas, age 16, filed on July 8, 2024. The
Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following reasons. 
 
First, Petitioner has written the incorrect courthouse
address on the front of the petition and proposed order, and therefore has
provided insufficient notice. Petitioner must provide the correct address in a
future petition. 
 
Petitioner
should not complete item 3c since no judgment was entered. 
 
Petitioner asserts that
Claimant was involved in a motor vehicle collision but suffered no injuries
that necessitated medical treatment. Nevertheless, given the type of incident, the Court requires a parent
declaration attesting to Claimant’s recovery and current condition. 
 
Petitioner should not include Claimant’s settlement in
items 11b(1) and 11b(5) as those values should only reflect “persons other than
claimant.” 
 
Petitioner
seeks to have $250 reimbursed for attorney fees which represents 25% of the
gross settlement. The Court finds this to be reasonable. 
 
The values in 17f should reflect the attorney
compensation, and not the net settlement amounts to the plaintiffs. 
 
Petitioner
cannot select both 18b5 and 18b8. 
 
Attachment 18b(5) appears to be incorrect, since based on
the net settlement amount, $750 should be paid to Claimant’s parent. 
 
In the proposed order (MC-351), 1b should be completed
instead of 1a since this is not an expedited petition. Item 6 should contain
the gross settlement amount ($1,000), and item 8b(2) should contain the
information in attachment 18b(5).
