And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for minors compromise filed by Christine Agopian on behalf of her 9-year-old child, Sacha Agopian, without prejudice. The denial is due to the fact that the attorney did not sign or date the declaration in attachment 13a, despite the other defects in the petition having been cured. The Court orders the petitioner to give notice and file a proof of service of the denial.
