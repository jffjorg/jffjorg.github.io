And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed two petitions for minors' compromise, filed by Ana Galeas on behalf of her children, Austin Villatoro and Manuel Galeas. The petitions are denied without prejudice due to various errors and deficiencies. The judge found that the petitions contained incorrect courthouse addresses, lacked medical records or reports confirming the children's conditions, and included errors in the calculations of attorney fees and settlement amounts. The judge also noted that the petitions should have included parent declarations attesting to the children's recovery and current conditions. The judge has given the petitioner an opportunity to correct these errors and resubmit the petitions. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution, they are encouraged to meet and confer and may submit on this tentative ruling.
