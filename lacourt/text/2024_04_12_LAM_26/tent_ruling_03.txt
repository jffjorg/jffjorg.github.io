  Case No.: 23STCV24205
 
  Hearing Date:  April 12, 2024
 
  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Plaintiff’s MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT RYAN TORIGOE’S RESPONSES TO
  PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE and request for monetary
  sanctions IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,035.00 
 



 

Background
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff 1333 Las
Palmas Avenue, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against defendant Ryan
Torigoe (“Defendant”). This is an unlawful detainer action for failure to pay
rent. 
            On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel defendant Ryan Torigoe to provide responses to Plaintiff’s
requests for production, set one; and request for monetary sanctions. As of
April 10, 2024, Defendant has not filed an opposition.  
Requests
for Production 
If “a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it” (Code Civ. Proc.
§2031.300), the party propounding the demand or the interrogatories may “move
for an order compelling response to the demand” (Code Civ. Proc. §2031.300(b)),
unless the non-responding party satisfies his or her burden of proof than an
exception applies. Additionally, “party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4” when failing to provide a timely response. (Code Civ. Proc.
§2031.300(a).)
            Plaintiff served Requests for
Production, Set One on Defendant by US Standard Mail on October 20, 2023,
making responses due on or before October 30, 2023. (Godinez Decl. ¶3, Ex. 1
[Request for Production, Set One].) No responses have ever been received. (Godinez
Decl. ¶ 5.) 
As Defendant has not responded to the
Request for Production, Set One Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.  
Sanctions
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant Ryan Torigue in the sum of $1,035.00. 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c). 
Here, Defendant did not file an opposition therefore the Court is
unaware of any substantial justification for the delay or reasons for it being
unjust. However, the Court finds the request for $1,035.00 for 3.0 hours of one
attorney’s time and the filing/appearance fee at a rate of $325 and filing fee
of $60 to be excessive due to the simplicity of the motion. Therefore, the
Court reduces the amount to $385.00 based on one hour of attorney time at a
rate of $325 and $60.00 in filing fees.  
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant
Ryan Torigoe’s responses to Plaintiff’s request for production, set one granted
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is granted
in the modified amount of $385.00.  
The moving party is ordered to provide
notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
