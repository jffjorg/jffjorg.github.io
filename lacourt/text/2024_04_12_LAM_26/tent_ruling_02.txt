 Case Number:  23STCV03737    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  26 Plaintiff’s  request for entry of Default Judgment is Denied.     The  complaint in this case  alleges 4 causes of action: (1) fraud and deceit,  (2) intentional infliction of emotional  distress, (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (4) breach of  contract. In summary,  the complaint alleges that Defendants breached an oral agreement made with the  Plaintiff because Defendants promised that they would not sell their property,  increase rent, or change ownership. However, Defendants ended up doing all  three to Plaintiff’s  detriment.    Plaintiff’s request for a default judgment of  $211,245.00 is denied because the application is deficient in the following:     1.      Plaintiff  failed to check the box beside “Prejudgment interest at the annual rate of” but  still put down 10% and is requesting $19,200.00 in prejudgment interest in the  JUD-100 form.  2.      Plaintiff has not provided sufficient  evidence justifying the $211,245.00 requested. In support of the default  application, Plaintiff included his declaration and 3 photographs. For  instance, Exhibit 1 is a picture of locks on the property fence and an iron  welder’s truck. Exhibit 2 is the picture of a senior lead police officer’s business  card. These  photos are insufficient to  support a judgment in the amount of $211,245.00.    3.      Further, Plaintiff requests prejudgment  interest but fails to provide any interest calculations as required by CRC  3.1800(a)(3).    4.      There is no affidavit or declaration under  penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California in support of the  judgment sought. Plaintiff’s only submitted declaration is insufficient because  it fails to include the “penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of  California” language.    Plaintiff must refile its documents to address the issues  identified above.   This matter is continued for an OSC re Default Judgment on May 3, 2024, at 8:30  a.m.
