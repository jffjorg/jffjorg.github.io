(“Plaintiff”) filed the action against defendants

Vierri, Inc., a California corporation; Hassan Saleh a/k/a Hassan K.
Saleh, an individual; Mahmoud Saleh a/k/a Mahmoud K. Saleh, an individual; and
Does 1-10 (collectively, “Defendants”). 
 alleging five causes of action. The causes of
action alleged are (1) complaint for money; (2) breach of written contract; (3)
open book account; (4) goods sold and delivered; and (5) account stated.  
On October 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Jem Logistics Services Ltd, Inc., a
California corporation; Jem Logistics Services Transport, a California
corporation; Julie Maske a/k/a Julie Michelle Maske a/k/a Julie Georgescu, an
individual; Nicolas Georgescu, an individual; Free Zone Clothing, Inc.,

Mahmoud Saleh a/k/a Mahmoud K. Saleh, an individual; and Does 1-10 (collectively,
“Defendants”) asserting the same five causes of action in the original
complaint.   
            On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants
Vierri, Inc. (“Vierri”) and Mahmoud Saleh a/k/a Mahmoud K. Saleh ("Mahmoud
Saleh") executed a "Confidential General Release and Settlement
Agreement" ("the Settlement Agreement"), where these Defendants
settled the claims alleged against them in this case for the principal sum of
$52,000.00, payable over 43 months. The Settlement Agreement includes the
following provision “The Stipulation will contain an Order for Conditional
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6
pursuant to which the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the
Stipulation.” (Besnyl Decl. ¶ 3; Ex. 1.)  On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Defendants
Vierri and Mahmoud Saleh subject to the Court’s retention of jurisdiction under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
to enforce the Settlement Agreement with the Court retaining jurisdiction
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enforce the settlement which
was entered on May 25, 2023. On the same day, Plaintiff filed a proposed
judgment. 
On March 8, 2024, the Court advanced the
hearing date of the motion to April 12, 2024. (Minute Order March 8, 2024.) As
of April 10, 2024, Defendants have not filed an opposition. 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides that “[i]f
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” In ruling on a motion to enter judgment the
trial court acts as a trier of fact. It must determine whether the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement. To do so it may receive oral
testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994)
23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  However,
“the power of the trial court under section 664.6 ‘is extremely limited.’”  (Howeth v. Coffelt (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 126, 134.)
Discussion
            Plaintiff moves this court for entry
of judgment against defendants, Vierri and 
Mahmoud K. Saleh, jointly and severally, in the total amount of
$59,138.60, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement between the
parties. Pursuant to the parties’ Settlement Agreement, Defendants agreed to pay
$52,000.00 to Plaintiff.  (Besnyl Decl. ¶
2; Ex.1.)  Under the settlement
agreement, the parties further agreed to the following monthly payments: (a) On
or before June 15, 2023, Defendants shall pay Plaintiff the sum of One Thousand
US Dollars ($1,000.00); (b) On or before July 15, 2023, Defendants shall pay
Plaintiff the sum of One Thousand US Dollars ($1,000.00); (c) On or before
August 25, 2023, Defendants shall pay Plaintiff the sum of Ten Thousand US
Dollars ($10,000.00). The Parties acknowledge that the additional 10 days for
this payment is because Defendants will be receiving the $10,000 loan on or
about August 20,2023; (d) Beginning September 15, 2023 and through December 15,
2026, Defendants shall make monthly payments to Plaintiff the sum of One
Thousand US Dollars ($1,000.00) per month; and (e) No interest shall accrue on
the Settlement Monies while the Defendants are not in default. If a default
occurs and is not cured, interest shall begin to accrue on the defaulted
balance at the rate of 10% per annum beginning on the date of the filing of the
instant action, i.e., January 14, 2021. (Id.; Settlement Agreement 1.2.)
Section 1.4 of the Settlement Agreement
provides that Defendant will have five (5) business days to cure a default
after email notice to Defendants' counsel of a default. (Besnyl Decl. ¶ 7;
Ex.1.) The Defendants failed to make the $10,000.00 settlement payment that was
due on August 25, 2023, but plaintiff agreed to allow the Defendants additional
time to cure their default. (Id.at 
¶ 8; Ex.2.) However, as part of that agreement, the Defendants were
supposed to make a payment of $3,000.00 by the end of December, but instead
only paid $1,000.00. (Id.) Accordingly, on January 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed a "Default in Payment Schedule" letter to defense
counsel putting Defendants on notice as to their overdue payment and giving
them 5-7 business days to cure their default. (Id.)
To date, Plaintiff has not received the
overdue payment, or any portion thereof. Plaintiff has received a total of
$9,000.00 in settlement payments from the Defendants, leaving an unpaid balance
of $43,000.00 still due and owing under the terms of the Settlement Agreement
(plus 10 % per annum pre-judgment interest from January 14, 2021). (Id.
at ¶ 9.)  A proposed Judgment has been
lodged with the Court. (Id. at ¶ 10.)  
            Accordingly, pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement, judgment is to be entered in the sum of unpaid payments of
$43,000.00 plus a prejudgment interest rate of 10% for a total of $59,138.00.
  CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion
to enforce the settlement agreement is GRANTED in the total amount of $59,138.00
consisting of a principal amount of $43,000.00 and prejudgment interest of
$16,138.60.  The Court will sign
Plaintiff’s proposed judgment submitted on January 29, 2024. 
Plaintiff is to give notice to all parties
and file proof of service of such.
