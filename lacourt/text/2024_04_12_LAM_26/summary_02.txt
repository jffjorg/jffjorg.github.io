The Judge's tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff's request for a default judgment of $211,245.00 is denied due to deficiencies in the application. The Plaintiff failed to check the box for prejudgment interest and did not provide sufficient evidence justifying the requested amount. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to provide interest calculations and did not include an affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury. The Judge ordered the Plaintiff to refile its documents and set the matter for an OSC re Default Judgment on May 3, 2024.
