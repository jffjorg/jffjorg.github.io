ANALYSIS:
 
On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff Dennis Block & Associates,
APC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant David Shenky
(“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed proof of substitute service of the Summons and
Complaint on the same date. When Defendant failed to file a responsive
pleading, Plaintiff obtained their default on October 16, 2023 and default
judgment on October 25, 2023.
 
On December 14, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Default and Default Judgment; Motion to Quash Service of Summons. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
The Motion is not accompanied by
a proof of service demonstrating that it, or notice of the hearing date, were
served on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation
of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones
v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Therefore, the hearing will be
continued to allow Defendant to demonstrate proper service of the moving papers
and notice of hearing. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant David Shenky’s Motion to Motion to Vacate Default
and Default Judgment; Motion to Quash Service of Summons is CONTINUED TO APRIL
11, 2024. BY MARCH 14, 2024, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE
MOTION PAPERS AND NOTICE OF HEARING DATE ON PLAINTIFF DENNIS BLOCK &
ASSOCIATES, APC. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING PLACED OFF
CALENDAR OR DENIED.
