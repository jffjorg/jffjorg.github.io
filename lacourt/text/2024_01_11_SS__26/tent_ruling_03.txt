ANALYSIS:
 
On August 22, 2023, Petitioner Ralph Monroy (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant Petition to Compel Arbitration against Respondents Jacob Emrani, Esq. and The Law
Offices of Jacob Emrani (“Respondents”). No response to the Petition has
been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Petition is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281, et seq., which provides in relevant part: 
 
On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a) The right to compel arbitration has
been waived by the petitioner; or 
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of
the agreement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a)-(b).) Petitioner
provides evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement in the parties’
retainer agreement. (Pet., Exh. A1, ¶14.) On July 28, 2023, Petitioner
requested that Respondents agree to arbitrate the disputed attorney’s fees. (Id.
at Hakim Decl., Exhs. 2.26-2.30.) Respondents have not agreed to arbitration. (Ibid.)
Therefore, Petitioner is entitled to an order compelling Respondents to
arbitration pursuant to the terms of the arbitration agreement. Specifically,
that the “[a]rbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Los Angeles,
California and under California Law” and “in accordance with the rules and
procedures of the American Arbitration Association.” (Id. at Exh. A1,
¶14.)
 
In light of the Motion to Compel Arbitration being granted,
a stay of the action is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.4.
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Ralph Monroy’s Petition to Compel Arbitration is
GRANTED. THE ACTION IS STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION. 
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING STATUS OF ARBITRATION IS SET
FOR JUNE 18, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
