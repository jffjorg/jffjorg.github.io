And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on Defendant David Shenky's Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment; Motion to Quash Service of Summons to April 11, 2024. By March 14, 2024, Defendant is required to file proof of service of the motion papers and notice of hearing date on Plaintiff Dennis Block & Associates, APC. Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.

The Judge's analysis reveals that the Plaintiff filed the instant action against the Defendant on June 26, 2023, and obtained default and default judgment on October 25, 2023. The Defendant filed the motion to vacate default and default judgment; motion to quash service of summons on December 14, 2023, but failed to provide proof of service demonstrating that the motion papers and notice of hearing date were served on the Plaintiff. The Judge notes that failure to give notice of a motion is a violation of due process and statutory requirements. Therefore, the hearing is continued to allow the Defendant to demonstrate proper service of the moving papers and notice of hearing.
