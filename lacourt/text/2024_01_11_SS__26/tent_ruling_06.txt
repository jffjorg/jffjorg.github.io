ANALYSIS:
 
On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff
California Unique Security Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action for conversion and common count for money against Defendant
Carlos Rezabala (“Defendant”). On November 27, 2023, Defendant filed the
instant Demurrer to the Complaint (styled as a “Motion to Dismiss”). No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Initially, the Court notes that
the Demurrer is not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating service of
the moving papers and notice of hearing on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of
a motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d
754, 757.) 
 
Also, the Demurrer must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41. “Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter,
the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) The
parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the
demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(3).) 
 
The Demurrer is not accompanied
by any declaration, let alone a declaration evidencing a meet-and-confer
effort. An effort to meet and confer being a pre-condition of filing a
demurrer, the Court will not make a ruling on the merits of the Demurrer until
the necessary declaration is filed. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Carlos Rezabala’s Demurrer to the Complaint is
CONTINUED TO MARCH 28, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET
COURTHOUSE. BY FEBRUARY 29, 2024, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE
MOVING PAPERS AND FILE AND SERVE A MEET AND CONFER DECLARATION AS REQUIRED BY
CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 430.41.
