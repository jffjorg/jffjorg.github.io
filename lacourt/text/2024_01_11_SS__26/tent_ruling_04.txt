ANALYSIS:
 
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiffs Norma Jean
Townsend (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Kenneth
Terrell, Jr., Soria Carr, and Southern California Poop 911, LLC (erroneously
sued as SoCalPoop911, Inc.) (“Defendants”). Defendant Southern California Poop 911, LLC filed an answer to
the Complaint on August 21, 2023, then filed a Cross-Complaint on October 24,
2023. The Court notes that the Cross-Complaint was not filed with leave of
court, as required by Code of Civil Procedures section 428.50 because it was
filed after a trial date was set in this action. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
428.50, subd. (b).) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436,
subdivision (b), the Court strikes the Cross-Complaint filed on October 24,
2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Reclassify Action on October 24, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 403.040 allows a plaintiff to file a motion for
reclassification of an action within the time allowed for that party to amend
the initial pleading. (CCP § 403.040(a).) If the motion is made after the time
for the plaintiff to amend the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1)
the case is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for
not seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).)
In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California
Supreme Court held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to
limited only if it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's
damages will necessarily be less than $25,000. (Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.) 
 
In Ytuarte v.
Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278, the Court of Appeals
examined the principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to
reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an
“unlimited” case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiff’s burden is to present evidence to demonstrate
a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must
review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is
obtainable.” (Ibid.) 
 
As the instant motion was filed after the time to amend the
complaint, Plaintiff must show that the case is incorrectly classified and good
cause of the timing of the motion. The Motion is supported by evidence of
Plaintiff’s medical bills showing she has incurred special damages of
$14,879.00. (Motion, Perea Decl., ¶3 and Exh. 1.) When accounting for other
damages for loss of earning capacity, property damages, and pain and suffering,
Plaintiff has demonstrated a possibility that her damages will exceed the
jurisdictional limit of this court. The action was also inadvertently filed as
a limited jurisdiction case when it should have been filed in the unlimited
jurisdiction court. (Id. at ¶4.) Upon realizing this error, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Reclassify. (Ibid.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Norma Jean Townsend’s Motion to Reclassify is GRANTED. THIS CASE IS RECLASSIFIED AS AN UNLIMITED
CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK FOR COLLECTION
OF FEES AND REASSIGNMENT TO AN UNLIMITED JURISDICTION COURT. PLAINTIFF IS TO
PAY THE RECLASSIFICATION FEE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
