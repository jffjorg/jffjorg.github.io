And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to set aside and vacate a default entered on a cross-complaint. Cross-Defendant Phuong Pham argues that the default was entered due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court finds that Cross-Defendant's declaration stating she was out of the country from May to July 2024 is conclusory and lacks corroborating evidence. The court also finds that Cross-Defendant failed to present a strong showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the court grants the motion to vacate the default due to the weak showing and the lack of prejudice to the opposing party. The court orders Cross-Defendant to file an answer within 20 days and awards fees and costs to Cross-Complainant Ventura Park Management, LLC in the amount of $1,350.00.
