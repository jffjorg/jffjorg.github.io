And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Verified First Amended Answer filed by the defendant, Van Nuys-H, Inc. dba Keyes Hyundai of Van Nuys. The plaintiff, Liel Levi, had demurred to the answer, arguing that certain affirmative defenses were unclear or uncertain. The judge has found that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend for six of the affirmative defenses, including those for apportionment, release and settlement, estoppel, waiver, collateral estoppel, and judicial estoppel. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer as to the seventh affirmative defense, which relates to the statute of limitations, finding that it is clear and unambiguous. The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the eleventh affirmative defense, which relates to a disclaimer, finding that it is clear and unambiguous. The judge has instructed the clerk to give notice of the ruling.
