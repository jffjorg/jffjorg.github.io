SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs Frankie
Fuentes and Melquiades Martinez (Plaintiffs) move for an order approving the
settlement agreement between them and Defendant Design Masonry, Inc. (Defendant).
This is an employment law case that stems from Defendant’s alleged failure to
pay minimum wages, overtime wagers, to provide rest periods, to provide meal
periods, to pay all wages earned, to indemnify, and to furnish accurate
itemized wage statements, as well as violations of California’s unfair
competition law. 
 
After
discussions and exchange of documents, the parties agreed to settle. They
believe that settlement is in the best interest of all parties.
 
Legal
Standard 
“PAGA
settlements are subject to trial court review and approval, ensuring that any
negotiated resolution is fair to those affected.” (Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549, citing Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
The trial court must determine that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and
adequate to all concerned. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 332, 337.)  
 
There is a
presumption that the settlement agreement is fair where: (1) the settlement is
reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the trial court to act intelligently; (3)
counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of
objectors is small. (Reed, 208 Cal.App.4th at 337.) This standard
applies in the context of class actions and qui tam actions alike. (See Gov.
Code § 12652(e)(2) [in qui tam action, a state or political subdivision may
settle the action with the defendant despite objections of the qui tam
plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam
plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement is
fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances]; see also Iskanian
v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 382 [a PAGA
representative action is a type of qui tam action].)  
 
Penalties
recovered by aggrieved employees must be distributed as follows: 75% to the
LWDA and 25% to the aggrieved employees. (Lab. Code § 2699(i).) Civil penalties
recovered under section 558(a)(3) shall be paid to the affected employee. A
prevailing employee is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and
costs incurred in the action. (Lab. Code § 2699(g)(1).) 
 
Agency
Notice Requirement 
“The proposed
settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it is
submitted to the court.” (Lab. Code § 2699(l)(2).) Plaintiffs’ counsel has
submitted a copy of the proposed settlement to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency (LWDA). (Melmed Decl. ¶ 62; Ex. 4.) 
 
Terms of the
Proposed Settlement 
Under the
proposed settlement agreement (the Agreement), Defendants will pay a Settlement
Fund of $117,500.00 for a release of all claims, rights, and liabilities by
Plaintiffs and other aggrieved employees arising from Plaintiffs’ allegations
in this action. (Melmed Decl., Ex. 1.) The Agreement provides that no more than
$39,166.67 will be deducted for attorney’s fees, an amount not to exceed
$7,500.00 will be deducted for counsel’s costs, and an amount not to exceed
$5,000.00 will be used for Settlement Administration costs. (Id.) The
Agreement also provides that Plaintiff will be paid an incentive award of
$2,000.00. (Id.) The Net Settlement Amount, minus the award of fees and
costs, incentive award, and settlement administration costs, shall be
distributed 75% to the LWDA and 25% to the Aggrieved Employees. (Id.)  
 
Plaintiffs seek
recovery of attorney’s fees in the amount of $39,166.67 for 49.1 hours billed
(for an actual lodestar of $33,215.10), costs of $7,500 (actual costs were
$4,636.91), and settlement administration costs of $5,000.00. (Melmed Decl. ¶¶ 51,
60, 61.) After subtracting those amounts from the Settlement Fund, $63,833.33
will remain for distribution, $47,875.00 (75%) to the LWDA, and $15,958.33
(25%) to the Aggrieved Employees. 
 
Plaintiffs have
established a presumption that the Agreement is fair. (Reed, 208
Cal.App.4th at 337.) The settlement was reached following discussions between
the parties and document exchanges, which led the parties to conclude that
there were substantial benefits to settling this action rather than engaging in
extensive litigation. (Melmed Decl. ¶ 15.) Plaintiffs’ counsel represents that
the gross PAGA penalty payment is extremely reasonable in light of the risks
and uncertainties associated with the PAGA claims in this case. (Melmed Decl.
¶¶ 50.) Plaintiffs’ counsel has extensive experience in litigating class action
and PAGA action employment matters in California. (Melmed Decl. ¶ 6.) Finally,
there are no objectors to the Agreement.  
 
Even once the
presumption of fairness has been established, the court bears the
responsibility to ensure the recovery under the settlement agreement represents
a reasonable compromise, given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims
being released, discounted by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish
and collect on those claims by pursuing the litigation. (Kullar v. Foot
Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 129.) 
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel estimated a maximum potential exposure of $1,283,200, and discounted
that amount based on factors including the risks of litigation. (Melmed Decl.
¶¶ 44-46.) Weighing the relevant factors, the Court finds that the proposed
settlement agreement is fair and reasonable.
 
Plaintiffs’
motion for approval of PAGA settlement is granted.
