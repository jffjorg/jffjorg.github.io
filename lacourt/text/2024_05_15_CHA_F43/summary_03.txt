The plaintiff argues that the case should be heard in California, while the defendant argues that the Bahamas is a more suitable forum. The judge has granted the defendant's motion and stayed the case pending a status report showing that an action was filed in the Bahamas and that the defendant accepted jurisdiction and waived any statute of limitations defense.
