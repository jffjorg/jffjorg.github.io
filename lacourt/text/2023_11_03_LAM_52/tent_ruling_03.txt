 Case Number:  21STCV43011    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor Cameron Moore’s Motions to Compel Responses to (1) Interrogatories and
(2) Document Demands
Plaintiff/judgment creditor Cameron Moore moves to
compel defendant/judgment debtor Zachery Ty Bryan to respond to interrogatories
and demands for production of documents.
            After
judgment, a judgment creditor “may propound written interrogatories to the
judgment debtor” (CCP § 708.020(a)) and “may demand that any judgment debtor
produce and permit” the creditor “to inspect and to copy a document that is in
[debtor’s] possession, custody, or control” (CCP § 708.030(a)).  
When the responding party fails to timely respond to
interrogatories or requests for production, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling responses.  (CCP §§
2030.290(b) [interrogatories]; 2031.300(b) [requests for production].)  Failing to timely respond waives any
objections.  (CCP §§ 2030.290(a);
2031.300(a).)  
Interrogatories
            Moore
is entitled to an order compelling Bryan to respond to Moore’s special
interrogatories.  On July 6, 2023, Moore
served post-judgment interrogatories on Bryan. 
(Sampson Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 3.)  Bryan
had not served any response as of when Moore’s counsel executed his declaration
in support of this motion on August 30, 2023. 
(Id., ¶ 13.)  Bryan therefore
did not timely respond to Moore’s interrogatories and waived any objections to
them.
Document Demands
            Moore
is entitled to an order compelling Bryan to respond to Moore’s document
demands.  On July 6, 2023, Moore served
post-judgment document demands on Bryan. 
(Sampson Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 3.)  Bryan
had not served any response as of when Moore’s counsel executed his declaration
in support of this motion on August 30, 2023. 
(Id., ¶ 13.)  Bryan therefore
did not timely respond to Moore’s document demands and waived any objections to
them.  
Sanctions
In
each motion, Moore moves for $1,100 in monetary sanctions against Bryan.  Failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery
process subject to monetary sanctions. 
(CCP § 2023.010(d).)  Bryan did
not respond to authorized discovery.  Bryan
did not act with substantial justification and sanctions are just under the
circumstances.  Moore reasonably incurred
$1,100 in expenses for each motion.  
Disposition
            Plaintiff/judgment
creditor Cameron Moore’s motion to compel responses
to interrogatories is granted. 
Defendant/judgment debtor Zachery Ty Bryan is ordered to serve verified
responses without objections to Moore’s special interrogatories, set one (Nos.
1-22) within 30 days.  Defendant/judgment
debtor Zachery Ty Bryan is ordered to pay plaintiff/judgment creditor
Cameron Moore $1,100 in sanctions within 30 days.
