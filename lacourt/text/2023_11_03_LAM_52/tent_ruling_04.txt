 Case Number:  22STCV14586    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment
Plaintiff Munish Batra requests court judgment by default
against defendants Anthony Bruce Eldridge and Lone Tree Entertainment, Inc.  Plaintiff’s
application meets all requirements for default judgment.  
The court notes two errors on plaintiff’s proposed
judgment.  First, section 5.a does not
identify the defendants against whom judgment is to be entered.  The court will modify the proposed judgment
to name defendants Anthony Bruce Eldridge and Lone Tree Entertainment,
Inc. in section 5.a.   Second, section 6.a(1) states the damages
are $702,500.00, but section 6.a(6) states the total judgment is to be $103,766.21.  The court will modify the proposed judgment
to state the total is $702,500.00.
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is granted.  After
modifying it as stated above, the court will sign the proposed judgment
plaintiff submitted on form JUD-100.
