reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of his or her dependents.
(b) The transfer complies with the requirements of this article, will not
contravene other applicable law, and the court has reviewed and approved the
transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. 
Insurance Code section 10139.5(b) requires the court
to consider 15 enumerated factors in determining whether this transfer should
