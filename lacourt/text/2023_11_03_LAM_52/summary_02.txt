  - "Courts regard medical records as presumptively private, such that plaintiff was not required to state the obvious in a declaration, that she would be personally embarrassed to have her medical records copied into court records."
  - "There is no concrete evidence of any interest, let alone an overriding one, that would be damaged by the unsealing of these materials."
  - "A party who knowingly participates in the arbitration process without disclosing a ground for declaring it invalid is properly cast into the outer darkness of forfeiture."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motions to seal records and vacate the arbitration award. The plaintiffs, Alvarado Hospital, LLC et al., moved to seal portions of the final arbitration award, while the defendant, Health Net of California, Inc., moved to seal the plaintiffs' petition to confirm arbitration award and its supporting papers.

The judge denied both motions, finding that the plaintiffs did not meet the requirements for sealing the records and that Health Net did not provide sufficient evidence to support its motion to seal.

The judge also confirmed the arbitration award, finding that the arbitrator did not exceed his powers and that the award was not based on material errors of law. The judge rejected Health Net's argument that the arbitrator refused to hear material evidence regarding claims settled with delegated entities, finding that the arbitrator's decision was not based on a refusal to hear evidence, but rather on a determination that the hearing was deemed closed.

The judge also rejected Health Net's argument that the arbitrator failed to consider the PPAs' arbitration provisions and the parties' stipulation to arbitrate, finding that the arbitrator did consider these provisions and correctly applied them to the dispute.

The judge's decision is based on the California Rules of Court, the Code of Civil Procedure, and various case citations.
