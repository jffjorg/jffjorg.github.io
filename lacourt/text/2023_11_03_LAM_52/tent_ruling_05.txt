            Plaintiff Santa Fe Lofts Pacific Owner LLC requests
court judgment by default in its unlawful detainer action against defendants Eunjin
(Hana) Joo and Moon Joo.  Plaintiff’s application meets all
requirements for default judgment.  
The court finds an error in the total amount in
plaintiff’s proposed judgment.  (Form
UD-110, § 6.a(6).  It states the total is
$65,185.50, but the four components of the judgment total $66,124.10.  Plaintiff’s other papers correctly state the
total amount is $66,124.10.  The court
will modify the proposed judgment to state the total is $66,124.10.
Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is granted. 
After modifying it as stated above, the court will sign the proposed
judgment plaintiff submitted on form UD-110.
