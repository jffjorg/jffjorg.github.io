And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing that was set for November 3, 2023, to provide adequate notice to the debtor, Youngran Cho. The hearing was originally set fewer than 30 days after the court granted the judgment creditor's application for the order to show cause, which did not allow enough time for notice to the debtor. The judge has determined that the judgment creditor failed to follow the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 704.770, subdivision (b), which requires that notice be given to the debtor at least 30 days before the hearing. As a result, the judge has continued the hearing to December 14, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., and ordered the judgment creditor to serve notice of the continued hearing as required by law. The judge will sign the proposed order to show cause with the new hearing date.
