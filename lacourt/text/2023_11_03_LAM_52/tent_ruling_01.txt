  Case Number:  19STCP02468    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  52 Order to
Show Cause Re: Sale of Dwelling Located at 14127 Avenida Espana, La Mirada, CA
90638
Judgment creditor
Nextwave Enterprises LLC applied for an order for sale of judgment debtor
Youngran Cho’s dwelling under Code of Civil Procedure section 704.750.  
On October 17,
2023, the court set this hearing for November 3, 2023.  The hearing date did not allow enough time for
notice to debtor Cho.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 704.770, subdivision (b) provides: “Not later than 30 days
before the time set for hearing, the judgment creditor shall do both of the
following: [¶] (1) Serve on the judgment debtor a copy of the order to show
cause, a copy of the application of the judgment creditor, and a copy of the
notice of the hearing in the form prescribed by the Judicial Council. Service
shall be made personally or by mail. [¶] (2) Personally serve a copy of each
document listed in paragraph (1) on an occupant of the dwelling or, if there is
no occupant present at the time service is attempted, post a copy of each
document in a conspicuous place at the dwelling.”  
This hearing was
set fewer than 30 days after the court granted judgment creditor’s application
for the order to show cause.  The court
therefore will continue this hearing to permit adequate notice to debtor Cho.  Judgment creditor must serve notice of the
continued hearing as required under Code of Civil Procedure section 704.770,
subdivision (b).  
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 704.770, subdivision (a), the court finds good cause
to set the order to show cause hearing later than 45 days after judgment
creditor filed this application.  The court hereby continues this
hearing to December 14, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. 
The court will sign the proposed order to show cause with the hearing
set for December 14, 2023, at 9:00 a.m.
