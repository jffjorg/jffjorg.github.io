  CASE NO.: 23STCV15650
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION  TO COMPEL ARBITRATION AND STAY PROCEEDINGS
 
Date: 
  December 12, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Lyft, Inc. (“Moving
Defendant”)
 
            The Court has
considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) assault; (2) battery; (3) negligence;
(4) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act; and (5) intentional infliction of
emotional distress.  
 
On September 8,
2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the
proceedings (the “Motion”) on the grounds that Plaintiff entered into an
agreement as a condition of using Moving Defendant’s services that requires
that the claims alleged in the Complaint be resolved in binding
arbitration.  On November 29, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to the Motion that states that
Plaintiff agrees to participate in arbitration proceedings.  
 
            In light of Plaintiff’s
non-opposition, the Court GRANTS the Motion and orders that
Plaintiff’s claims be resolved in arbitration. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  The Court STAYS the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration
proceedings.  The Court schedules a
status conference on June 11, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.  The parties are to submit a joint status
report by June 4, 2024.
 
 Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
        
Dated this 12th day of December 2023
