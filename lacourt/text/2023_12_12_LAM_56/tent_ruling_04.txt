  CASE NO.:  23STCV06136
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEMURRER AND
  MOTION TO STRIKE
 
Date: December 12, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTIES: Defendants
B&K Enterprise, Inc. (“B&K”); Soojin Kelly Kim (“Soojin”); and Brandon
Kim (“Brandon”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”)[1]
 
RESPONDING PARTY:
Plaintiff 
 
The Court has
considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out
of a sublease arrangement.  The currently
operative second amended complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of oral
agreement; (2) wrongful retention of security deposit under Civil Code section
1950, subdivision (c); (3) money had and received; (4) breach of the covenant
of quiet enjoyment; and (5) unfair competition under Business and Professions
Code section 17200.
 
In relevant part, the
SAC alleges: In 2019, Plaintiff and Moving Defendants entered into an oral
agreement (the “Sublease Agreement”) for Plaintiff to sublet a second-floor
commercial space (the “Premises”) from Moving Defendants.  (See SAC ¶¶ 8, 18.)  Under the Sublease Agreement, Plaintiff
agreed to make monthly rent payments of $40,000 for the duration of Moving Defendants’
master tenancy, during which time Plaintiff would operate a karaoke business
and utilize Moving Defendants’ services and infrastructure.  (See id.)  
 
Plaintiff took
possession of the Premises in 2019.  (SAC
¶ 19.)  Plaintiff and Moving
Defendants performed under the Sublease Agreement for about three years.  (SAC ¶ 20.)  On or about February 22, 2023, however,
Brandon presented Plaintiff with a new written sublease agreement that
indicated that the Premises would be sublet to new tenants, and demanded that
Plaintiff vacate the Premises within seven days.  (See SAC ¶¶ 20-21.)  On information and belief, the new subtenants
pay a larger amount in monthly rent, which motivated Moving Defendants to force
Plaintiff to vacate the Premises.  (See
SAC ¶¶ 20, 46.) 
 
On November 6, 2023,
Moving Defendants filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the fifth causes of
action on the grounds that the SAC fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.  Moving
Defendants also filed a motion to strike (the “Motion”) portions of the SAC.
 
 
 
DEMURRER
Meet and Confer
The meet and confer requirement has
been met for the Demurrer and Motion. 
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court
accepts as true all material factual allegations and affords them a liberal
construction, but it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.  (Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246,
1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Fifth Cause of Action: Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”)
The UCL prohibits any unlawful, unfair
or fraudulent business act or practice. 
(Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; see Clark v. Superior Court
(2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610.)  To show a violation of the UCL, a plaintiff
must establish: (1) a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to
qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury; and (2) that that economic injury was the result of,
i.e., caused
by, the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the
gravamen of the claim.  (Kwikset Corp.
v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 322.)  A breach of contract may form the
predicate for a UCL claim, provided it also constitutes conduct that
is unlawful, or unfair or fraudulent. 
(Puentes v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 638, 645.)  To show a
business practice is unfair, the plaintiff must show the conduct threatens an
incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of
one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a
violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms
competition.  (Byars v. SCME Mortgage
Bankers, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1134, 1147.)   
 
The UCL claim is rooted in Moving
Defendants’ alleged breach of the Lease Agreement and the resulting damages
Plaintiff incurred.  (See SAC ¶¶
52-54.)  The Court is not persuaded that the
facts in the SAC are sufficient to allege that the breach of the Lease
Agreement was also unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent.  Plaintiff’s opposition (the “Demurrer
Opposition”) does not clearly articulate how the facts of the SAC fall within
the legal framework of the unfairness prong of the UCL.  Plaintiff has not shown the ability to amend
this claim to state a valid cause of action. 
The Court therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the fifth cause of action
without leave to amend.  
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
Legal
Standard
Under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 436, a motion to strike either: (1) strikes any irrelevant,
false or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strikes any pleading
or part thereof not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule or order of court.  (CCP § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
            The
Motion seeks to strike allegations from paragraphs 28 and 46 of the SAC.  Paragraph 26 concerns punitive damages and
paragraph 48 alleges that Defendants Soon Han Pak, Chung Hyuk Pak, and 3855
Wilshire Blvd Property, LLC (collectively, the “3855 Wilshire Defendants”)
assisted Moving Defendants’ scheme to terminate the Lease Agreement.  (See SAC ¶¶ 28, 46.)  
 
            The
request for punitive damages is not alleged in connection with a particular
claim, and Plaintiff does not identify a cause of action that may form the
basis for a punitive damages award.  (See
Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).) 
Paragraph 46 is alleged in connection with the fourth cause of
action.  The Court previously sustained
the 3855 Wilshire Defendants’
demurrer to the SAC’s fourth cause of action. 
In addition, Plaintiff does not offer any authority that demonstrates a
legal basis for imposing secondary liability in breach of the covenant of quiet
enjoyment actions.  The Court therefore
GRANTS the Motion without leave to amend. 

 
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 

 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar. 
 
 
Dated this 12th day of December 2023
