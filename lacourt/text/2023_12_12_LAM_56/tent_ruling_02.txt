  CASE NO.: 19STCV45806
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: 
  December 12, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: January 22, 2024
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Steffanie Stelnick (“Stelnick”)
 
On
November 6, 2023, Stelnick filed motions to be relieved as counsel for
Defendants Christopher L. Adams (“Adams”), Nicolo James Rusconi (“Rusconi”),
RVCC Intersect, LLC (“RVCC”), and Reserve Vault, LLC (“Reserve Vault”)
(collectively, the “Motions”). The Motions are compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motions are unopposed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
In
support of the Motions, Stelnick declares that there are irreconcilable
differences that require her to withdraw as Defendants’ counsel.  Given the imminence of trial and the
requirement that business entity Defendants RVCC and Reserve Vault be
represented by counsel, the Stelnick Declarations do not provide sufficient
information for the Court to determine if withdrawal is appropriate at this
stage in the litigation.  Absent
additional information that may be presented at the time of the hearing, the Court
provisionally DENIES the Motions without prejudice. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
         Dated this 12th day of December 2023
