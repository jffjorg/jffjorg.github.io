The judge, Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Steffanie Stelnick on behalf of defendants Christopher L. Adams, Nicolo James Rusconi, RVCC Intersect, LLC, and Reserve Vault, LLC. The motion is unopposed and seeks to withdraw Stelnick as counsel due to irreconcilable differences. However, the court is provisionally denying the motion without prejudice, citing the imminence of trial and the requirement that business entity defendants RVCC and Reserve Vault be represented by counsel. The court is requiring additional information to determine if withdrawal is appropriate at this stage in the litigation.
