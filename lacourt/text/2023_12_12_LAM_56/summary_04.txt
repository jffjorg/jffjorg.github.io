And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Jinhee Kim, alleges that the defendants breached an oral sublease agreement and wrongfully retained a security deposit. The defendants have moved to strike certain allegations and to demur to the fifth cause of action, which alleges unfair competition.

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action without leave to amend, finding that the allegations do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court has also granted the motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint.

The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website. If the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
