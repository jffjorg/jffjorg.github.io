And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Fleet Capital, Inc., Sam Ostayan, and Inco Builders. The court grants in part the motion, finding that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication on the first, second, and seventh causes of action against Inco and Ostayan. However, the court denies the motion on all other grounds.

The court also denied Culkin's motion to quash the stipulation between Best Alliance and Culkin regarding Best Alliance's non-monetary status.

The main issues in the case are whether Culkin defaulted on a loan, whether the notice of default was properly recorded, and whether Culkin adequately tendered payment prior to foreclosure. The court found that there is a triable issue of fact with regards to whether Culkin was required to make installment payments, and therefore, the court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on these grounds.

The court also noted that the defendants failed to establish that Inco and Fleet were Ostayan's alter egos, and therefore, Ostayan and Inco are entitled to summary judgment on the first, second, and seventh causes of action.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, with some claims being granted and others being denied. The case will proceed to a hearing on August 12, 2024, where the court will consider the parties' arguments and make a final ruling.
