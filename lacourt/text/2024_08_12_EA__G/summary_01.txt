And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied Sunny Way Corporation's motion to lift the stay of proceedings. The motion was filed on June 10, 2024, and a hearing was set for August 12, 2024. The stay was originally ordered on May 28, 2024, following notice of pending bankruptcy proceedings involving Sunny Way Trucking Inc. Sunny Way Corporation argued that the stay should be lifted because it is not involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, but the court denied the motion. The court found that there is a significant risk of duplicative proceedings if the stay is lifted against Sunny Way Corporation while proceedings against Sunny Way Trucking remain stayed. The court exercised its discretion to keep proceedings stayed against Sunny Way Corporation to manage and fashion procedures to control litigation and ensure the orderly administration of justice.
