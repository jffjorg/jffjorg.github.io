Summary: The Judge denies Jabril Spencer's Motion to Consolidate, which seeks to consolidate the present case with an Unlawful Detainer case (UD Case). The Judge holds that the actions have not been deemed related, have been sent to two different departments, and Plaintiff has not filed a motion to consolidate in the UD Case. The Judge also notes that the case concerns damages related to the purported wrongful foreclosure action and not as to who is in rightful possession of the property.
