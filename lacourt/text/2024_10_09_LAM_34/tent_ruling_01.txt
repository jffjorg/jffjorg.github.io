Background
 
Plaintiff
Spencer Mays (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
 
From August 1, 2011 through May 21, 2017, Plaintiff
resided in an apartment located at 4011 Hubert Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90008
(“Property”) under a written lease which Plaintiff renewed every year. 
 
The Property was subject to the Los Angeles Rent
Stabilization Act. On November 16, 2011, the Property was foreclosed by Aurora
Loan Services, LLC. (“Aurora”). 
 
On January 31, 2012, Aurora filed an unlawful
detainer action against the previous Property owner and all occupants,
including Plaintiff. Aurora voluntary dismissed their entire action with
prejudice on February 7, 2024. 
 
Around August 2014, Defendants IH4 Property West,
L.P. and IH2 Property West, L.P. (“Defendants”) acquired title to the Property.
On August 12, 2014, Defendants filed a second unlawful detainer action.  
 
On November 1, 2016, Defendants obtained a judgment
of possession over the Property. Since Plaintiff was not named in Defendants
unlawful detainer action, Plaintiff filed a Claim of Right of Possession. At
the hearing, Plaintiff presented her lease, and the trial court deemed
Plaintiff’s claim valid. Plaintiff then filed an answer to Defendants’ action.
 
On March 27, 2017, Defendants filed for summary
judgement that was granted for Defendants and against Plaintiff. 
 
On May 21, 2017, Plaintiff was evicted from the
Property. At the time, Plaintiff was paying $450.00 per month for rent. The
fair market value of a comparable apartment was $2,000.00. 
 
On April 26, 2017, Plaintiff appealed the summary
judgement to the Appellate Division of the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
On March 28, 2019, summary judgement was reversed and the case remanded,
holding that Plaintiff was entitled to litigate her right to possess the Property.
Remittitur was not filed until February 11, 2021. 
 
After remittitur was filed, Defendants moved to
dismiss the action against Plaintiff. On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice
of Intention to file a Cross-Complaint. However, Defendants’ dismissal was
granted. 
 
On
June 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Complaint asserting the following causes of
action against Defendants and Does 1-10: 
 
1.              
Violation of Rent Stabilization Ordinance § 151.09; and 
2.              
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
 
On
August 13, 2021, Defendants filed a Special Motion to Strike under C.C.P.
section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP Statute). 
 
On
September 10, 2021, Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion was granted. 
 
On March
2, 2022, Plaintiff appealed the Court’s ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion. On
April 16, 2024, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Court’s ruling stating that
Defendants are entitled to attorney fees and costs of appeal. 
 
On August
6, 2024, Defendants filed this Motion for Attorney’s Fees. As of September 30,
2024, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to Defendants’ Motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16(c) provides for the recovery of attorney’s fees and
costs incurred by the prevailing party in the appeal of an anti-SLAPP motion. (Morcos
v. Board of Retirement (1990) 51 Cal.3d 924, 927; Church of Scientology
v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 659, disapproved of on other
grounds by Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th
53; Harbour Landing-Dolfann v. Anderson (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 260, 263; Evans
v. Unkow (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499.)
 
Discussion
 
1.              
The Parties’ Arguments
Defendants
move the court to award them $148,917.14, which is comprised of $1,154.14 in costs
and expenses associated with litigation, $60.00 in filing fees for this Motion,
$144,703.00 in attorney’s fees incurred, and $3,000.00 for an anticipated six
hours associated with this Motion through hearing. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
Matta Decl., ¶ 10; Memorandum of Costs, p. 1.) 
 
Defendants
argue that since Defendants successfully defeated Plaintiff’s appeal,
Defendants are entitled to all of their fees reasonably incurred as per the
appellate court’s ruling. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, 5:8-16.) Additionally,
Defendants argue that the fees requested are reasonable since courts recognize
that it is expensive for a defendant to prevail on an anti-SLAPP Motion. (Id.,
6:7-18.) Defendants also argue that the requested hourly rate is reasonable. (Id.,
7:13-28, 8:1-20.) 
 
Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition to Defendants’ Motion. 
 
2.              
Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
a.               
Legal Standard 
 
Civil Code section 1794(d) provides that a buyer who
prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the court to
recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.”
 
b.              
Discussion 
 
On
April 16, 2024, the Court of Appeals affirmed this court’s ruling granting
Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion stating that Defendants are entitled to attorney
fees and costs of appeal. (Remittitur dated June 28, 2024.)
 
As
such, Defendants are the prevailing party and are entitled to attorney’s fees
and costs. 
 
3.              
Method of Calculation for Fees 
 
Defendants
argue that the lodestar adjustment method should be used to calculate
attorney’s fees. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, 5:18-25, 6:20-22, 6:27-28.)
 
Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition disputing the lodestar method or proposing a
different method. 
 
The court
uses the lodestar adjustment method to calculate fees.

Reasonableness of the Fees Claimed
 
a.               
Reasonableness of the Hourly Rates
 
                                                        
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
“The courts
repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best position to value
the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this
includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar
calculus. In making its calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge
and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and
reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys
regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other
cases.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437, citations omitted.) 
 
                                                      
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
Counsel for
Defendants claim the following hourly rates: (1) $500.00 per hour for Counsel
Sherri Matta; (2) $600.00 per hour for Counsel Sonali Olson; (3) $600.00 per
hour for Counsel Joel Witzman; (4) $600.00 per hour for Counsel Rajeev Patel;
(5) $250.00 per hour for Counsel Mason Englet; (6) $900.00 per hour for Counsel
Lisa Perrochet; (7) $900.00 per hour for Counsel Mark Kressel; (8) $900.00 per
hour for Counsel Scott Dixler; (9) $100.00 per hour for Olson Law Group, APC’s support
staff; and (10) $140.00 per hour for Horvitz & Levy’s support staff.
(Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Matta Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Defendants
argue that the requested hourly rates are reasonable. (Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, 7:13-28, 8:1-20.) Defendants argue that since Counsel Sherri Matta has
been a civil litigator for fifteen years, her $500.00 per hour fee is within
the range of prevailing market rate. (Id., 7:13-18.) 
 
Additionally,
Defendants contend that although Matta was the primary attorney, three
additional partners from Olson Law Group, APC were also involved in the matter.
(Id., 7:19-28.) Those partners include Counsel Sonali Olson, Joel
Witzman, and Rajeev Patel. (Ibid.) Olson has been a civil litigator
since 1995, Witzman has been practicing since 1997, and Patel since 2001. (Ibid.)
Counsel Mason Englet is a junior attorney at Olson Law Group, APC who has been
practicing civil litigation since 2022. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Matta
Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Additionally,
Defendants retained specialist appellate counsel to assist them in the
appellate proceedings brought by Plaintiff from Horvitz & Levy. (Id.,
8:3-20.) Counsel Lisa Perrochet is a partner at Horvitz & Levy with over 30
years of experience in civil appeals. (Ibid.) Perrochet is also a California
State Bar Certified Appellate Specialist since 1996 and is on the board of
Association of Southern California Defense Counsel. (Ibid.) Counsel Mark
Kressel is also a partner at Horvitz & Levy with previous experience as Chair
of the ABA’s Council of Appellate Lawyers, Vice President of the Los Angeles
County Bar Association, and President of the Barristers Section of the Los
Angeles County Bar Association. (Ibid.) Counsel Scott Dixler is a partner at Horvitz
& Levy with extensive experience in appellate proceedings, as well as, serving
on the Amicus Committee of the Association of Southern California Defense
Counsel and on the Executive Board of the American Bar Association Judicial
Division’s Council of Appellate Lawyers. (Ibid.) The regular hourly rate
for Perrochet is $1,250.00, $1,025.000 for Kressel, and $925.00 for Dixler. However,
Defendants argue that on this motion Defendants are requesting an hourly rate
of $900.00 which is reasonable due to counsel’s experience. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff
has not opposed Defendants’ Motion. 
 
After
considering the information provided, the court finds that the appropriate
hourly rate for (1) Counsel Sherri Matta is $500/hr; (2) Counsel Sonali Olson
is $500/hr; (3) Counsel Joel Witzman is $500/hr; (4) Counsel Rajeev Patel is
$500/hr; (5) Counsel Mason Englet is $250/hr; (6) Counsel Lisa Perrochet is $550/hr;
(7) Counsel Mark Kressel is $550/hr; (8) Counsel Scott Dixler is $550/hr. 
 
Furthermore,
the court finds that attorney’s fees should not be awarded for services
provided by Olson Law Group, APC and Horvitz & Levy’s support staff. (Roe
v. Halbig (2018) 29 Cal.App.th 286, 312.)
 
b.              
Reasonableness of the Number of Hours
 
                                                        
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
“Under the
lodestar adjustment methodology, the trial court must initially determine the
actual time expended and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of
the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made
for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include, but are
not limited to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the attorney
skill exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee
applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It
follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court
finds the time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the
circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney
fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].) 
 
                                                      
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
Counsel for
Defendants claim that the following hours were incurred: (1) 148.20 total hours
and 6.00 anticipated total hours to attend to this motion through hearing for
Counsel Sherri Matta; (2) 5.00 total hours for Counsel Sonali Olson; (3) 1.20
total hours for Counsel Joel Witzman; (4) 5.70 total hours for Counsel Rajeev
Patel; (5) 3.70 total hours for Counsel Mason Englet; (6) 1.50 total hours for
Counsel Lisa Perrochet; (7) 22.70 total hours for Counsel Mark Kressel; and (8)
47.30 total hours for Counsel Scott Dixler. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Matta
Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff
has not opposed Defendants’ hours claimed. 
 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Defendants’ counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
 
Defendants’
fee recovery is based on 241.30 hours Defendants’ counsel spent litigating this
case through the instant motion. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Matta Decl., ¶
10.) The fees incurred are reasonable, as captured in the billing records
submitted to this Court. (Id., Exh. 2-3.) Defendants’ counsel’s billing
records reflect the actual time and descriptions of services performed in
connection with litigating this case. Although the submission of such detailed
time records is not necessary under California law, if submitted, such records
“are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
 
Nevertheless,
since Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to Defendants’ Motion, Defendants
do not need to prepare a reply. As such, Counsel Sherri Matta’s anticipated
time to attend to this motion through hearing of 6.00 hours (3.00 hours to
review opposition, research, and draft reply brief and an additional 3.00 hours
to prepare for and appear at the hearing on this motion) are reduced to a total
of 3.00 hours. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Matta Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Accordingly,
the court grants Defendants’ requested attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of
$120,300.00 for 235.30 hours billed, and $1,500.00 [3 hours at $500/hr] in an
allowance of an additional three hours total associated with this Motion
through hearing. A total of $121,800.00.
 
5.              
Reasonableness of the Costs Claimed 
 
Defendants filed
a Memorandum of Costs listing $620.38 in filing and motion fees and $533.76 of
other costs incurred. (Memorandum of Costs, p. 1.) Additionally, Defendants
list $60.00 for a filing fees of this Motion. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
Matta Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff
has not opposed Defendants’ costs and expenses. 
 
The court notes that as a prevailing party, Defendants
can obtain costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision
(b).
 
Accordingly, the court finds that all of
these costs are reasonable and allowable under at least one of the costs
statutes. The court will award all $1,214.14 in these costs and expenses.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants IH4 Property West,
L.P. and IH2 Property West, L.P.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in
part. Fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff
in the total amount of $123,014.14. This amount is comprised of $121,800.00 in
attorney’s fees and $1,214.14 in costs and expenses.
