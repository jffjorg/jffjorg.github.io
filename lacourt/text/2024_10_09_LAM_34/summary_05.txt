Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted James Dalessandro's motion for attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $60,640.00. Dalessandro is the judgment creditor and Eric Mitchell is the judgment debtor. The court confirmed the arbitrator's opinion and award in 2013 and entered judgment in favor of Dalessandro and against Mitchell. The court amended the judgment in 2016 to make Mitchell jointly and severally liable.

Dalessandro claims that he incurred attorney's fees of $74,720.00 in enforcing the judgment, while Mitchell argues that the fees are unreasonable and that Dalessandro failed to provide sufficient detail regarding the services incurred. The court finds that the time spent by Dalessandro's counsel is reasonable, but reduces the amount of attorney's fees to $60,640.00. The court also finds that attorney's fees should not be awarded for services provided by paralegal Timothy Wilson.
