And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, El Segundo Plaza Associates, L.P. and El Segundo Plaza I, Inc. The defendants argue that the plaintiff, JCS El Segundo, Inc., Jay Shin, and Clara Shin, assigned their claims to the defendants when they executed a quitclaim deed. The judge concludes that there is a triable issue regarding the scope and meaning of the quitclaim deed and denies the motion for summary judgment.

The judge notes that the quitclaim deed is ambiguous and that extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret the deed. The judge finds that the language of the quitclaim deed, which states that the grantor confirms that the existing lease will end on December 31, 2023 and that the grantor agrees to vacate the premises and assign all rights, claims, and interests under the lease to the grantee, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.

The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' evidence suggests that they did not intend to assign their claims to the defendants when they executed the quitclaim deed. The judge finds that a reasonable juror could find that the plaintiffs believed the quitclaim deed related solely to the release of the property, not the lawsuit.

Therefore, the judge denies the motion for summary judgment and sets the matter for trial.
