And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has made a tentative ruling in the case Fred Goldstein v. Joshua Driskell, et al. (Case No. 22STCV25084). The case involves a legal malpractice action, where Plaintiff Fred Goldstein is seeking to compel further responses from Defendant Joshua Driskell to Form Interrogatories, Set One.

The Judge finds that the motion is timely filed, despite Defendant's argument to the contrary. However, the Judge also finds that the motion is moot, as Defendant has already served amended responses to the Form Interrogatories on October 25, 2024.

The Judge also finds that the amended responses are code-compliant and do not require further responses. Therefore, the Judge DENIES the motion to compel further responses. Additionally, the Judge DENIES Plaintiff's request for sanctions.

The Judge orders Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling. The ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to it.
