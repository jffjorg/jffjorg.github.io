MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES BY DEFENDANT JOSHUA DRISKELL TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Fred Goldstein
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Joshua
Driskell
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
This is a legal malpractice action.  Plaintiff, Fred
Goldstein, a self-represented litigant, alleges that he retained Defendants
Joshua Driskell (Driskell or Defendant), Primuth Driskell & Terzian LLP,
and Lagerlof LLP, in November 2018 to represent Plaintiff in the underlying
probate action filed as 18STPB11264 in the County of Los
Angeles.   
 
On August 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in pro per
against Defendants. 
 
On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff served Driskell with Form
Interrogatories, Set One.  Driskell electronically
served verified responses on June 27, 2024.  The responses were a mixture of objections and
substantive responses. 
 
On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel Further
Responses by Defendant Joshua Driskell to Form Interrogatories, Set One.  Plaintiff seeks sanctions against each Defendant
and his counsel of record.
 
The motion was heard on September 12, 2024.  The court found the motion was timely filed
but continued the matter because the parties had not participated in an
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing of this motion.  The parties participated in an IDC on October
8, 2024.  The issues were not resolved. 
 
            On October
11, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Outcome of Informal Discovery
Conference.  The Notice indicates that
Defendants would serve amended responses.
 
            On October
28, 2024, Defendants filed a further opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.  In the further opposition, Defendants
indicate they served amended responses on October 25, 2024.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, parties may move for a further response to interrogatories
where an answer to the requests is evasive or incomplete or where an objection
is without merit or too general.¿ 
Notice of the motion must be given
within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding
party waives any right to compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (c).)¿ The motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)
¿¿¿¿         Finally, California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿¿
 
Monetary Sanctions¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the
discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct
such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection
to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements  
 
Unless notice of the motion is given within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any
specific later date to which the requesting party and the responding party have
agreed in writing, the requesting party waives any right to compel further
response to the interrogatory.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)¿ ¿The
motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)
 
The parties disagree over whether this motion was timely
filed.  Contrary to Defendant’s position,
the motion is timely.  Defendant
electronically served his responses on June 27, 2024.  Accounting for the two extra days for
electronic service (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B)), and the 45th
day landing on a Sunday (Code Civ. Proc., § 12a), Plaintiff timely filed this
motion 47 days later on August 14, 2024.  The motion is timely.¿
 
B.    
Analysis
 
Plaintiff’s motion is moot. 
Defendants served amended responses on October 25, 2024.  A privilege log was also provided.  (Niedabalski, ¶¶ 8-9, Exs. 3and 4.)  Plaintiff has not indicated or otherwise shown
how the amended responses are defective.
 
Even if Plaintiff takes issue with Defendants’ amended
responses, the court finds they are code-compliant.  Defendants asserted meritorious objections
based on relevancy to interrogatories which are tailored to motor vehicle
accidents.  (See, e.g., Form Interrogatory
No. 2.3.)  In other respects, Plaintiff
simply takes issue with the “credibility” of Defendants’ response.  (See, e.g., Form Interrogatory Nos. 4.1,
12.1, 12.2, 12.6.)  
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses by Defendant Joshua Driskell is DENIED.  Given the court’s ruling, Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
