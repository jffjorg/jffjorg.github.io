MOTION TO COMPEL
DEFAULT/DEFAULT JUDGMENT
(Requests for
Admission, Set One)

Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 22CHUD00957

  
Motion Filed: 3/4/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Michael Moshe Perry, in pro
per (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Nasch Canoga LLC
(“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: NOT OK (NO NOTICE FILED)
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling the Court Clerk
to enter default/default judgment against Plaintiff on Defendant’s
cross-complaint.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is denied as
moot.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer
action. On 8/26/22, Plaintiff filed its unlawful detainer complaint against
Defendant. On 11/21/22, Defendant filed his answer and amended answer thereto.
 
On 12/14/22, Defendant filed a
notice of removal of the action to Federal Court. On 12/30/22, the entire action
was remanded to State Court. On 10/9/23, Plaintiff filed its first amended
complaint for unlawful detainer against Defendant. On 10/11/23, the Court
reclassified the action from Civil Limited jurisdiction to Civil Unlimited
jurisdiction.
 
On 10/12/23, the Clerk rejected
Defendant’s request for entry of default/default judgment on Defendant’s
cross-complaint, stating that “there is no cross-complaint on this action.”
(10/12/23 Request for Entry pf Default/Judgment, p. 1.) On 3/4/24, Defendant
filed the instant motion to compel. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that Defendant fails to identify any applicable authority for the instant
motion to compel the Court clerk to enter default/default judgment against
Plaintiff. Defendant primarily cites to rule 8.23 of the California Rules of
Court, which states that: “The failure of a court reporter or clerk to perform
any duty imposed by statute or these rules that delays the filing of the
appellate record is an unlawful interference with the reviewing court's
proceedings.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 8.23.) The Court notes that this rule is
applicable to appellate proceedings, and is inapposite here, where no
delay in the filing of any appellate record is raised.
 
Furthermore, the Court reiterates
the Clerk’s finding that there is no cross-complaint on record in the instant
action. Defendant represents that he filed a cross-complaint in Federal Court
on 12/14/22. (Def.’s Mot. ¶¶
15, 43.) However, the action was remanded to this Court in its entirety
on 12/20/22, which would include any purported cross-complaint filed by
Defendant.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
denies Defendant’s motion as moot. The Court notes Defendant’s remaining arguments
but declines to reach them as they are not within the scope of the instant
motion.

CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The unopposed motion is denied as
moot.  
 
The Court is not requesting oral argument on this
matter.  Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) notice
of intent to appear is required.  Unless the Court directs argument in the
Tentative Ruling, no argument will be permitted unless a “party notifies all
other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of
the party’s intention to appear and argue.  “The tentative ruling will
become the ruling of the court if no notice of intent to appear is received.”
