Ex. 5; (6) June 6, 2024, tentative ruling granting a motion to stay in the
matter entitled, Doe v. Barstow Unified School Dist., San Bernardino
County Superior Court, Case No. CIVSB2227304. – Ex. 6; and (7) June 6, 2024, tentative

– Ex. 7. 
 
            The request for judicial notice is
GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code Sections 452, subdivision (d), (h), and 453 (except
as to the truth of the matters stated therein). 
 
DISCUSSION
            “Except as provided in Sections
917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, the perfecting of an appeal
stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from
or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 916, subd. (a).) 
 
A
trial court proceeding affects the effectiveness of an appeal if “the possible
outcomes on appeal and the actual or possible results of the proceeding are
irreconcilable” or “the very purpose of the appeal is to avoid the need for
that proceeding.”  (Varian Med. Sys.,
Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal. 4th 180, 190.)  Furthermore, the court must consider: “(1)
whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to
succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured
absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the
other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest
lies.”  (Nken v. Holder (2009) 556
U.S. 418, 426.)
 
Motion for Stay
The
District moves to stay this present lawsuit pending resolution of review and
decision arising from a Petition for Writ filed by District in the Second
District Court of Appeal, Division Six (the “Appellate Court”) concerning the
constitutionality of Assembly Bill (“AB”) 218. 
 
            The Court recognizes that the writ petition
pending before the Appellate Court, while it challenges the ruling of a trial
court in Santa Barbara County and not a judgment or order made by this Court,
it does relate to the same issue as was raised in this Court, i.e., the
constitutionality of AB 218. 
Nevertheless, the writ process is much quicker than that in the case of
appeals, such that this Court anticipates that the Appellate Court will rule
relatively soon.  Trial in the instant
case is not until the end of October this year. 
If, in fact, no ruling is made by the Appellate Court until closer to
the trial date, or if the ruling of the Appellate Court results in a Petition
for Review in the California Supreme Court, then the District may bring an ex
parte application to continue the trial. 

 
            Therefore, the motion for stay of
proceedings is DENIED and the Motion to continue trial is also DENIED, but
without prejudice.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions proved on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 25th day of June 2024
