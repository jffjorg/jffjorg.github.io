```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for stay of proceedings or alternatively, to continue trial filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The defendant seeks to stay the proceedings or continue the trial pending the resolution of a Petition for Writ filed by the District in the Second District Court of Appeal, which challenges the constitutionality of Assembly Bill (AB) 218. The judge recognizes that the writ petition relates to the same issue as the one raised in the instant case, but notes that the writ process is quicker than an appeal and anticipates that the Appellate Court will rule relatively soon. The judge denies the motion for stay of proceedings, but denies the motion to continue trial without prejudice, allowing the defendant to bring an ex parte application to continue the trial if the Appellate Court does not rule until closer to the trial date or if the ruling results in a Petition for Review in the California Supreme Court.
