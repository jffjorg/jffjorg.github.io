And here is a summary in English text:

This is the tentative ruling of Judge Holly J. Fujie in the case of LL Jane Doe CE v. Doe Church. The case involves claims of childhood sexual assault, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff, LL Jane Doe CE, filed a complaint on December 20, 2022, against several defendants, including Doe Church. However, the defendants did not file an answer/response to the complaint, and the plaintiff's requests for entry of default were rejected. As a result, the court entered orders for dismissal on March 22, 2024.

The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration on March 28, 2024, arguing that the dismissals were entered through inadvertence and/or clerical error. The court agrees with the plaintiff and vacates the orders of dismissal, reinstating the action against Doe Church. The court gives Doe Church twenty days to file a responsive pleading to the complaint.
