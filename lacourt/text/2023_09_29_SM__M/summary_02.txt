```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the plaintiff, Jessica Jacobs, against the defendant, Steven Ray Ritchie. The case concerns the ownership and possession of a property located at Old Topanga Canyon Road in Topanga, California. The defendant, Ritchie, is seeking to overturn a judgment obtained by the plaintiff in an unlawful detainer action, which determined that Ritchie is not the rightful owner of the property.

The judge has determined that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted in part and denied in part. The judge has ruled that the first eight causes of action alleged by the plaintiff, including quiet title, preliminary injunction, declaratory relief, trespass, nuisance, breach of contract, specific performance, and fraudulent conveyance, are barred by issue preclusion. However, the judge has denied the motion as to the ninth cause of action for defamation, which does not directly relate to the issue of the lease agreement between Ritchie and Ivester.

The judge has concluded that the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of his title to the property in the underlying unlawful detainer action, and therefore, the doctrine of res judicata applies to bar the defendant's relitigation of the issue. The judge has also ruled that the record is sufficiently developed to show that the issue was litigated in the underlying action, and that the defendant expressedly or impliedly agreed to submit the issue to prior adjudication.

```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant Steven Ray Ritchie. The Court finds that the issues raised in the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) are barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion, as they arise from an issue necessarily decided in the underlying unlawful detainer action (UD action).

The Court previously sustained Plaintiff Jessica Jacobs's demurrer on the grounds that the issue of the alleged lease agreement between Ritchie and Lauren Ivester was previously adjudicated in the UD action. Ritchie appealed the judgment and the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment.

The Court finds that Ritchie had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his interest in the property in the underlying UD action, including the issue of the lease agreement. The Court rejects Ritchie's argument that he could not have reasonably presented evidence or legal theories in the UD action that he is now presenting in the SACC.

The Court grants Jacobs's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first through eighth causes of action, which relate to Ritchie's title to the property and the alleged lease agreement. The Court denies the motion as to the ninth cause of action for defamation, which is not directly related to the issue of the lease agreement.

The Court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any objections or further evidence presented at the hearing on September 29, 2023.
