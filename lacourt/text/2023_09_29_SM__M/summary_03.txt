Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to compel production of phone records from Verizon Wireless, seeking call logs and text message logs of Plaintiff Wallach and Decedent for the period March 14-15, 2020. The judge finds that the records are subject to discovery because they are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also finds that the subpoenas are narrowly tailored and do not constitute a "serious" invasion of privacy. The judge balances the right of privacy against the interest in having just litigation and concludes that the privacy interests do not outweigh the defendant's reasonably tailored subpoena.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wallach et al. v. Providence Health System So. Cal., case number 21STCV07431. The Defendant, Providence Health System So. Cal., has moved to compel the production of phone records from Verizon Wireless, specifically the call logs and text message logs of the Plaintiff, Wallach, and the Decedent, for the period of March 14, 2020, to March 15, 2020. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the phone records are constitutionally protected and that the subpoenas would violate third parties' right to privacy.

The Judge has found that the phone records are subject to discovery and that the Defendant has shown good cause for the production of the records. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff has not established a serious invasion of privacy and that the Defendant's interest in obtaining the records outweighs the Plaintiff's privacy interests. Therefore, the motion to compel compliance is granted. The Judge has noted that the subpoena is narrowly tailored and only seeks the record logs of calls and texts, not the content of the calls and messages, and that the subpoena is limited to the relevant two-day time period leading up to the Decedent's death.

significant\_statements:
  - The Court notes that the subpoena is extremely limited in scope and depth. The subpoena only seeks the record logs of calls and texts—not the content of the calls and messages. Further, the subpoena is narrowly tailored for the relevant two-day time period leading to her death. As such, this is not a “serious” invasion of privacy where Defendant must show a compelling need, direct relevance or that there is no alternate means to obtain the information. Simply put, Plaintiffs’ and third parties’ privacy interests do not outweigh Defendant’s reasonably tailored subpoena.
