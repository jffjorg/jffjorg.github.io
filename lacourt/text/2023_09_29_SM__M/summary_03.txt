Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to compel production of phone records from Verizon Wireless, seeking call logs and text message logs of Plaintiff Wallach and Decedent for the period March 14-15, 2020. The judge finds that the records are subject to discovery because they are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also finds that the subpoenas are narrowly tailored and do not constitute a "serious" invasion of privacy. The judge balances the right of privacy against the interest in having just litigation and concludes that the privacy interests do not outweigh the defendant's reasonably tailored subpoena.
