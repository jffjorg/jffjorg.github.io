## English Summary:

The judge is considering a motion for attorneys' fees filed by Defendant Lauren Sanchez after her successful defense against an anti-SLAPP lawsuit. 

While the judge acknowledges the complexity of the case and the significant time spent by Defendant Sanchez's counsel, they find that the total amount of time billed, especially for an unopposed motion, is excessive.

Therefore, the judge intends to award Defendant Lauren Sanchez $250,000 in attorneys' fees, a reduction from the $348,151 initially requested. The judge also grants the $877.35 in costs requested.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees filed by defendant Lauren Sanchez. The motion seeks an order compelling the plaintiff, Michael Sanchez, to pay $348,151 in attorneys' fees and $877.35 in costs incurred in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion. The judge has concluded that the defendant prevailed on the underlying anti-SLAPP motion and that the only issue is the amount of reasonable fees incurred by the defendants.

The judge has found that the requested hourly rates are reasonable and has used the lodestar method to determine the amount of attorneys' fees awarded. The judge has concluded that Ms. Sanchez shall be awarded $250,000 in attorneys' fees, which is a reduced amount from the initial request.

The judge has also awarded $877.35 in costs and has granted the motion in the reduced amount. The ruling recognizes that significant time was spent prior to the filing of the complaint and that counsel has presented significant evidence of additional tasks that were performed, which would justify a higher award of fees. However, the judge has concluded that the overall amount of time was unreasonable and has reduced the award accordingly.

English summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling in the case of LMS vs WLS et al., case number 23SMCP00011, is a summary of the Judge's thinking based on information presented before today. The Judge has determined that Defendant Lauren Sanchez is entitled to mandatory attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c) after bringing a successful motion to strike. The determination of reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court. The fee-setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the 'lodestar' method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted based on consideration of factors specific to the case. The burden of challenging attorney fees as excessive is on the challenging party. Defendant Lauren Sanchez has moved for an order compelling Plaintiff Michael Sanchez to pay $348,151 in attorneys’ fees and $877.35 in costs. The Plaintiff does not dispute that the Defendant prevailed on the underlying anti-SLAPP motion, but challenges the amount of reasonable fees incurred by the Defendants. The Judge has determined that the requested hourly rates are reasonable, but the overall amount of time spent on the fee motion was unreasonable and grants the motion in the reduced amount of $250,000. The cost request of $877.35 is granted.
