Legal
Standard
 
“Under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to
strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees. The fee-shifting provision was
apparently intended to discourage such strategic lawsuits against public
participation by imposing the litigation costs on the party seeking to chill
the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and
petition for the redress of grievances. The fee-shifting provision also
encourages private representation in SLAPP cases, including situations when a
SLAPP defendant is unable to afford fees or the lack of potential monetary damages precludes a
standard contingency fee arrangement.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1131.) 
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v.
Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A]
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin
v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49
[discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an
approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of
the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not
arbitrary. (Id. at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining
the modification of the lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of
Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.¿(Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿General arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 

Defendant Lauren Sanchez moves for
an order compelling Plaintiff Michael Sanchez to pay $348,151 in attorneys’
fees and $877.35 in costs incurred in connection with this action.  There is no dispute that Defendant prevailed
on the underlying anti-SLAPP motion. Thus, the only issue is the amount of
reasonable fees incurred by the Defendants. 

 
Ms. Sanchez’s Fees
 
In their initial motion, Ms. Sanchez’s
counsel claimed a total of 440.9 hours of work. (Bird Decl., ¶ 12.) Ms. Sanchez
proffers the declarations of her counsel, averring the claimed time spent and
rates of counsel, but without comprehensive billing entries. Mr. Bird provided
strategic oversight. (Bird Decl. ¶¶ 11, 13-15.)  The bulk of the day-to-day work was handled by
a junior partner, Mr. Rocos, and an associate, Ms. Wiseley. (Id.) Counsel
provides that they charged as follows: Mr. Bird charged for 57.9 hours at $1,140.00/hr.;
Mr. Rocos charged 177.3 hours at $755.00/hr.; Ms. Wiseley charged 158.7 hours
at $575.00/hr.; and paralegal Alison Hyon charged 43.1 hours at $365. (¶¶ 11-15.)
Lower rates applied from December 13, 2022, through January 6, 2023. (¶ 11, fn.
2.)  Counsel provides that these
attorneys are educated, sophisticated and experienced in litigation. (Bird
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, 4.) Counsel avers that all three attorneys charge at or below
standard hourly rates charged in similar matters.  
 
As part of their fee request, counsel
claimed fees connected with the instant motion. 
(Rocos Suppl. Decl., ¶ 5.)  Those
fees totaled an additional $38,965, based upon 64.9 hours of work, along with $4,530
for the reply brief based upon six hours of work by Mr. Rocos.  (Id. at ¶¶ 5-8.) Counsel provides that
these attorneys are educated, sophisticated and experienced in litigation. (Bird
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, 4.) 
 
Reasonable Fees
 
With respect to the companion
motion for attorneys’ fees filed by attorneys for Defendants Bird, Marella,
Boxer, Wolpert, Nessim, Drooks, Lincenberg & Rhow, P.C. (“Bird Marella”)
and Terry W. Bird (collectively “Lawyer Defendants”), the Court concluded that $198,981.20
in attorneys’ fees was reasonable.  The Court
lowered the requested fee award based, in part, on the close cooperation
between counsel and the overlap between the requests, the duplication of effort
between closely aligned parties, and that the overall time appeared excessive
(although once again, the Court does not doubt the accuracy of the billed time).
These same concerns apply to Defendant Sanchez’ motion.  The Court also recognizes that with respect
to Defendant Sanchez, counsel has presented significant evidence of additional tasks
that were performed, which would justify a higher award of fees.  (see generally Bird Decl.)
 
The Court recognizes that significant
time was spent prior to the filing of the complaint, taking the lead on various
issues, and spending additional time tackling highly sensitive and explosive allegations
against high profile defendants.  The
Court understands why additional time was spent by counsel. The Court also
agrees that “[a party] cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to
complain about the time necessarily spent by the [defendant] in response.” (Peak-Las
Positas Partners v. Bollag (2009) 172 Cal. App. 4th 101, 114; see also
Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217 Cal. App. 3d 647, 654 (“Parties who litigate
with no holds barred in cases such as this, in which the prevailing party is entitled
to a fee award, assume the risk they will have to reimburse the excessive
expenses they force upon their adversaries”). 
These considerations, however, do not make the overall amount of time
reasonable.  Taking the instant fee motion,
the Court concludes that it was unreasonable to have spent over $43,000 in
attorney’s fees for an unopposed motion.
 
For these reasons, the Court finds
as follows.  First, the Court concludes
that the requested hourly rates are reasonable. 
Using the lodestar method, considering counsels’ experience, counsels’ skill,
the claimed time spent on tasks, and the Court’s familiarity with the matter, the
Court concludes that Ms. Sanchez shall be awarded $250,000 in attorneys’
fees.  amount of time (at the above listed
hourly rates) for the work performed in this matter.  Therefore, the motion is GRANTED in the
reduced amount.    
 
As to the cost request, the Court awards
$877.35.
