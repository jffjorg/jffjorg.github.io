This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a case between Plaintiff Theresa Marasco and Defendant 1753 9th Street LLC.

The Judge grants the motion as to all cited FIs and RFAs except FI no. 3.3 and RFA no. 3.

The Judge also sanctions the Defendant's former counsel, Kere Tickner, Esq., Mary Kate Sullivan, Esq., and/or Joel Spann, Esq., jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $555 for discovery misconduct. The Judge finds that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust against the Defendant, as the record suggests that the prior counsel of record was responsible for the discovery misconduct.

The Plaintiff is seeking sanctions in the amount of $6,593.49 and $5,678.24, but the Judge finds that the requested sanctions are unreasonably high and grants sanctions in the reduced amount of $555 as to the FIs and $555 as to the RFAs.
