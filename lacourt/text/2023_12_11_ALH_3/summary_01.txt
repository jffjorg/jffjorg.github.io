And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by Louis Petrie Separate Property Trust (LP Trust) to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Café on Lemon, Inc. (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleges that LP Trust breached the lease agreement and interfered with the Plaintiff's prospective economic advantage.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract are sufficient to state a claim, and therefore overrules LP Trust's demurrer to the First Cause of Action for breach of contract.

However, the Court sustains LP Trust's demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, as the Plaintiff fails to allege how LP Trust's alleged misrepresentations caused them to forego negotiations with an alternate buyer.

The Court also overrules LP Trust's demurrer to the cause of action for declaratory relief, as the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract are sufficient to state a claim.

The Court gives LP Trust 20 days' leave to amend its demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action.
