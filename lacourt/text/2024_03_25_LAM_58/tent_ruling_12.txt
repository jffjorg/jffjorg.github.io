            The
First Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for (1.) breach of contract,
(2.) attempted extortion, (3.) conversion, (4.) specific performance, and (5.) violation
of Penal Code section 502.   
 
            On
January 5, 2024, the Court entered default against Defendant Jennifer Willaims.
Does 1-100 have not been dismissed. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendant Williams. The request for
entry of default judgment is granted in a reduced
amount upon the filing of a dismissal of Does 1-100. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the form of injunctive relief and includes a request
for costs in the amount of $2,495.35 and $56,991.70 in attorney fees. 
 
            First,
the Court declines to enter default judgment as to one party where other
parties remain. (Nicholson v. Henderson (1944) 25 Cal.2d 375, 378 [“[A]s a general rule there can be only one
final judgment in a single action.”].) Thus, default judgment cannot be granted
until Plaintiff dismisses Does 1-100. 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff
requests the following injunctive relief:
 
“A
permanent injunction is hereby entered against Williams, under which (i)
Williams is ordered to return to NewNew the laptop that NewNew issued to her,
as well as all NewNew information, documents, and data, within fourteen (14)
days; (ii) Williams is enjoined from further copying, deleting, or altering any
of NewNew’s company information, including without limitation work product that
Williams created for NewNew pursuant to any contract with NewNew, as well as
information contained on or accessible through the NewNew laptop in Williams’s
possession; (iii) Williams shall hold confidential all Confidential Information
and Third Party Information as defined in the CIIAA, including without
limitation NewNew’s trade secrets; (iv) Williams is enjoined from disclosing
any of NewNew’s confidential or proprietary data and/or records to the media or
any other third parties outside of NewNew; and (v) Williams
is enjoined from contacting any current or former NewNew officers, directors,
employees, contractors, investors, or clients for the purpose of communicating
false and/or misleading information about NewNew or its officers, directors,
employees, contractors, investors, and/or clients.” (Proposed Judgment)
 
            The
injunctive relief is appropriate for the causes of action alleged. However, the
request to enjoin Williams “from contacting any current or former NewNew
officers, directors, employees, contractors, investors, or clients for the
purpose of communicating false and/or misleading information about NewNew or
its officers, directors, employees, contractors, investors, and/or clients” is vague
and overboard, and a potential prior restraint on speech. The Court strikes
this portion of the request for permanent injunctive relief. 
 
Additionally, in
seeking attorney fees, Plaintiff requests fees pursuant to Civil Code section
1717. Plaintiff seeks fees in the amount of $56,991.70 based on the lodestar
method for time reasonably incurred. (Reynolds Decl., ¶ 5.) However, Plaintiff
fails to identify the specific contractual provision that permits attorney
fees. (Diarra Decl., ¶ 12; LASC 3.207.) Further, the requested attorney fees are,
on their face, excessive and unreasonable. 
 
Moreover, it is
not clear on what basis Plaintiff is entitled to recover the $3,746.50 paid to
Setec Investigations for the forensic analysis and memorandum provided. The
Court will order reduced attorney fees in the amount $5,790. 
 
Further, Plaintiff
has not substantiated the $473.75 in “Law Firm Costs” requested. (CIV-100 ¶ 7.)

Accordingly, the

above upon the filing of a dismissal of Does 1-100.
