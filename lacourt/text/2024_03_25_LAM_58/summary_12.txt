The judge also grants the request for injunctive relief, but strikes the portion of the request that seeks to enjoin Williams from contacting certain individuals. The judge orders reduced attorney fees in the amount of $5,790 and reduces the costs to $2,021.60. The judge also orders the Defendant to return NewNew's laptop and data, and to refrain from copying, deleting, or altering NewNew's company information. The judge's decision is based on the Court's general rule that there can only be one final judgment in a single action, and that the Plaintiff's request for attorney fees is excessive and unreasonable.
