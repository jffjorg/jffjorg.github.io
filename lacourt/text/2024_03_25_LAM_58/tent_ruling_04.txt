 
             This action arises from consumer protection
violations. The Complaint, filed on June 10, 2020, alleges Defendant Great
Supplies & Services, Inc. (GSS), which was doing business as a used-car
dealership under the fictitious business name Ayla Motors, committed numerous
violations of California consumer-protection laws in selling the subject 2016
Ford Mustang (Vehicle) to Plaintiff Fernando Flores in October 2019. 
 
Thereafter, Defendant GSS moved to compel
arbitration. On January 12, 2021, the Court granted the motion.
 
In October 2022, the arbitrator
issued an interim award including monetary relief in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant GSS; in December 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award
that included prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees. The following month, Plaintiff
filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award, which GSS did not oppose. The
Court entered judgment on February 15, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor now
moves to amend the judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187. No
opposition was filed. 
 
            The motion
is granted.   
 
Discussion

 
            Plaintiff
moves to amend the judgment adding Mehdi Omrani (Omrani), Kaladar
Co., Inc. (Kaladar), and Luxury Auto Sales, Inc. (Luxury Auto) as additional judgment debtors
based on the fact they are alter egos of Judgment Debtor GSS. Judgment Debtor
also seeks to amend the judgment to include an order enabling Judgment Creditor
to dispose of the Vehicle. 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 187 provides that once a court has jurisdiction over a
party, it may employ “all the means necessary to carry [its jurisdiction] into
effect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187.) “This includes the authority to amend a
judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor, and thereby make
the additional judgment debtor liable on the judgment. [Citation.] Amending a
judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor ‘ “is an equitable
procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to
add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real
defendant.” ’ ” (Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City
of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 280; NEC
Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778-779.)
 
            To
prevail on a motion to amend a judgment to change a judgment debtor's name, the
moving party must show that the party to be added was in fact an original
defendant in the action. (Burlingame v. Justice's Court (1934) 1 Cal.2d
71, 72–73.) In addition, the moving party must have acted with due diligence in
seeking to amend the judgment. (Alexander v. Abbey of the Chimes (1980)
104 Cal.App.3d 39, 48.) The moving party has the burden of proving the facts
essential to the granting of the motion by a preponderance of the evidence. (Wollersheim
v. Church of Scientology (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1017.) The “decision
to grant an amendment lies in the sound discretion of the trial court.
[Citation.]” (Relentless Air Racing, LLC v. Airborne Turbine Ltd.
Partnership (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 811, 815.)


            Here, Judgment
Creditor submits adequate evidence of the alter ego relationship between GSS
and the proposed judgment debtors.
 
“Before the
alter ego doctrine will be invoked in California, two conditions generally must
be met. [¶] ‘First, there must be such a unity of interest and ownership
between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities
of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist. Second, there
must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of
the corporation alone.’ [Citation.] While courts have developed a list of
factors that may be analyzed in making these determinations, ‘[t]here is no
litmus test to determine when the corporate veil will be pierced; rather the
result will depend on the circumstances of each particular case.’ ” (Curci
Investments, LLC v. Baldwin (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 214, 221; see Mesler
v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 300; Sonora Diamond Corp.
v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.)
 
In general,
the conditions in which a court may disregard the structure of a limited
liability company and consider it the alter ego of a member “necessarily vary
according to the circumstances in each case inasmuch as the [alter ego]
doctrine is essentially an equitable one and for that reason is particularly
within the province of the trial court.” (Zoran Corp. v. Chen (2010) 185
Cal. App. 4th 799, 811.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff
submits evidence that Mehdi Omrani is the owner, officer, or director of Judgment
Debtor GSS, Kaladar, and Luxury Auto; further the
parties have the same counsel and do business on each other’s lot. (Cook Decl.,
¶¶ 3, 45, Exs., 2, 10, 20.) Specifically, the evidence shows Omrani was the
sole owner, officer, and director of Kaladar. (Cook Decl., ¶ 45; COE, Ex. 20.)
Further, Kaladar listed Brian D. McMahon as its registered agent for service of
process—the same attorney who represented Judgment Debtor GSS at the
arbitration hearing. (Cook Decl., ¶¶ 3, 45, Ex. 20.) Additionally, Omrani was
listed on the Secretary of State filings for Luxury Auto in April 2023 and sat
for his deposition at Luxury Auto for his remote deposition in September 2022.
(Cook Decl., ¶ 22, Ex. 5, at 8:5-13 [showing Omrani was located at 10423
Hawthorne Boulevard in Inglewood], Ex. 18 [showing Luxury Auto was issued dealer
license for that location in February 2022].)
 
            Additionally,
although not named in the action, Omrani, Kaladar, and Luxury Auto participated
in and controlled the underlying litigation and arbitration against GSS. Judgment
Creditor argues that this is most evident in the fact that Luxury Auto took
over GSS’ (doing business as Ayla Motors) location; now, even though it has no
sales lot, Ayla Motors is still advertising vehicles for sale at that location,
and Kaladar dba Cal Auto Net has a sign identifying itself as “LUXURY AUTO
SALES DISPLAY AREA.” (Cook Decl., ¶¶ 25, 34, 43, Ex. 13, at 3, Ex. 19, at 1, 4,
Ex. 7, at 4-5, Ex. 8, at 2.) Further, in March 2018, Kaladar obtained a dealer
license for Cal Auto Net to operate at 10401 Hawthorne. (Cook Decl., ¶ 29, Ex.
10.) In February 2019, GSS obtained a dealer license for Ayla Motors to operate
at 10504 Hawthorne. (Cook Decl., ¶ 30, Ex. 11.) This location was across the
street and one block south from Cal Auto Net. (Cook Decl., ¶
24, Ex. 7, at
1, 3.) The foregoing evidence (and other evidence) suggests that Judgment
Debtor GSS dba Ayla Motors and Kaladar, and Luxury Auto Sales were all
operating on each other properties treating their respective properties as
their own for business purposes. (Cook Decl., ¶¶ 20-34, 43, 45, 51.)
 
            Additionally, Judgment Creditor has satisfied
the requirement that injustice will result if the Court fails to disregard GSS’s
corporate entity. Specifically, five days before the Court confirmed the arbitration
award and entered judgment, Judgment Debtor GSS dissolved itself. (Cook Decl.,
¶¶ 11-12, 47, Ex. 22.) Judgment Creditor persuasively argues that this action has
hindered his ability to recover on the Judgment, resulting in an injustice. 
 
Lastly,
Judgment Creditor requests the Judgment be amended to allow him to dispose of
the Vehicle. 
 
As
noted above, Code of Civil Procedure section 187 “grants to every court the
power to use all necessary means to carry its jurisdiction into effect,
even if those means are not specifically pointed out in the code.” (Alexander
v. Abbey of the Chimes (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 39, 44 [italics added].)
 
Here,
the current Judgment is for rescission, which requires Judgment Debtor GSS to
pay off the balance owed on the Vehicle and to reimburse Judgment Creditor for
his payments in exchange for Judgment Creditor’ transfer of the vehicle to Judgment
Debtor GSS. (Cook Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 1, at 1:26-2:2 [Judgment].) The Judgment
explicitly states, “Plaintiff shall surrender the Vehicle and transfer his
interest therein to GSS.” (Id., at 2:2.) However, as a result of GSS’
actions to dissolve itself, GSS has frustrated Judgment Creditor’s attempts to obtain
satisfaction on the Judgment. Judgment Creditor argues the amended judgment
request will allow Judgment Creditor to dispose of the Vehicle to pay off the
balance on the Judgment himself.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
has met its burden on this motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to amend the judgment is
granted.
