And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Liv Burger's Motion to Quash Service of Summons. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the service of summons was not effective due to Liv Burger's absence from the premises. The Judge notes that while the process server left the summons and complaint on the doorstep, this does not constitute personal service as required by law. The Judge also finds that the witness Heather Patterson's testimony that Liv Burger was not present during service is credible, despite the Plaintiff's attempts to discredit her. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to show that the service was effective, and therefore the motion to quash is granted.
