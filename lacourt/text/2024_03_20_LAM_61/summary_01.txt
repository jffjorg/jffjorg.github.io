And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is continuing the hearing on the demurrer filed by Ocean Blue Express, Inc. (Plaintiff) to the cross-complaint filed by EK Line, Inc. (Defendant). The demurrer argues that EK Line, Inc. lacks standing to bring the action due to the assignment of its claims to Beg4Clothing, Inc. The judge has set an OSC (Order to Show Cause) to address the Defendant's failure to hire new counsel or file an opposition to the demurrer. The judge is not ruling on the demurrer at this time due to ongoing issues related to the settlement agreement between the parties. The judge is giving the parties an opportunity to resolve their conflict over the settlement before addressing the demurrer.
