COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Petition for Release from Property Lien 
 
 
  
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
Denied.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On or about January 1, 2021, Plaintiff executed a
written credit application and agreement for the conversion of an existing
garage to an ADU. (Complaint ¶ 13.) Defendants Sergio Miramontes, Rosa
Miramontes, and Does 1 through 10 were the owners or reputed owners of the
construction project. (Complaint ¶¶ 7-8.) Plaintiff supplied materials for the
project. (Complaint ¶ 14.) Defendants failed to remit payment to Plaintiff.
(Complaint ¶ 16.) On May 2, 2022, Plaintiff recorded a mechanics lien against
the project for the sum of $35,000.00. (Complaint ¶¶ 17-18.) On August 12,
2022, Plaintiff Jublio Escalera filed a complaint against Defendants Sergio
Miramontes, Rosa Miramontes, and Does 1 through 50, alleging a single cause of
action for foreclosure of mechanics lien. 
 
On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff orally moved to dismiss
the complaint without prejudice. (08/19/24 Minute Order.)
 
On October 2, 2024, Defendants Sergio Miramontes and
Rosa Miramontes (“Defendants”) filed a petition for release of property lien
(the “Petition”). Plaintiff filed no opposition. 
 
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The owner of property or the owner
of any interest in property subject to a claim of lien may petition the court
for an order to release the property from the claim of lien if the claimant has
not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time provided
in Section 8460.” (Civ. Code § 8480(a).) Under section 8460, “[t]he claimant
shall commence an action to enforce a lien within 90 days after recordation of
the claim of lien. If the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the
lien within that time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.”
(Civ. Code § 8460.)
 
“An owner of property may not
petition the court for a release order under this article unless at least 10
days before filing the petition the owner gives the claimant notice demanding
that the claimant execute and record a release of the claim of lien. The notice
shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 2 (commencing with Section
8100) of Title 1, and shall state the grounds for the demand.” (Civ. Code
§ 8482.) 
 
Notice shall be given by personal
delivery, mail in the manner provided in Section 8110, or leaving the notice
and mailing a copy in the manner provided in Section 415.20 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. (Civ. Code § 8106.)
 
Under Civil Code section 8102, the
notice must include: 
 
(1)   The name and address of the owner
or reputed owner.
 
(2)   The name and address of the direct
contractor.
 
(3)   The name and address of the
construction lender, if any.
 
(4)   A description of the site
sufficient for identification, including the street address of the site, if
any. If a sufficient legal description of the site is given, the effectiveness
of the notice is not affected by the fact that the street address is erroneous
or is omitted.
 
(5)   The name, address, and relationship
to the parties of the person giving the notice.
 
(6)   If the person giving the notice is
a claimant:
 
(A)  A general statement of the work
provided.
 
(B)  The name of the person to or for
whom the work is provided.
 
(C) A statement or estimate of the
claimant's demand, if any, after deducting all just credits and offsets.
 
(Civ. Code § 8102(a).)
 
The clerk shall set a hearing date
not more than thirty days after the filing of the petition. (Civil Code § 8486(a).)
The Petitioner must serve a copy of the petition and notice of hearing to the
claimant at least fifteen days before the hearing. (Civ. Code § 8486(b).)
 
A petition to release a mechanic’s
lien must be verified and allege all of the following:
 
(a)  
The date of recordation of the claim of
lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the petition.
 
(b)  
The county in which the claim of lien is
recorded.
 
(c)  
The book and page or series number of the
place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
 
(d)  
The legal description of the property
subject to the claim of lien.
 
(e)  
Whether an extension of credit has been
granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and
that the time for commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
 
(f)   
That the owner has given the claimant
notice under Section 8482 demanding that the
claimant execute and record a release of the lien and that the claimant is
unable or unwilling to do so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
 
(g)  
Whether an action to enforce the lien is
pending.
 
(h)  
Whether the owner of the property or
interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is another
restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to enforce the
lien.
 
(Civ.
Code § 8484.)
 
“At the hearing both (1) the
petition and (2) the issue of compliance with the service and date for hearing
requirements of this article are deemed controverted by the claimant. The
petitioner has the initial burden of producing evidence on those matters. The
petitioner has the burden of proof as to the issue of compliance with the
service and date for hearing requirements of this article. The claimant has the
burden of proof as to the validity of the lien.” (Civ. Code § 8488(a).) “If
judgment is in favor of the petitioner, the court shall order the property
released from the claim of lien.” (Civ. Code § 8488(b).) “The prevailing party
is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.” (Civ. Code § 8488(c).)
 
 
III.          
DISCUSSION

 
Plaintiff recorded the mechanics lien on May 2, 2022.
(Ex. A.) Ninety days after May 2, 2022, is July 31, 2022. Plaintiff filed the
complaint on August 12, 2022. Accordingly, Plaintiff did not file the complaint
within the time permitted under Section 8460 and Defendants may petition this
court for an order releasing the property from the claim of lien.
 
On June 4, 2024, Defendants notified Plaintiff by mail
that they would be filing a petition to expunge the lien. (Ex. C.) Under
section 8482, notice must be given at least ten days before filing the
petition. (Civ. Code § 8482.) Further, when notice is given by mail,
“[s]ervice is complete at the time
of the deposit, but any period of notice and any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period or on a date certain after service of the
document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court,
shall be extended five calendar days, upon service by mail, if the place of
address and the place of mailing is within the State of California.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1013(a); Civ. Code § 8116(b).) Defendants filed the
Petition on October 2, 2024. October 2, 2024, is more than fifteen days after
June 4, 2024. Thus, the Petition was timely filed.
 
Defendants attach a Demand for
Release of Claim of Lien, dated June 4, 2024. The notice contained Defendants’
names and address. (Ex. C p. 1.) It also contained the name and address of the
contractor, Santa Fe General Construction, Inc., c/o Jublio Escalera. (Ex. C.
p. 1.) Further, the notice contained the property’s address, which was
sufficient to identify the site. (Ex. C p. 1.) Finally, the notice was signed
by Defendants’ attorney and the notice identified him as such. (Ex. C p. 1.)
Accordingly, the contents of Defendants’ notice is sufficient. (See Civ. Code
§ 8102(a).)
 
 
The hearing is set for November 7, 2024. The Petition
was filed on October 2, 2024. October 2, 2024, is more than thirty days after
November 7, 2024. Thus, Civil Code section 8486’s requirement that the
hearing date be set for a date not more than thirty days after the filing of
the petition is not satisfied.
 
Defendants attach proofs of service executed on
October 2, 2024, showing Defendants served Plaintiff with the notice of hearing
and verified petition for release of property from lien.  (Proofs of Service filed 10/2/24.)  The petitioner must serve a copy of the
petition and notice on the claimant at least fifteen days before the hearing.
(See Civ. Code § 8486(b).) October 2, 2024, is more than fifteen days before
November 7, 2024. Thus, Defendants timely served Plaintiff with the petition
and notice. 
 
However, Civil Code section 8486 provides that “[s]ervice shall
be made in the same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the claimant as
provided in Section 8108.” (Civ. Code § 8486(b).) A summons may
be served to a party in California by personal delivery, delivery to someone
else at the party’s usual residence or place of business, by mail coupled with
acknowledgement of receipt, or by publication. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 415.10,
415.20, 415.30, 415.50.) Accordingly, service by email is not one of the
methods contemplated in section 8486. Thus, Defendants did not give Plaintiff
proper notice of the hearing and petition.
 
The Petition alleges the claim of lien was recorded on
May 11, 2022. (Petition ¶ 7.) A copy of the Mechanic’s Lien is attached to the
Petition. (Ex. A.)  However, the attached
Mechanics Lien is not certified.
 
The Petition also alleges the claim of lien was
recorded in Los Angeles County and identifies the document number as “Document
No. 20220514463.” (Petition ¶ 7.) The Petition alleges Defendants gave
Plaintiff notice by demanding Plaintiff execute and record a release of the
lien on May 6, 2024, June 4, 2024, and August 22, 2024. (Petition ¶¶ 11-12,
14.) The Petition also alleges Plaintiff refused to execute the Release of
Mechanics Lien following Defendants’ June 4, 2024, demand. (Complaint ¶ 12.)
Further, the Petition alleges Defendants received no response to their May 6,
2024, and August 22, 2024, demands. (Petition ¶ 14.)  Further, the Petition states Plaintiff
voluntarily dismissed his complaint to foreclose the mechanics lien on August
19, 2024, and “Defendants had filed no action, nor sought relief under any law
governing bankruptcy, and there was no restraint to prevent Plaintiff from
timely filing a Complaint to Foreclose on the Mechanic’s Lien[.]” (Petition ¶¶
13, 15.) Finally, the Petition is verified by the Defendants.
 
Thus, although the Petition complies with most of the
requirements set forth in Civil Code section 8484, Defendants have not filed a
certified copy of the Mechanics Lien. 
Further, Defendants’ service of the notice of hearing and Petition did
not comply with Civil Code section 8486. Accordingly, this court denies
Defendants’ petition.
 
Defendants seek $12,964.75 in attorneys’ fees.
(Petition p. 5.) Defendants have not prevailed, so this court denies the
request. (See Civ. Code § 8488(c).)
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Petition is
denied, without prejudice.
