And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' petition to release the property from the mechanics lien. The defendants, Sergio Miramontes and Rosa Miramontes, filed the petition after the plaintiff, Jubilio Escalera, failed to commence an action to enforce the lien within the time permitted by law.

The court finds that the defendants did not provide proper notice of the hearing and petition, as required by Civil Code section 8486. Additionally, the court notes that the defendants did not file a certified copy of the mechanics lien, as required by Civil Code section 8484.

The court also denies the defendants' request for attorneys' fees of $12,964.75, as they did not prevail in the petition.

The ruling is tentative, meaning that the parties may still present arguments and evidence at the hearing scheduled for November 7, 2024.
