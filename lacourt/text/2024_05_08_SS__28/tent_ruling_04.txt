 Case Number:  21STCV39388    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 26, 2021, Plaintiffs Elia Morales, Jose Saenz, Sonia Morales Martinez,
and Leonel Curiel, a minor, appearing by and through his guardian ad litem
Sonia Morales Martinez, filed this action against Defendants Dong Jin Chu
(“Chu”), DJC Transportation, Inc. (“DJC”), and Does 1-25 for negligence. 
On
December 2, 2021, Defendants Chu and DJC filed an answer. 
On
June 27, 2022, the Court found that this case (21STCV39388) and case number
21STCV45209 are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a). Case number 21STCV39388 became the lead case. The cases were assigned
to Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
April 11, 2024, Petitioner Sonia Morales Martinez (“Petitioner”) filed an
amended petition for approval of minor’s compromise to be heard on May 8, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Leonel
Curiel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
Section 12a(1) of the amended petition states that
medical expenses totaled $891.00. Section 12a(3) of the petition states that
the total amount of medical expenses has been reduced by $534.60 as the result
of negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions. The remaining amount
($356.40) typically would be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Here,
however, Section 12a(4) of the amended petition states that none of the medical
expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Section 12b(1) of the amended petition states that Petitioner
paid $356.40 of the medical expenses.  Section
14a appears to indicate that Petitioner is not seeking reimbursement for this
payment. 
The Court concludes that Petitioner is waiving her
right to be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds for her payment of $356.40
in medical expenses.  Based on this
understanding, the Court approves the amended petition. 
Petitioner asks that the
net settlement amount of $1,620.00 be paid or delivered to Sonia Morales
Martinez, 11609 Ohio Ave., #3, Los Angeles, CA 90025, without bond, on the
terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402.  The Court grants the request. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS the amended petition to approve the
compromise of minor Plaintiff Leonel Curiel’s claims filed by Petitioner Sonia
Morales Martinez on April 11, 2024.  The net
settlement amount of $1,620.00 shall be paid or delivered to Sonia Morales
Martinez, 11609 Ohio Ave., #3, Los Angeles, CA 90025, without bond, on the
terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Petitioner is ordered to file proof of service of this
ruling with the Court within five days.
