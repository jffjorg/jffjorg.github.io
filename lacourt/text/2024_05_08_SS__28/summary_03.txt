And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Moses Lebovits and Richard Jacinto. However, the motion lacks proof of service showing service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the parties. Additionally, the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order are inconsistent in stating which counsel are asking to be relieved. Therefore, the Court denies the motion without prejudice and orders counsel to file the proof of service with the Court within five days.
