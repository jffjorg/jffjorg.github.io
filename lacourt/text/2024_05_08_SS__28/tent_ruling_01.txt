BACKGROUND 
On October 7, 2020, Plaintiff
Janice Michelle Supe (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants City of
Los Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1-50 for general
negligence and premises liability.
On May 6, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint against the City, the County, and Does 1-50 for
premises liability.
On June 10, 2022, the
City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Roes 1-10
for apportionment of fault, indemnification, and declaratory relief.
On August 10, 2022, the
Court dismissed the County without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.
On June 27, 2023, the
City amended its cross-complaint to add Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC
(“Montshire”) as Roe 1.  On December 15,
2023, Montshire filed an answer.
On April 10, 2024,
Montshire filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for
production, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories,
set one, and for sanctions, to be heard on May 8, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
The trial is currently
set for November 13, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
          Montshire
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production, set
one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one.  Montshire also asks the Court to impose
sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.010, subdivision (a), provides:
“Any
party may obtain discovery within the scope delimited by Chapter 2 (commencing
with Section 2017.010), and subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5
(commencing with Section 2019.010), by inspecting, copying, testing, or
sampling documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically
stored information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party
to the action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a), emphasis
added.)
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300 provides: 
“If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall
apply: 
“(a)
The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2)
The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b)
The party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. 
“(c)
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a
party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d)
(1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional circumstances, the
court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for
failure to provide electronically stored information that has been lost,
damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good faith
operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2)
This subdivision shall not be construed to alter any obligation to preserve
discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.010, subdivision (a), provides:
“Any
party may obtain discovery within the scope delimited by Chapter 2 (commencing
with Section 2017.010), and subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5
(commencing with Section 2019.010), by propounding to any other party to the
action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.101, subd. (a), emphasis
added.)
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a)
The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise
the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection
to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
“(2)
The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b)
The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. 
“(c)
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a
party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   
DISCUSSION 
          On
January 30, 2024, Montshire served requests for production of documents, set one,
special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide
timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Montshire filed
this motion.
          As an
initial matter, Montshire, a cross-defendant in the City’s cross-complaint, is
seeking discovery responses from the plaintiff in the original complaint.  Montshire and Plaintiff have asserted no
claims against each other.  May Montshire
seek discovery responses from Plaintiff? 

          “Whether
‘any other party to the action’ [Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.101, subd. (a), 2031.010, subd. (a)] allows parties to a cross-complaint to serve
[interrogatories and inspection demands on] others who are parties to the main action only is unclear.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) (Cal. Practice Guide) ¶ 8:920,
p. 8F-6 [interrogatories]; id., ¶ 8:1425, p. 8H-3 [“It is unclear
whether a cross-complaint is the same ‘action’ as the complaint, so as to
permit a third party cross-defendant to serve [inspection demands under Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.010 et seq.] on plaintiff”].)
         “For pleading
purposes, a cross-complaint is regarded as a separate pleading, not the same ‘action’
as the complaint [citation].”  (Cal.
Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:921, p. 8F-6.)  “However, for discovery purposes, parties to
the complaint and cross-complaint should be treated as parties to the same ‘action,’
so as to permit service of interrogatories [and inspection demands] between
[plaintiff and third-party cross-defendant]. 
Otherwise, to obtain discovery from each other, depositions would be
required.”  (Id., ¶ 8:922, p.
8F-6; see id., ¶ 8:1425, p. 8H-3.) 
Therefore, the Court concludes that Montshire may seek Plaintiff’s discovery
responses.
          Because
Plaintiff did not respond to Montshire’s discovery requests, the Court grants
Montshire’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the request for
production of documents and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant
responses without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by June 7,
2024.  In addition, the Court grants Montshire’s
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the special and form interrogatories
and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the
interrogatories without objections by June 7, 2024.
Montshire requests
monetary sanctions totaling $3,135.00.  Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available
against parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. Therefore,
sanctions are not available under these statutes. 
Other statutes addressing
misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves, authorize a sanctions
award for these motions.  (See Code Civ.
Proc, § 2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed
based solely on [the statute].  Monetary
sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the
Discovery Act.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra,
¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions
for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion
for its persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in
authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose
between sides of any such conflict.”) 
California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V.
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.) 
Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions here would
be inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.  The Court denies the
sanctions request.
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Cross-Defendant
Montshire, LLC’s motion to compel responses to its request for production of
documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff Janice Michelle Supe to provide
verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by June 7, 2024.
The Court GRANTS
Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC’s motion to compel responses to its special
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Janice Michelle Supe to provide
verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without
objections by June 7, 2024.
The Court GRANTS
Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC’s motion to compel responses to its form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Janice Michelle Supe to provide
verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by June 7, 2024.
The Court DENIES
Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC’s request for sanctions.
Cross-Defendant
Montshire, LLC should have filed three separate motions, one for each type of
discovery at issue.  The Court therefore orders
Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC to pay the Court $120.00, representing two
additional filing fees, by June 7, 2024. Moving party is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
Moving party is ordered
to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
