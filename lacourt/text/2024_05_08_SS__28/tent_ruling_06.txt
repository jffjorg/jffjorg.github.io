PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to dismiss the actions filed by Flores and Rodriguez or, in the

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(b) The court may impose an
issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses. 
“(c) The
court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence. 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. 
“(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
“(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other
section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not
impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide
electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or
overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic
information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information. 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.)         

B.   Sanctions for failure to comply with Court order to
respond to demand for inspection 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (c),
provides in part: 
“If
a party . . . fails to obey [an] order [under Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300, subdivision (b)] compelling a response [to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling], the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (c).)               
C.   Sanctions for failure to comply with Court order to
respond to interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If
a party then fails to obey an order [under Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, subdivision (b)] compelling answers [to interrogatories], the court
may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky).)   
DISCUSSION 
On November 27, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s
motion to compel Rodriguez’s responses to the Demand for Inspection and
Production of Documents (set one) and ordered Rodriguez to provide verified,
code-compliant responses and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by December 27,
2023.  In addition, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to compel Rodriguez’s responses to the Specially Prepared
Interrogatories (set one) and ordered Rodriguez to provide verified,
code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without objections by
December 27, 2023. The Court also granted Defendant’s motion to compel
Rodriguez’s responses to the Form Interrogatories (set one) and ordered Rodriguez
to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories
without objections by December 27, 2023.  The Court ordered Rodriguez
and his counsel to pay Defendant $820.68 in sanctions by December 27, 2023. 
On November 29, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s
motion to compel Flores’s responses to the Demand for Inspection and Production
of Documents (set one) and ordered Flores to provide verified, code-compliant
responses and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by December 29, 2023.  In addition, the Court granted Defendant’s
motion to compel Flores’s responses to the Specially Prepared Interrogatories
(set one) and ordered Flores to provide verified, code-compliant responses to
the special interrogatories without objections by December 29, 2023. The Court
also granted Defendant’s motion to compel Flores’s responses to the Form
Interrogatories (set one) and ordered Flores to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by December 29, 2023.  The
Court ordered Flores and his counsel to pay Defendant $820.68 in sanctions by
December 29, 2023. 
Rodriguez and Flores have not complied with the Court’s
November 27, 2023 and November 29, 2023 orders. 
Defendant asks the Court, as a result, to issue terminating sanctions
and dismiss Rodriguez's and Flores's cases or, in the alternative, impose $455.34 in monetary
sanctions on Rodriguez and $455.34 in monetary sanctions on Flores. 
The Court denies Defendant’s request for terminating
sanctions.  Rodriguez and Flores have
violated one discovery order to date.  Defendant
has not shown that less severe sanctions would be ineffective in producing
compliance with the discovery rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128
Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.)  
Defendant concedes that issue and evidentiary
sanctions preventing Rodriguez and Flores from introducing evidence about “physical,
mental, emotional, property, loss of income or earning capacity, or any other
damages as a result of the subject accident” would have the effect of a
terminating sanction.  Having determined
that terminating sanctions are not appropriate, the Court also declines to order
issue and evidentiary sanctions that would effectively terminate these
plaintiffs’ cases. 
Instead, the Court awards monetary sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300, subdivision (c) (failure to comply
with order compelling response to demand for inspection) and 2030.290,
subdivision (c) (failure to comply with order compelling response to
interrogatories).  Defendant requests monetary
sanctions of $455.34 on each motion based on two hours of attorney time at
$160.17 per hour, one hour of paralegal time at $75.00 per hour, and one $60.00
filing fee. 
The Court awards $440.34 for both motions based on two hours of
attorney time and two filing fees. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant Jose Chavira’s motion to
dismiss Plaintiff Raul Flores’s action.  
The Court DENIES Defendant Jose Chavira’s motion to
dismiss Plaintiff Johan Rodriguez’s action.  
The Court GRANTS Defendant Jose Chavira’s request for
monetary sanctions and orders Plaintiff Raul Flores, Plaintiff Johann Rodriguez, and their counsel to pay
Defendant Jose Chavira $440.34 by June 7, 2024.
