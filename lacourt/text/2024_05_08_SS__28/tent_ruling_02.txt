REQUEST 
Chan
asks the Court to order Plaintiff to appear for a deposition and pay monetary sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
* * *
 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
December 21, 2023 Chan served a notice of taking Plaintiff’s deposition on January
3, 2024.  Plaintiff did not attend the
January 3, 2024 deposition.  Chan has
moved to compel Plaintiff’s deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 authorizes the Court to compel the
deposition of “a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent,
or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff, however, is no longer a party to
any case in which Chan is a party.  As
noted, on April 17, 2024, the Court granted Chan’s motion to dismiss
Plaintiff’s claims against Chan.  The
remaining cross-complaints to which Chan is a party do not include Plaintiff as
a party.  Chan has not shown that
Plaintiff falls within the statute’s remaining categories.  Therefore, Chan may not move to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450. 
Accordingly,
the Court denies Chan’s motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Ting Kwan Chan’s motion to compel Hongde Cui to attend a deposition. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
