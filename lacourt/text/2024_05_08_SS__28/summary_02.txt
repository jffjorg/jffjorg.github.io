The court has considered the motion by Ting Kwan Chan to compel Hongde Cui to attend a deposition and pay monetary sanctions. The court finds that Chan's motion is not supported by the law and is denied. The court notes that Hongde Cui is no longer a party to any case in which Chan is a party, and therefore Chan may not move to compel Hongde Cui's deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450. The court denies Chan's motion and orders Chan to give notice of this ruling.
