And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules as follows. Montshire, LLC, a cross-defendant in the city's cross-complaint, seeks discovery responses from the plaintiff, Janice Michelle Supe. The court grants Montshire's motion to compel responses to its request for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the discovery requests without objections and to produce the requested documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things by June 7, 2024.

The court also denies Montshire's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. Additionally, the court orders Montshire to pay the court $120.00, representing two additional filing fees, by June 7, 2024.
