And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants Plaintiff Regina Present's motion for trial preference under CCP § 36(a) due to her substantial interest in the outcome of the case as the majority owner of the Fowling Street Property and her health being such that a preferential trial setting is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The Court finds that Plaintiff Regina Present has submitted sufficient evidence of her birthdate and age, as well as medical evidence of her health. The Court also finds that the Defendants have failed to show that the Plaintiff's motion is not supported by competent medical evidence. The Court notes that the standard for a motion for preference under CCP § 36(a) is not as rigorous as that under CCP § 36(d), and that a declaration by the Plaintiff's counsel is sufficient to show the Plaintiff's health is such that preference is necessary. The Court also rejects the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiffs' due process rights will be violated if the motion is granted, citing Swaithes v. Superior Court (1989) and holding that the trial court has no power to balance the opposing interests of the parties.
