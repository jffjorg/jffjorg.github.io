BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Richard J. Rosiak brought this action against his
ex-wife Margarita Rosiak and defendants 1 to 10 seeking to quiet title to four
Nevada properties. 
The Court previously sustained a demurrer to Plaintiff’s
original complaint with leave to amend. 
Defendant demurs to the First Amended Complaint (FAC).
Plaintiff opposes. 
Defendant’s Demurrer – without Motion to Strike is sustained
without leave to amend. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento
(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must
be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, courts
assume the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions,
contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of
Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The Court grants Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice
(RJN) of the September 11, 2022, Nevada District
Court’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision.

 
ANALYSIS
Defendant renews her argument that Plaintiff’s quiet title action
is precluded by the Nevada divorce decree awarding Defendant the subject
properties. 
“Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, ‘precludes
relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.’” Gabriel v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 547, 556 (quoting, Mycogen
Corp. v. Monsanto Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896). “Collateral estoppel
precludes the relitigation of an issue only if (1) the issue is identical to an
issue decided in a prior proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3)
the issue was necessarily decided; (4) the decision in the prior proceeding is
final and on the merits; and (5) the party against whom collateral estoppel is
asserted was a party to the prior proceeding or in privity with a party to the
prior proceeding.” Zevnik v. Superior Court (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 76,
82, 70 Cal.Rptr.3d 817. 
“[A] decree of divorce which does not adjudicate or dispose
of property interests does not bar a subsequent suit. On the other hand, a
decree which does adjudicate property rights and makes a division is final as
to the property which is actually divided.” Lewis v. Superior Court
(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 844, 847. As the Court previously concluded, all requirements
for collateral estoppel are present here. The four properties Plaintiff seeks
to quiet title to where previously the subject of divorce proceedings between
Plaintiff and Defendant in Nevada. RJN at p. 124. The ownership of the
properties, as between Plaintiff, both individually and as trustee, and
Defendant was actually litigated and necessarily decided. RJN p. 96-99 ¶¶
44-54, p. 124. As determined by the Nevada court, the 2012 transfer of the
three properties on Villa De Conde Way to the trust was void. RJN p. 99, ¶ 54.
In dividing the marital assets, the Nevada court awarded Defendant a 100%
interest in each of the four properties at issue here. RJN p.124. Because the
Nevada divorce proceeding is final, on the merits, and Plaintiff was a party to
that proceeding he is precluded from relitigating the issue here. 
Plaintiff fails to allege new facts showing that he has an
interest in the subject properties, and instead alleges that the Nevada court
lacked jurisdiction over the RJRP Family Trust  (the Trust) because it was never joined as a
party. FAC ¶ 17. Moreover, as explained in the Court’s previous ruling, a trust
is not a legal person who can be a party to an action, a trust can only sue and
be sued through its trustee. Galdjie v. Darwish (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th
1331, 1343. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was a party to the divorce
proceedings and that he was the trustee of the RJRP Family Trust.
In his opposition, Plaintiff fails to address the preclusive
effect of the Nevada divorce decree, and instead argues about the status of the
RJRP Trust. In ruling on the original demurrer, the Court noted that that the Trust
had been revoked, based on the judicially noticeable “Notice of Revocation of
the RJRP Family Trust Dated 5/8/1995” filed by Plaintiff in another case in May
2020, and the Nevada divorce decree revoking the trust. Plaintiff argues that
neither revocation were valid, and that the trust was never revoked. Whether or
not the Trust was revoked is irrelevant. The Nevada court was within its power
to void the re-titling and transfer of the properties to the Trust, and to
award those properties to Defendant in the divorce. 
The Court again finds that collateral estoppel precludes
Plaintiff’s causes of action and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
