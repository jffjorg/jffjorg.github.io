And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's first amended complaint. The Plaintiff, Richard J. Rosiak, brought a quiet title action against his ex-wife Margarita Rosiak and defendants 1-10 to quiet title to four Nevada properties. The Defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff's action is precluded by the Nevada divorce decree, which awarded the Defendant a 100% interest in each of the four properties. The Court has found that the Plaintiff's allegations do not raise new facts showing an interest in the properties and that the Plaintiff's arguments about the status of the RJRP Family Trust are irrelevant. The Court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that collateral estoppel precludes the Plaintiff's causes of action.
