TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Min Guan’s motion for relief from waiver of objections to
defendant HS Service’s form interrogatories set one; special interrogatories,
set one; and request for production of documents, set one is GRANTED.   
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
The motion is unopposed as of April 26, 2024. 
 
 
 
Plaintiff Min Guan sues her employer Gary Moore
Trucking, Inc. for assigning her to operate a large commercial truck. Plaintiff
collided, causing severe injuries. Plaintiff also alleges that Gary Moore
Trucking, Inc. did not pay her for her labor. In addition, Plaintiff sues JW
Fulfillment, Inc., and HS Services for negligently handling the contents of the
26-foot box truck. Plaintiff also sues her employer for fraud.
 
Plaintiff moves the Court for an order to
relieve her from waiver of objections to defendant HS Service’s form
interrogatories, set one; special interrogatories, set one; and request for
production of documents, set one. 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed does not timely respond, the party waives
any objection to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
Similarly, if a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling does not timely respond, the party waives any objection to the
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) But the court may
relieve that party from this waiver if the party satisfied the following
conditions:
 
(1) 
The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240.
 
(2) 
The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
 
Defendant
served form interrogatories, set one; special interrogatories, set one; and
requests for production of documents, set one on October 6, 2023 by electronic
service. (Decl. Xu, ¶ 1, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff served verified responses to Defendant’s
discovery on November 8, 2023. (Decl. Xu, ¶ 8.) Plaintiff’s counsel explains
that she believed the responses were due on November 9, 2024. (Decl. Xu, ¶ 4.) Given
the 30-day deadline and the addition of two court days for electronic service,
they were actually due on November 7, 2023. 
As such, Plaintiff’s responses were untimely.  The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to serve
timely responses was a mistake which warrants relief from waiver.  
 
The
Court also finds the responses to substantially comply with sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.
 
Based
on the above, the motion for relief from waiver of objections is GRANTED.
