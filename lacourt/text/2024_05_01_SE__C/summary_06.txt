The hearing is currently set for January 29, 2025, but will now be continued to May 9, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The plaintiff's opposition was filed on April 30, 2024, and the defendant's reply is due May 6, 2024. The judge notes that unlawful detainer actions have priority in trial setting and that hearings on motions to quash in such actions should be heard within three to seven days after the filing date of the motion.
