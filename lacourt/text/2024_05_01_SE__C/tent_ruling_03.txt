TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff
Alfredo Tomas Chavez Garcia’s motion to compel the deposition of American Honda
Motor Company, Inc.’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED. No sanctions are
awarded. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff moves
to compel Defendant’s Person Most Qualified (PMQ) deposition according to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.  
 
Discussion
 
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 does not appear for deposition after service of a
deposition notice and the party has not validly objected, the noticing party
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Article 2, commencing with Section 2025.210, sets forth
the grounds for objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).) A party served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity
unless that party serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days before the deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) 
 
On December 12,
2023, Plaintiff noticed the deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified. (Decl.
Castruita, ¶ 11, Ex. 7.) Defendant objected, stating that Plaintiff did not
meet and confer. (Decl. Castruita, ¶ 12, Ex. 8.) The Court finds the purported lack
of meeting and conferring to be an invalid objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410,
subd. (a).) 
 
From January 16,
2024, to February 1, 2024, Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendant about
scheduling the deposition. (Decl. Castruita, ¶ 14, Ex. 10.) 
 
On April 18,
2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel and offered August 9, 2024,
as a deposition date. According to Defendant, this is the soonest date a PMQ is
available.  (Decl. Chang, ¶ 4, Ex 1.) Defendant’s
counsel also offered to continue the trial given that trial is currently set
for July 19, 2024. (Decl. Chang, ¶ 4, Ex 1.) Plaintiff’s counsel rejected both
offers. (Decl. Chang, ¶ 4.) Plaintiff argues that the date offered is unacceptable
because it is after the scheduled trial date. 
 
The motion is
GRANTED. The deposition is ordered to take place August 9, 2024, unless the
parties agree to a different date. The parties may stipulate to continue trial
or may move to continue trial in Dept. SE-F. 

 
Sanctions
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section¿2025.450(c)
further provides, “(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450(c).) 
 
In its
discretion, the Court does not award sanctions.
