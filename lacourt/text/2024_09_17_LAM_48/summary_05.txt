And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Walter Gee's motion for terminating or issue sanctions against Defendants Laguna Creek Construction, Inc. (dba ALFA Kitchen, Bath and Flooring) and Mohammadali Kalantari. The motion was filed on August 20, 2024, and withdrawn on August 21, 2024, before being re-filed. The Court has also denied Plaintiff's requests for relief, including the modification of the protective order and the ordering of Defendants to refrain from deleting files and permit forensic examination.

The Court has found that Plaintiff has not shown a history of willful discovery abuse by Defendants and that less severe sanctions would be effective. The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request to conclusively establish certain issues, including the authorization of Yang to use ALFA's license and logo, the payment of $40,000 from Yang to Kalantari, and the manufacturing of the Alleged Subcontract and Termination Letter.

The Court has admonished Defendants' Counsel for failing to comply with a previous Court order and has warned that future violations may result in sanctions. The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request to file the lodged documents under seal, finding that the privacy concerns regarding the documents outweigh the right of public access to the record.
