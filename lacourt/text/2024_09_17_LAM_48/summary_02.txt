And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint should be granted. The plaintiff, Kayvan Setareh, seeks to substitute Hudson Studios LLC as the plaintiff, which is the owner of the subject property. The defendants, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Pacific Bell Telephone Company, oppose the amendment, arguing that Setareh knew he was not the owner of the property and should not be allowed to substitute a new plaintiff. However, the judge has determined that there is no showing of prejudice and has granted the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to file the first amended complaint within five days. The parties are also ordered to stipulate to various relief in light of the amendment, including their intention to return to mediation.
