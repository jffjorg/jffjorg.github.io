And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions by counsel Anthony Cartee and Ryan Christopher Ellis to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Mine Farm Buy LLC, et al. The judge found that the counsel's declarations did not provide sufficient information to support their motion, and that reliving counsel less than two months before trial would be highly prejudicial to the defendants. The judge noted that a corporation cannot represent itself in court and that the proposed orders did not include the correct information about future hearings or the defendants' current or last known telephone numbers. The motions are denied without prejudice, and the parties are notified to submit on the tentative ruling.
