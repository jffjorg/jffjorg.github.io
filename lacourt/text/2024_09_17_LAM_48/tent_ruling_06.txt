  CASE NO.: 23STCV09032
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 17, 2024



 
Anthony
Cartee, counsel of record for Defendants Mine Farm Buy LLC and Ryan Christopher
Ellis, seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s
declarations state only that “circumstances render it unreasonably difficult
for the attorney to carry out the employment effectively,” and counsel requests
an in camera hearing “so that non-public information and declarations can be
shown in support of this motion.”  That is
not sufficient.  Counsel can state in very
general terms the reasons without divulging attorney-client privileged information.  Typical reasons include lack of communication,
breakdown in the relationship, failure to pay counsel as required by a retention
agreement, etc.
Moreover,
relieving counsel less than two months before trial is highly prejudicial to
Defendants, particularly for Mine Farm Buy LLC, which cannot represent itself.  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic
Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101 [“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria
persona or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”].)
Additionally,
the Form MC-053 proposed orders do not include the correct information about
future hearings or Defendants’ current or last known telephone numbers.
The
motions to be relieved are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
