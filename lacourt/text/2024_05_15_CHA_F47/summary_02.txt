And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, Tatiana Nayfeld LAC Inc., Tatiana Nayfeld, and Mark Nayfeld, against the plaintiff, Teresa Arasheben. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were negligent in their duties as landlords, which led to harm caused to the plaintiff. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to allege any basis for a duty owed to her by the defendants, and therefore the complaint fails to state a negligence cause of action. The court gives the plaintiff 30 days leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects in the pleading.
