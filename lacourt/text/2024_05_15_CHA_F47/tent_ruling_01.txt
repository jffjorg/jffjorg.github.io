SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Lorena Dominguez’s
(Plaintiff) claim that she was injured when she slipped and fell on lettuce
and/or water on the floor of a Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less (Food
4 Less) grocery store on 9/1/21.  On
8/9/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Food 4 Less and Sergio Pulido, a
Food 4 Less employee she interacted with on the date of the incident, for: (1)
Negligence and (2) Premises Liability which includes allegations of willful
failure to warn.  On 9/7/23, Food 4 Less
filed and served its answer to the complaint.
 
On 9/25/23, Plaintiff electronically served a first set
of discovery which included 138 Requests for Production of Documents.  (Dawood Decl. ¶4).  After meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff
withdrew her first set of discovery.  (Id.
¶5).  On 11/9/23, Plaintiff served her
Amended Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, which include 120
requests/inspection demands.  (Id.
¶6, Ex.B).
 
On 11/17/23, Food 4 Less sent a meet and confer letter
regarding the amended discovery asking Plaintiff to withdraw and/or limit the
discovery by 12/1/23.  (Dawood Decl. ¶7,
Ex.C).  Despite follow-ups, Food 4 Less
never received a response to the meet and confer efforts regarding the Amended
Special Interrogatories, Set 1.  (Id.
¶¶8-9).
 
On 12/12/23, Food 4 Less filed and served the instant
motion seeking a protective order: (1) limiting or restricting the scope of
discovery Plaintiff Lorena Dominguez (Plaintiff) may seek in requests for
production of documents/inspection demands to information/evidence that
directly proves or disproves the elements of the causes of action pled in
Plaintiff’s Complaint,  pursuant to CCP
2017.020, and/or (2) limiting or restricting the frequency/extent/number of
requests for production of documents Plaintiff may utilize, pursuant to CCP
2019.030.  Additionally, Food 4 Less
requests an order imposing sanctions jointly on Plaintiff and her counsel of
record, Ruben Vardanyan of Vardanyan Law Firm, in the amount of $1,435.00.
 
On 4/8/23, Plaintiff filed and served an “Opposition to
Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less’s Motions for Protective Orders”
which lists 5/16/24 as the only hearing date despite the fact that three
separate motions for protective orders are on calendar for 5/14/24, 5/15/24 and
5/16/24.  On 5/8/24, Food 4 Less filed
and served a reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The scope of discovery is broad.  CCP 2017.010 provides: 
 
“Unless otherwise limited by order
of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or
of any other party to the action. Discovery may be obtained of the identity and
location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of
the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any
document, electronically stored information, tangible
thing, or land or other property.”
 
However, if the Court determines the burden, expense, or
intrusiveness of discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the
information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, the Court
must limit the scope of discovery.  See
CCP 2017.020. 
 
Additionally, CCP 2019.030(a) provides: 
 
“(a) The court shall restrict the
frequency or extent of use of a discovery method provided in Section
2019.010 if it determines either of the following:
(1) The discovery sought is
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source
that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.
(2) The selected method of
discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of
the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake
in the litigation.”
 
 
The party seeking a protective order has the burden of
showing good cause for the issuance of a protective order by a preponderance of
evidence.  Stadish (1999) 71 CA4th
1130, 1144; Fairmont Insurance Company (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255;  Goodman (1967) 253 CA2d 807, 819-820.
 
Unlike special interrogatories and requests for
admissions, there is no statutory limit on the amount of document requests a
party may propound without serving a declaration of necessity.  Food 4 Less has specifically challenged only a
fraction of the document requests propounded by Plaintiff on the grounds that
they are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence and/or that they are unreasonably cumulative and duplicative.  Food 4 Less has failed to meet its burden on
these issues.  
 
As noted above, the scope of discovery is broad.  Therefore, information regarding other claims
and documents Food 4 Less has in its possession regarding Plaintiff’s social
media may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Additionally, if particular requests seek documents
which Food 4 Less deems to be privileged, Food 4 Less can appropriately object
and provide the necessary information 
(i.e., a privilege log) for Plaintiff and/or the Court to evaluate the
validity of the privilege claim.  See
CCP 2031.240(c).  Further, if Food 4 Less
determines that the same documents are responsive to multiple requests, it can
simply refer Plaintiff to the same 
documents in its responses.    
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.  Plaintiff cites no authority for the request
in the opposition.  Additionally, as
noted above, Plaintiff filed one opposition in response to three separate
motions set for hearings on three separate days with only one hearing date
listed.  Also, the declaration submitted
in support of the opposition does not allocate how much time was spent with
regard to each motion.  (See Vardanyan
Decl. ¶5).  As such, the Court cannot
determine how much of the $3,000.00 in sanctions requested could properly be
allocated to opposing the instant motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. 
Food 4 Less is ordered to provide responses to the Requests for
Production of Documents within 30 days. 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel is advised that in the  future separate oppositions to separate
motions are required.  Failure to properly
oppose motions in the future may result in opposition arguments not being
considered. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that Food 4 Less has failed
to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion and reply as
required.  See CRC
3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties
are advised that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in matters
being continued so that papers can be re-filed in compliance with the rule,
papers not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
