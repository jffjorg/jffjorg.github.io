RINALDO ALBERICO,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV26025
  Hearing Date:  September 4, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to enforce settlement
   




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff
Rinaldo Alberico filed this action against Defendant County of Los Angeles,
asserting causes of action for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and
failure to prevent. Plaintiff alleges that he was fired after reporting
numerous instances of other deputies using racial slurs against him. 
            On April 25, 2024, the parties
attended mediation and reached a settlement for $19,999. (Megrabyan Decl. ¶ 2.)
That same day, the mediator sent an email to both parties with the terms of the
settlement, and both parties responded confirming the terms. (Id., ¶ 4,
Ex. 1, 2.) Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement on May 1, 2024. On May 15,
2024, defense counsel circulated a written agreement formalizing the terms
reached in mediation and requesting Plaintiff’s signature. (Id., ¶ 6,
Ex. 5.) On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel responded to the email, stating
that Plaintiff “wants to be reinstated to the Sheriff Department.”[1] (Id.,
¶ 7, Ex. 6.) Defense counsel responded that Plaintiff did not qualify for
reinstatement under Los Angeles County Code of Ordinances Section 17.01 and
that reinstatement was not a negotiated settlement term. (Id., ¶ 8, Ex.
6.) 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated
that he was “working on [Plaintiff]” and needed “a little more time.” (Megrabyan
Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 7.) Defense counsel attempted to follow up with calls and emails
multiple times afterwards, but Plaintiff did not respond. (Id., ¶ 10.)
On July 11, 2024, defense counsel sent an email stating that if they did not
receive a response within 10 days, a motion would be filed. (Id., ¶ 11.)
Plaintiff’s counsel responded that he would contact his client but has not
followed up. (Ibid.) To date, Defendant has not received a signed
settlement agreement. (Ibid.)  
On July 26, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion to enforce settlement. Plaintiff filed his opposition on August
20, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on August 27, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“If parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) A settlement
agreement is a contract, and the legal principles which apply to contracts
generally apply to settlement contracts.¿(Weddington Productions, Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal. App. 4th 793, 815.) 
When ruling on a
section 664.6 motion, the trial court acts as a trier of fact to determine
whether a settlement has occurred, which is also an implicit authorization for
the trial court to interpret the terms and conditions to settlement. (Skulnick
v. Roberts Express, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 884, 889.) “Trial judges
may consider oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations
alone.” (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.) “Having
orally agreed to settlement terms before the court, parties may not escape
their obligations by refusing to sign a written agreement that conforms to the
oral terms.” (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th 1421, 1431.)

DISCUSSION
            In
order for the Court to enforce a settlement agreement under section 664.6, the
agreement must either be “in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) A
settlement is enforceable if one party consents in a signed writing and the
other consents orally before the court. (Elyaoudayan, supra, 104
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1431-32.) However, if a written agreement is the sole basis
for enforcement, the writing must be signed by both parties. (Ibid.; Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 305.) 
            Here,
neither condition applies. There is no writing signed by both parties outside
the presence of the Court, nor an oral agreement reached before the Court. Defendant
cites no authority allowing the Court to enforce an oral agreement made outside
the presence of the Court. It is true that “parties may not escape their
obligations by refusing to sign a written agreement that conforms to the oral
terms.” (Elyaoudayan, supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at p. 1431.) However, that
only applies after the parties have “orally agreed to settlement terms before
the court.” (Ibid.) The oral agreement here was reached in mediation,
outside the presence of the Court. “Since the stipulation in this case was not
entered into before the court, the stipulation in writing provision governs.” (City
of Fresno v. Maroot (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 755, 760.) And as discussed
above, the writing provision requires the signature of both parties. (Harris,
supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at p. 305.) 
In sum, there is
no agreement for the Court to enforce under section 664.6. The Court also has
no authority to compel Plaintiff to sign an agreement. Under section 664.6, the
Court is only authorized to enforce an existing agreement; the Court cannot
force an agreement into existence by ordering the parties to sign it. As
discussed above, no agreement currently exists within the meaning of section
664.6. However, Defendant may file a cross-complaint for breach of contract if
it wishes to enforce the oral agreement reached in mediation.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s
motion to enforce settlement is DENIED.
