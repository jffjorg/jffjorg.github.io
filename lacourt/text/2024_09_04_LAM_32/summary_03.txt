Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents in a lemon law action. The court finds that the plaintiff's discovery requests are overly broad and unduly burdensome. As a result, the court orders the defendant to produce specific documents, including the "Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual," recall notices and technical service bulletins, customer complaints, and documents related to warranty claims and repairs. The court also orders the defendant to provide supplemental responses to the plaintiff's requests within 45 days. The court does not award sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.
