Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion by the County of Los Angeles (Defendant) to enforce a settlement agreement reached with Plaintiff Rinaldo Alberico. The parties attended mediation on April 25, 2024, and reached an oral agreement with terms including a settlement amount of $19,999. However, Plaintiff's counsel failed to follow up on the agreement and did not sign a written agreement requested by the Defendant. The Defendant filed a motion to enforce the settlement on July 26, 2024. The judge ruled that the settlement agreement is not enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 because there is no writing signed by both parties outside the presence of the court or an oral agreement reached before the court. The judge also stated that the court cannot compel Plaintiff to sign an agreement. The Defendant is free to file a cross-complaint for breach of contract if it wishes to enforce the oral agreement.
