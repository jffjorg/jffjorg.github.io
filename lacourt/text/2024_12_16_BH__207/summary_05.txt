The tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Modern One Plastering in the amount of $449,700. The plaintiff, Nanette James, incurred special damages to repair her residential home due to construction damages. The defendants were dismissed or defaulted, except for Wilmar Guevara-Alvarez and Modern One Plastering, against whom default was entered.

The court also cannot grant the request for default judgment while the Doe Defendants remain in the litigation. The court continues the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment to April 2, 2025, and the plaintiff shall file an Amended Request for Entry of Default Judgment on or before March 5, 2025.
