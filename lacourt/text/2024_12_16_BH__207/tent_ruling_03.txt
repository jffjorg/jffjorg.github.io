MOTION
 
On July 26, 2021, Plaintiff 1427 Lincoln Santa Monica LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed suit against Defendant Nicholas Morris (“Defendant”) to
recover for breach of a lease and damages to Plaintiff’s real property.  
 
At a March 10, 2023 Mandatory Settlement Conference (“MSC”), the
parties stipulated to a settlement. 
(Minute Order, Mar. 10, 2023.)  On
March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement, and the Court set an
Order to Show Cause Re: Settlement (“OSC”) for September 13, 2024.  Plaintiff did not submit any documents or
appear at the OSC, so the Court dismissed the case.
 
Plaintiff now moves to set aside the dismissal and have judgment
entered against Defendant for breaching the settlement agreement.  The motion is unopposed.
 
DISCUSSION
 
                         
I.         
SET ASIDE DISMISSAL
 
a.     LEGAL
STANDARDS – DISCRETIONARY AND MANDATORY RELIEF
 
Code of Civil procedure section 473 “includes a discretionary
provision, which applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies
as of right.” (Minick v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25
(hereafter Minick).)  “Section 473
is a remedial statute to be “applied liberally” in favor of relief if the
opposing party will not suffer prejudice. 
Because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any
doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief from default.  Unless inexcusable
neglect is clear, the policy favoring trial on the merits prevails.”  (Minick, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 24
[cleaned up].) 
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than
six months had elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under
section 473 was unavailable”]; People v.
The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Ca.App.4th 712, 721 [motion
for relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no
case exceeding six months”]).  “The
six-month limit is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), unless an application is made within the
six-month period.”  (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340,
citations omitted.)  
 
                                                                       
i.     DISCRETIONARY
RELIEF
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
                                                                     
ii.     MANDATORY
RELIEF
 
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any
(1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  “In considering whether the trial court
properly denied relief under section 473(b), the first question is the
sufficiency of defendants' showing of attorney fault, if believed, to trigger
the mandatory relief provisions of that statute.”  (Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond
Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868, 896, disapproved on other
grounds by Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire
Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830 (hereafter Standard).)  “Under section 473(b), a party is entitled to
relief from a default and resulting judgment whenever, on timely application
for relief, his attorney ‘attest[s] to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect’ in connection with the default or the judgment.”  (Ibid.)  
 
b.     ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff has provided the attorney Declaration of Daniel B. Kolko,
which provides:
 
3. The Court ordered dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint without
prejudice resulted solely from my mistake as set forth below.
 
[…]
 
8. I mistakenly thought that the September 13, 2024 OSC was scheduled
to occur after Defendant’s last day to complete payment (September 15, 2024). I
was not aware that the Court set the Order to Show Cause hearing for September
13, 2024, and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that my absence from
the hearing has caused for the Court. 
 
9. On September 18, 2024, I received notice of the Court’s dismissal
of the Complaint without prejudice.
 
(Kolko
Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)  
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff has
sufficiently demonstrated that the failure to attend the September 13, 2024
(and resulting dismissal) was due to counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
and/or neglect.  As such, the Court finds
that the relief from the dismissal is mandatory.  
 
                       
II.         
ENFORCE SETTLEMENT
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) In ruling on a motion to
enter judgment, the court acts as a trier of fact. The court must determine
whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. To do so, the
court may receive oral testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v.
Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
The issue on a motion to enforce settlement agreement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 is whether the parties entered into a valid and
binding settlement agreement. (See Viejo v. Bancorp. (1989) 217
Cal.App.3d 200, 209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make factual determinations
under section 664.6 is generally limited to whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement agreement”].) 
In other words, the only issue before the court is whether an agreement
exists; not whether the agreement has been breached.
 
            Here, the Kolko Declaration
provides:
 
4. On March 10, 2023, a Mandatory Settlement
Conference was held and the Court subsequently set an Order to Show Cause Re
Dismissal (Settlement) to be held the following year, on September 13, 2024. 
 
5. On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Notice
of Settlement with the Court. 
 
6. Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct
copy of Plaintiff’s Notice of Settlement, which includes the parties’
Stipulation re Settlement entered voluntarily by Plaintiff and Defendant. 
 
7. The Stipulation re Settlement gave Defendant
until September 15, 2024 to complete payment. Exhibit 1 at 6.
 
[…]
 
10. To date Plaintiff has only received Defendant’s first $1,000
monthly payment, which Defendant sent on or around September 29, 2023. Attached
as Exhibit 2 is a true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s November 9, 2023 email
correspondence with Defendant. Plaintiff has received no subsequent
communications from Defendant regarding payment.
 
(Kolko
Decl. ¶¶ 4-7, 10.)
 
            Attached as Exhibit 1 to the Kolko
Declaration is Plaintiff’s Notice of Settlement, attached to which is the
parties’ stipulation, which provides:
 
Defendant shall pay to Plaintiff the sum of $13,000 in immediately
available funds by September 15, 2024; provided, however, if Defendant pays to
Plaintiff the sum of $8,000 in immediately available funds by September 15,
2023, $5,000 shall be forgiven such that Defendant's obligation shall be deemed
paid in full by payment of such $8,000; further, provided, however, if
Defendant does not make such $8,000 payment by September 15, 2023, but
Defendant instead makes ten (10)[1]
monthly payments to Plaintiff of  $1,000
each in immediately available funds with the first payment made by no later
than September 15, 2023, and each subsequent payment made by no later than the
15th day of the following calendar month, with the last of such
payments made by no later than August 15, 2024, in which case $3,000 shall be
forgiven such the Defendant’s obligation shall be deemed paid in full by
payment of such $10,000.[2]  Time shall be of the essence.  
 
The parties have stipulated to a judgment of $13,000, a copy of which
is attached hereto, entitled Stipulation for Civil Judgment. In the event the
foregoing payment of $13,000 (as such may be discounted as provided above) is
not made in full by Defendant to Plaintiff by September 15, 2024, then
Plaintiff shall have the right by ex parte application to the court to have the
Stipulation for Civil Judgment entered by the court as a judgment against
Defendant. Such ex parte application shall be accompanied by a declaration
under penalty of perjury that Plaintiff has not received payment in full of the
$13,000. Such declaration shall further state whether any partial payments had
been received by Plaintiff towards the $13,000 obligation and the amounts
thereof, if any. If any such payments had been received by Plaintiff, then
immediately following entry of the Stipulation of Civil Judgment, Plaintiff
shall file a partial satisfaction of judgment reflecting the amounts so
received by Plaintiff. 
 
In the event of any dispute between the parties with reference to the
subject matter of this stipulation or the Stipulation of Civil Judgment, the
prevailing party in any proceedings to enforce this Stipulation or the
Stipulation of Civil Judgment or to collect thereon shall be entitled to
recover its costs and attorneys' fees. 
 
The parties stipulate to this action being stayed until September 15,
2024, with the court anticipated to enter an order to show cause re: entry of
judgment or dismissal at a date convenient to the court after such date. If the
payment obligations of Defendant, above, are satisfied in full by September 15,
2024, the parties shall file a mutual dismissal of this action with prejudice,
and, if the parties fail to do so and if Plaintiff does not seek entry of the
Stipulation for Civil Judgement by the time of the order to show cause hearing,
the court is authorized to dismiss this action. 
 
Defendant hereby waives and releases all claims of any kind against
Plaintiff that have been raised in this action or that could have been raised
in this action. Effective upon timely payment in full of Defendant's
obligations under this stipulation, Plaintiff shall be deemed to have waived
and release all claims of any kind against Plaintiff that have been raised in
this action or that could have been raised in this action.
 
(Ex.
1 to Kolko Decl.)
 
            Also attached to the stipulation is
a “Stipulation for Civil Judgment” stipulating to a judgment in the amount of
$13,000 in favor of Plaintiff 1427 Lincoln Santa Monica LLC and against
Defendant Nicholas Morris in the amount of $13,000.
 
            Thus, Plaintiff has demonstrated the
parties had a settlement agreement whereby Defendant would be obligated to pay Plaintiff
$13,000, except that if Defendant paid certain sums within a certain timeframe,
Plaintiff would write off the balance of the $13,000 and consider the debt paid
in full.  Plaintiff has further
demonstrated that Defendant did not pay those initial sums within the time
frames specified, and therefore, pursuant to the parties’ agreement, a
stipulated judgment in the amount of $13,000 is now warranted, with the $1,000
Defendant has already paid to Plaintiff to be applied as a partial satisfaction
of the $13,000 judgment.
 
                    
III.         
NOTICE
 
The
Court continued the hearing on the initial motion because as indicated in the
Tentative Ruling posted for the October 31, 2024 hearing:  “although Plaintiff has provided a
“Certificate of Service” that indicates “I hereby certify that on October 4,
2024, a true and correct copy of the foregoing document was served on Defendant
via electronic mail” the Court finds the certificate to be faulty.  First, it is not signed under penalty of
perjury, and therefore holds no evidentiary value.  It also does not indicate what electronic
service address was used to send the document or what electronic service
address the documents were sent to, or specifically what document(s) were
served on Defendant.  It also does not
specify Defendant’s name.”
 
Thereafter, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. The
proof of service attached to the motion indicates that the motion was
electronically (email) served on November 20, 2024.  But the Court finds the proof of service to
be defective.  
 
Defendant
is a self-represented litigant. Self-represented parties must affirmatively
consent to electronic service by serving and filing a notice so stating. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.251, subd. (c)(3)(B).) Absent such affirmative consent,
self-represented parties must be served with documents by nonelectronic means.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1010.6, subd. (d)(4), 1011, subd. (b); Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.253, subds. (b)(2), (3).)   Here, the Court finds that Defendant has not
filed and served a notice affirmatively consenting to electronic service, and
Plaintiff has not shown otherwise.  Moreover,
the Court notes that the address listed for Defendant under “Service List” is
not Defendant’s address of record.  
 
            Accordingly, the Court finds that
Plaintiff failed to provide proper notice of the motion to Defendant.  
            
CONCLUSION
 
            In lieu of denying the motion, the
Court continues the hearing to January 30, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207
to permit Plaintiff time to perfect proper notice of the motion to Defendant.  Further, the Court orders Plaintiff to serve the
notice of the continued hearing and the motion by either regular mail or
personal service at Defendant’s address of record.
 
            Plaintiff shall file the notice with
a proof of service in conformance with the Court’s orders on or before January
6, 2025.
