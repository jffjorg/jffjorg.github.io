MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Nanette James (“Plaintiff”) requests for default judgment
against Defendant Modern One Plastering (“Defendant”) in the amount
of $449,700, which is composed entirely of special damages incurred to repair
Plaintiff’s property.  
 
            This
case arises from construction damages to Plaintiff’s residential home.  Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges eight causes of
action for (1) negligence; (2) breach of implied warranty of reasonable
workmanship; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of express warranty; (5) strict
products liability; (6) intentional misrepresentation; (7) fraudulent
concealment; and (8) declaratory relief against Defendants Bahram Fata; BFF
Construction, Inc.; Modern One Plastering; Wilmar Guevara-Alvarez; JB Marble
Co; Jacques Barlava; and Does 1 through 100. 
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Amendment, naming Defendant Farhad
Lajevardi in place of Doe 1.
            
            Defendants
BFF Construction, Inc.; Bahram Fata; and Farhad Lajevardi (Doe 1); JB Marble
Co.; and Jacques Barlava were dismissed, at Plaintiff’s request on April 10,
2024.  
 
            Default
was entered against the remaining named Defendants Wilmar Guevara-Alvarez and
Modern One Plastering on November 17, 2021. The Doe Defendants have not yet
been dismissed.
 
            The
Court cannot grant the request for default judgment while the Doe Defendants
remain in the litigation.  Further, the
Court cannot grant the request only as to Modern One Plastering without a
separate request for default judgment or dismissal as to Wilmar
Guevara-Alvarez.  (California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(7).
 
            Further,
Plaintiff’s Complaint does not specify an amount of damages.  (See Compl.)  However, the Court cannot award damages that
are in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580,
subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Therefore, the Court denies without
prejudice Plaintiff’s Request for Entry
of Default Judgment.
 
            Further, the
Court continues the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment as to
Defendants Wilmar Guevara-Alvarez and Modern One Plastering to April 2, 2025 at
8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  Plaintiff
shall file an Amended Request for Entry of Default Judgment on or before March
5, 2025.  No appearance will be necessary
if the judgment is entered beforehand.
