And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order enforcing a settlement agreement. The plaintiff had claimed that a settlement agreement was reached on March 8, 2024, and that the defendants had failed to comply with its terms. However, the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of a written settlement agreement, and therefore failed to meet its burden of proof. The judge also noted that without seeing the written agreement, it could not confirm that the terms of the judgment the plaintiff seeks are aligned with the parties' agreement.
