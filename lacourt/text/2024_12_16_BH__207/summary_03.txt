Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by Plaintiff 1427 Lincoln Santa Monica LLC to set aside a dismissal and enforce a settlement agreement with Defendant Nicholas Morris. The case arose from a breach of a lease and damages to real property. The parties stipulated to a settlement at a Mandatory Settlement Conference, which included a payment schedule and a provision for enforcement. Plaintiff did not attend an Order to Show Cause Re: Settlement hearing, and the case was dismissed. The judge finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that the failure to attend the hearing was due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or neglect, and that the relief from the dismissal is mandatory.

The judge also finds that the parties had a valid and binding settlement agreement, and that Defendant has not made the payments due under the agreement. Therefore, the judge orders a stipulated judgment in the amount of $13,000 in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant.

However, the judge continues the hearing to January 30, 2025 to permit Plaintiff time to perfect proper notice of the motion to Defendant, as the current proof of service is defective. The judge also orders Plaintiff to serve the notice of the continued hearing and the motion by regular mail or personal service at Defendant's address of record.
