REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 
I.         
BACKGROUND
 
On July 5, 2023,
Plaintiff Dai Yongzheng filed a Complaint against Defendant Paul S. Chao on
causes of action for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of duty
of good faith and fair dealing pursuant to Corporations Code section 17704.08,
subdivision (d). 
 
On December 29, 2023
and January 2, 2024, the Court issued Orders for Publication in this matter. 
 
On April 19, 2024,
Plaintiff filed:
 
(1)       Judicial Council Form
CIV-100, Request for Entry of Default and Court Judgment;
 
(2)       Judicial Council Form
JUD-100, Proposed Judgment;
 
(3)       Judicial Council Form
MC-030, Declaration; and
 
(4)       Declaration of
Plaintiff Dai Yongzheng.
 
On April 19, 2024, by
request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office entered default on Defendant. 
 
II.      
ANALYSIS
 
The Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED
in part. 
 
The Court awards $132,070.00 in damages (the amount
requested in the Complaint), $8,003.80 in pre-judgment interest (the total
amount allowable based on the causes of action alleged), and $1,385.0 in costs
(the total amount claimed).
 
Regarding the interest calculation,
Plaintiff’s Counsel used a rate of 10% per year in their calculation. (MC-030.)
However, the three causes of action in the Complaint — conversion, breach of
fiduciary duty, and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing pursuant to
Corporations Code section 17704.08 (as opposed to its common law analogue) —
are all torts, not contract claims. (See Burlesci v. Petersen (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 1062, 1066 [“Conversion is a strict liability tort.”]; See also Strebel
v. Brenlar Invs., Inc. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“California law is
committed to the view that the fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty is a tort .
. . .” (Quotation and internal quotation marks omitted.)].) Further, no
contract is alleged in the pleading; rather, the allegations discuss tort
violations, such as removing and selling inventory, failing to timely collect
debts for the corporate entity, and building a separate business relationship
with the company’s customers. (Complaint, ¶¶ 29, 36–38, 42.) Pre-judgment
interest for tort violations is only 7% per year, not 10% per year. (Civ. Code,
§ 3287, subd. (c).)
