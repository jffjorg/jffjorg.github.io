And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on the demurrers filed by the defendants, Janet Mandelbaum and Brenda Mandelbaum, to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Araceli Gutierrez, Jesus Galindo, and Ezequiel Galindo. The demurrers were filed on May 17, 2023, and September 13, 2023, respectively. The plaintiffs have not filed opposition to the demurrers, and the Court wishes to move along the proceedings in a timely manner.

The Court sets a new hearing date for the demurrers on January 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27, and also sets a Case Management Conference and Trial Setting Conference for the same date and time.

The plaintiffs are given notice that if they do not wish to substantively oppose the demurrers, they must dismiss their claims against the demurring defendants at least nine court days prior to the continued hearing date. If they wish to pursue their claims, they must file timely substantive opposition to the demurrers.

The demurring defendants are ordered to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If a party submits on the tentative, the email must include the case number and must identify the party submitting.
