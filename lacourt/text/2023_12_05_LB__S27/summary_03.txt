And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Order Denying Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel**

This tentative order denies the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Daniel Azizi, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice for two reasons. Firstly, Counsel failed to provide proof of service on Plaintiff at her last-known address, and secondly, Counsel's attempts to contact Plaintiff were inadequate. The Court requires Counsel to amend the declaration to detail the results of his attempts to contact Plaintiff and to serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court if unable to confirm Plaintiff's address. The motion is denied for the second time, and the Counsel is reminded to appear remotely at the hearing and case management conference.
