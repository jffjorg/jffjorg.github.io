      CASE NO: 22LBCV01000
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION
  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept. S27
8:30 a.m.
December 5, 2023



 
Moving Party:               Plaintiff’s
Attorney, Daniel Azizi
Opposing Party:           None filed
            Notice:                         See below
 
1.     9/21/23
Hearing on Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
Plaintiff, Maria Angie Gonzalez’s
attorney of record, David Azizi, moved to be relieved as counsel, and the Court
heard the motion on 9/21/23.  The Court
ruled, in pertinent part:
Counsel declares there has been an
irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, such that further
representation is not possible.  The
motion is denied without prejudice for two reasons.  
 
First, Counsel declares the moving
papers were served on Client at an address he was unable to confirm.  Counsel declares he attempted to confirm the
address via telephone, and certified mail, and a TLO search.  The Court wishes to hear from Counsel, at the
hearing, concerning the results of each of these attempts.  Did Counsel receive the signed return
receipt?  Did Counsel get Plaintiff’s
voicemail?  Did Counsel leave a
message?  Does counsel have an e-mail
address for Plaintiff?  What were the
results of the TLO search?  Counsel must
address these issues by way of an amended declaration.  If Counsel is unable to serve Plaintiff at a
confirmed address, Counsel must serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the
Court pursuant to CCP §1101(b) and CRC 3.1362(d).  
 
Second, there is no proof of
service on Plaintiff at her last-known address. 
Even if the address is not confirmed, Counsel must file proof of service
of the moving papers at the last-known address.
 
2.     Instant
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
On 11/03/23, Counsel filed a new
motion to be relieved as counsel, setting it for hearing on 12/05/23.  The moving papers appear to be the same as
those previously filed on 9/21/23.  There
continues to be no proof of service of the moving papers on the Clerk of the
Court, and there continues to be no proof of service of the moving papers on
Plaintiff at her last-known address.  
 
Additionally, while the Court’s
prior order required Counsel to detail the results of his attempts to contact
Plaintiff, the renewed motion continues to lack any specific facts concerning
the service attempts.  
 
The motion is therefore denied a second
time.  
 
3.     CMC
Counsel is reminded that there is a
case management conference on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the
motion to be relieved.  The Court asks Counsel
to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion and the
CMC.
