And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Long Beach Unified School District. The plaintiff, John Doe L.A., seeks damages for childhood sexual abuse. The defendant argues that it cannot be held vicariously liable for the sexual assault of a minor student and that Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218) is unconstitutional.

The court finds that the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. The court determines that vicarious liability is not applicable in this case because no cause of action is pled against the defendant under a theory of vicarious liability.

The court also finds that AB 218 is constitutional. The court holds that the provisions of AB 218 aimed at reducing barriers to childhood sexual assault claims and adding treble damages for assault resulting from a cover-up do not implicate improper retroactivity or create a gift to the state.

Accordingly, the court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
