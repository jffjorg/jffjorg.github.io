And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute between the parties regarding supplemental discovery responses. The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel did not attend the 1/31/24 hearing due to misunderstandings about the deposition and IDC meeting. The judge finds that the parties agreed to deposition, but the agreement was contingent upon Defendants taking Plaintiff's settlement offer, which they refused. The judge grants the motions as there is no opposition and no defects, and finds good cause to grant the motion. The judge also notes that Plaintiff's counsel filed an IDC brief with the court after the conversation.
