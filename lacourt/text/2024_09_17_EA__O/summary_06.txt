And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Nathan Chung's motion to amend his answer is granted. The motion seeks to remove 11 improper defenses and add new ones. The judge finds no prejudice in granting the motion and notes that amendments to pleadings are liberally allowed at any stage of the proceeding. The case is still at the pleading stage and the amendment will not require further discovery. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's newly retained counsel had previously recognized that the original defenses were improper.
