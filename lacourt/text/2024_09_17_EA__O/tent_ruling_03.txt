Background
 
This case
arises from a partnership dispute. Plaintiff DONGYI (USA) TRADING GROUP, INC.
alleges the following against Defendant SUNSHINE EDUCATION ACADEMY
(corporation) (“Sunshine”) and Wenying Sun (“Sun”) (collectively, “Defendants”):
Plaintiff was established in 2017 and it later determined to invest an
education business in Southern California. In November 2018, Plaintiff and
Defendant Sunshine entered into an Investment Agreement whereby Plaintiff
agreed to invest $200,000 in Defendant Sunshine for 51% its shares; Sun (CEO
and General Manager of Sunshine) is a 49% shareholder of Sunshine. In 2022,
Plaintiff requested Defendants to provide certain financial documents of
Sunshine because Plaintiff was preparing a non-immigration petition for its
owner to enter the United States. 
However, Defendant Sun had refused to produce them. 
 
On November
2, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit for: 1.     Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2.     Shareholder’s Derivative Action for
Damages Due to Breach of Fiduciary Duty 3.     Accounting—Request for Appointment of
Receiver
 
On November
9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) for: 1.     Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 2.     Shareholder’s Derivative Action For
Damages Due To Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 3.     Accounting – Request For Appointment
Of Receiver 4.     Fraud 5.     Conversion 6.     Restitution Based On Unjust Enrichment
 
On June 1,
2023, Defendants Sunshine and Sun filed an answer.
 
On August 16,
2023, Plaintiff filed amendments to the complaint/fictitious/incorrect name
naming the following defendants: US Sunshine
International Group, a California corporation, Sunshine Medias, Inc., a
California corporation (Defendant), Sunshine Boarding School, a California
corporation), World Celebrity Club, a California corporation, and World
Federation Of Youth Literary Art, a California nonprofit corporation. 
 
On November 30, 2023, the court discharged the Order to Show Cause Re:
Plaintiffs Failure to Appear on October 4, 2023, and the Order to Show Cause
Re: Why the Court Should not Dismiss this Case in its Entirety for Lack of
Prosecution. 
 
On January 31, 2024, the court conducted its IDC; there was no
appearance by Defendants.[1]

 
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motions.
 
On April 16, 2024, the court heard the Motion to Compel Defendant Sunshine
Education Academy’s Form Interrogatories Set No. One And Request For Monetary
Sanctions (Set By The Court) And Motion To Compel Defendants Wenying Sun And
Sunshine Education Academy’s Request For Production Of Documents Set No. One
And Request For Monetary Sanctions. The granted the motions and ordered that “Documents
and complete responses to interrogatories are to be produced within 60 days of
this order.” (April 16, 2024 Minute Order, emphasis added.)[2] 
 
On July 16, 2024, the court held an IDC Re: Deposition; MSC; and CMC. The
minute order provides, in relevant part, the following: “The Court and Counsel
confer re: discovery sought by Plaintiff's Counsel, specifically with regard to
the Court Order made on April 16, 2024. The Court states it has read and
considered the minute order dated April 16, 2024, documents and complete
responses to interrogatories are to be produced within 60 days of this order.
After conducting the Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), the issues remain
unresolved. Plaintiff is now permitted to file formal discovery motions and is
to contact court staff for scheduling/reservation dates. Defense Counsel [Andion]
represents to the Court that he intends to file a motion to be relieved as
counsel.” (Minute Order, emphasis added.)  
 
On July 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions and default
judgment.
 
On August 12,
2024, Counsel Andion filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel as to
Sunshine and Sun. 
 
Legal
Standard Re: Terminating Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(d) provides for four types
of termination sanctions. 

(1) Striking
     pleadings in whole or in part;
(2) Staying further proceedings
     by a party until it obeys a discovery order;
(3) Dismissing the action or
     part of it; and
(4) Rendering a default judgment.

Discussion
Plaintiff seeks the terminating sanction of a default judgment. A
decision to enter default judgment should not be made lightly. As articulated
by the court in Marriage of Eustice (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1309,
factors to consider in making the determination include whether the defendant’s
violation was willful, whether the violation is preceded by a history of
discovery abuse, and whether less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance. (See also Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
690, 702.) But when a party has flagrantly engaged in discovery abuses, a
judge’s denial of the opponent’s request for termination sanction is an abuse
of discretion. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 996 [“In this case, the trial court had to
impose terminating sanctions once it was learned during trial that Bentley
still had failed to comply with discovery orders and directives and Bentley's
misuse of the discovery process was even worse than previously known.”].) 
Here, Defendants’ discovery obstruction is chronicled
in Plaintiff’s discovery motions, meet and confer efforts, and the IDCs. 
-           
On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff served the subject discovery (RFPs
and FROGs). 
-           
On June 29, 2023, responses were served, but deemed evasive
and incomplete. 
-           
On July 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel sent Defense Counsel a
meet and confer letter regarding the evasive responses. 
-           
On August 9, 2023 (after an August 2, 2023 promise for
supplemental responses), Plaintiff’s Counsel sent a second meet and confer
letter about incomplete and evasive responses. 
-           
On August 25, 2023, further promises for supplemental
responses were made, to no avail. 
-           
On April 16, 2024 (after a 1/31/24 IDC which Defense counsel
did not attend), the court granted the discovery motions. The court ordered
that the parties “to meet
and confer re: outstanding discovery and possible dates for deposition.”
-           
On July 16, 2024, the court held another IDC wherein
Plaintiff informed the court that the responses required by the court’s April
16, 2024 order were not provided. (See Motion for Terminating Sanctions pp.
3-5.) 
And to date, no responses have been provided. In fact, responses will not
be provided. According to Defense Counsel’s motion(s) to be relieved as
counsel,[3]
Defendants are “not cooperat[ing] … in fulfilling the client’s discovery
obligations.” (MC-052 Form.) Plainly put, Defendants have chosen not to
response meaning that a lesser sanction will be futile. Consequently, this
sufficiently extreme conduct warrants an extreme sanction: default judgment.
(See Jerry’s Shell v. Equilon Enters., LLC (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1058,
1059 [failure to respond to discovery and to comply with judge’s orders
provides ample grounds for imposing a terminating sanction.].)
Notwithstanding, when the court strikes a defendant’s answer and enters
a default judgment as a discovery sanction under CCP section 2023.030(d)(4),
the relief may not exceed the relief demanded in the complaint. (See CCP
section 580(a); CCP 585; Marriage of Kahn (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1113,
1116-1119 [default judgment in dissolution of marriage was void because
petitioner had not sought any particular amount of damages]; see also Greenup
v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824-829 [default taken after an answer is
stricken as a discovery sanction is treated the same way as a default taken
after the defendant fails to answer a complaint].) Here, neither the motion nor proposed order provides
a default judgment application for the court to ascertain whether the default
judgment comports with due process requirements and other rules. 
Therefore, the ruling is TBD/CONTINUED pending submission of default
judgment material. 
Monetary Sanctions
As for monetary sanctions, CCP section 2023.030(a) provides in relevant
part that: “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging
in the misuse of a discovery process . . . pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
Here, imposition of sanctions against Defendants is clearly justified as
they refuse to comply. As for Defense Counsel Andion, sanctions are not
justified. Absent his motion to be relieved as counsel, the court would not
have the basis it is relying upon to find default judgment warranted. 
Therefore, the court imposes monetary sanctions about Defendants, not
Defense Counsel.  
Plaintiff’s Counsel seeks $4,060 [calculated as follows: 4 hours
drafting motion + 2 hours reviewing and preparing the reply + 2 hours travel to
and from court, at an hourly rate of $500, plus $60 filing fee]. Here, utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
court reduces the hours to 4 hours drafting the motion (no opposition nor
reply). Should Counsel attend the hearing in person,[4]
the court will provide the additional two hours requested, for a total of 6
hours. As for the hourly
rate, it is an attorney’s obligation to
establish “reasonable rates in the local community as a basis for [the fee]
award.” (Nemecek
& Cole v. Horn (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 641, 652; see also Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 155 [explaining the
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work].)
Here, absent evidence that his rate is reasonable in the local community (Nichols
v. City of Taft (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1243), the court reduces the hourly
fee to $400. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the procedural
history of this case evidence Defendants’ ongoing recalcitrance with
Plaintiff’s effort to obtain relevant and straightforward discovery.
(See 4/16/24 Ruling [for analysis on the discovery].) Therefore, the
court grants Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgement with prejudice
against the Defendants Sunshine Education Academy and Wenying Sun, but the
hearing is continued/TBD pending submission of default judgment material.
Additionally, Counsel Andion’s motions to be relieved as counsel are granted
(and no monetary sanctions are issued against him).
