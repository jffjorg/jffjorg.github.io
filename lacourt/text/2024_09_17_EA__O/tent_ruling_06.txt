On June 20,
2024, moving defendants filed the instant demurrer x MTS.

and Alyssia) and overruled (as to Jane Roes 6 and 7). The MTS was granted with
leave to amend; SAC due on or by October 4, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
Chung seeks to amend his answer to remove the eleven (11) improperly asserted
defenses and to add different ones. 
 
Here, there
is no reason to not grant the motion. First, amendments to pleadings are
liberally allowed at any stage of the proceeding. (Motion p. 5, citing Code
Civ. Proc. §473; Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Second, the court finds no prejudice by granting the motion. (See Motion
p. 4, citing Fair v. Bakhtiari (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1147; Thompson
Pacific Construction, Inc. v. City of Sunnyvale (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 525,
544-545 [Without a showing of prejudice, the failure to grant leave to amend
may be an abuse of discretion].) For one, the changed affirmative defenses will
not require further discovery. Additionally, the case is still at the pleading
stage. Third, per CRC Rule 3.1324(b)(2), the amendment was not made earlier
because Plaintiff filed the pro
per, and newly retained counsel (7/5/24) noted that original defenses were
improper. 
 
Therefore,
exercising its discretion, the court grants the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.
