And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's application for default judgment. The plaintiff seeks statutory damages of $8,000, attorney's fees of $570, and costs of $1,504, for a total of $10,074. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's declaration lacks sufficient evidence to support a request for deterrence damages. Therefore, the court grants the application for default judgment, but reduces the amount to $6,074. The plaintiff is requested to file a revised proposed order.
