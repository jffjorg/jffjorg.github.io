And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties in this case. The case arises from a partnership dispute between the plaintiff, DONGYI (USA) TRADING GROUP, INC., and the defendants, Wenying Sun and Sunshine Education Academy.

The plaintiff seeks to enter a default judgment against the defendants and is also seeking monetary sanctions. The defendants have refused to comply with discovery orders and have failed to produce financial documents, which the plaintiff has requested.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, but has continued the hearing pending submission of default judgment material. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to be relieved as counsel, and has imposed monetary sanctions on the defendants, but not on the defense counsel.

The judge has noted that the defendants' discovery obstruction is chronicled in the plaintiff's discovery motions, meet and confer efforts, and the IDCs. The judge has also noted that the defendants have chosen not to respond to the plaintiff's requests for discovery, and that a lesser sanction would be futile.

The judge has concluded that the defendants' ongoing recalcitrance with the plaintiff's efforts to obtain relevant and straightforward discovery warrants the entry of default judgment with prejudice against the defendants.
