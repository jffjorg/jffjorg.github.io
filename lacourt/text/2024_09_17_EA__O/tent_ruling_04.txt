[1] According to counsel’s declaration filed on 2/20/24,
he did not attend the 1/31/24 hearing because he “was under the impression”
that should Plaintiff depose Sun, which Defendants agreed to, supplemental
discovery responses would be unnecessary such that the IDC would be taken off
calendar. According to Plaintiff’s Counsel’s declaration filed on 4/9/24, the
agreement was contingent upon Defendants taking Plaintiff’s settlement offer,
which they refused. In fact, after the conversation, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed
the IDC brief with the court and served it upon Counsel Andion. 
 


[2] The court’s tentative was to give 30 days for
responses, but instead gave 60 days. 


[3] The motions are granted as absent an opposition and
otherwise no defects, there is good cause to grant the motion. 
 


[4] His office is in Pasadena.
