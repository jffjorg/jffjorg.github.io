 Case Number:  22SMCV00398    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  I The application for a writ of attachment is DENIED.  Writs of attachment are governed by the Code
of Civil Procedure, and can only be issued if certain showings are made.  One is that the case be based in contract,
not tort.  There also must be a
contractual sum certain (or reasonably certain) at issue.  This is not an appropriate case.  Plaintiff contends that defendant breached
the warranty of habitability.  It is not
clear to the court that the cause of action is really one that sounds in
contract, although the duty is implied in every contract.  But more to the point, there is no certainty
to the damages here.  This is not a
situation where the defendant bought a widget from plaintiff but won’t
pay.  Further, the argument for the writ
is not based so much on the amount of contract damages—or if it is, there is no
justification or proof of it.  In short,
the showing has not been made.  The
application for the writ is DENIED.
