And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The motion is untimely and sets forth no reason to vacate the prior order. The court is at a loss in this case due to the plaintiff's lack of participation and failure to respond to discovery. The court has previously sanctioned the plaintiff $4000 for failing to respond to discovery, and the defendant has moved for terminating sanctions. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to be precluded from presenting evidence that would likely have been disclosed in proper responses to the discovery in question. The judge notes that the plaintiff has ignored the court's prior orders and that some form of sanction was appropriate. The motion to set aside is denied, and the case remains dismissed.
