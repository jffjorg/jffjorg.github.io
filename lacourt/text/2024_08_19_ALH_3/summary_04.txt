The judge finds that China is a more suitable alternative forum for the breach of contract action, citing the fact that the dispute concerns real property in China, would involve applying Chinese law and interpreting documents in Chinese, and all the key witnesses currently reside in China and Singapore. The judge notes that Plaintiff did not oppose the motion or argue that he is prohibited from filing a civil suit against Defendant in China. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is granted and the case is dismissed.
