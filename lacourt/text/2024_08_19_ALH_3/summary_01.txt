And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Costco Wholesale Corporation's motion to uphold its designation of certain documents as confidential. The motion was filed on April 8, 2024, in response to Plaintiff Vincent Derosa's objections to the confidential designations. The Court notes that the Defendant did not provide any specific documents for review and instead relied on its counsel's declaration stating that the documents were confidential. The Court finds that the Defendant's declaration lacks foundation and is not competent testimony demonstrating that the documents are entitled to confidential treatment. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's objections were deficient and failed to identify the specific documents with disputed designations. As a result, the 30-day deadline to file a motion to uphold the designations has not expired, and the motion is denied without prejudice.
