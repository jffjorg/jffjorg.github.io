ORDER
  RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
August
   19 , 2024




 


 


 



 
Michelle
 E. Soon seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant
 American Southwest Chamber of Commerce USA (“Defendant”) on grounds that
there
 has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
This matter previously came on for
hearing on July 30, 2024. At the hearing, the Court found that the motion
should be granted because no prejudice would result from counsel’s withdrawal
but ordered counsel to file a revised proposed order. A revised proposed order
was filed the same day which comports with the Court’s instructions. However,
the Court notes that on August 1, 2024, a discovery motion was filed seeking
discovery responses from Defendant. Because the motion was filed after the
proposed order was filed, the hearing date for this motion is not identified as
an upcoming proceeding. Therefore, the Court adds the Hearing on Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses, scheduled for November 6, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m., to Item 8 of the proposed order and GRANTS the motion. The motion
shall be effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order
on Defendant and all parties who have appeared in this action.  
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 19th
day of August 2024
