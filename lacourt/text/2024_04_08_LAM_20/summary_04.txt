And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jila Babazadeh-Shraga vs. Gohar Babazadeh. Jila seeks to compel responses to her requests for production, set three, from Gohar. Gohar claims that responses have been served and that Jila's waiver of objections should be set aside. However, since responses have now been served, the Judge finds the Motion to Compel to be moot and denies it. The Judge awards Jila reduced sanctions in the amount of $1000. Additionally, Gohar's request to set aside her waiver of objections cannot be made via opposition briefing, and the moving party must give notice. Counsel are strongly encouraged to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
