And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion filed by Defendant Helio Marquez to set aside a default judgment and quash service of summons. The default judgment was entered on October 20 and 21, 2022, but Defendant claims that he lacked notice of the litigation until September 2023. He also argues that the substitute service made on him was not properly made. The Court has reviewed the evidence presented by Defendant and found that the service was not made at the correct location and that Defendant did not receive notice of the litigation in a timely manner. As a result, the motion is granted, and the default judgment is vacated.
