Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to quash service of summons brought by Defendant Stylenquaza, LLC. The Defendant is a Texas company that distributes quartz slabs through various states, but not California. The Plaintiff, Demetrio Luna Reyes and Guillemina Valdez, seeks to hold the Defendant liable for damages, but the Defendant argues that it lacks minimum contacts with California and therefore personal jurisdiction cannot be exercised over it. The court finds that the Defendant's contacts with California are attenuated and do not rise to the level of purposeful availment, and therefore grants the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The court also finds that further jurisdictional discovery would not likely turn up proof establishing jurisdiction.
