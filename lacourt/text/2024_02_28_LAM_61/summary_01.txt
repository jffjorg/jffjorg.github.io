Summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial's motion for sanctions in the amount of $17,450 against Defendants Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Memorial Health Services, and Desiree Thomas. The motion was based on the Defendants' failure to provide adequate factual support to an application for ex parte relief in granting the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend complaint. The Judge found that the remedy for this failure is to deny the application, rather than imposing sanctions. The Judge also rejected the Plaintiff's argument that the Defendants' failure to provide adequate factual support constituted a basis for sanctions. The motion is denied, and the Defendants are ordered to give notice.
