to the Complaint for Declaratory Relief
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Defendant
O’Neil & Matusek represented Plaintiff Jerry Kohn in Jerry Kohn v. Lou
Maze, et al., 20STCV07618, until Plaintiff terminated representation on June 1,
2023. Following termination of representation, the underlying case settled.
Defendant apparently submitted a lien on the underlying action, and seeks collection
of certain fees and costs from the settlement. Plaintiff seeks to challenge the
recovery, or at least the amount of recovery. 

 
On
January 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Declaratory Relief.
 
RULING: Overruled.
1st
Cause of Action: Declaratory Relief
Defendant O’Neil & Matusek challenge the declaratory
relief claim on grounds of insufficient facts due to the lack of allegations
articulating the terms of the disputed agreement or a copy of the agreement,
and (“a hidden”) misjoinder of parties based on certain language over the fee
dispute potentially involving any and all attorneys for Plaintiff. Plaintiff
maintains the complaint presents a proper declaratory relief claim, and denies
any requirement for presentation of any terms of the retainer agreement.
Plaintiff also challenges the procedural posture of the demurrer. Defendant in
reply maintains its right to rely on the fee agreement before seeking quantum
meruit recovery. 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a
demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of
law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson
Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our
liberal pleading rules, where the complaint contains substantive factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave
to amend.]
 
Declaratory relief arises under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1060:
 
“Any person interested under a written instrument … or under
a contract, or who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with
respect to another, or in respect to, in, over or upon property … may, in cases
of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective
parties, bring an original action or cross-complaint in the superior
court for a declaration of his or her rights and duties in the premises,
including a determination of any question of construction or validity arising
under the instrument or contract. He or she may ask for a declaration of rights
or duties, either alone or with other relief; and the court may make a binding
declaration of these rights or duties, whether or not further relief is or
could be claimed at the time. The declaration may be either affirmative or
negative in form and effect, and the declaration shall have the force of a
final judgment. The declaration may be had before there has been any breach of
the obligation in respect to which said declaration is sought.”
 
“[Declaratory relief] serves to set controversies at rest
before they lead to repudiation of obligations, invasion of rights or
commission of wrongs; in short, the remedy is to be used in the interests of
preventive justice, to declare rights rather than execute them.” (Travers v. Louden (1967) 254
Cal.App.2d 926, 931.) “[U]nder California rules, an actual controversy that is
currently active is required for such relief to be issued, and both
standing and ripeness are appropriate criteria in that determination. (Citation.)
One cannot analyze requested declaratory relief without evaluating the nature
of the rights and duties that plaintiff is asserting, which must follow some
recognized or cognizable legal theories, that are related to subjects and
requests for relief that are properly before the court.” (Otay Land Co.v. Royal Indemn. Co. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 556, 563.)
“‘[S]ection 1060 does not require a breach of contract in order to obtain
declaratory relief, only an ‘actual controversy.’ Declaratory relief pursuant
to this section has frequently been used as a means of settling controversies
between parties to a contract regarding the nature of their contractual rights
and obligations.’” (Osseous Technologies
of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th
357, 365.) Declaratory relief operates prospectively. (Id. at p. 366.)
 
“To
qualify for declaratory
relief under
section 1060, plaintiffs were required to show their action ... presented two
essential elements:
‘(1) a proper subject of declaratory
relief, and (2)
an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the rights or
obligations of a party.’” (Lee v. Silveira (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 527, 546.) The operative language in
the complaint states in paragraph 14:
 
“Plaintiff seeks a judicial declaration and declaratory
judgment (a) that none of the Defendants is or shall be entitled to any amount
of money from Plaintiff, from any attorney of Plaintiff, from the Underlying
Matter, or from any proceeds of the settlement of the Underlying Matter; and
(b) In the alternative, to the extent it is established that any of Defendants
is or shall be entitled to (a) any amount of money from Plaintiff, from any
attorney of Plaintiff, from the Underlying Matter, or from any proceeds of the
settlement of the Underlying Matter. In the alternative, to the extent it is
established that any of Defendants is or shall be entitled to (a) any amount of
money from Plaintiff, from any attorney of Plaintiff, from the Underlying
Matter, or from any proceeds of the settlement of the Underlying Matter; or (b)
any lien against the Plaintiff, against any attorney of the Plaintiff, against
the Underlying Matter, or against any proceeds of the settlement of the
Underlying Matter, then Plaintiff seeks a judicial declaration of the extent
and conditions of such entitlement.”
 
The plain language of the operative complaint not
only alleges a controversy subject to a declaratory relief claim, but said
claim constitutes the proper means to resolving an attorney fee lien dispute
involving former counsel. (Brown v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 320, 333.) The court therefore
finds the declaratory relief claim properly alleged for purposes of the
demurrer. 
 
Defendant’s
argument seeking to impose a mandatory contractual element as a necessarily
pled precursor to a declaratory relief cause of action requires inference
beyond the scope of the pleading. “When discharge occurs, if a lien exists, it
survives, but it is for quantum meruit, the reasonable value of services
rendered to the time of discharge, rather than for the full contract fee.” (Hansen v. Jacobsen (1986) 186
Cal.App.3d 350, 355–356.) Nothing in the motion or reply in any way undermines
the well established quantum meruit basis of recovery for contingent fee
contracts addressed in a lien by former counsel. (Huskinson & Brown v. Wolf
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 453, 460-461; Fracasse
v. Brent (1972) 6 Cal.3d 784, 791.)
 
Arguments
characterizing the declaratory relief as arising in breach of contract fails to
reflect the current applicable standard. (Moss
v. Moss (1942) 20 Cal.2d 640, 643; City of Alturas v. Gloster
(1940) 16 Cal.2d 46, 49.) The means for determining the amount of any potential
recovery in no way requires a party to plead all underlying terms of the
foundation agreement in order to allege the basic and minimal elements of the
actual declaratory relief cause of action for purposes of surviving demurrer. (Cazares v. Saenz (1989) 208
Cal.App.3d 279, 287-289.) 
 
On the misjoinder argument, specifically contend a
potential misjoinder may exist due to the lack of current counsel as a party to
the action. Defendant focuses on the section in paragraph 14, which states: “to
the extent it is established that any of Defendants is or shall be entitled to
(a) any amount of money from Plaintiff, from any attorney of Plaintiff, from
the Underlying Matter, or from any proceeds of the settlement of the Underlying
Matter.” The argument depends on a finding that current counsel seeks to
somehow potential deprive Defendants of their right to adjudication the lien. (Aresh v. Marin-Morales (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 296, 304; see Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1121, 1131.) The court finds no
support for this argument, and again declines to consider any extrinsic
reference dependent conclusions.
 
The demurrer is overruled. Defendant to answer the complaint
