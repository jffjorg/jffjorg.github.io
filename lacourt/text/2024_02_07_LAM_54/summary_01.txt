English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mealad K. Saadeh v. Marriott Hotel Services, LLC, et al. The defendants demurred to the second cause of action for harassment in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), alleging that the plaintiff failed to allege facts showing severe and pervasive harassment. However, the court overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of a hostile work environment, including being treated differently and subjected to harsh discipline, are sufficient at the pleading stage to establish racial harassment. The defendants are ordered to file and serve answers to the First Amended Complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
