And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is concerned about a potential conflict of interest between the named plaintiff, Huong Bui, and the class in the case of Huong Bui v. Spectrum LifeSciences, LLC et al. The judge has continued the preliminary approval of the class action settlement and requested additional briefing and evidence to address this concern. Specifically, the judge requires the plaintiff's counsel to submit further briefing on the plaintiff's adequacy as a class representative and why a conflict of interest does not exist between the plaintiff and the class. The judge also requires the revision of the plaintiff's individual settlement agreement to explicitly state that it is not contingent on the final resolution of the class action and PAGA matters. Additionally, the judge requires the revision of the Class Notice to disclose to class members the named plaintiff's entry into a separate individual settlement agreement with the defendant. The parties are required to submit supplemental briefing and evidence by February 20, 2025, and the motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement is continued to March 13, 2025.
