And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the first amended complaint (FAC) by the defendants, Wayne Gretzky and Janet Gretzky, is sustained with 30 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff, Howard Feldman, may amend his complaint only as authorized by the court's order and may not add a new party or cause of action without permission. The court also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of the June 22, 2023, and August 1, 2023, minute orders.

The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation were insufficient because they failed to specify which statements were made to the plaintiff and how they caused harm. The court allowed the plaintiff one final opportunity to amend the complaint to allege a claim for fraud and negligent misrepresentation against the defendants.

The court also addressed the plaintiff's "Errata Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint" document, which was filed without leave of court. While it would be proper to strike the pleading, the court chose to consider it as a second amended complaint, despite the improper filing.
