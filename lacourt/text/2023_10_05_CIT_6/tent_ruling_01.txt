Cabrera v. Bost Land, LLC
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike Defendant’s Answer
TENTATIVE RULING          The Court GRANTS
the motion to strike with leave to amend. The answer of Defendant filed on July
25, 2022 is hereby stricken in its entirety. The Court orders Defendant to file
and serve an amended verified answer to the complaint addressing the defects
identified herein within ten calendar days of this order.
          Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice and provide proof of service of same within five
calendar days of the Court’s order.
BACKGROUND          This
is an ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act case. On May 16, 2022, Plaintiff Gabriela
Cabrera (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Bost Land, LLC (Defendant)
and Does 1 to 10, alleging one cause of action for violations of the Unruh
Civil Rights Act.          On
July 25, 2022, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to strike the answer. The motion is unopposed.
LEGAL
STANDARD – Motion to Strike          “Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may
serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this
time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in subdivision (e).”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).) “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any
pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed
in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.” (Id., § 436.)
 DISCUSSION          Meet and Confer          Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 435.5, subdivision (a), the parties were required to meet and confer
before bringing this motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) The
Court finds Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and confer to be insufficient, as
Plaintiff’s counsel did not meet and confer in person or telephonically as is
required under Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a). (Grace
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Moreover, the meet and confer emails were sent in February 2023
and the subject motion was not filed until May 2023. Nevertheless, the Court
may not deny the motion to strike for failure to adequately meet and confer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a)(4).) The Court will still consider the
motion to strike but admonishes Plaintiff to comply with these requirements
going forward.           Analysis          “A
plaintiff has only 10 days after service of an answer to file a demurrer to the
answer (see
¶ 7:27). A motion to strike an answer may be brought ‘within the
time allowed to respond to a pleading.’ (CCP § 435(b)(1)). Presumably, because
a motion to strike and a demurrer must be brought at the same time, a motion to
strike must be filed within 10 days after service of the answer. [CCP § 435(b);
CRC 3.1322(b)].” (B. Motions to Strike, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial
Ch. 7(I)-B; see also CCP § 430.40(b), 435.5(b)(1), (d).)
            “Any
party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a
notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply to motions
specified in subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)
“A notice of motion to strike must be given within the time allowed to plead,
and if a demurrer is interposed, concurrently therewith, and must be noticed
for hearing and heard at the same time as the demurrer.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)
            Although
the motion is unopposed, the Court notes that the motion to strike was not
brought within 10 days of Defendant’s filing of the answer. The answer was
filed on July 25, 2022, (Answer (7/25/2022)), and Plaintiff acknowledges having
received it from Defendant on that date. (Grace Decl., ¶ 2). Plaintiff provides
no explanation for having waited approximately one year before bringing this
motion, especially when there is only one month before the current trial date
of November 13, 2023. Nevertheless, the Court exercises its discretion to still
consider the motion, particularly since this motion is unopposed, which the
Court construes as a tacit admission from Defendant that the motion is
meritorious. (See CCP § 436(a); Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th
742, 749-750 [the court retains the discretion to consider an untimely filed
demurrer]); see Holden v. City of San Diego (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 504,
418; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ.
Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10 [lack of opposition may be
construed as concession that the motion is meritorious].)
            As
for the merits of this motion, Plaintiff contends the Defendant’s answer should
be stricken since it is unverified and fails to respond specifically to each
allegation. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (d); Id., § 446, subd. (a);
C. Answer, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 6-C, citing Paul Blanco's Good Car Co. Auto
Group v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2020) 56 CA5th 86, 111.) The Court
agrees. Defendant’s answer contains a general denial, thereby failing to
respond to each allegation specifically, and it is unverified. (Answer
(7/25/2022).)
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion to strike with leave to amend.
Defendant must file an amended verified answer addressing the defects
identified herein within ten days of the date of the Court’s order.CONCLUSION                        The Court GRANTS
the motion to strike with leave to amend. The answer of Defendant filed on July
25, 2022 is hereby stricken in its entirety. The Court orders Defendant to file
and serve an amended verified answer to the complaint addressing the defects
identified herein within ten calendar days of this order.            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice and provide proof of service of same within five calendar days of the Court's order.
