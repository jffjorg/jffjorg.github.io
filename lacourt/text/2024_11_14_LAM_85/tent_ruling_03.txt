 Case Number:  23STCP03499    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  85 
Janet Jha v. City of
Los Angeles
 and City Council, 23STCP03499


Tentative decision on motion
to set appeal bond: granted



 
            Petitioner
Janet Jha (“Jha”) moves for an order setting an appeal bond in the amount of
$37,654,972 against Respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles City
Council (“City Council”) (collectively, “City”). 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. The Petition
            Petitioner
Jha filed the Petition against the City on September 21, 2023, alleging (1)
mandamus based on a violation of the Permit Streamlining Act (“PSA”); (2) mandamus
based on a violation of the Housing Accountability Act (“HAA”); (3) mandamus
based on a violation of the Density Bonus Law; and (4) declaratory relief.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
 
            a.
Governing Law
            When
the Legislature enacted the Housing Element Law, it declared that local
governments need to designate and maintain a supply of land and adequate sites
for the development of housing sufficient to meet the locality’s housing need
for all income levels.  Pet., ¶21.  
            The
HAA provides an avenue for developers to provide housing for very low, low-, or
moderate-income households (sometimes referred to as “low-cost housing”) when a
local government fails to adopt a housing element in substantial compliance
with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶22.  The local government shall approve housing,
and not condition that approval in a matter rendering that housing project
infeasible, unless the local government can make certain written findings based
upon a preponderance of the evidence. 
Pet., ¶23.  
            A
local jurisdiction cannot determine whether its adopted element is in
substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶25. 
It must submit a draft housing element to the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (“HCD”), which must issue findings before the
local jurisdiction adopts the housing element. 
Pet., ¶25.  If HCD finds the draft
element is not substantially compliant, the local jurisdiction must either revise
the draft to address any issues or adopt the draft housing element with written
findings explaining why it substantially complies with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶25. 
It must then submit the adopted housing element to HCD for it to find whether
it substantially complies with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶25. 
In a March 16, 2023 memorandum, HCD advised that a local jurisdiction’s
housing element is only in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law on
the date HCD issues a letter finding to that effect.  Pet., ¶26.
            The
Housing Element Law requires local governments to update their housing element
in eight-year cycles.  Pet., ¶27.  The City had not adopted a substantially
compliant housing element by the time the current cycle began on October 15,
2021.  Pet., ¶27.  Although it drafted a housing element on November
24, 2021, HCD found on February 22, 2022 that it was not substantially
compliant.  Pet., ¶28.  The City revised and resubmitted the draft
housing element on April 28, 2022, and HCD found it substantially compliant on
May 11, 2022.  Pet., ¶28.  The City adopted the housing element on June
14, 2022, and HCD certified its compliance with the Housing Element Law on June
29, 2022.  Pet., ¶28.  
            Under
Government Code[1] sections
65589.5(o)(1) and 65941.1(a), a housing development applicant who submits a complete
preliminary application is vested with the zoning and general plan standards in
effect at the time of submission.  Pet.,
¶30.  This includes entitlement to the
Builder’s Remedy if submitted when the jurisdiction does not have a compliant
housing element, even if it adopts one during the entitlement process.  Pet., ¶31. 
HCD confirmed as much in a June 2023 Notice of Violation issued to La
Cañada Flintridge and in an October 2023 Letter of Technical Assistance to
Santa Monica.  Pet., ¶32, Ex. A.
            
            b.
The Project
            On
June 23, 2022, Jha submitted a preliminary application for a 40-unit project
with 20% set aside as affordable to lower-income households (“Project”) at
13916 W. Polk Street.  Pet., ¶53.  Because the City found the Project was
complete on June 24, 2022, development rights in effect on that date vested for
the Project.  Pet., ¶54.  
            Jha
proposed a housing project that reserved 20% of the units for low-cost housing while
the City was out of compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶55. 
Under the Builder’s Remedy, the City was barred from disapproving the
Project unless it made one of the written findings required under section 65589.5(d).  Pet., ¶55.
            On
August 11, 2022, Jha filed an Affordable Housing Referral Form with the City’s
Affordable Housing Services Section. 
Pet., ¶57.  The City signed this
form on December 12, 2023.  Pet.,
¶64.  After a meeting with City staff on
December 9, 2022, Jha was allowed to submit a PSA development application.  Pet., ¶66. 
Jha submitted the application and paid the fees on December 21,
2022.  Pet., ¶66.  
            On
January 26, 2023, the City sent Jha a 39-page Project Review letter.  Pet., ¶67. 
The Project Review asserted the application was incomplete and did not
comply with objective zoning standards.  Pet.,
¶67.   The
Project Review further said that, although the Project was eligible for the
Builder’s Remedy, HAA does not specify the entitlement process that a local
government can require.  Pet., ¶68.  The City Planning Department’s (“Planning”)
position was that a general plan amendment (“GPA”) and rezoning amendment were
the proper entitlement path.  Pet.,
¶68.  This is not an entitlement at all,
but rather a legislative action.  Pet.,
¶68.  
            Section
65589.5(d) does provide an entitlement path. 
Pet., ¶71.  If HCD does not find a
local jurisdiction’s housing element substantially compliant by the
jurisdiction’s statutory deadline, the local jurisdiction may not use section
65589.5(d)(5) to deny a qualifying affordable housing project.  Pet., ¶72. 
HCD’s Notice of Violation to La Cañada Flintridge explained that a jurisdiction
shall not disapprove a housing development project for low-cost housing, or
condition approval in a manner that renders the housing development project
infeasible for development for such households, without one of five written
findings.  Pet., ¶71, Ex. A.
            On
April 5, 2023, Jha resubmitted revised application materials in response to the
Project Review.  Pet., ¶81.  The City sent a second Project Review asserting
the application was incomplete for failure to comply with City code
standards.  Pet., ¶¶ 82-83.  The letter emphasized that the City would not
process the development application unless Jha sought legislative rezoning that
she did not want.  Pet., ¶85.
            Jha
appealed the City’s incompleteness determination of her application.  Pet., ¶86. 
The City Council’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee (“PLUM”) recommended
denial of the appeal, and the City Council denied it on June 27, 2023.  Pet., ¶¶ 92-93.
            On
May 16, 2023, the City wrote Jha a letter asserting that the preliminary
application’s submittal had expired and that Jha’s vested rights therefore had
terminated.  Pet., ¶95.  Section 65941.1(d)(2) states that if a public
agency determines that the application for the development project is incomplete,
the development proponent shall submit the specific information necessary to
complete the application within 90 days of receiving the agency’s written
identification of the necessary information. 
Pet., ¶99.  This means that the
90-day period resets with every new completeness determination.  Pet., ¶99.  The City wrongly interpreted the statute to
mean that an applicant has only a single 90-day clock after the first written
incompleteness determination.  Pet.,
¶100.  Planning argued that even if Jha
were entitled to approval pursuant to the Builder’s Remedy, it no longer
applied because Jha’s vesting rights had expired and the City’s Housing Element
was now in substantial compliance with the Housing Element Law.  Pet., ¶104.
            After
Jha received the City’s May 16 letter, she asked HCD to clarify the preliminary
application expiration provision.  Pet.,
¶103.  HCD confirmed that the application
remains valid after a second incompleteness determination so long as the
applicant resubmits within 90 days of that determination.  Pet., ¶103. 

 
            c.
Causes of Action
            The
first cause of action seeks mandamus for violation of the PSA.  The PSA requires public agencies to compile
lists of the information required from an applicant for a development project.  Pet., ¶109. 
It also has strict timelines when an agency must determine whether an
application is complete.  Pet., ¶109.  Agencies can only judge whether an
application is complete based on the items in the checklist.  Pet., ¶109.
            The
City’s Project Reviews violated the PSA because they treated project
consistency with a zoning ordinance or general plan as an item necessary for an
application to be complete.  Pet.,
¶110.  The City refused to process an
application based on a substantive decision regarding project consistency.  Pet., ¶110. 
Section 65931 defines development projects as activities involving the
issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other
entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.  Pet., ¶111. 
This does not include rezonings or GPAs. 
Pet., ¶111.  Courts have held that
applicants cannot use the PSA to compel legislative changes to a zoning
ordinance or a general plan.  Pet.,
¶111.  Conversely, the City cannot demand
an applicant to seek such changes through a PSA completeness determination.  Pet., ¶111. 
The City refused to accept Jha’s development application based on
purported non-compliance with substantive zoning standards and criteria, not
because of incomplete information.  Pet.,
¶114.  
            The
second cause of action seeks mandamus for violation of the HAA.  The City unlawfully disapproved the Project
and failed to proceed in the manner required by law.  Pet., ¶117. 
The City disapproved the low-cost housing Project without making one of
the findings under Section 65589.5(d)(1)-(5) and also did not support such
findings by a preponderance of evidence in the record.  Pet., ¶121. 
Although Jha submitted the preliminary application before the City’s
Housing Element was deemed substantially compliant with the Housing Element Law,
the City attempted to deny her the Builder’s Remedy.  Pet., ¶122. 

            The
third cause of action seeks mandamus for violation of the Density Bonus
Law.  The Project reserved 20% of the
units for low-cost housing.  Pet.,
¶128.  This entitled the Project to two
incentives or concessions and a waiver or reduction of any development
standards that will physically preclude the Project at the proposed density.  Pet., ¶128. 
The City denied Jha those incentives without making the public health
and safety findings required under the HAA. 
Pet., ¶129.
            The
fourth cause of action seeks declaratory relief.  The City has avoided obligations under state
law through its refusal to process housing development projects that qualify
under the Builder’s Remedy.  Pet., ¶132.
 
            d.
Prayer for Relief
            Jha
seeks a writ of mandate compelling the City to review and process development
applications pursuant to the PSA and SB 330. 
Pet. Prayer, ¶¶ 1-2.           Jha
also seeks a writ of mandate (1) voiding the June 27, 2023 denial of the PSA
appeal based on violation of section 655589.5(d), (2) compelling Planning to
accept and process the Project application, and (3) compelling the City and
Planning to take all steps necessary to process the application, approve the
Project, and issue all related approvals within 60 days.  Pet. Prayer, ¶3.  Jha also seeks a declaration concerning the City’s
violations.  Pet. Prayer, ¶7.
            Jha
also seeks attorneys’ fees, costs, and fines under section 65589.5.  Pet. Prayer, ¶¶ 8-10.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
September 25, 2023, Jha served the City with the Petition and Summons.
            On
November 8, 2023, the parties stipulated to extend the deadline for all responsive
pleading to February 1, 2024.
On March 22, 2024, the City
filed its Answer to the Writ. 
On July 24, 2024, the court granted the Petition.
            According
to Petitioner, the City sought a writ of mandate in the court of appeals on
August 19, 2024, which was denied on October 3, 2024.   
            On
September 17, 2024, the court entered judgment and the clerk issued a writ of
mandate the next day. 
            Petitioner
anticipates that the City will appeal and filed the instant motion to set bond
on October 10, 2024.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            An
appeal may be taken from a judgment, except an interlocutory judgment. 
CCP §904.1(a)(1).  
In order to obtain appellate review of the trial court’s
order under the HAA, a party may file a petition within 20 days or such further
time not exceeding an additional 20 days as the trial court may allow for good
cause.  §65589.5(m).  The party may also appeal the judgment or
order of the trial court under CCP section 904.1.  Id. 
If the local agency appeals the judgment, the local agency shall post a
bond to the benefit of the project applicant in an amount to be determined by
the trial court.   Id.
 
            C.
Statement of Facts[2]
            a.
Background 
            Jha
is the owner of the Project.  Jha Decl.,
¶2.  As a result of the denial of her
application for the Project, the City has caused Jha to incur substantial
financial costs.  Jha Decl., ¶3.  These costs are directly attributable to the
City’s refusal, and continuing refusal, to perform an act it had a duty to
perform no later than January 19, 2023. 
Jha Decl., ¶3.  
            The
additional delay will inflict significantly increased financial costs for Jha,
detrimentally decreasing the valuation of the Project and increasing the
likelihood of making the Project infeasible. 
Jha Decl., ¶4.  Because of the City’s
appeal, Jha will absorb unnecessary Project carrying costs.  Jha Decl., ¶4.  Construction costs continue to escalate,
future rents are delayed, and holding costs will be incurred, all while housing
market rents risk declining, possibly negatively affecting the valuation of the
Project.  Jha Decl., ¶4.  
 
b. Additional Costs and Losses
            After
consulting several contractors and referring the DGS California Construction
Cost Index 2021-2025, Jha found that there is 17% increase in the construction
cost from the Past Delay and 28% increase in the construction in the Projected Delay.  Jha Decl., ¶6.  Applying these increased costs to a 100,260
square foot building results in the following costs:
 



Building Area of the Project 


100,260 Square Feet




Construction cost ($400 per square
  foot including the permit fees)


$40,104,000




Cost Increase per square foot for
  past the 18 months (Past Delays)


$6,765,182




Cost Increase per square foot for
  the future 30 months (Projected Delays)


$13,177,345




Total additional construction
  costs due to delays


$19,942,528



 
            Existing
investors have investment accounts totaling in excess of $2,500,000.  Jha Decl., ¶7.  Petitioner must pay a preferred return on
investment equal to 10% per annum, or $20,833 per month.  Jha Decl., ¶7.  Applying this monthly cost to the Past Delays
and the Projected Delays results in the following costs: 
                        



Investment Amount 


$2,500,000




Preferred return on investment 


10%




Returns due to past delays 


$375,000




Returns due to projected delays


$625,000




Total returns due to delays 


$1,000,000 



 
            Additionally,
new investment must be sought with a projected requirement to show a minimum of
20% annual return.  Jha Decl., ¶8.  Further, Petitioner must pay interest on the current
outstanding loan equal to 8% per annum on $2,500,000 as well as property taxes
on the Project site equal to about $14,661 per year.  Jha Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.  
            It
is necessary to manage the building as it exists now, manage the attorneys’
efforts to achieve and defend their approval, manage their investors, and other
tasks that arise from time to time.  Jha
Decl., ¶11.  Jha projects the time
requirement to be roughly 100 hours per year at a rate of $200 per hour.  Jha Decl., ¶11.  Estimated administrative costs for Past
Delays are $30,000.  Jha Decl., ¶11.  Estimated administrative costs for Projected
Delays are $50,000.  Jha Decl., ¶11.  
            Due
to the increased uncertainty of the US economy, increased inflation, and increased
interest rates, the City’s appeal creates a real possibility that the entire
Project might become infeasible in the next 30 months.  Jha Decl., ¶13.  In the event of a catastrophic failure,
projected losses are expected to be about $5,325,000.  Jha Decl., ¶13.  
The following summarizes the estimates of the costs imposed
on Petitioner:

            D. Analysis
            According
to Petitioner, the City sought a writ of mandate in the court of appeals on
August 19, 2024, which was denied on October 3, 2024.  Petitioner anticipates that the City will
appeal from the judgment and seeks an appeal bond of $37,654,972.  The City asks for a bond of $400,000.
            Petitioner’s
requested bond amount must be reduced.  The
bond may not cover damages from the City’s errors (Past Delay).  The City correctly argues that there
is nothing in the HAA which indicates an intent to rescind, or repeal the
City’s immunities from damages.  Opp. at
2, 3-5.  Relatedly, the City points out
that Petitioner seeks a bond to cover damages occurring prior to the date of
entering judgment on September 17, 2024, and thus has no relation to the appeal
period.  Opp. at 2.  
Petitioner replies that SB 575, which
enacted the bond requirement, demonstrates that the purpose of the bond is to
deter unlawful actions by cities. 
O’Neill Decl., Ex. D.  Reply at 3.  Exhibit D does not say that, and it might
constitute an unconstitutional penalty if it did.  Damages from Past Delay will not be included
in the bond.  The bond amount will be
calculated from the date of judgment forward.
            The
City argues that Petitioner seeks to recover speculative lost investment
returns at the rate of 10% and 25% of the investment, instead of the “increases
in costs” intended to be covered by the bond.  Petitioner responds that lost returns are
intended to “reflect the consequences of the amount of time it took to get
through the legal process.”   Ex. D.   
The court agrees.   Lost return is a consequence of delay and
subject to the bond requirement. 
However, Petitioner will be limited to 10% for existing investors and no
amount will be added for speculative new investment.
            The
City argues that Petitioner seeks to recover costs for a 30-month appeal period
when the median appeal period for the Second District Court of Appeals is
estimated to be at 616 days or 20.5 months. 
Wong Decl., Ex. A.  Opp. at 3.  Petitioner replies that the 20.5 months does
not account for the time between judgment and appeal, or the 30-day periods for
an appellate decision to be final or to seek review from the California Supreme
Court.   The court accepts the City’s
20.5-month median.  
            
F. Conclusion
            The bond will be set at the 28% increased
construction cost, the loss of returns at 10% for existing investors, mortgage
interest, property taxes, administrative costs, and lost rent for 20.5
months.  Petitioner’s counsel is directed
to make these arithmetical calculations based on the Jha declaration’s
calculations for a 30-month period, confirm the numbers with the City’s
counsel, and submit a proposed order with the final amount of the bond.
