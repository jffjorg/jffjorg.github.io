  Case Number:  22STCP03807    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ruben Gonzalez v. Board of Trustees
of the Cerritos Community College 
District and Cerritos Community 
College District, 22STCP03807 


Tentative decision on (1) Gonzalez’s
petition for administrative mandamus: denied; (2) District’s petition for
administrative mandamus: denied




 
Petitioner Ruben
Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”) seeks administrative mandamus to vacate the decision by
the Board of Trustees (“Board”) of the Cerritos Community College District
(“District”) to dismiss him from his employment.  The District separately petitions concerning
the exclusion of witness testimony by the administrative law judge (“ALJ”) and her
finding that the District failed to prove dishonesty.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
1. Gonzalez’s Petition
(22STCP03807)
On October 19, 2022, Petitioner Gonzalez filed the Petition against
the Board and District alleging a claim for administrative mandamus.  The operative pleading is the First Amended
Petition (“FAP”), filed on November 11, 2022 and adding Real Party-in-Interest
Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”). 
The FAP alleges in pertinent part as follows.
On January 20, 2021,
the Board voted to terminate Gonzalez under Education Code section 87732 for:
(1) immoral conduct within the meaning of Code section 87332(a); (2) dishonesty
within the meaning of Education Code section 87332(b); and (3) evident
unfitness for service within the meaning of Education Code section 87732(d).  In the amended charges, the Board added a charge
for persistent violation or refusal to obey the school laws within the meaning
of Education Code section 87332(f).  
The accusation filed
against Gonzalez consisted of vague and false allegations which were time
barred by the four-year time limit of Education Code Section 87680.  The ALJ improperly heard and considered time-barred
charges.  Although the ALJ properly
struck or barred evidence regarding most of the time-barred charges, they
improperly impacted the formal decision. 
In violation of
Education Code section 87031(b)(1), the charges also included material that was
not in Gonzalez's personnel file and to which Gonzalez had not been given an
opportunity to provide a written response.  Such evidence should not have been admitted.
The administrative hearing
was held on September 27-October 1, October 4-5, November 30-December 1, 2021,
and January 18-19, 2022.  The ALJ issued her
decision on August 22, 2022, sustaining the District's decision to terminate Gonzalez.
 
The ALJ made
numerous erroneous evidentiary rulings, including admission of inadmissible
evidence, preventing Gonzalez from presenting certain witnesses and evidence
and/or limiting his witness examination, which prejudiced him. 
The ALJ also made
improper credibility determinations as to numerous witnesses, including without
complying with the requirements of Government Code section 11425.50(b).  
Finally, the ALJ
relied on testimony and evidence, including unsubstantiated hearsay, which was
not reliable under Government Code section 11513.  
The decision is not
supported by the findings as the findings are not supported by the weight of
the evidence.  
The Board’s attorney
informed Gonzalez by letter dated on or about September 21, 2022, that,
pursuant to Education Code section 87680, the Decision affirming the Board's
termination is binding and all administrative appeals had been exhausted.  The Board’s automatic adoption of the ALJ's
decision is reviewable pursuant to Education Code section 87682 and Government
Code section 11523 through administrative mandamus.
 
2. The District’s
Petition (22STCP03841) 
On October 24, 2022,
the District filed a Petition against Respondent OAH with Gonzalez as Real
Party-in-Interest.  The Petition alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
On or about January
20, 2021, the Board reviewed the statement of written charges and determined
that it would dismiss Gonzalez from employment.  The Board’s decision to dismiss Gonzalez was
based on allegations of: (1) immoral conduct within the meaning of Education
Code section 87732, subdivision (a); (2) dishonesty within the meaning of
Education Code section 87732, subdivision (b); and (3) evident unfitness for
service within the meaning of Education Code section 87732, subdivision (d). 
On January 21, 2021,
Gonzalez was served with the District’s Notice and Statement of Decision to
Dismiss (“Notice”), attaching a Notice of Immediate Unpaid Suspension and
Intention to Dismiss, Statement of Written Charges, and Gonzalez’s most recent
performance evaluation.  Pursuant to
Education Code section 87669, the decision to dismiss Gonzalez was imposed
immediately.  On February 18, 2021,
Gonzalez filed an objection to the Board’s Notice and requested a hearing.
On October 5, 2021,
the Statement of Written Charges was amended to include additional allegations
of events and alleged persistent violation or refusal to obey the school laws
or reasonable regulations within the meaning of Education Code section 87732(f).  
At the outset of the
hearing, pursuant to Education Code section 87680, Gonzalez moved to exclude
any evidence related to allegations of misconduct occurring more than four
years prior to the date of the filing of the notice.  The District asserted that Education Code
section 87680’s four-year time limit is subject to the doctrine of equitable
estoppel. 
On August 22, 2022, the
ALJ issued a written decision correctly upholding the decision to dismiss
Gonzalez from employment.  However, the decision
included the following erroneous rulings and findings:  
a) “[T]he District
failed to meet its burden of establishing equitable estoppel for tolling the
statute of limitations for the majority of their allegations”;
b) “Evidence related
to reports made to Cerritos College administrators falling outside Code section
87680’s four-year limit is excluded. [Gonzalez], however, is estopped from
asserting the four-year limit on evidence of misconduct observed by C.R. after
her report to Dean Smith”; 
c) “The District
failed to establish cause exists to dismiss [Gonzalez] on the basis of
dishonesty”. 
            The ALJ’s decision did
not properly apply Atwater Elementary School Dist. v. California Dept. of
General Services, (“Atwater”) (2007) 41 Cal.4th 227 when analyzing
Gonzalez’s concealment of misconduct thereby triggering equitable tolling of
the statutory timeframe set forth in Education Code section 87680 and
improperly sustained general objections to routine discovery and deposition
testimony to exclude evidence of Petitioner’s dishonesty.  
            The
District prays that the court issue a writ of mandate directing OAH that the
portion of the ALJ’s decision excluding testimony of witnesses AW, LS 1, LS 2,
MT, and CR is not supported by law and should be set aside and the evidence
admitted and to find that Gonzalez committed dishonesty and persistent refusal
to obey the school laws or reasonable regulations as additional grounds for his
dismissal.  
 
3. Course of
Proceedings
On October 19, 2022, Gonzalez filed his Petition (22STCP03807).
On October 24, 2022, District filed its Petition (22STCP03841).
On November 8, 2022, the court found that 22STCP03807 and
22STCP03841 to be related within the meaning of CRC 3.300(a).
On November 11, 2022, Gonzalez filed his FAP.
Proofs of service on file show that Gonzalez served Respondent
Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) on October 25, 2022, and Real Party
Board on November 4, 2022.  
On January 20, 2023, Real Party Board filed its Answer. 
On January 24, 2023, Gonzalez filed his Answer to the District’s
Petition (22STCP03841).
On March 9, 2023, the court consolidated the related cases
and designated 22STCP03807 as the lead case. 
 
B. Standard of
Review
CCP section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision
which structures the procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions
rendered by administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
CCP section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases
are subject to independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence. Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”)
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.  See CCP
§1094.5(c).  Education Code section 87682
expressly requires the trial court’s independent review of an administrative mandamus
petition by either the governing board or the employee.  
Under the independent judgment test, “the trial court not
only examines the administrative record for errors of law but also exercises
its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de
novo.”  Bixby, supra,
4 Cal.3d at 143.  The court must
draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations.  Morrison
v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners,
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868.  In
short, the court substitutes its judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic
facts of what happened, when, why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon v. Board of Accountancy, (1976)
55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
“In exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must
afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative
findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the
burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to
the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda,
supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the court should not interfere with the agency’s
discretion or substitute its wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51;
Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision.  Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at
514-15.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5
is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 515.
An agency is presumed to have regularly performed its
official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden
of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles
County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137.  “[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party
attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings
were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of
discretion.  Afford v. Pierno,
(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.
 
            C.
Governing Law[1]
            In
a permanent employee dismissal, the District must establish (1) that the
individual charge is sustained by a preponderance of the evidence, (2) that if
the charge is sustained, it related to a specific cause as set forth under
section 44932 or 44939, and (3) after determining the charges and causes
proved, whether it renders the teacher “unfit to teach” so as to merit
dismissal.  California Teachers’ Assn.
v. State of California, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 327; Morrison v. State Board
of Education, (“Morrison”) (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 220.
 
1.
Section 87732




No
regular or academic employee shall be dismissed except for, inter alia: immoral or unprofessional
conduct, dishonesty, unsatisfactory performance, evident unfitness for service,
and persistent violation of or refusal to obey rules.  §87732(a), (b), (c), (d), (f).
 
a.
Immoral Conduct




A
regular or academic employee can be dismissed for “immoral conduct.”  §87732(a). 
The courts have developed a broad and well-understood definition of
immoral conduct in teacher dismissal cases: “[...] that which is hostile to the
welfare of the general public and contrary to good morals.  Immorality has not been confined to sexual
matters, but included conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or indicative of
corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or
shameless conduct showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable
members of the community, and as an inconsiderate attitude toward good order
and public welfare.”  Palo Verde
Unified School Dist. v. Hensey, (“Palo Verde”) (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d
967, 971-72 (quoting Board of Education of San Francisco Unified School
Dist. v. Weiland, (“Weiland”) (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808).  Based on this definition, a teacher’s
falsification of attendance records to add names of three students to secure
continued employment was deemed immoral conduct and dishonesty. Weiland,
supra, 179 Cal.App.2d at 808. 
Similarly, a teacher’s removal of school property (a public address
system speaker) from the classroom wall was deemed immoral.  Palo Verde, supra, 9 Cal.App.3d
at 967.
 
            b.
Dishonesty
            A regular or academic employee may be
dismissed for dishonesty under section 87732(b).
Dishonesty
indicates a “lack of honesty or integrity;” a “disposition to defraud or
deceive.” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/) “Dishonesty necessarily
includes the element of bad faith.” Small v. Smith, (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d
450, 456.) “[I]t means fraud, deception, betrayal, faithlessness; an absence of
integrity; a disposition to cheat, deceive or defraud; deceive and
betray.”  Ibid. “Dishonest conduct
may range from the smallest fib to the most flagrant lie. Not every impropriety
will constitute immoral or unprofessional conduct, and not every falsehood will
constitute ‘dishonesty’ as a ground for discipline.” Fontana Unified School
Dist. v. Burman, (1998) 45 Cal.3d 208, 220, n. 12.
 
            c.
Evident Unfitness for Service
 Evident unfitness for service in section
87732(d) means “clearly not fit, not adapted to or unsuitable for teaching,
ordinarily by reason of temperamental defects or inadequacies.’”  Woodland Joint Unified School District v.
Comm’n on Prof. Comp., (“Woodland”) (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429,
1444.  Conduct constituting evident
unfitness for service will often constitute unprofessional conduct.  Id. at 1445.  For a school district to meet this charge, it
must demonstrate satisfaction of the Morrison factors (see post) and take the additional step
of showing that the unfitness is “evident,” meaning that the offensive conduct
is caused by a defect in temperament.  Ibid.

“[T]he
term ‘evident unfitness for service’ should not be given a definite
technical meaning and that a court should not arbitrarily find that it is
subsumed under some set formula . . . 
In applying the standard due consideration must be given to the
circumstances of the case at hand.”  Oakland
Unified School Dist. v. Olicker, (1972) 25 Cal. App. 3d 1098, 1108
(citations omitted).  Before an inference
can be drawn that conduct renders a teacher evidently unfit to teach, it is
necessary to show “a relationship
between that conduct and the functioning of defendant as a teacher.” Id. at 1109.
 
2. Unfit to Teach




A finding of misconduct is not alone enough to dismiss.  Instead, that misconduct must render the
teacher unfit to teach.  San Dieguito
Union High School, (“San Dieguito”) (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 278, 288.  The conclusion of unfitness must be based
upon an objective standard as articulated in Morrison, supra, 1
Cal.3d at 220.  See San Dieguito, supra,
135 Cal.App.3d at 288.
In Morrison, supra, 1 Cal.3d at 214, the
California Supreme Court articulated factors to consider in whether a
credentialed employee’s misconduct renders him unfit for service as a
teacher.  Those factors are: (a)
likelihood that the conduct at issue may have adversely affected
students/fellow teachers; (b) degree of such adversity anticipated; (c)
proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct; (d) type of teaching
certificate held by the party involved; (e) extenuating or aggravating
circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct; (f) likelihood of recurrence of
the questioned conduct; (g) praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of motives
resulting in the conduct; (h) extent to which disciplinary action may inflict
an adverse impact or chilling effect upon constitutional rights of the teacher
involved or other teachers.  Id.
at 229-30.  Not every Morrison
factor must be considered; a trier of fact may consider all of the factors that
are relevant to the respective case.  Ibid.;
West Valley-Mission College v. Concepcion, (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1766,
1777.
3. Persistent Violation of Rules
Pursuant to section 87732(f), a regular or academic employee
is subject to dismissal for “[p]ersistent violation of, or refusal to obey, the
school laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the
government of the community colleges by the board of governors or the governing
board of the community college district employing him or her.”  The violation must be persistent or
“motivated by an attitude of continuous subordination.”  Governing Board of the Oakdale Union
School District v. Seaman, (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77, 81-82.  Cause for discipline may be based on the
violation of school rules, including those requiring the timely submission of
lesson plans and policies against excessive absenteeism.  San Dieguito, supra, 174
Cal.App.3d at 1180-81.
 
4. Hearing Procedure
The
governing board of the community college district determines whether to dismiss
an employee. §87669.  The written
statement of dismissal shall be in writing and served on the employee
personally.  §87672.  If the employee demands a hearing within 30
days, the matter shall proceed to arbitration or hearing as specified in
Article 4 (§§ 87669-678).  The matter
shall be referred to an arbitrator, but if the parties do not agree on an
arbitrator, it shall be certified to OAH for appointment of an ALJ.  §87678. 

The
ALJ shall conduct proceedings in accordance with Government Code Chapter 5,
commencing with section 11500, except with the broader discovery rights of a
civil action in superior court.  §87679.  The written notice delivered to the employee
pursuant to section 87672 shall be deemed an accusation.  §87679.
The
ALJ shall determine whether there is cause to dismiss or penalize the
employee.  No decision of dismissal or
suspension shall be made based on charges or evidence of any nature relating to
matters occurring more than four years prior to the filing of the notice.  §87680.
The
decision of the arbitrator or ALJ may, on petition of either the governing
board or the employee, be reviewed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
same manner as a decision made by a hearing officer under Chapter 5 (commencing
with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.  The court, on review, shall exercise its
independent judgment on the evidence.  §44945.
 
D. Statement of Facts
1. Background 
            On January 21, 2021, the District
served Gonzalez with a Notice and Statement of Decision to Dismiss. The operative
Second Amended Statement of Charges was based on four grounds under section
87732: (1) immoral or unprofessional conduct; (2) dishonesty; (3) evident unfitness
for service; and (4) persistent violation of school laws or Board regulations.  AR 1503-35.
 
            2. The Administrative Hearing 
The administrative
hearing was conducted virtually over 11 days. Numerous witnesses testified.  The ALJ admitted some testimony but excluded
other testimony as untimely under section 87680.
 
3. The Admitted
Testimony 
            a. AZ
            AZ attended Cerritos College from
July 2017 until January 2020.   AR
2413.  She was a member of the women’s
soccer team as a captain in 2017 and 2019 but not 2018 because she tore her ACL.  AR 2413.  Gonzalez was the head coach.  AR 2414. 
When AZ first joined the team, Gonzalez had a conversation with her
about her boyfriend, stating that stating it was not possible to stay faithful
in a marriage.  AR 2415.  Gonzalez explained that he cheated on his
wife.  AR 2415.
In the Summer of 2019,
there was a District investigation regarding a player who was alleged to be partying
and having sexual relationships with coaching staff during a yearly team trip
in 2018.  AR 2418.  During a team practice, one of the players
mentioned she got a call from an investigator, and Gonzalez became angry and
defensive, raising his voice and asked who else received a call from a District
investigator.  AR 2419-20.  Gonzalez then ordered: “Nobody from here on
out is to speak to any investigator.”  AR
2420.  The team was definitely
concerned.  AR 2420.  
Gonzalez pulled AZ and
the other team captain aside, telling them, “There’s no proof.  Do they have photos? What do they want me to
do, fire my own brother?” Gonzalez also blamed the female students, stating
that the players should not have been in the room where the coaches were
drinking.  AR 2421.  AZ then witnessed Gonzalez interrogating each
player individually as to where the investigation came from.  AR 2422-23. 
 
By his response, it was
clear that there would be consequences, such as to playing time, if a player
did not do what the coaches wanted.  AR
2421.  Gonzalez ordered AZ and her fellow
captain not to mention the investigation or any sexual harassment allegations
to any new players on the team and, if they heard new players talking about it,
they were to “shut it down immediately.” 
AR 2424.  
Gonzalez and Assistant
Coach Brent Whitfield (“Whitfield”) were the two main coaches.  AR 2426. 
They worked side-by-side together, according to Gonzalez, for “almost
ten years”.  AR 2426.  AZ and her teammate felt uncomfortable with Coach
Whitfield, who added players as friends on social media, drank shots with
players, made inappropriate comments, and threatened to cut playing time when
rejected.  AR 2425-26, 2431, 2433-34.  
On a soccer trip across
the country to play the number one soccer team in their division during the
summer of 2019, AZ received inappropriate texts from Whitfield after he
attempted to have her drink alcohol with him. 
AR 2434-36.  The messages
reflected that he was drinking and that boundaries were being crossed.  AR 2435. 
AZ became fearful to say anything around Coach Whitfield because he made
fun of her stuttering.  AR 2442.  AZ felt she could not report inappropriate
behavior to Gonzalez based on his prior response to an investigation.  AR 2437. 

            AZ described the team environment as
“toxic,” with coaches demeaning players, mocking their weight, and using
fitness as punishment.  AR 2442-43.  Other teammates felt the same.  AR 2445. 
AZ and her teammates did not report anything because they were fearful
that the coaches would retaliate and diminish their opportunity to transfer to a
four-year college.  AR 2445.  
            AZ reported to the Title IX office,
including Title IX Coordinator Valyncia Raphael-Woodward (“Raphael”).  AR 2446. 
She said she wanted to stay anonymous, but Raphael said she could not
guarantee anonymity.  AR 2446.  She spoke to the other Title IX officer, who
said she should try to get others to report with her.  AR 2447. 
AZ left upset because she felt Title IX was where she was supposed to
go.  AR 2447.
The thought came to her
that she could report to Athletic Director Maria Castro (“Castro”).   AR 2447. 
She obtained Castro’s guaranty of anonymity, and she spoke to Castro about
the inappropriate and toxic behavior on the team.  AR 2447-48. 
On October 10, 2021, Castro had a meeting with the team about the
allegations being investigated.  AR 2452.
 
Following this meeting,
a teammate MC screamed at and accused AZ of reporting to Castro and threated to
beat her up, screaming: “I know it was you who fucking told Maria and I will
beat your fucking ass,” while other teammates held her back.  AR 2454. 
Under her breach MC added “stupid fucking bitch.”  AR 2454. 
The confrontation lasted 30 seconds. 
AR 2492.  The whole team, probably
16-20 players, was present.  AR
2493.  Everyone was quiet and no one knew
what to say.  AR 2493.  Then other players were shouting to calm MC
down and holding her back.  AR 2495.  AZ was so shocked by the encounter that she
started laughing because she did not know how to respond.  AR 2495. 

Gonzalez was 10-15 feet
away when MC started yelling.  AR
2453.  He was two to three feet away when
he opened the gate.  AR 2454.  He did nothing to stop the attacking MC or
correct what she said.  AR 2454.  It was clear he knew what was going on.  AR 2497.
After the confrontation,
AZ went straight to Castro’s’ office.  AR
2497.  She made no effort to talk to
Gonzalez.  AR 2497-98.  She told Castro exactly what happened,
including that Gonzalez had opened the gate instead of protecting her.  AR 2456. 
AZ was informed that Coach Whitfield would be suspended.  AR 2498-99. 

AZ felt she had no
option but to withdraw from the soccer team. 
Had she continued, the coaches and other players would have made her
life difficult and uncomfortable.  AR 2456-57.  
            AZ recalled seeing social media
posts from former Cerritos College soccer player Ashley Webb in 2020 about
inappropriate text messages and players being treated like dogs, which was consistent
with her experience on the team.  AR 2459.    
 
            b. AJ
            AJ participated in the women’s
soccer program in 2018 and 2019.  AR 3109.
 Gonzalez was the coach.  AR 3109.
AJ went on a road trip
to Seattle in September with the team where the coaches were intoxicated, and Gonzalez
was present.  AR 3110, 3123.  AJ was accosted by Coach Whitfield who put his
hand on her leg under a table while they were drinking.  AR 3110. 
This made her uncomfortable, but she did not report it because she had
heard that nothing would happen and she would be retaliated against, such as
loss of playing time.  AR 3111-12.  AJ did not know if Gonzalez was aware of the
incident.  AR 3128.  While her dad was going to report the
incident to Gonzalez, he never did because AJ suffered a head injury and
stopped playing.  AR 3130.  
            AJ was aware of an app accusing a
player of sleeping with one of the coaches. 
AR 3114.  That player’s mother
spoke to Gonzalez, who told the players they needed to own up to sending the app.  AR 3114. 
If not, the police would be called, and there would be an
investigation.  AR 3115.  After they, they asked for the players phones
to see if they had downloaded the app.  AR
3115. Gonzalez talked to the team at a team practice and told them that the
allegations were false.  AR 3118.
Assistant Coach Ana
Ramirez (“Ramirez”) flirted with players during practice.  AR 3119.  
Gonzalez was around but did not think anything of it.  AR 3119. 
            Gonzalez never discouraged her from
reporting or threatened loss of playing time. 
AR 3134.
            
c. CR
            CR attended Cerritos College from
2013 to 2015 where she played on the soccer team.  AR 2328.  Gonzalez was the head coach.  AR 2335. 
She played soccer for Gonzales in high school in 2012.  AR 2329.
During a December 2013 soccer
trip to San Francisco, CR and her friend AJ went to the coaches’ room.  AR 2335. 
When they entered, CR saw Coach Diego Millan (“Millan”) stroking the
upper thigh area of one of her teammates (Lily).  AR 2335. 
AJ also witnessed Millan’s behavior. 
AR 2335.  When AJ exited the room,
she informed CR that another teammate, Clare Gomez, just had a threesome with Assistant
Coach Memo Gonzalez (“Memo”) and Coach Whitfield.  AR 2336. 
CR felt this behavior was wrong and that she should say something to a
higher authority, but not Gonzalez because Coach Memo was his brother.  AR 2336-37.  Through observation, it was obvious to CR that
Gonzalez knew what was going on.  AR 2337.

            CR was deeply disturbed and reported
to the Athletic Dean Dan Smith (“Smith”) what she observed and heard upon her
return from the trip.  AR 2338-39; AR 2359.
 When she got to practice three minutes
after she left Dean Smith’s office, Gonzalez knew that she had reported the
sexual misconduct.  AR 2339.  Gonzalez angrily confronted CR in front of the
entire team, yelling at her that she should not have reported anything to Dean
Smith and that she should have come to him first.  AR 2339-40. 
            In the Summer of 2013, before the
San Francisco trip for the Championship game, there was a trip to Florida at which
some drinking among coaches and players occurred.  CR did not know if Gonzalez was aware of it. AR
2351-52, 2360.  CR reported to Dean Smith
the misconduct during the San Francisco trip but did not report earlier
incidents when an assistant coach touched CR’s sister’s shoulders on the bus or
underage drinking on the Florida trip. 
AR 2385-86, 2358-59. 
            After CR’s report, the demeanor of all
coaches towards her changed and they stopped communicating with her.  AR 2348.  CR continued to witness coaches laughing and flirting
with the players, but it was kind of like this behavior was deliberately hidden
from her.  AR 2347.
            She did not observe anything
untoward on a subsequent Chicago trip or improper after her report to Dean
Smith.  AR 2354, 1396-97.  
CR believes that
Gonzalez cut her playing time in half because she reported to Dean Smith and
also did not fulfill his promise to assist her in transferring to a four-year university.  AR 2343. 
In the 2014 season, after she reported to Dean Smith, CR played in 23
games and started 15 of them.  AR 2362.  She transferred to a university in Louisiana
to play soccer after the coach received a reference from Gonzalez that was “not
positive”.  AR 2355, 2389.
 
            d. Ana Ramirez 
            Ramirez
was an assistant coach at Cerritos College when Gonzalez became head coach
2006. AR 2604-05. 
In 2013-2014 she did not
see Gonzalez tell any players anything to discourage reporting.  AR 2609. 
She did not have the impression that players were afraid or intimidated
to report any misconduct.  AR 2609.  She never observed Gonzalez yelling at CR in
front of the team about reporting misconduct. AR 2606.  
She attended all
practices from July 2019 through the end of the 2019 season, and Gonzalez did
not do anything to discourage the players from reporting any misconduct they
experienced or observed.  AR 2620.  In July 2019, she did not observe Gonzalez tell
the team not to participate in any investigation, or that incoming freshmen
should not be told about the investigation or alleged misconduct. AR 2619-20.  She did not hear from anyone else that Gonzalez
did or said anything to discourage players from reporting or participating in
any investigation, or not to tell incoming freshman about any allegations or
investigation.  AR 2621.  She never heard Gonzalez tell AZ or any
captain to affirmatively put a stop to any discussions with incoming players
about allegations of misconduct or investigations.  AR 2622-23.  
In 2019, she never had
the impression that players were afraid or intimidated by Gonzalez, other coaches,
or the team environment from reporting any issues of misconduct.  AR 2635.  Gonzalez never did anything to discourage
players from coming to him or making reports to anyone else.  AR 2636, 2367, 2655.  To the contrary, he told the team to come to
him or any coach with any problems. AR 2653, 2654.
 
e. Maria Castro
Castro has been the Athletic
Director since 2019 and was previously the soccer team trainer.  AR 2245-46.  
In September 2019, AZ
reported drinking and improper texts by assistant coaches after a team trip to
New York.  AR 2254-55.  Castro contacted the Title IX office, as well
as her direct supervisor, Dean Rory Natividad, and they collectively decided to
investigate.  AR 2255.
Castro met with the team
on October 10, 2019, before practice, to tell them of her investigation.  AR 1155-56. 
Afterwards, AZ reported an altercation with MC blaming AZ for reporting.
 AR 2256-57.  MC blamed AZ for ruining their season through
the investigation and Coach Whitfield’s suspension.  AR 2257. 
AZ told Castro that most of the team was surrounding them during the
confrontation, and Gonzalez was on the outskirts going to unlock the gate for
practice. AR 2258.  
Castro summoned MC to
her office through a text with Gonzalez, and told MC to “trust the process”,
return to practice, and apologize to the team for her outburst.  AR 2258-59. 
Gonzalez reported to Castro that MC had done so.  AR 2296. 

Castro investigated AZ’s
report along with the Title IX coordinator. 
AR 2260-61.  Castro had a
relationship with the players, and she conducted the investigation, working
with the Title IX coordinator every step. 
AR 2261.  She interviewed about 15
student athletes on the women’s soccer team. 
AR 2263.  She also interviewed
Whitfield and Gonzalez.  AR 2266.  They found no evidence that Coach Whitfield
and another coach were drinking in a bar (AR 2264-65) but did learn that
coaches would sometimes text inappropriately (AR 2265).  Gonzalez said he was unaware of any alleged
texting or drinking.  They concluded
there was insufficient basis to fire Coach Whitfield.  AR 2267. 
There was no evidence Gonzalez had anything to do with MC instigating
the incident with AZ.  AR 2279-80.  
The result was an
agreement between Whitfield, Gonzalez, and herself to “keep them in check” and
make sure Whitfield knew how he should behave moving forward.  AR 2267.
As an athletic trainer
for the team since 2013 before becoming Athletic Director in 2019, Castro had
no direct knowledge of any conduct by Gonzalez or other coaches to inform the
players they should not speak out, and never observed conduct that she should
report.  AR 2314-17.    
 
f. Adriana Flores-Church
Adriana Flores-Church
(“Church”) has been the Director of Human Resources since 2006 and VP since
2016.  AR 2546-47.  After the September 2019 Title IX
investigation of AZ’s report, including MC’s retaliation and Gonzalez ignoring
it, the District determined no disciplinary action was warranted against Gonzalez.  Coach Whitfield was placed on suspension
during the investigation and was reinstated after the allegations were not
substantiated.  AR 2575.[2]  
 
g. Valyncia
Raphael-Woodward
Raphael was Director of
Diversity, Compliance, and Title IX Coordinator from July 2016 to September
2020.  AR 2658.  She has a JD and a PhD in educational
leadership, and extensive training in Title IX and sexual harassment
investigations.  AR 2658-59.  
During her Title IX
investigation, no one reported to her that Gonzalez did or said anything to
discourage reporting.  AR 2684.  The investigation was concluded by June 20,
2019, before the players returned in July 2019.  AR 2684.  
If a player, after
reporting improper conduct, is confronted by her teammates, the head coach has
a duty to take action.   AR 2700.  The head coach has a variety of options, and Raphael
hopes the coach would share it with her as soon as they become award of
it.  AR 2700.  Raphael “coached” head coaches to report
retaliation to her for Title IX reporting and also coached them to not
intervene in any altercation between players as it may make matters worse.  AR 2700-01. 
Intervention is an option, but she did not want coaches to be
“deputized” to handle the issue on their own without letting her know.  AR 2703-04.  If the head coach had no knowledge, he cannot
report it.  AR 2710.  But if Castro had information about Title IX
retaliation, she was obliged to report it.  AR 2710.  If Castro told Gonzalez that she would handle
a situation, he would be correct to follow that direction.  AR 2711. 

 
h. Octavio Marquez
Assistant Coach Octavio
Marquez (“Marquez”) was an assistant soccer coach from 2009 to 2019.  AR 2845-46. 

CR was a very good
player but had some attitude issues about not coming out of games or not
starting.  AR 2848-49.  He is not aware of CR ever reporting any
misconduct by anyone, and never observed Gonzalez scolding or admonishing her
regarding her having reported something about him.  AR 2849. 
He never heard that Gonzalez ever yelled at or scolded CR and would have
heard about it if it happened.  AR 2849-50.
 
Gonzalez was not a coach
that would admonish a player in front of other players.  AR 2851.  He never observed Gonzalez tell players to not
report anything without coming to him first. 
In fact, Gonzalez encouraged players to talk to Castro (when she was an
athletic trainer) or one of the deans if there was an issue that they did not
feel comfortable discussing with a coach.  AR 2851-52.
Based on his ten years
of working with Gonzalez, there was no culture of fear to prevent players from
reporting concerns.  AR 2874.  He never heard Gonzalez discourage AZ or any
other players from reporting anything to anyone, not to participate in any
investigation, or not to talk to incoming freshman about allegations.  AR 2876-77.  If Gonzalez had said any that, Coach Marquez
would have heard about it.  AR 2877.  
The District cleared him
of any wrongdoing following its investigation. 
AR 2902.
 
i. OL 
OL started as a soccer
player in the Summer 2019.  AR 2759.  AZ was not practicing because she was
returning from a torn ACL. AR 2782.  Gonzalez
never mentioned an investigation or that players should not talk to
investigators, and OL was not aware of any investigation during the summer
session. AR 2766.  OL never witnessed any
coach flirting with any player.  AR 2767.

Gonzalez never did or
said anything to discourage players from reporting anything they had concerns
about, and there was no environment of fear where players were afraid to raise
concerns or problems.  AR 2767.  OL felt comfortable talking to Gonzalez if she
had an issue or concern.  AR 2768.  She and other players completed a three-hour
course on Title IX.  AR 2768. She did not
fear losing playing time if she reported misconduct and was not aware of other
players being afraid.  AR 2769. 
Two to three weeks after
the 2019 New York trip, OL saw MC argue with AZ.  AR 2777. 
Castro had told the team about an investigation but did not say what it
was about. AR 2780-81. On the day of the altercation, the team started in the
weight room then walked to the field.  AR
2820.  Castro was not present.  AR 2818-19.  AZ and MC raised their voices to each other.  AR 2777. 
The players stood between MC and AZ to prevent any further altercation.  AR 2777, 2821-22. AZ then grabbed her stuff
and left.  AR 2776-77.  OL learned from other players that MC was blaming
AZ for the team losing an assistant coach but did not learn why MC was blaming
AZ. AR 2780-81. 
Before the argument, Gonzalez
left the team from the weight room and drove around to go to the other side of
the field and park.  AR 2820-21.  The team waited by the back gate to the field
for Gonzalez to unlock it.  AR 2821. Gonzalez
was walking to the gate on the other side and did not see the fight.  AR 2778.  OL knew Gonzalez did not observe the argument
because she was looking around for coaches as she did not want her teammates to
get in trouble for fighting with each other. AR 2779-80.  OL is certain that Gonzalez arrived after AZ
had left.  AR 2822–23, 2827.
After the argument and during
practice, Gonzalez told MC to go see Castro. AR 2783.  MC returned to practice and apologized to the
team.  AR 2784.  OL later learned that AZ made the report, and
OL was not mad at AZ.  AR 2799.  Nor were the other players.  AR 2799. 
MC is usually loud and an instigator.  AR 2799, 2822.
 
j. Gonzalez 
            Gonzalez had been the head coach of
the women’s soccer team since 2006.  He
also taught classes in health, sports psychology, sports management, soccer,
soccer fitness and technique, weight training, beginning and advanced.  AR 2931, 2933.  
He told players he had
an open-door policy, and they could also talk to other coaches, Castro (then
team trainer), Human Resources, Title IX or whomever they felt comfortable
with.  AR 2943.  When Escorcia tried to blackmail him by threatening
to make misconduct allegations, Gonzalez reported it promptly to Title IX
Coordinator Raphael.  AR 2949.  The ensuing investigation ended by June 20,
2019, before the team’s 2019 Summer session.  AR 2949-55. 
Thus, contrary to AZ’s testimony, Gonzalez did not tell anyone in Summer
2019 not to talk to investigators.  AR 2991,
3051. 
            Gonzalez did not have a
confrontation with CR about reporting to Dean Smith instead of himself at a
practice the week after the 2013 championship. 
AR 2958.   Additionally, the
championship was over and there was no practice.  AR 2958.  Neither Dean Smith, CR, nor anyone else ever
told Gonzalez about any such report.  AR 2957-58.
 
Based on the school game
stats, CR played and started in most games. 
AR 2968-69.  Gonzalez gave an
honest assessment of CR to the Lafayette coach: CR was talented, could be lazy
at times and uncoachable, and had an attitude, but he thought she would do a
good job at the next level.  AR 2971.  Gonzalez recommended CR to coach at Bishop
Amat High School in 2014 because she had won a championship there and he wanted
her to motivate her as a player to get a coach’s perspective the expectations
of a player.  AR 2975-76.  Gonzalez also mentored her as a coach.  AR 2977. 

            On October 10, 2019, at 7:00 a.m. in
the weight room, Castro told the team she was conducting an investigation of
allegations of misconduct.  AR 3006.  He was not present during the meeting because Castro
said she wanted to meet with the players alone. 
AR 3007.  Gonzalez was outside the
weight room, speaking with the strength and conditioning coach.  AR 3007. 
The meeting lasted five to ten minutes and the players started walking
towards the field.  AR 3009.
Gonzalez waited until
all the players were out of the weight room and made sure the door was
closed.  AR 3009-10.  He walked to his car to drive to the gate
that the coaches usually go through.  AR
3010.  He went to and unlocked the gate, unlocked
and opened the bin and took out the practice equipment needed for that day, and
carried it 20 yards to the bench.  AR
3010-11.  Then he walked to open the gate
for the student athletes on the other side of the field.  AR 3011. 
This process took 10-12 minutes.  AR 3013, 1834. 

            As Gonzalez was about 50 yards away
from the players gate – halfway across the soccer field -- he heard what
sounded like horseplay.  AR 3080-81.  As he got closer, it went silent within ten seconds.
 AR 3082.  That was unusual.  AR 3082. 
HE did not question anyone about it at the time.  AR 3082. 
Later, Castro texted him that she wanted to see MC.  AR 3019-20.  He asked MC: What’s going on?  AR 3020. 
MC said she did not know, and Gonzalez told MC to go see Castro.  AR 3020. 

At the end of practice,
MC asked to speak to the team.  Gonzalez
agreed, and MC apologized for yelling at AZ.  AR 3020-21.  He asked MC and MC said she did not want to
talk about it.  AR 3021.  He then visited Castro who said that MC
yelled at AZ because MC believed AZ caused the investigation.  AR 3021-22.  Gonzalez asked Castro if he should reach out
to AZ and Castro said she would handle it.  AR 3023, 3087.  Gonzalez had no further contact with AZ.  AR 3024. 
Later, Castro suspended AZ for playing in an outside league, which was
not permitted.  AR 3024.  Gonzalez was not involved in that decision. AR
3025.
            Gonzalez never observed or received
reports of players and coaches flirting but would have reported it to the Title
IX coordinator and the dean if he had.  AR 3049.  Gonzalez had never been disciplined for any
misconduct or given progressive discipline.  AR 3059-60.  If he returned to coach the soccer team, he
would do a better job of communicating with students and coaches and have them
sign a contract to reinforce rules and reporting.  AR 3060-61. 
        
 
4. The Excluded
Evidence
            a. MT
            MT played on the women’s soccer team
from 2013 to 2015.  AR 2045.  MT remembered two situations where Gonzalez
was upset with players who made reports about sexual misconduct.  AR 2051. 
Leslie told MT, who was captain, that she was uncomfortable about what
coaches were saying about her, she tried to report it, and Gonzalez pulled her
aside and told her that he was angry she did that.  AR 2052. 

The second incident was
similar.  AR 2052.  The coaches were making fun of Ira’s weight
and body type.  AR 2053.  MT could not recall if Ira made a complaint,
but Ira told MT that Gonzalez pulled her (Ira) aside and told her not to say
anything.  AR 2053.  Gonzalez never said anything or did anything
to MG to discourage her from making a report. 
AR 2094.
Gonzalez was present
when Coach Memo was making fun of a student, Gracie, because of her weight.  AR 2053.  Memo said that Gracie was fat and needed to
lose weight so she could move more quickly and be effective.  AR 2053. 
MT told Memo that was not nice.  AR
2054.  Gonzalez did not intervene but
instead laughed and said something to Memo in Spanish.  AR 2054. 
Gracie was a great player.  AR
2054.  MT saw Gracie crying, but MT was
unsure if Gracie heard the comments.  AR
2055.  
MT’s roommate and fellow
soccer player, CG, was dating Coach Memo. 
AR 2065-66.  Although MT was
unsure if Gonzalez knew about the relationship, Gonzalez was present when Memo
put his arms or hands around CG.  AR
2066-67.  
Coach Whitfield also
asked through text message if MT wanted to get together with him, which she
declined.  AR 2073.   Memo also texted that he wanted to see her
underwear.  AR 2057.
MT did not know if Gonzalez
was aware of any inappropriate relations between players and coaches. AR 2084.  
 
            b. AW
            AW was on the women’s soccer team in
2014. AR 1927.  AW had heard that sexual
misconduct was reported to the college while she was on the team.  AR 1928. 
A teammate told her that a year before she tried to tell the
administration that the coaches were bothering her, but the administration had
not done anything.  AR 1929.  The athletic director had told Gonzalez about
the report, and he ended up telling the team that everything should stay
in-house.  AR 1929.  As a result, AW was scared to report anything
to administration.  AR 1929. 
            When on the buses, the girls would
dance sexually while the coaches would sometimes watch, however at no point did
Gonzalez stop this dancing or stop the coaches from watching.  AR 1943-44.  Gonzalez would be present when coaches
commented about a player’s body and did not stop it.  AR 2000.  Gonzalez would laugh off the other coach’s comments.  AR 2002. 
For example, Coach Tavo made a comment to AW in the weight room that she
should make sure to “get your leg workout in” which was sexual in nature.  AR 2013. 
Gonzalez was present.  AR
2013.  AW did not come forward earlier
because of the power that Gonzalez had to affect a player’s career.  AR 2008-09. 
 
            c. LS 1
            LS 1 attended Cerritos College from
2008 until 2010.  AR 1951-52. Gonzalez
knew that LS 1 suffered from sciatica and offered to help her by taking her to
get a massage.  AR 1955, 1957.  LS 1 believed it would be a sports massage and
agreed to go with Gonzalez.  AR 1955.  Instead, Gonzalez had booked and prepaid for a
couples massage at a massage parlor.  AR
1955-56.  
During the session, Gonzalez
and LS 1 were required to be naked in the same room, and Gonzalez had arranged
for the room to also have a shower and a milk bath.  AR 1957.  After the massage, Gonzalez used the milk bath
and attempted to convince LS 1 to go inside the milk tub with him.  AR 1957. 
LS 1 only slightly stepped inside the bath feeling very uncomfortable,
and instead took a quick shower.  AR 1957.  While she showered Gonzalez remained in the
milk bath.  AR 1957.  After this, they received manicures and
pedicures, which were also prepaid by Gonzalez. 
AR 1957.  LS 1 only played along
to get home safe.  AR 1985.  
Following the massage, Gonzalez
wanted to go and grab a bite to eat.  AR
1957-58.  LS 1 remembered feeling very
uncomfortable because Gonzalez was treating her like a girlfriend by opening the
door for her and walking behind her.  AR
1958.  Gonzalez hugged her from behind
which lasted for approximately a minute. 
AR 1979-80.  LS 1 played along as
she wanted to get home.  AR 1958.
            As a result of this experience, LS 1
felt uncomfortable.  AR 1960.  She decided she could not stay on a team where
the head coach was hitting on her, and she transferred to Compton Community
College.  AR 1960-61.
            Gonzalez had a meeting with the
coaches and players that inappropriate comments should not be made.  AR 1964-65.  However, after this meeting Gonzalez was
present when assistant coaches made sexual comments to players.  AR 1991-92. 

            If LS 1 had not experienced this
situation with Gonzalez, she would not have transferred from Cerritos Community
College, would have finished college faster, and would have stayed in-state.  AR 2041.  LS 1 never reported her experience because Gonzalez
was powerful and could have had a tremendously negative impact on her soccer
career.  AR 2007-08.
Gonzalez never threatened
her in any way to prevent her from reporting. AR 2024.  Nor did he do so in the years after she was at
Cerritos.  AR 2024.  Gonzalez was present for various comments by assistant
coaches at which he would look the other way or laugh, but LS 1 could not
recall any specific comment he likely heard.  AR 2043.
 
            d. LS 2
            LS 2 practiced with the women’s
soccer team at Cerritos College during the summer of 2013.  AR 2180-81.  LS 2 had private training sessions with Coach Memo,
who she described as flirtatious and making comments sexualizing her body. AR
2183-84, 2198.  She never told Gonzalez
that Memo made her uncomfortable in this private training.  AR 2199.
During the summer of
2013, Gonzalez took her to get a massage at one of his friend’s homes while
they were running errands. AR 2188-89.  They
waited for each other outside on the beach while each had a massage.  AR 2188.  This interaction made LS 2 feel uncomfortable.  AR 2188-89. 

Prior to August of 2020,
she had not told anyone about the massage and never previously reported it, but
she came to the realization that this was inappropriate and that she should
come forward.  AR 2189-90. 
            LS 2 was friends with CR, who told her
about sexual relations between assistant coaches and Cerritos soccer players.  AR 2225. 
CR told her that she felt that her playing time was affected after she reported
the sexual misconduct and that the player who was having sexual relations with
Memo received more playing time.  AR
2225-26.
Gonzalez never did
anything to prevent her from reporting Memo or any of her experiences with the
coaches.  AR 2201. 
 
5. The ALJ’s Decision
The ALJ issued her decision on August 22, 2022.  AR 1853-98.
 
a. Section 87680
            At the outset of the hearing, Gonzalez
moved pursuant to section 87680 to exclude any evidence related to allegations
of misconduct that occurred more than four years prior to the date of the
filing of the notice.  AR 1855.  Section 87680 provides in relevant part: 
 
“No
testimony shall be given or evidence introduced relating to matters which
occurred more than four years prior to the date of the filing of the notice.
Evidence of records regularly kept by the governing board concerning the
employee may be introduced, but no decision relating to the dismissal or
suspension of any employee shall be made based on charges or evidence of any
nature relating to matters occurring more than four years prior to the filing
of the notice.”  AR 1855.  
 
b. Equitable
Estoppel
            The District asserted that section
87680’s four-year time limit is subject to the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  AR 1855. 
The District acknowledged that the majority of the charges against Gonzalez
involved incidents that occurred more than four years prior to the January 21,
2021, notice and argued that evidence of these charges should be admitted
pursuant to Atwater, supra, 41 Cal.4th at 227 where the
California Supreme Court considered the statutory time limit provision in
section 44944(a), the parallel provision to section 87680.  AR 1856. 
The California Supreme Court found that Code section 44944’s statutory
time limit was not absolute and could be extended under the doctrine of
equitable estoppel.  AR 1856.  Testimony from District witnesses AW, LS 1, LS
2, MT, and CR was heard for the for the purpose of determining whether grounds
existed to apply equitable estoppel.
            The ALJ stated that the District
failed to meet its burden of establishing equitable estoppel for the majority
of the allegations. However, there was evidence that Gonzalez’s conduct
prevented CR from making additional reports of misconduct she experienced and
observed after Gonzalez angrily confronted and prevented her from making
additional reports after her first report to Dean Smith in 2013.  AR 1861. 
As a result, Gonzalez was equitably estopped from asserting that the District
is prevented from presenting evidence of wrongdoing involving or observed by CR
after her report to Dean Smith.  AR 1861.

The District also asserted
that the equitable doctrine of delayed discovery, which postpones the accrual
of a cause of action until a party discovers or has reason to discover a cause
of action, is ground to permit consideration of evidence of misconduct
occurring more than four years prior to the date of the filing of the notice pursuant
to Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Ca.4th 797, 807.  AR 1862. 

            In Ethicon, the California
Supreme Court noted that “in order to adequately allege facts supporting a
theory of delayed discovery, the plaintiff must plead that, despite diligent
investigation of the circumstances of the injury, he or she could not have
reasonably discovered facts supporting the cause of action within the
applicable statute of limitations period.” 
AR 1862.  The ALJ stated that the
evidence established that the District failed to diligently and reasonably
investigate multiple reports of misconduct its officials received until AW’s
social media posts in 2020 became public. 
AR 1862.  
            The ALJ granted Gonzalez’s motion to
exclude in part and denied it in part. 
AR 1862-63.  Evidence falling
outside section 87680’s four-year limit is excluded, but Gonzalez is estopped
from asserting the four-year limit on evidence of misconduct observed by CR
after her report to Dean Smith.  AR
1863.  
            
            c. Credibility Evaluation 
The ALJ summarized the
witness testimony.   AR 1863-89.  The complaining witnesses -- CR, AZ, and AJ
-- were credible and convincing.  AR
1891.  AZ had no discernible motivation
to fabricate her testimony.  AR
1891.  Though AJ and AZ were on the team
together for a period in 2019 and knew each other, they were not friends.  AR 1891. 
Their testimonies regarding the environment at Cerritos College were
consistent and established that (1) coaching staff would routinely flirt and
romantically pursue the players, (2) players believed that if they did anything
that made the coaches unhappy, they would lose playing time which would affect
their ability to be recruited to other schools, and (3) Gonzalez discouraged
players from reporting complaints to District administration.  AR 1891-92. 
Although CR and AJ testified that Gonzalez made promises that he did not
deliver, their testimony regarding the misconduct they witnessed was measured.  AR 1892. 
Neither CR nor AJ made any allegation that Gonzalez personally harassed
the players by sending personal text messages or in any other manner.  AR 1892. 

The ALJ did not credit
Gonzalez’s testimony that he did not treat CR differently after her report.  AR 1892. 
Gonzalez described CR as “lazy” to a recruiting coach.  AR 1892. 
Gonzalez defended the call stating that he had to be honest in his
assessment, but that assessment is inconsistent with his decision to recommend
CR as a coach for the Freshman team at Bishop Amat.  AR 1892. 
Gonzalez did not present any evidence suggesting that CR’s playing
abilities, aptitude, or attitude had deteriorated from the time of that
recommendation.  AR 1892.  
 
d. Immoral or
Unprofessional Conduct 
Pursuant to section
87732(a), the governing board of a community college district has the authority
to seek the dismissal of a regular (tenured) employee for “[i]mmoral or
unprofessional conduct.”  AR 1892.  
The District established,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that Gonzalez engaged in immoral conduct
when he failed to stop MC from threatening AZ after AZ reported the
inappropriate behavior of coaching staff to Director Castro.  AR 1893.
 
e. Dishonesty 
Pursuant to section
87732(b), the governing board of a community college district the authority to
seek the dismissal of a regular (tenured) employee for “dishonesty.”  AR 1893. 

            ALJ Chin concluded that the District
failed to establish cause exists to dismiss Gonzalez on the basis of dishonesty
as many of the District’s allegations of dishonesty are related to conduct
which occurred before the four-year period.  AR 1894. 
To the extent District did not prove the misconduct, the District also
failed to establish that Gonzalez was dishonest when denying the misconduct.  AR 1894. 
To the extent that the charge of dishonesty is related to the District’s
Special Interrogatories, the interrogatories were overbroad, vague and called
for legal conclusions.  AR 1894.  The responses, therefore, could not establish
that Gonzalez engaged in dishonest behavior. 
AR 1894.  
 
            f. Evident Unfitness for
Service 
            Pursuant to section 87732(d), the
governing board of a community college district the authority to seek the
dismissal of a regular (tenured) employee for “evident unfitness for service.”  AR 1894. 

The ALJ concluded that Gonzalez’s
conduct in the aggregate indicates a factual nexus between his conduct and a
finding of his unfitness for service.  AR
1897.  The evidence established that Gonzalez
permitted a toxic environment where players are subjected to flirtatious or
abusive behavior by their coaches and where players were afraid to report any
misconduct for fear of retaliation.  AR
1896.  This conduct adversely affected
the players and continued until at least 2019. 
AR 1896.  As the head coach,
Gonzalez had significant authority over the players.  AR 1896. 
He also had the ability to grant and reduce playing time and was
instrumental in assisting players to transition to four-year schools.  AR 1896. 
These decisions were not subject to any oversight or review.   AR 1896. 
The imposition of discipline will not affect any of Gonzalez’s
constitutional right and there has been some notoriety given to the conduct
through the social media posts.  AR
1896.  
 
            g. Persistent Refusal to Obey 
            The District has the right to adopt
rules governing the conduct of its employees and to require the employees to
observe the rules.  AR 1897.  A single violation of a school board’s rules
is not of itself cause for the dismissal of a permanent teacher under section
44932(a)(8).  AR 1897.  
The District failed to
present evidence that it had ever previously disciplined Gonzalez for
misconduct before the instant action.  AR
1898.  The evidence presented by the
District suggested that it had been complicit in enabling Gonzalez’s misconduct
by exercising little to no oversight over him despite having received a number
of reports of misconduct over the years when he was the head coach for the
Cerritos College women’s soccer team.  AR
1898.  Therefore, the District failed to
establish that grounds exist to dismiss Gonzalez for a persistent violation of,
or refusal to obey, laws or the District’s regulations.  AR 1898. 

 
            h. Conclusion 
            The ALJ decided that cause exists to
dismiss Gonzalez pursuant to section 87732(a) for unprofessional conduct or
immoral conduct, and section 87732(d) for evident unfitness for service, and
that the District’s decision to dismiss him from employment is reasonable and
supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 
AR 1898.  
 
E. Analysis
Petitioner Gonzalez seeks
administrative mandamus to vacate the ALJ’s termination decision.  The District’s Petition seeks to overturn the
ALJ’s exclusion of witness testimony and finding on the cause for dishonesty.
 
1. The Excluded
Testimony Was Properly Excluded
        No decision of
dismissal or suspension shall be made based on charges or evidence of any
nature relating to matters occurring more than four years prior to the filing
of the notice.  §87680. On January 21,
2021, the District served Gonzalez with a Statement of Decision to
Dismiss.  Thus, any charges or evidence
prior to January 21, 2017 are barred by the language section 87680.
            The ALJ excluded the testimony and
attendant exhibits of District’s witnesses AW, LS1, LS2, MT and CR under
section 87680, concluding that neither equitable estoppel under Atwater,
supra, 41 Cal.4th 227 nor the delayed discovery rule applied because the
District was on actual notice of sexual harassment and inquiry notice for
anything else.  AR 1863.  
            The District appeals from the ALJ’s
ruling to exclude its witness testimony and evidence under the four-year rule
in section 87680 and the ALJ’s findings that equitable estoppel and the
discovery rule did not apply.  Evidentiary
errors are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.  People v. Guerra, (2006) 37 Cal.4th
1067, 1140, disapproved on other grounds, People v. Rundle,
(2008) 43 Cal.4th 76, 151.  Public policy
generally prevents claims after the unexcused lapse of time.  Addison v. State, (1978) 21
Cal.3d 313, 317.  Courts have little
discretion to extend statutes of limitations. Hill v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County, (1967) 251 Cal.Capp.2d 746.
 
            a. Equitable
Estoppel
In Atwater,
a teacher who was accused of sexual misconduct moved to dismiss all allegations
and exclude all evidence of sexual misconduct with five minor boys because the underlying
incidents occurred more than four years before the district served its notice
of intent.  41 Cal.4th at 230.  The teacher relied on section 44944(a), which was at the time
identical in language to the pertinent part of section
87680:
 
“No
testimony shall be given or evidence introduced relating to matters that
occurred more than four years prior to the date of the filing of the notice.
Evidence of records regularly kept by the governing board concerning the
employee may be introduced, but no decision relating to the dismissal or
suspension of any employee shall be made based on charges or evidence of any
nature relating to matters occurring more than four years prior to the filing
of the notice.”
 
The California Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal’s
holding that section 44944(a)’s time limit
is absolute and cannot be extended by the application of equitable doctrines.  The court held that the time bar is not absolute and equitable estoppel may apply where
a school can show the employee’s affirmative conduct induced the students to
refrain from reporting within the four-year period.  Id. at 232-33.  In essence, if the district can
show that an employee used their power or authority to induce students or
others to refrain from reporting the employee’s sexual misconduct, the district
will be allowed to introduce evidence of sexual misconduct falling outside the
four-year period.  Id. at 233.
The District argues that, under Atwater, the
four-year bar in section 87680 is not absolute
and is subject to the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  Simply put, Atwater prevents an
employee from deliberately inducing another parties’ inaction.  Similarly, a party cannot commit a fraudulent
or dishonest act, and then seek protection from their misdeeds by invoking a
statute of limitation. “The purpose of the statute of limitation is to protect
a defendant from the prosecution of a stale claim; it may never be used to
assure the success of his fraud.”  Carruth
v. Fritch, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 426, 434.  Opp. at 13-14.
Equitable estoppel applies in circumstances where a party
has induced another into forbearing to act. 
Lantzy v. Centex Homes, (2003) 31 Cal..App.4th 363, 383.  The elements of estoppel are: (1) the party
to be estopped must be appraised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his
conduct shall be acted upon; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true
state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.  Driscoll v. City of Los Angeles,
(1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 305.  
The District argues that the testimony of AW and MT should
have been admitted because the elements of equitable estoppel are met by
Gonzalez’s behavior in interfering with Cerritos College’s investigations of
sexual misconduct and in threatening players who reported sexual misconduct on
the team, including credible testimony from LS 1, CR, AJ, and AZ.  Opp. at 14.
First, Gonzalez knew the facts.  According to the District’s proof, he
confronted CR about an investigation and angrily responded to discussions about
an investigation when AZ and AJ were present.  Witnesses consistently testified that Gonzalez
was present when comments were made about player’s bodies and when flirting
occurred.  AR 1991-92, 2002, 2442-43, 3119.  
Second, the same evidence establishes that Gonzalez abused
his position of power to preclude the District from acting by intimidating
women and the team when reports were made, including confronting CR, angrily
reacting to an investigation as AZ testified, and demanding players’ phones as
AJ described.  AR 2339-40, 2420, 3115.  Gonzalez also knew he had an independent duty
to report but failed to do so.  AR 2258, 3080.  
Third, the District had no knowledge of the misconduct because
Gonzalez failed to report the misconduct of his coaching staff and/or concealed
it.  Id.  CR’s report to Dean Smith is
not District knowledge.  Gonzalez was a
championship soccer coach who insisted nothing was wrong to Dean Smith and Dean
Smith listened. The reality is that the District never had notice. 
Fourth, Gonzalez’s failure to report, and concealment of
his own misconduct, left the District unable to take disciplinary action
against him.  Justice and equity demand
that the District’s evidence of misconduct be admitted to break the cycle of
harassment and abuse. Opp. at 18-19.
The District’s argument is specious.  Under
Atwater, the employee’s mere failure to report or self-report
does not trigger equitable estoppel.  Estoppel
does not apply to obligate an employee to report his own misconduct, and any
limitations period still runs in that circumstance.  There must be specific action by the
defendant prevented the commencement of the action in a timely manner.  Mark K. v. Roman Catholic Archbishop,
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 603, 613.  
As the ALJ found, the District
has no evidence that Gonzalez’s words or conduct towards any of the excluded
witnesses induced them to not report. 
MT provided only hearsay evidence that Ira told her that
Gonzalez pulled Ira aside and told her not to say anything.  AR 2053.  Gonzalez never said anything or did anything
to MT to discourage her from making a report. 
AR 2094.  
AW also only provided hearsay from a teammate, who told her that
a year before she tried to tell the administration that the coaches were
bothering her, the athletic director told Gonzalez about the report, and he
ended up telling the team that everything should stay in-house.  AR 1929.  
LS 1 had troubling testimony about a massage and milk bath with
Gonzalez, but she never reported her experience because Gonzalez was powerful
and could have had a tremendously negative impact on her soccer career.  AR 2007-08. 
Gonzalez never threatened her in any way to prevent her from reporting.  AR 2024.  Nor did he do so in the years after she left Cerritos
College.  AR 2024.  
LS 2 had private training sessions with Coach Memo, who she
described as flirtatious and making comments sexualizing her body.  AR 2183-84, 2198.  She never told Gonzalez that Memo made her
uncomfortable in her private training. 
AR 2199.  During the summer of
2013, Gonzalez also took her to get a massage at one of his friend’s homes
while they were running errands.  AR
2188-89.  Yet, Gonzalez never did
anything to prevent her from reporting Coach Memo or any of her experiences
with the coaches.  AR 2201. 
Finally, CR observed Coach Millan stroking the upper thigh area
of one of her teammates (Lily).  AR 2335.  AJ informed CR that another teammate, Clare
Gomez, just had a threesome with Coach Memo and Coach Whitfield.  AR 2336. 
CR felt she should say something to a higher authority, but not Gonzalez
because Memo was his brother.  AR 2336-37.  CR reported to Athletic Dean Smith what she
observed and heard upon her return from the trip.  AR 2338-39, 2359.  Gonzalez angrily confronted CR in front of the
entire team, yelling at her that she should not have reported anything to Dean
Smith and that she should have come to him first.  AR 2339-40.
As Gonzalez argues
(Reply at 6), there is no evidence that Gonzalez did or said anything to AW,
MT, LS1, LS2, or CR that deterred them from reporting misconduct.  In fact, CR actually reported after the December
2013 trip.  MT and AW provided only hearsay
evidence that Gonzalez told another soccer player not to say anything.  LS 1 and LS 2 testified that Gonzalez never
did anything to discourage reporting.  It is also true, as Gonzalez argues, that these
witnesses were adults, unlike the minors in Atwater, and were trained
annually on Title IX, including how to report sexual harassment.  AR 2121, 2768, 2150, 2286-87.  Whether any of them was deterred from
reporting because of concern about their playing career is insufficient under Atwater,
which requires affirmative discouragement by the employee for estoppel.  There is no evidence Gonzalez affirmatively
prevented any of these witnesses from reporting.  Reply at 6.
Additionally, all these
students were outside Gonzalez’s control by 2015.  Even if there were evidence that he discouraged
them from reporting before 2015, nothing prevented them from reporting the misconduct
in subsequent years.  Indeed, some of the
witnesses came forward in 2020 after AW posted on Instagram.  See AR 1858-59.  These witnesses (except CR) simply elected not
to report anything until 2020 without any affirmative effort by Gonzalez.  
The
ALJ correctly ruled that equitable estoppel did not apply to admit the
testimony of the excluded witnesses.

 
b.
The Delayed Discovery Rule
The
District argues that, while Atwater
court based its decision on the application of equitable estoppel to the
four-year rule in section 44944, it did
not rule out other equitable grounds.  41 Cal.4th at 233.  This is consistent with authority that the
statute of limitations in administrative matters is properly evaluated under
rules similar to those in judicial proceedings.  See 2
Cal.Jur.3d, Administrative Law, §144, p. 366.  Opp. at 14.
The
delayed discovery rule is an exception to the general rule for determining when
a cause of action accrues.  Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., (2005)
35 Cal.4th 797, 807.  The delayed
discovery rule postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff
discovers, or has reason to suspect, a factual basis for its elements.  Id.
at 803.  The delayed discovery rule
permits accrual to be delayed until a plaintiff knew or should have known of
the wrongful conduct at issue.  Naftzger v. American Numismatic Society,
(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 421, 428.  Opp.
at 14.
The
District argues that the ALJ improperly excluded the testimony of LS 1 and LS 2
based on the delayed discovery rule.  The
ALJ acknowledged that the District had no notice regarding Gonzalez’s
misconduct with respect to LS 1 and LS 2: 
 
“District
witnesses LS 1, LS 2, and MT did not indicate they had attempted to report any
misconduct to the District or that they had been prevented from reporting by
any misconduct by Gonzalez.” AR 1856.
 
Despite
this finding, the ALJ did not explain why she did not consider the testimony of
LS 1 and LS 2.  The testimony of LS 1 and
LS 2 concerns entirely separate issues from CR’s report in 2014, as Gonzalez’s misconduct
with LS 1 and LS 2 happened in 2010 and 2013.  The District had no knowledge of, nor any
reasonable opportunity to discover, Gonzalez’s abuse of his position to get these
two female student athletes to engage in sexual activities with him, and the
doctrine of delayed discovery clearly applies.  California’s public policy is to allow delayed
discovery in sexual abuse and assault cases.  See,
e.g., CCP §340.1.
That same principle should apply to undisclosed allegations of Gonzalez’s sexual
misconduct.  The District’s basis to
initiate dismissal proceedings thus did not accrue until it discovered Gonzalez’s
misconduct.  Opp. at 17-18.
            Atwater
did not permit other equitable theories, only concluding that it need not
decide whether other equitable principles apply.  41 Cal.4th at 233.  The court believes that the delayed discovery
rule does not apply to the statutory bar of section 87680.  To do so would subvert the plain language of,
and public policy behind, section 87680, which precludes a dismissal or
suspension based on charges or evidence of any nature relating to matters
occurring more than four years prior to the filing of the notice.  Unlike the delayed discovery rule -- which
concerns the accrual of a claim -- section 87680 is a limitation on the charge
and use of evidence more than four years old in an employee dismissal or
suspension.  Whatever the wisdom of the
statute, its purpose is to prevent the use of stale evidence for a claim that
has already accrued.  The delayed
discovery rule has no bearing on such a circumstance.  
            Atwater
permitted more than four-year old evidence and charges when the employee
affirmatively acts to prevent reporting of misconduct based on an estoppel
theory.  In that circumstance, the
statute of limitations already has passed, and the employee is estopped from
relying on it.  41 Cal.4th at
232 (citing Lantzy v. Centex Homes, (2003) 31 Cal.4th 363).   In
contrast, the delayed discovery rule prevents accrual of a claim and has
nothing to do with the employee’s inequitable conduct.  To apply delayed discovery would permit a
district to evade section 87680’s purpose.  

Even if, arguendo, the delayed discovery rule applies,
the ALJ was correct that the rule only applies where the plaintiff has been
diligent.  “[P]laintiffs
are charged with presumptive knowledge of an injury if they
have information of circumstances to put [them] on inquiry. . .”  Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., (2005)
35 Cal.4th 797, 807-08 (citations and internal quotes omitted).  
In December 2013, CR observed Coach Millan stroking the upper
thigh area of one of her teammates (Lily). 
AR 2335.  AJ informed CR that another
teammate, Clare Gomez, just had a threesome with Assistant Coach Memo and Assistant
Coach Whitfield.  AR 2336.  CR felt she should say something to a higher
authority and reported to Athletic Dean Smith. 
AR 2338-39, 2359.  
In 2010, LS 1 experienced sexual harassment due to a massage and
milk bath with Gonzalez.  AR 2007-08.  During the Summer of 2013, LS 2 had private
training sessions with Assistant Coach Memo, who was flirtatious and made
comments sexualizing her body. AR 2183-84, 2198.  Gonzalez took her to get a massage at one of
his friend’s homes while they were running errands. AR 2188-89.  Gonzalez never did anything to prevent her
from reporting Memo or any of her experiences with the coaches.  AR 2201.  
The District does not cite any authority that the delayed
discovery rule can prevent accrual where the defendant is aware of sexual
harassment of one victim but not a second or third.  The District
should have known, or could have discovered upon reasonable inquiry, the
allegations of LS 1 and LS 2 based on Dean Smith’s knowledge of CR’s report in
December 2013.  These incidents
occurred before CR’s December 2013 observations.  It is true that the experiences of LS 1 and LS
2 were separate incidents, but they should have been uncovered in a reasonable
sexual harassment investigation.  Yet,
the District failed to investigate sexual misconduct by Cerritos College coaches
until AW posted an allegation of sexual harassment on Instagram in August
2022.  See AR 1858-59.  
The delayed discovery rule did not prevent exclusion of the
testimony of LS 1 and LS 2 under the four-year rule.
 
2. The CR Evidence Not Excluded
After CR reported
to Dean Smith, Gonzalez angrily confronted her in front of the entire team,
yelling at her that she should not have reported anything to Dean Smith and
that she should have come to him first. 
AR 2339-40.  The ALJ ruled that “[Gonzalez]…is
estopped from asserting the four-year limit on evidence of misconduct observed
by C.R. after her report to Dean Smith.” 1855-63.  This ruling was correct.
Gonzalez argues that the
problem is that CR testified she did not observe any misconduct after her
report to Dean Smith.  She did not
observe anything untoward on a subsequent Chicago trip or improper after her
report to Dean Smith.  AR 2354,
1396-97.  Thus, the ALJ should not have considered any of CR’s testimony of events.  Yet, CR’s testimony factored into the ALJ’s
decision as she reached back years to conclude that Gonzalez allowed a “toxic
environment. . .until at least 2019.”  AR 1896.  In the absence of CR’s testimony, there is
only the testimony of AZ and AJ, who were at the District in 2017 and 2019 and
conceded they did not know if Gonzalez was aware of any misconduct.  Thus, the ALJ overreached to make a broad
conclusion of a toxic atmosphere.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 11.
Abuse of discretion occurs when a court misunderstood the facts
or there was insufficient evidence to support the facts it relied on.  People v. Cortez, (1971) 6 Cal.3d 78,
85-86. Because CR did not observe any
more misconduct after she reported to Dean Smith, ALJ should not have
considered any of CR’s testimony of events.  By contravening or ignoring her ruling or
misunderstanding the facts, she abused her discretion and tainted the decision
with inadmissible evidence central to its outcome.  Reply at 9.
The District does not respond to this argument.  However, the ALJ did not improperly consider
CR’s testimony.  
First, the ALJ’s conclusion about a toxic atmosphere was clearly
based on AZ’s testimony, not CR’s.  AZ
described the team environment as “toxic,” with coaches demeaning players,
mocking their weight, and using fitness as punishment.  AR 2442-43. 
Other teammates felt the same.  AR
2445.
Second, while CR did not observe any additional misconduct after
reporting to Dean Smith, the ALJ was entitled to consider CR’s testimony about the
repercussions CR felt from reporting. 
This included the fact that the demeanor of all coaches towards her
changed, and they stopped communicating with her.  AR 2348.  Gonzalez cut her playing time in half and did
not fulfill his promise to assist her in transferring to a four-year university.  AR 2343. 
CR transferred to a university in Louisiana to play soccer after the
coach received a reference from Gonzalez that was “not positive”.  AR 2355, 2389.   The ALJ was entitled to consider this
testimony.  See AR 1866-67.
 
4. The Weight of the Evidence
a. Pertinent Testimony
(i). Student Testimony
The
ALJ’s exclusion of testimony left only AZ, AJ, and to some extent CR, as the District’s
student witnesses.
 
AZ
AZ attended Cerritos from July 2017 until January 2020.   AR 2413. 
She testified to two instances concerning Gonzalez.
First, in the Summer of 2019, there was a District investigation
regarding a player who was alleged to be partying and having sexual
relationships with coaching staff during a yearly team trip in 2018.  AR 2418. 
During a team practice, one of the players mentioned she got a call from
an investigator and Gonzalez became angry and defensive.  AR 2419-20.  Gonzalez ordered: “Nobody from here on out is
to speak to any investigator.”  AR 2420.  Gonzalez pulled AZ and the other team captain
aside, telling them, “There’s no proof.  Do
they have photos? What do they want me to do, fire my own brother?” Gonzalez also
blamed the female students, stating that the players should not have been in
the room where the coaches were drinking. 
AR 2421.  AZ witnessed Gonzalez interrogating
each player individually about where the investigation came from.  AR 2422-23.  
Gonzalez ordered AZ and her fellow captain not to mention the
investigation or any sexual harassment allegations to any new players on the
team and, if they heard new players talking about it, they were to “shut it
down immediately.”  AR 2424.
Second, AZ and her teammate felt uncomfortable with Coach
Whitfield, who added players as friends on social media, drank shots with
players, made inappropriate comments, and threatened to cut playing time when
rejected.  AR 2425-26, 2431, 2433-34.  On a soccer trip across the country during the
Summer of 2019, AZ received inappropriate text messages from Whitfield after he
attempted to have her drink alcohol with him. 
AR 2434-36.  AZ felt she could not
report inappropriate behavior to Gonzalez based on his prior response to an
investigation.  AR 2437.  
            AZ
described the team environment as “toxic,” with coaches demeaning players,
mocking their weight, and using fitness as punishment.  AR 2442-43. 
AZ reported to the Title IX office. 
AR 2446.  She obtained Castro’s
guaranty of anonymity and told Castro about the inappropriate and toxic
behavior on the team.  AR 2447-48.  
On October 10, 2021, Castro had a meeting with the team about
the allegations being investigated.  AR
2452.  Following this meeting, MC screamed
at and accused AZ of reporting to Castro and threated to beat her up.  AR 2454. 
The confrontation lasted 30 seconds. 
AR 2492.  The whole team --
probably 16-20 players -- was present. 
AR 2493.  Other players were
shouting to calm MC down and holding her back. 
AR 2495.  Gonzalez was 10-15 feet
away when MC started yelling and he was two to three feet away when he opened
the gate.  AR 2453-54.  He did nothing to stop MC or correct what she
said.  AR 2454.  It was clear he knew what was going on.  AR 2497.
            
            AJ
            AJ
participated in the women’s soccer program in 2018 and 2019.  AR 3109.  AJ went on a road trip to Seattle in September
with the team where the coaches were intoxicated, and Gonzalez was present.  AR 3110, 3123.  AJ was accosted by Coach Whitfield who put his
hand on her leg under a table while they were drinking.  AR 3110. 
This made her uncomfortable, but she did not report it because she had
heard that nothing would happen and she would be retaliated against, such as
loss of playing time.  AR 3111-12.  AJ did not know if Gonzalez was aware of the
incident.  AR 3128.  
            AJ
was aware of an “app” which accused a Cerritos College player of sleeping with one
of the coaches.  AR 3114.  That player’s mother spoke to Gonzalez, who told
the players they needed to own up to sending the app.  AR 3114. 
If not, the police would be called and there would be an
investigation.  AR 3115.  They asked for the players phones to see if
they had downloaded the app.  AR 3115. Gonzalez
talked to the team and told them that the allegations were false.  AR 3118. 

Assistant Coach Ramirez flirted with players during practice.  AR 3119.  
Gonzalez was around but did not think anything of it.  AR 3119. 
            Gonzalez
never discouraged her from reporting or threatened loss of playing time.  AR 3134. 
 
            CR
            CR
attended Cerritos College from 2013 to 2015. 
After she reported to Dean Smith the events of the December 2013 soccer
trip, Gonzalez angrily confronted CR in front of the entire team, yelling that she
should not have reported anything to Dean Smith and that she should have come to
him first.  AR 2339-40. 
            After
CR’s report, the demeanor of all coaches towards her changed; they stopped
communicating with her.  AR 2348.  CR believes that Gonzalez cut her playing time
in half because she reported to Dean Smith, and also did not fulfill his
promise to assist her in transferring to a four-year university.  AR 2343. 
She transferred to a university in Louisiana to play soccer after the
coach received a reference from Gonzalez that was “not positive”.  AR 2355, 2389.
 
(ii). Gonzalez 
            Gonzalez
told players he had an open-door policy, and they could also talk to other
coaches, Castro (then team trainer), Human Resources, Title IX or whomever they
felt comfortable with.  AR 2943.  When Escorcia tried to blackmail him by threatening
to make misconduct allegations, Gonzalez reported it promptly to Title IX
Coordinator Raphael.  AR 2949.  The ensuing investigation ended by June 20,
2019, before the team’s 2019 Summer session.  AR 2949-55. 
Contrary to AZ’s testimony, Gonzalez did not tell anyone in the Summer of
2019 not to talk to investigators.  AR 2991,
3051. 
            Gonzalez
did not have a confrontation with CR about reporting to Dean Smith instead of
himself at a practice the week after the 2013 championship.  AR 2958. 
The championship was over and there was no practice.  AR 2958.  Neither Dean Smith, CR, nor anyone else ever
told Gonzalez about any such report.  AR 2957-58.
 
There were no repercussions against CR.  Based on the school game stats, CR played and
started in most games.  AR 2968-69.  Gonzalez gave an honest assessment of CR to
the Lafayette coach.  AR 2971.  Gonzalez recommended CR to coach at Bishop
Amat High School and also mentored her in her coaching.  AR 2975-77.  
            On
October 10, 2019, at 7:00 a.m. in the weight room, Castro told the team she was
conducting an investigation of allegations of misconduct.  AR 3006.  He was not present during the meeting because Castro
said she wanted to meet with the players alone. 
AR 3007.  Gonzalez waited until
all the players were out of the weight room and made sure the door was
closed.  AR 3009-10.  He walked to his car to drive to the gate
that the coaches usually go through.  AR
3010.  He went to and unlocked the gate,
unlocked and opened the bin and took out the practice equipment needed for that
day, and carried it 20 yards to the bench. 
AR 3010-11.  Then he walked to
open the gate for the student athletes on the other side of the field.  AR 3011. 
This process took 10-12 minutes.  AR 3013, 1834. 

            As
Gonzalez was about 50 yards away from the players gate – halfway across the
soccer field -- he heard what sounded like horseplay.  AR 3080-81.  As he got closer, it went silent within ten seconds.
 AR 3082.  That was unusual.  AR 3082. 
He did not question anyone about it at the time.  AR 3082. 
Later, Castro texted him that she wanted to see MC.  AR 3019-20.  He asked MC what’s going on?  AR 3020. 
MC said she did not know, and Gonzalez told MC to go see Castro.  AR 3020. 

At the end of practice, MC asked to speak to the team.  Gonzalez agreed, and MC apologized for
yelling at AZ.  AR 3020-21.  He asked and MC said she did not want to talk
about it.  AR 3021.  He then visited Castro, who said that MC
yelled at AZ because MC believed AZ caused the investigation.  AR 3021-22.  Gonzalez asked Castro if he should reach out
to AZ and Castro said she would handle it. AR 3023, 3087.  
            Gonzalez
never observed or received reports of players and coaches flirting but would
have reported it to the Title IX coordinator and the dean if he had.  AR 3049.  Gonzalez had never been disciplined for any
misconduct or given progressive discipline.  AR 3059-60.
 
            (iii).
Other Pertinent Testimony  
Gonzalez was aided by the testimony of Coach Ramirez, Coach
Marquez, and student OL.
            Coach Ramirez testified that she attended all practices from July
2019 through the end of the 2019 season, and Gonzalez did not do anything to
discourage the players from reporting any misconduct they experienced or
observed.  AR 2620.  She did not hear from anyone else that Gonzalez
did or said anything to discourage players from reporting or participating in
any investigation, or not to tell incoming freshman about any allegations or
investigation.  AR 2621.  She never heard Gonzalez tell AZ or any
captain to affirmatively put a stop to any discussions with incoming players
about allegations of misconduct or investigations.  AR 2622-23.  
Coach Marquez testified that CR was a very good player but had
some attitude issues about not coming out of games or not starting.  AR 2848-49.  He is not aware of CR ever reporting any
misconduct by anyone, and never observed Gonzalez scolding or admonishing her
regarding her having reported something about him.  AR 2849. 
He would have heard about it if it happened.  AR 2849-50.  Gonzalez was not a coach that would admonish a
player in front of other players.  AR 2851.
 Gonzalez encouraged players to talk to
Castro (when she was an athletic trainer) or one of the deans if there was an
issue that they did not feel comfortable discussing with a coach.  AR 2851-52.
OL testified that Gonzalez never did or said anything to
discourage players from reporting anything they had concerns about, and there
was no environment of fear where players were afraid to raise concerns or
problems.  AR 2767.  OL felt comfortable to talk to Gonzalez if she
had an issue or concerns.  AR 2768.  She and other players completed a three-hour
course on Title IX.  AR 2768. 
OL saw MC argue with AZ. 
AR 2777.  Castro had told the team
about an investigation, but she did not say what it was about.  AR 2780-81.  The team started in the weight room then
walked to the field.  AR 2820.  AZ and MC raised their voices to each other.  AR 2777. 
The players stood between MC and AZ to prevent any further altercation.  AR 2777, 2821-22.  AZ then grabbed her stuff and left.  AR 2777. 
Before the argument, Gonzalez left the team from the weight room
and drove around to go to the other side of the field and park.  AR 2820-21. 
The team waited by the back gate to the field for Gonzalez to unlock it.
AR 2821. Gonzalez was walking to the gate on the other side and did not see the
fight.  AR 2778. OL knows Gonzalez did
not observe the argument because she was looking around for coaches because she
did not want her teammates to get in trouble for fighting with each other. AR 2779-80.  OL is certain that Gonzalez arrived after AZ
had left. AR 2822–23, 2827.
 
b. Immoral Conduct
The courts have developed a broad and well-understood
definition of immoral conduct in teacher dismissal cases: “[...] that which is
hostile to the welfare of the general public and contrary to good morals.  Immorality has not been confined to sexual
matters, but included conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or indicative of
corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or
shameless conduct showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable
members of the community, and as an inconsiderate attitude toward good order
and public welfare.”  Palo Verde, supra,
9 Cal.App.3d at 971-72 (citation omitted). 
Based on this definition, a teacher’s falsification of attendance
records to add names of three students to secure continued employment was
deemed immoral conduct and dishonesty. Weiland, supra, 179
Cal.App.2d at 808.  Similarly, a
teacher’s removal of school property (a public address system speaker) from the
classroom wall was deemed immoral.  Palo
Verde, supra, 9 Cal.App.3d at 967.
The ALJ sustained the cause of immoral
conduct based on a single incident: “[Gonzalez] engaged in immoral conduct when
he failed to stop M.C. from threatening A.Z. after A.Z reported the
inappropriate behavior of coaching staff to Director Castro.”  AR 1893. 
The District only generally argues that it presented extensive
evidence demonstrating that Gonzalez engaged in and permitted sexual harassment
within the women’s soccer program.  The District
witnesses consistently testified, that Gonzalez engaged in sexual harassment
and openly allowed his assistant coaches to sexually harass female players.  The ALJ correctly determined that the
testimony of the District’s witness was:
 
“…consistent and established that: (1)
coaching staff would routinely flirt and romantically pursue the players; (2)
players believed that if they did anything that made the coaches unhappy, they
would lose playing time which would, in turn, affect their ability to be
recruited to other schools; and (3) Gonzalez discouraged players from reporting
any complaints to District administration.”  AR
1891-92.
 
The District
argues that the testimony of multiple witnesses consistently showed that Gonzalez
either participated in or tolerated inappropriate sexualized behavior toward
female student-athletes, including flirting, demeaning comments, and overt
sexual advances from both him and his coaching staff.  AR
2442-43 (AZ), 2347 (CR), 2053-54 (MT), 1991-92 (LS 1).  Witnesses LS 1 and LS 2 testified that Gonzalez
arranged for a “couples massage,” requiring both LS 1 and Gonzalez to be naked,
which made LS deeply uncomfortable.  AR 196.  This behavior clearly falls under immoral
conduct, as it reflects a willful disregard for the boundaries expected of a
coach in a professional setting.  Opp. at
15.
The record also
clearly establishes that Gonzalez confronted women on multiple occasions when
they reported sexual misconduct and that he directly interfered with
investigations of sexual misconduct.  CR
testified that Gonzalez yelled at her in front of the entire team in 2014, and MT remembered two situations where Gonzalez
was upset with players who made reports about sexual misconduct to the college.
 AZ
testified that Gonzalez angrily directed the team not to participate in an
investigation pertaining to allegations of sexual harassment in 2019, and AJ testified that Gonzalez demanded
that players turn over their phones so he could search through them in the same
period.  Gonzalez’s
conduct in yelling at and intimidating women who report sexual harassment is
immoral conduct.  Gonzalez’s conduct in
directly interfering with investigations of sexual harassment also constitutes
immoral conduct as it is indicative of corruption and indecency, and an
inconsiderate attitude toward good order and the public welfare.  See Weiland, supra, 179
Cal.App.2d at 811.  Opp. at 15.
There are two problems with the District’s
argument.  First, the District wrongly
relies on the excluded testimony of MT, LS 1, and LS 2.  Second, the District relies on evidence from
witnesses that are irrelevant to the ALJ’s specific finding of immoral conduct,
which is that Gonzalez failed to stop MC from threatening AZ after AZ
reported the inappropriate behavior of coaching staff to Castro.  AR 1893. 
The testimony of CR and AZ that Gonzalez instructed players not to
report does not bear on this finding.
Gonzalez adds that it is far from clear as
to where he was when the altercation between MC and AZ occurred.  OL, Castro, Gonzalez and the maps and photos
indicate he was not there.  AZ’s own
5.5-minute timeline supports that conclusion.  Even if he was near enough to hear more than
noise, AZ’s account shows there was noise and multiple voices yelling, and there
is no reliable evidence about what Gonzalez actually heard and understood from the
30-second altercation.  AZ testified that
MC threatened to “beat your ass” at a time when Gonzalez was at least 15 feet
away, behind a heavy and tall steel gate. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 9.
Gonzalez notes that the District did not
call any other players to corroborate AZ’s testimony, which should have been
looked upon with suspicion.  Evid. Code
§412.  Gonzalez testified that he heard
some commotion when he got close to the gate, but it ended in ten seconds as he
got closer. As OL indicated, the players would not want to be caught by a coach
fighting with each other.  Even if he was
just two to three feet behind the gate, there is no reliable evidence that he heard
and understood the significance of what MC was yelling, let alone that she was
threatening AZ, or that he could do anything to stop it while he was walking up
to and unlocking a heavy gate and chain.  In fact, Raphael said she coached Gonzalez not
to intervene in such situations. Thus, the ALJ’s finding that “Gonzalez failed
to stop MC from threatening AZ” is not sustained by the evidence.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9-10.
The court agrees that it has not been proven
that Gonzalez heard the details of the confrontation between MC and AZ – in
particular, MC’s threat against AZ for reporting.  This fact does not absolve Gonzalez, however,
because he clearly heard something. 
Moreover, he admitted that what sounded like horseplay (AR 3080-81) got silent
within ten seconds as he grew closer, which was unusual.  AR 3082. 
Yet, he did not question anyone about it at the time.  AR 3082. 

Gonzalez is wrong to argue that Title IX Coordinator Raphael coached
him to do nothing in this situation.  To
the contrary, Raphael testified that the head coach has a duty to take action if
a player, after reporting improper conduct, is confronted by her
teammates.   AR 2700.  The head coach has a variety of options, and
Raphael hoped the coach would share it with her as soon as he became aware of
it.  AR 2700.  Raphael coaches head coaches to report
retaliation to her for Title IX reporting, and also coaches them to not
intervene in any altercation between players as it may make matters worse.  AR 2700-01. 

Thus, Gonzalez had a duty to take action, and he should have at
least inquired about what was happening in the unusual incident.  He then should have informed Raphael when he
learned MC was threatening AZ for reporting. 
Raphael testified that, if Castro told Gonzalez that she would handle the
situation, he would be correct to follow that direction.  AR 2711. 
But Castro did not do so.  She only
told Gonzalez that she would handle the issue of whether AZ wanted to return to
the team, which occurred sometime later. 
AR 3023, 3087.  
In sum, Gonzalez failed to handle the matter
appropriately.  Was his failure immoral
conduct?  Gonzalez is correct that the
answer is no.  As he argues, it is
overreaching to label as immoral conduct Gonzalez’s failure to stop an
altercation that ended in 30 seconds, for which he was not present, and where
it is unclear that he heard and understood the words said.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10-11.
Moreover, the ALJ’s finding was that Gonzalez failed to stop MC
from threatening AZ, not that he failed to take action by reporting the matter
to Raphael.  There is no evidence that
Gonzalez was present in sufficient time to stop the threat.  To the contrary, OL testified that she was
looking around for coaches and Gonzalez, who was walking to the gate on the
other side, was not present for the fight.  AR 2778-80, AR 2822–23, 2827.  While Gonzalez should have taken action, it
was not physically possible for him to stop MC from making the threat.[3]
The finding of immoral conduct is not supported by the weight of
the evidence.
 
c. Unfitness for Service
Evident unfitness for service in section
87732(d) means “clearly not fit, not adapted to or unsuitable for teaching,
ordinarily by reason of temperamental defects or inadequacies.’”  Woodland, supra, 2 Cal.App.4th at
1444.  Conduct constituting evident
unfitness for service will often constitute unprofessional conduct.  Id. at 1445.  For a school district to meet this charge, it
must demonstrate satisfaction of the Morrison factors and take the
additional step of showing that the unfitness is “evident,” meaning that the
offensive conduct is caused by a defect in temperament.  Ibid. 
In Morrison,
supra, 1 Cal.3d at 214, the California Supreme Court articulated factors
to consider in whether a credentialed employee’s misconduct renders him unfit
for service as a teacher.  Those factors
are: (a) likelihood that the conduct at issue may have adversely affected
students/fellow teachers; (b) degree of such adversity anticipated; (c)
proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct; (d) type of teaching
certificate held by the party involved; (e) extenuating or aggravating
circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct; (f) likelihood of recurrence of
the questioned conduct; (g) praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of motives
resulting in the conduct; (h) extent to which disciplinary action may inflict
an adverse impact or chilling effect upon constitutional rights of the teacher
involved or other teachers.  Id.
at 229-30.  Not every Morrison
factor must be considered; a trier of fact may consider all of the factors that
are relevant to the respective case.  Ibid.;
West Valley-Mission College v. Concepcion, (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1766,
1777.
“[T]he term ‘evident unfitness for
service’ should not be given a definite technical meaning and a court should
not arbitrarily find that it is subsumed under some set formula….”  Oakland Unified School Dist. v. Olicker,
(1972) 25 Cal. App. 3d 1098, 1108 (citations omitted).  Before an inference can be drawn that conduct
renders a teacher evidently unfit to teach, it is necessary to show “a relationship between that conduct
and the functioning of defendant as a teacher.” Id. at 1109.
The ALJ considered the Morrison
factors and found that Gonzalez permitted a toxic environment where players
were subjected to flirtatious or abusive behavior by coaches and where players
were afraid to report misconduct for fear of retaliation.  AR 1896. 
This conduct continued to at least 2019. 
As head coach, Gonzalez had significant authority over the players,
including their playing time and transfer to four-year schools.  AR 1896. 
This conduct was blameworthy and had no extenuating circumstances.   AR 1896. 
Gonzalez is likely to repeat his behavior as he has received Title IX
training since 2016 with no effect.  See
AR 1896.  The imposition of
discipline will not affect any of Gonzalez’s constitutional rights and there
has been some notoriety of the conduct through social media.  AR 1896. 

After considering the Morrison
factors, the ALJ concluded that there is a factual nexus between Gonzalez’
conduct and a finding of his unfitness for service.   AR 1897. 
The testimony supporting this charge is as follows.
 
AZ
AZ testified to two instances concerning Gonzalez.  In the Summer of 2019, there was a District
investigation regarding a player who was alleged to be partying and having
sexual relationships with coaching staff during a yearly team trip in 2018.  AR 2418. 
During a team practice, one of the players mentioned she got a call from
an investigator, and Gonzalez became angry and defensive.  AR 2419-20.  Gonzalez ordered: “Nobody from here on out is
to speak to any investigator.”  AR 2420.  Gonzalez pulled AZ and the other team captain
aside, telling them, “There’s no proof.  Do
they have photos? What do they want me to do, fire my own brother?” Gonzalez also
blamed the female students, stating that the players should not have been in
the room where the coaches were drinking. 
AR 2421.  AZ witnessed Gonzalez interrogating
each player individually about where the investigation came from.  AR 2422-23.  
Gonzalez ordered AZ and her fellow captain not to mention the
investigation or any sexual harassment allegations to any new players on the
team and, if they heard new players talking about it, they were to “shut it
down immediately.”  AR 2424.
            As
discussed ante, Gonzalez failed to take action when MC screamed at and
accused AZ of reporting to Castro and threated to beat her up.  AR 2454. 
It was clear he knew what was going on. 
AR 2497.
            AZ
described the team environment as “toxic,” with coaches demeaning players,
mocking their weight, and using fitness as punishment.  AR 2442-43. 

 
            AJ
            AJ
went on a road trip to Seattle in September with the team where the coaches
were intoxicated, and Gonzalez was present. 
AR 3110, 3123.  AJ was accosted by
Coach Whitfield who put his hand on her leg under a table while they were
drinking.  AR 3110.  This made her uncomfortable, but she did not
report it because she had heard that nothing would happen and she would be
retaliated against, such as loss of playing time.  AR 3111-12. 
AJ did not know if Gonzalez was aware of the incident.  AR 3128. 

            AJ
was aware of an “app” which accused a Cerritos College player of sleeping with one
of the coaches.  AR 3114.  That player’s mother spoke to Gonzalez, who told
the players they needed to own up to sending the app.  AR 3114. 
If not, the police would be called, and there would be an
investigation.  AR 3115.  They asked for the players phones to see if
they had downloaded the app.  AR 3115. Gonzalez
talked to the team at a team practice and told them that the allegations were
false.  AR 3118.  
Assistant Coach Ramirez flirted with players during practice.  AR 3119.  
Gonzalez was around but did not think anything of it.  AR 3119. 
 
            CR
After CR reported the events of the December
2013 soccer trip to Dean Smith, Gonzalez angrily confronted CR in front of the
entire team, yelling at her that she should not have reported anything to Dean
Smith and that she should have come to him first.  AR 2339-40. 
After CR’s report, the demeanor of all coaches towards her changed; they
stopped communicating with her.  AR 2348.
 
Gonzalez argues that there is no evidence
that he has a defect in temperament or a fixed character trait that could not
be remediated.  The ALJ did not identify
any such trait and her finding rests primarily on Gonzalez’s mere presence at
incidents that are not indicative of his knowledge or intent.  AZ claimed Gonzalez “was present” and “in the
same vicinity” when Coach Memo flirted with another player (AR 2522), but even
she was not paying attention to all they said (AR 2526), and she did not know
if Gonzalez actually observed anything (AR 2527).  The ALJ found that “A.J. observed … coaches
and players regularly flirting during practice... Though [Gonzalez] attended
practices, A.J. noted he did nothing to stop the flirting”.  AR 1873. 
However, AJ testified that she only saw AR flirt with players and could
not say Gonzalez saw it.  AR 3119.  The ALJ essentially dismissed Gonzalez merely
for being present at incidents.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 12.
Further, the ALJ misapplied the Morrison
factors to the facts.  The ALJ mainly
focused on the likelihood of recurrence because Gonzalez received some Title IX
training (without evidence of what that training included) and was likely to
repeat his conduct.  AR 1896. That does
not logically follow.  Pet. Op. Br. at
12.
The ALJ agreed that Gonzalez had no previous
discipline and was not given any progressive discipline.  AR 1889.  Gonzalez reported the Escorcia allegations in
2018-19, followed the dean’s direction to investigate player bullying in 2019,
supported the District’s Title IX investigations, and sought to follow up with
AZ but was told that Raphael would handle it.  Gonzalez also attested to steps he would take
to improve communication, compliance and reporting.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12-13.
The ALJ ignored that the fact that CR, AJ,
and AZ all testified they did not know what misconduct Gonzalez observed.  The only evidence that players were prevented
from reporting was hearsay.  AZ was not
deterred from reporting anything and no witness testified that they were
prevented by Gonzalez’s conduct from reporting any improper conduct.  OL, AJ, Marquez, Castro, Raphael, and Ramirez all
testified that were not aware that Gonzalez did anything to deter reporting of
misconduct.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
The ALJ’s statements that “Gonzalez had the
ability to grant and reduce playing time and was instrumental in assisting
players to transition to four-year schools” and that “these decisions were not
subject to any oversight or review” does not support her conclusion that
he is unfit.  Gonzalez does not differ
from other head coaches by having the ability to affect players’ playing time
or to help them transfer to four-year schools. 
That fact is not evidence that he abused his power.  The ALJ conceded that the District failed to establish
the charge of persistent failure to obey school rules and laws.  Coupled with the lack of progressive
discipline, the ALJ should have found that the District failed to show any
“fixed trait.”  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
Further, Gonzalez’s oversight of assistant
coaches is only one small part of his coaching duties, and not any part of his
regular faculty assignment.  Gonzalez did
not commit any misconduct in teaching regular classes outside of coaching
soccer, and this is evidence of his fitness and unlikelihood of repeating the
questioned conduct.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
The court does not agree. 
AZ described the team environment as toxic.  AZ testified to two instances of misconduct
by Gonzalez, one in which Gonzalez affirmatively prevented players from
speaking to an investigator and one where he failed to take action in response
to MC’s threat to AZ for reporting.  
AJ testified to a road trip to Seattle where the coaches were
intoxicated, and Gonzalez was present.  AR
3110, 3123.  AJ was aware of an “app”
which accused a Cerritos College player of sleeping with one of the coaches.  AR 3114.  Gonzalez talked to the team at a team practice
and told them that the allegations were false. 
AR 3118.  There is an inference
that he made this statement to discourage reporting.  Finally, Coach Ramirez flirted with players
during practice and Gonzalez was around but did not think anything of it.  AR 3119. 
Finally, after CR reported the events of the
December 2013 soccer trip to Dean Smith, Gonzalez angrily confronted CR in
front of the entire team, yelling at her that she should not have reported
anything to Dean Smith and that she should have come to him first.  AR 2339-40. 
After CR’s report, the demeanor of all coaches towards her changed; they
stopped communicating with her.  AR 2348.
The ALJ accurately stated that, although AJ and AZ were on the
team together for a period in 2019 and knew each other, they were not friends.  AR 1891. 
Their testimonies regarding the environment at Cerritos College were
consistent and established that (1) coaching staff would routinely flirt and
romantically pursue the players, (2) players believed that if they did anything
that made the coaches unhappy, they would lose playing time which would affect
their ability to be recruited to other schools, and (3) Gonzalez discouraged
players from reporting complaints to District administration.  AR 1891-92. 

Although the ALJ never identified a fixed character trait, the
District is correct that Gonzalez’s conduct reveals a fixed character trait of
disregard for the well-being and safety of student athletes under his
supervision.  Opp. at 17.  Contrary to Gonzalez’s claims, his work as a
soccer coach is part of his assignment as a faculty member; he issued grades to
women on the soccer team and testified that he teaches soccer.  AR
2455-57.  Gonzalez’s pattern of allowing
inappropriate sexual behavior and discouraging reporting meets this definition
in that it harmed students and the community.  
As the District argues, Gonzalez’s failure to take
responsibility for his actions further supports the finding that he is unfit
for service.  Gonzalez not only denied
any wrongdoing but also deflected responsibility onto his players and coaching
staff.  This lack of accountability
demonstrates that he is unable to adhere to the ethical standards required of
an educator and coach.  See Opp.
at 17.  Gonzalez’s misconduct spanned the
four-year period and is an aggravating factor.  His retaliation towards those who reported
abuse reflects an unfitness for service that cannot be remedied through
disciplinary warnings or lesser measures. 
Opp. at 17.
The ALJ’s finding of cause for evident
unfitness for service -- meaning that the offensive conduct is caused by a
defect in temperament -- is supported by the weight of the evidence. 
 
d. Dishonesty
Dishonesty indicates a “lack of
honesty or integrity;” a “disposition to defraud or deceive.”
(https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/) “Dishonesty necessarily includes
the element of bad faith.” Small v. Smith, supra, 16 Cal.App.3d at
456. “[I]t means fraud, deception, betrayal, faithlessness; an absence of
integrity; a disposition to cheat, deceive or defraud; deceive and
betray.”  Ibid. “Dishonest conduct
may range from the smallest fib to the most flagrant lie. Not every impropriety
will constitute immoral or unprofessional conduct, and not every falsehood will
constitute ‘dishonesty’ as a ground for discipline.” Fontana Unified School
Dist. v. Burman, supra, 45 Cal.3d at 220, n. 12.
The ALJ ruled
that the District could not backdoor testimony excluded under the four-year
rule to sustain a cause for dishonesty.  “Many
of the District’s allegations … are related to conduct … before the four-year
period. To the extent District did not prove the misconduct, the District also
failed to establish that Gonzalez was dishonest when denying [it].”  AR 1894.
The District
argues that multiple witnesses testified that Gonzalez not only knew about the
inappropriate behavior, but actively participated in covering it up and
discouraging players from reporting it. 
This includes Gonzalez’s attempt to dissuade CR from reporting
misconduct to the administration by confronting her angrily after she went to Dean
Smith instead of reporting to him directly.  AR
2339-40.  It includes AZ’s testimony that
Gonzalez became visibly upset during the summer of 2019 when players were
contacted by District investigators regarding sexual harassment allegations.  Even LS 1 remembered a meeting with Gonzalez where
such comments were discussed as inappropriate. AR
1964-65.  Gonzalez’s even acknowledged that
there had been previous sexual misconduct allegations concerning the team
(which he concluded were false).  AR 3074. 
Opp. at 16.
Yet, Gonzalez
consistently denied any knowledge of allegations of sexual misconduct occurring
within the program.  AR 3070 (Gonzalez never heard complaints about
his assistant coaches during trips).  Gonzalez
also made false statements during the investigation as he repeatedly denied any
knowledge of the ongoing misconduct. These denials directly conflict with the
consistent and credible testimony from other witnesses, establishing a clear
basis for dismissal on the grounds of dishonesty under section 87732(b).  Opp. at 16.
As Gonzalez
argues (Reply at 10), the District’s
argument that he can be terminated for denying the incidents that are more than
four years old is an effort to end-run around the four-year rule. The argument
is circular, as it would render the entire statutory provision
meaningless.  Reply at 8.  As for the testimony of CR and AZ, the
District only offered evidence that Gonzalez was present when these witnesses observed
or experienced harassment.  Gonzalez
discouraged reporting but did not acknowledge that sexual harassment had
occurred.  Therefore, the contention he knew
of sexual harassment and falsely denied it is speculative.  
The weight of
the evidence supports the ALJ’s determination that the District did not
establish the cause of dishonesty.
 
5. Witness
Credibility
Gonzalez
argues that the ALJ made unfounded and contradictory credibility determinations
for key witnesses without complying with the requirements of Govt. Code section
11425.50(b) to properly justify those determinations.  The ALJ gave CR, AZ, and AJ the benefit of the
doubt as to their recollection due to the passage of time but withheld that benefit
from OL.  AR 1891, 1875.  The ALJ said AZ had no motive to lie, but she
blamed Gonzalez for not realizing her dream of playing Division 1 soccer.  The ALJ ignored the contradiction between AZ’s
testimony that Gonzalez was two to three feet away when MC was yelling and Castro’s
testimony that AZ told her, immediately after the incident, that Gonzalez was
“on the outskirts” about to open the gate.  The ALJ ignored AJ’s motive to fabricate
because AJ believed Gonzalez had reneged on a commitment to pay for her CT scan
and she blamed him for her problems with class enrollments.  AR 3131–33.  The ALJ disregarded the fact that OL had no
motive to fabricate her testimony.  The
ALJ improperly considered CR’s testimony in determining Gonzalez’s credibility.
 AR 1892.  The ALJ unfairly misconstrued and discounted Gonzalez’s
testimony about CR.  AR 1892.  The ALJ accepted Gonzalez’s testimony that he
had CR coach high school soccer to motivate her (AR 1887), but then erroneously
concluded that doing so was inconsistent with him telling the Lafayette coach
she was lazy.  Finally, the ALJ
ignored the contradictions to CR’s claims of retaliatory treatment, including Rodriguez’s
testimony.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
Government Code section 11425.50(b)
(“section 11425.50(b)”) provides in pertinent part:
 
“(b)... If the factual basis for the
decision includes a determination based substantially on the credibility of a
witness, the statement shall identify any specific evidence of the observed
demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness that supports the determination,
and on judicial review the court shall give great weight to the determination
to the extent the determination identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or
attitude of the witness that supports it.” 
 



Section 11425.50(b) is based on the premise
that the trier-of-fact who viewed the live testimony is better able to judge
their credibility than a reviewing court operating from a “cold record.”  Guymon v. Board of Accountancy, (1976)
55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1015.  Despite
section 11425.50(b), California fixes responsibility for factual determinations
subject to independent judicial review with the trial court rather than the
administrative agency as a matter of public policy.  Id. at 1015.  The court has an independent duty to evaluate
witness credibility.  See Long
Beach Civil Service Commission, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 652, 658; Guymon,
supra, 55 Cal.App.3d at 1011-12. 
Section 11425.50(b) only requires a court to give great weight to an
administrative presiding officer’s credibility determination only “to the
extent the determination identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude
of the witness that supports it.”  No
deference is required where the presiding officer’s determination is based
substantially on witness credibility, but there is no reference to the
presiding officer’s observation of the demeanor, manner, or attitude of the
witness.  California Youth Authority
v. State Personnel Board, (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 595-96 (great weight
not accorded to ALJ credibility determination where decision never identified
any observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of witnesses and relied only on
inferences from evidence to determine credibility).  
The credibility issues raised by Gonzalez do
not significantly bear on the court’s decision. 
The ALJ made no credibility findings based on demeanor or attitude and
her findings are not entitled to great weight. 
The court has credited the testimony of all witnesses who had direct
observations – including AZ, AJ, and CR -- and has given less credit to
conclusions or general observations. 
There are some contradictions in witness accounts and the court has construed
them to reach the conclusions stated ante.
 

F. Conclusion
Both Petitions are denied. 
The District’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve
it on Petitioner’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service
for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit
the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for December 17,
2024 at 9:30 a.m.
