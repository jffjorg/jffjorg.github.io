And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge (ALJ) has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Gonzalez, a plaintiff, against the District, a defendant. The case concerns the District's handling of complaints, which the ALJ found were not taken seriously. The ALJ defined moral turpitude and unprofessional conduct, and found that the District's actions were immoral, but not necessarily dishonest or a persistent violation of laws or regulations. Gonzalez argues that the findings are inconsistent, but the ALJ maintains that they are not, and that the reasoning does not preclude a finding of immoral conduct where the conduct is not unprofessional or a persistent violation. The case will proceed to a future hearing.
