ANALYSIS
 
I.          Requests
for Admission  
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . .
by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.010.)  “Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
When a party fails to serve a timely
response to requests for admission “[t]he party to whom the request was
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc § 2033.280(a).) “The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The court
shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated [the] motion.” Ibid.

Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides
that a misuse of the discovery process is “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery
process includes “[m]aking or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery.”   “The court may impose a monetary sanction
against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct” under Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).  A court has discretion to fix the amount of
reasonable monetary sanctions.  Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.
 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion to deem
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission served on Defendant as admitted, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Christina Cicione (“Cicione”) declares that her office served
Defendant with Requests for Admission, Set One, via electronic service on April
14, 2023. Cicione Decl., ¶ 2 and Exhibit A. Plaintiff has not received
responses and Defendant’s counsel has not communicated regarding the past due
responses. Id., ¶ 3. 
Counsel’s hourly rate is $300.00 per
hour and she has incurred two (2) hours of attorney time to bring the motion. Id.,
¶ 4. A filing fee of $60.00 was incurred for the motion. Id.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $660.00 against
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record, DLA Piper LLC, jointly and
severally. Id. 
The Court finds that Defendant has
failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One. Therefore,
the Court finds that the matters therein shall be deemed admitted pursuant to Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.280(b). Also, the motion is unopposed which creates an
inference that the motion has merit. Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410. 
As to the issue of monetary sanctions,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount
of $660.00 is unreasonable. Given that the motion is unopposed and the relative
brevity and straightforward nature of the motion, the Court finds that monetary
sanctions in the amount of $360.00 is reasonable. This amount represents one
(1) hour of work on the motion as well as the $60.00 filing fee. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            In sum, Plaintiff’s motion for an order deeming
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted is GRANTED.   
 
            Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Monetary sanctions in the amount of $360.00 are
to be paid by Defendant and Defendant’s counsel, DLA Piper LLC, jointly and
severally, to Plaintiff within 30 days of notice of the Court’s order. 
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
