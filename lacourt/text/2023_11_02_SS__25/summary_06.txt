And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside the entry of default against Ping Dominguez. The motion is based on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The Judge finds that the Defendant's mistake was reasonable, as she grew up in China and does not speak English fluently. Therefore, the Judge grants the motion and orders the Defendant to file a separate noticed answer within 20 days.
