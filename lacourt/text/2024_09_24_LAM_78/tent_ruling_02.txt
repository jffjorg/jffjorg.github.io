 Case Number:  23STCV16433    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ ANA MADRID, et al., Plaintiff(s), vs. GUILLERMO CERVANTEZ, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.:¿ 23STCV16433 Hearing Date:¿ September 24, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL DISCOVERY RESPONSES  I.  BACKGROUND Plaintiff Ana Madrid (“Plaintiff Madrid”) served on in pro per defendant Guillermo Cervantez (“Defendant Guillermo”) form interrogatories, set one, on April 22, 2024. (Decl. Brinton, ¶ 2; Exh. A.) To date, Defendant Guillermo has not served responses despite counsel’s office repeatedly calling and writing to him. (Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff Madrid therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant Guillermo to respond to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. Any opposition was due on or before September 11, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.   II.  MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) Because the evidence shows Defendant Guillermo was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Defendant Guillermo has not opposed the motion demonstrating otherwise. Plaintiff Madrid’s motion is therefore GRANTED. Defendant Guillermo is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff Madrid’s form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP §2030.290(a),(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c)). Defendant Guillermo did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a).  Plaintiff Madrid seek sanctions in the amount of $600 for 1 hour preparing the motion, and 0.5 hours to attend the hearing, at the rate of $400 per hour. The request is granted. Defendant Guillermo is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff Madrid, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $600, within twenty (20) days.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: September 23, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
