The defendant failed to respond to the requests despite proper service and repeated attempts by the plaintiff's counsel to contact him. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond waived any objections he may have had and ordered him to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 15 days. The judge also awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $600, to be paid within 20 days.
