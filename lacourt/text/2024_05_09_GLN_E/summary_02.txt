And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court rules that the Plaintiffs' Motions to Compel Responses to Discovery Requests are GRANTED. The Court finds that the Defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests served on August 29, 2023. The Court orders the Defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to the Plaintiffs' Requests for Production of Documents, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Admissions within 10 calendar days of the Court's order. The Court also grants the Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One, subject to the payment of an additional filing fee. The Court warns that all motions must provide sufficient notice to the Defendant. The Court will hear from counsel on the issue of sanctions.
