And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling denying Defendant KVA Investments LLC's motion to expunge the lis pendens filed by Plaintiff George Gabriel and others. The lis pendens relates to a property located at 1007 16th Street, Santa Monica, CA 90403. The Defendant argued that the pleading does not contain a real property claim and that the Plaintiff cannot establish the probable validity of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the Court found that the Plaintiff sufficiently alleged a real property claim and a quiet title claim against the Defendant.

The dispute centers around the Defendant's claim of title ownership, which was allegedly obtained through fraud. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant obtained title to the property through a conspiracy with Co-Defendant Brian Dozier, who fraudulently represented that the many different encumbrances against the property would ultimately be nullified and the property would be returned to the Plaintiff's ownership. The Court found that the Plaintiff sufficiently alleged fraud in the Defendant's obtaining title to the property and that the Defendant's claim of title ownership is invalid.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff presented evidence to directly dispute the Defendant's interest in the property without having to claim a conspiracy between the Defendant and Dozier. Therefore, the motion to expunge the lis pendens is denied.
