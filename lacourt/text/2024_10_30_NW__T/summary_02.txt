The judge has issued a tentative ruling on various motions in limine filed by both the plaintiff and defendant. The judge has granted several of the motions, including those to exclude evidence or testimony related to settlement negotiations, arbitration, attorney fees, and financial condition. The judge has also granted motions to exclude certain references, such as those to the defendant's bad reputation, VW's advertising and marketing materials, and the plaintiff's expectations of the vehicle. The judge has denied one motion, which sought to exclude mentions of one-time complaints. The judge has also ruled that expert testimony from lay witnesses will be excluded, and that evidence not produced in discovery will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The judge has emphasized that all rulings on motions in limine will apply equally to all parties, counsel, and witnesses, and that counsel are required to advise their clients and witnesses of these court rulings.
