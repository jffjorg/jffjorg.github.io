And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is granting Plaintiff George Gabriel's motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories Set One, Request for Production of Documents Set One, and to compel appearance at deposition. The Judge orders Defendant Brian Dozier to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days and pay $1,300.00 in monetary sanctions for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The Judge also orders Defendant Dozier to provide verified answers in code-compliant language and produce documents without objections within 20 days and pay $1,300.00 in monetary sanctions. Additionally, the Judge orders Defendant Dozier to appear for deposition and produce documents without objections on November 19, 2024, and pay $2,225.00 in monetary sanctions. The Judge finds that Defendant Dozier failed to act with substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions unjust, and therefore imposes monetary sanctions on Defendant Dozier.
