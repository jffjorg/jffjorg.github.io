And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the discovery motions filed by the parties. The judge has granted some of the plaintiff's requests for discovery, including requests for documents related to the subject vehicle, contact between the defendant and the plaintiff, and written or recorded statements from any person concerning the subject vehicle. The judge has also granted requests for specific information, such as the model year of the plaintiff's vehicle and the same year and model BMW in Southern California.

The judge has denied some of the plaintiff's requests as overbroad or vague, including requests for documents that are not specifically related to the subject vehicle or the plaintiff's complaints. The judge has also denied some requests as duplicative or irrelevant.

The judge has stricken all general objections filed by the defendant, as they are not allowed by code. The judge has also overruled the defendant's objections to individual responses to discovery requests.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to respond to the tentative ruling.
