Introduction 
Plaintiff George Gabriel, as
successor trustee, (Plaintiff) moved to compel initial responses from
Defendant/Doe 1 Brian Dozer (Defendant) as to Form Interrogatories, Set One
(FI), Request for Production of Documents, Set One (RPD), and to compel attendance
at the Deposition (Depo).  All three
motions requested monetary sanctions against Defendant:  $2,925.00 (FI); $1,950.00 (RPD); and
$4,105.00 (Depo).  Defendant’s
opposition  was due October 17, 2024 and
none was filed.  On October 22, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to all discovery motions.
Discussion 
A party that has not received
timely responses to written interrogatories and requests for production is
entitled to an order compelling responses without objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2030.290, 2031.300.)  A motion to compel initial discovery
responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing,
and need not be accompanied by a separate statement.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac.
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  Plaintiff provided that the FI and RPD were
served on July 2, 2024 and to date responses have not been received.  (Bobby Benjy Decl. pars. 3-5, and 11 (FI) and
pars. 3-5, and 14 (RPD).)  Because
responses have not been received or shown to be served, the two motions
presented good cause for the requested relief. 

Both motions to compel responses
to FI and RPD are GRANTED.  
The Court is authorized to compel
the deposition of a party if, after service of a deposition notice, a party to
the action without having served a valid objection, fails to appear for
examination.  The moving party must show
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution.  The moving party must show specific facts to
support good cause justifying the production of any document, electronically
stored information or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2025.450.)  Plaintiff served the Depo Notice that
included 149 requests for documents and separately emailed Defendant to remind
him of the Depo.  Plaintiff provided good
cause for the document demands in that the document requests related to the
allegations in the First Amended Complaint and defenses in the Answer.  Defendant responded and refused to appear
without counsel, wherein Plaintiff re-asserted their right to the Depo.  Plaintiff submitted that Defendant failed to
appear.  (Benjy Decl. pars. 3-7, and
10.)  Because Defendant failed to appear
and produce, the Depo Motion is persuasive.
The Motion to Compel the Depo is
GRANTED.  
Sanctions shall be imposed unless
the Court finds that the responding party acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of a sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2030.290(c) and
2031.300(c) and 2025.450(g)(1).) 
Plaintiff presented sufficient facts to show the reasonableness of the
$650 hourly rate charged but the 4.5 hours expended for the FI Motion and 3
hours expended for RPD Motion and 4.9 hours expended for the Depo Motion are
unreasonable, especially when no opposition was filed.  The Court reduces the time charged to 2 hours
each for the FI, RPD, Depo Motions. 
Plaintiff further requested $920 for court reporter expenses in the Depo
Motion.  The Court finds the court
reporter expenses to be reasonable. 
Defendant failed to present facts to show that they acted with
substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions unjust.  Monetary sanctions for the FI Motion and the
RPD Motion are reduced to $1,300.00 each. 
Monetary sanctions for the Depo Motion is reduced to $2,225.00, which
includes the $920 court reporter fees.
Monetary sanctions are GRANTED
against Defendant in the amount of $1,300.00 for the FI Motion, $1,300.00 for
the RPD Motion, and  $2,225.00 for the
Depo Motion.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
