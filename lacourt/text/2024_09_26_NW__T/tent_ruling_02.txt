 Case Number:  24VECV03817    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV03817 Chakon v Lee-TysonTentative ruling: Motions to quash:  Lucas Lee-Tyson states in his declaration under oath that he does not live at or lease 19333 Rosita St. Tarzana, CA.  Therefore, he has admitted under oath that he has no right to possession.  Mr. Lee-Tyson could sign a stipulation to relieve himself of the right to possession.  Otherwise, if not willing to do so, then the court will presume he does claim a right to possession, in which case the substitute service is proper.  Either he is in possession, in which case sub-service is proper, or he is not in possession.  He cannot have it both ways. If unwilling to disavow the right to possession, the court denies the motion to quash.  Response to complaint by defendant Lee-Tyson due within 5 days.As to Jordan Marksberry, the same reasoning applies to him. The court also notes that as to the proof of service on the Marksberry motion, there is no such address as 14300 Newport Ave #5, LOS ANGELES, CA 90028.  This would be grounds to deny the motion.  The court denies the motion to quash.  Response to complaint by defendant Marksberry due within 5 days.
Mason McFadden’s and Donnie Crawford’s motion to quash is moot as there is no proof of service filed as to them.  There is nothing to quash.
