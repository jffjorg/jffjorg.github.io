And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering motions to quash filed by Lucas Lee-Tyson, Jordan Marksberry, and others. The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented and has made the following determinations. Lucas Lee-Tyson has admitted under oath that he does not live at or lease the address listed in the complaint, which means he has no right to possession. The Judge is giving Lee-Tyson the opportunity to sign a stipulation to relieve himself of this right, but if he is unwilling to do so, the Judge will presume he still claims a right to possession and will deny the motion to quash. Similarly, Jordan Marksberry's address was found to be invalid, which would be grounds to deny the motion to quash. The Judge denies the motion to quash for both Lee-Tyson and Marksberry. The motion to quash filed by Mason McFadden and Donnie Crawford is moot because no proof of service was filed, so there is nothing to quash. The Judge orders the defendants to respond to the complaint within 5 days.
