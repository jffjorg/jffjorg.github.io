And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion for an order to permit appraisal and inspection of a real property located at 30200 Agoura Road, Suite 110, Agoura Hills, CA 91301 owned by the defendant is continued. The defendant has not appeared in the action, and as such, the defendant is not entitled to service of notice or papers. The judge is concerned about providing the defendant with an opportunity to be heard, especially since the relief requested by the plaintiff is for an order to enter upon the defendant's property. Due to the uncertainty of the defendant's address, the motion should be hand delivered to the defendant and the defendant's agent's office, which is an attorney's office, for a continued date. The judge also queries why default has not been entered against the defendant.
