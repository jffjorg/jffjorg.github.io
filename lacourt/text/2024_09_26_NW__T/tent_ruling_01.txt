24VECV02404 Wells Fargo v Sarti
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank’s Motion for an Order to Permit Appraisal and Inspection is CONTINUED.
Introduction 
Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank (Plaintiff) moved for an order to permit appraisal and inspection of real property located at 30200 Agoura Road, Suite 110, Agoura Hills, CA 91301 owned by Defendant Sarti Emergency Specialists, Inc. (Defendant).
An opposition was due September 13, 2024 but none was filed.  
Procedure 
Despite being served with the Summons and Complaint, Defendant has not appeared in this action.  Because Defendant has not yet appeared, Defendant is not entitled to service of notice or papers.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1014.)  However, this presents a dilemma in providing Defendant with opportunity to be heard, especially when the relief requested by Plaintiff is for an order to enter upon Defendant’s property.  Without an appearance, Defendant’s address to effectuate service of the noticed motion is uncertain.  The proof of service to the motion shows that Plaintiff served the motion upon Defendant’s agent for service of process rather than Defendant but not in the manner as a summons and complaint.  The motion should be hand delivered to the defendants and to defendant’s agent’s office, which is an attorney’s office for a continued date.
The motion for an appraisal and inspection is CONTINUED.
The court queries why default has not been entered against defendant.
