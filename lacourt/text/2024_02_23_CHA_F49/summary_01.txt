```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, William S. Hart Union High School District, argued that the primary assumption of risk doctrine applies to the case, which would bar the plaintiff's claim. The judge found that the doctrine does apply, but that the defendant's failure to use mats during rehearsals may have increased the risk of harm.

The judge also found that there are triable issues regarding whether the lack of mats deviates from standard safety requirements for the activity and whether the defendant's actions increased the risk of harm. Therefore, the case must proceed to trial.
