And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, filed by Attorney Michael J. Fairchild, is granted. The motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 284 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The court finds good cause to grant the request, as Attorney Fairchild has stated that he cannot effectively and ethically represent the plaintiff, and the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal. The court sets a Trial Setting Conference for January 22, 2025, to allow the plaintiff sufficient time to engage new counsel if desired.
