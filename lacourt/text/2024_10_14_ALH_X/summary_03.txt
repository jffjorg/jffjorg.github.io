And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the case should be transferred from the Los Angeles Superior Court to the San Bernardino Superior Court. The lawsuit was filed after a car accident on the 210 Freeway in Redlands, California, where the Defendant resides. The Plaintiff, a resident of Arizona, sued the Defendant for negligence and negligent entrustment. The Defendant moved to transfer the case to San Bernardino Superior Court, arguing that the accident and Plaintiff's injuries occurred in San Bernardino County, making Los Angeles Superior Court not the proper venue. The Plaintiff did not oppose the transfer. The Judge granted the motion, ordering the case to be transferred to San Bernardino Superior Court and requiring the Plaintiff to pay transfer fees in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 399, subdivision (a).
