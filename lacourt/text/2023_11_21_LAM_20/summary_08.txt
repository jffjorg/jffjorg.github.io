The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel discovery and ordered the Defendant to provide discovery responses within 30 days. However, the Defendant failed to provide any responses, leading the Plaintiff to seek terminating, contempt, and monetary sanctions. The Court finds that the Defendant's conduct constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, citing California discovery law and relevant court cases. The Court will enter a terminating sanction, striking the Defendant's Answer and entering default. The Court will also award reduced monetary sanctions in the amount of $750. The Court will not award any contempt sanctions or set a contempt hearing.
