            vs.
COMMERCE ENTERPRISES, INC., et al.,
 
                        Defendants.

Hearing Time:

ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION FOR
  PROTECTIVE ORDER



 
Defendant Commerce
Enterprises, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves for a protective order. 
Defendant’s motion will be continued to a
new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON NOVEMBER 19,
2024     
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform
to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders
the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the Court (“Informal
Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other designated counsel for
the parties with full authority and
any self-represented parties are ordered to participate in person in an
IDC. 
It appears Defendant reserved an IDC for December 5, 2024
that pertains to the instant motion for protective order. Defendant
filed an IDC Statement on October 23, 2024 indicating, inter alia, “[t]the
Motion has already been filed and is presently set for November 19, 2024…As
stated in the moving papers, the subpoena served by the Plaintiff is over broad
and Defendant seeks a protective order barring or significantly modifying, the
requested materials.”
The Court notes that the responding parties may file an IDC form in Department 50 setting
forth a response to Defendant’s IDC Statement three days prior to the IDC.   
Defendant must use the Court’s online reservation system to continue
the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to
have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session productive
and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the
parties with full authority, and any
self-represented parties are to meet and confer, in person or
via telephone in a further attempt to resolve as many of the
issues as possible before the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).)
If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Defendant is ordered to take both the December 5, 2024 IDC and the
motion off calendar as soon as possible. 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
