And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendants' application to permit Sylvia E. Lind, an attorney from Florida, to appear pro hac vice on their behalf in this case. The judge noted several defects with the application, including the fact that Lind does not explicitly state that she is not eligible to appear as counsel pro hac vice due to residency in California, and that her declaration does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivision (d)(2) and Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. The application is denied without prejudice, and the defendants are ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
