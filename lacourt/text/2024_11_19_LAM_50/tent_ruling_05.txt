KISHA HARRIS,
  
                        Plaintiff,
            vs.
LIAN BOYD,
                        Defendant.


Case No.:


22STCV20388




Hearing Date:


November 19, 2024




Hearing Time:


10:00 a.m. 




[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 



            
Plaintiff Kisha Harris (“Plaintiff”) appears to request entry of
default judgment against Defendant Lian Boyd (“Boyd”). The Court notes that the
Request for Court Judgment filed on October 17, 2024 does not indicate that
Plaintiff seeks any amount of damages. 
As a threshold matter, the docket for this action does not appear to
show that the Clerk has entered default against Boyd. Plaintiff’s latest
request for entry of default against Boyd appears to have been filed on October
22, 2024, and such request was rejected. 
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff’s apparent request for default
judgment against Boyd is denied. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
