And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for approval of a Private Attorney General Act (PAGA) settlement between plaintiff Melissa Perez and defendant SPARC GROUP LLC dba NAUTICA. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging twelve causes of action, including a ninth cause of action for violation of Labor Code sections 2698, et seq. The parties agreed to fully resolve the issues between them, including a PAGA Release as to Plaintiff and Aggrieved Employees. The plaintiff moves for approval of the PAGA settlement.

The judge notes several defects with the motion, including lack of notice of motion, lack of signature from defendant, and lack of submission to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. The judge also notes that the settlement agreement and release of PAGA claims do not appear to contain any defined terms, and that the plaintiff did not provide evidence showing that the proposed settlement was submitted to the LWDA.

Based on these defects, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion for approval of the PAGA settlement without prejudice. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
