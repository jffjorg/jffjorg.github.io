[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
APPLICATION TO APPEAR PRO HAC VICE



 
Defendants 21 In Right, Inc., Luis Clemente and Roberto Clemente, Jr.
(collectively, “Defendants”) apply for an order permitting Sylvia E. Lind, Esq.
to appear pro hac vice on their behalf in this action. 
The Court notes a few defects with the
application. 
First, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivisions (a)(1)-(3), no person is eligible
to appear as counsel pro hac vice if the person is “[a] resident
of the State of California,” is “[r]egularly employed in the State of California,” or is “[r]egularly
engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities in the State
of California.” Although Ms. Lind states that she is “not regularly engaged in the
practice of law or other business in the State of California,” (Lind Decl., ¶ 6), she
does not expressly state that all of the circumstances set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, subdivisions (a)(1)-(3)
do not apply to her.  
Second, Ms. Lind indicates that she
“was admitted to the State Bar of Florida (Bar No. 1044502) in 2023,” and that
she was “admitted to the State Bar of New York (Bar No. 2781714) in 1996.”
(Lind Decl., ¶ 3.) However, pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 9.40, subdivision (d)(2), “[t]he
application must state:…(2) The courts to which the applicant has been
admitted to practice and the dates of admission.” Ms. Lind does not appear to
provide this information.  
Third, the “Verified
Application of Sylvia E. Lind” provides, inter alia, that “I declare under penalty of perjury
that the forgoing is true and correct.” Ms. Lind’s declaration further
provides, “[e]xecuted this 24th day of October 2024 at Palm Harbor, Florida.”
The Court notes that Code of Civil Procedure section
2015.5 “defines a ‘declaration’ as a writing that is signed, dated, and
certified as true under penalty of perjury. In addition,¿section
2015.5¿specifies that a declaration must either reveal a ‘place of
execution’ within California, or¿recite that it is made ‘under the laws
of the State of California.’” (Kulshrestha v. First
Union Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 601, 606 [emphasis in
original].) Ms. Lind’s declaration does not satisfy these
requirements.¿¿ 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
application is denied without prejudice.  
Defendants are ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
