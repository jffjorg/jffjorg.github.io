And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues brought by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, will be continued due to the large number of evidentiary objections raised by the parties. The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the objections, and to file a joint statement with the text, the objection, and the argument of each side regarding any remaining material objections. The parties must also review any remaining objections at a hearing, and may file revised briefing and evidence if necessary. The judge has scheduled a hearing on the motion for a later date, which will be set at the hearing on objections.
