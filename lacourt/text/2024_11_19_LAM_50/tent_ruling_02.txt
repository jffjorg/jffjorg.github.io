  Time:    2:00 p.m. 
 
ORDER RE: 
 
DEFENDANT LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
  JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF ISSUES
 




 
The motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication of issues brought by Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District
(“Defendant”) is continued as set forth below.  
The parties have interposed 42 evidentiary objections. Due to the
voluminous number of objections, the hearing on the motion will be continued to
a date that will be set at the Hearing on Objections discussed below. 
The Court orders the parties to meet and confer by telephone or in
person in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the
objections. The only objections that should remain are those that pertain to material
evidence regarding material issues. Keeping the rules of evidence
in mind, the parties should be able to reduce the objections to just a few. If
any material objections remain unresolved, the parties are to set
them forth in a joint statement with the text, the objection, and the argument
of each side in favor of their respective positions regarding the remaining
material objections, along with a space for a ruling. 
The joint statement must be filed on or before _______ with a courtesy
copy delivered to Department 50. The Court will review any remaining objections
with the parties at a hearing on _______________ at 2:00 p.m. (the
“Hearing on Objections”). The date for the hearing on the motion will be set at
the Hearing on Objections. 
If necessary, based upon the resolutions reached during the meet and
confer process and/or at the Hearing on Objections, the parties may
respectively file and serve revised briefing and evidence. The revised evidence
may eliminate objectionable material; however, no new evidence or new
argument is to be submitted unless it is as a result of compromises reached
during the meet and confer process. In the event that revised briefing
and evidence is necessary, the Court will discuss with the parties a briefing schedule
for the revised briefing at the Hearing on Objections.   
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this Order.
