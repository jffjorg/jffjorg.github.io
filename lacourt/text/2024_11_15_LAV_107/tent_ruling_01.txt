COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
 
Motion
  to Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
This
is a medical malpractice case. (Complaint p. 3.) On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff
Morgan Harris (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Bespoke
Treatment, LLC (“Bespoke Treatment”), Nima Fahimian MD Inc. (“Fahimian”), and
Does 1 to 10, alleging a cause of action for general negligence.
 
On
October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion seeking an order quashing, or in the
alternative, a protective order, on the subpoenas duces tecum served by Fahimian
and Bespoke Treatment (the “Motion”). On November 1, 2024, Fahimian filed an
opposition. On November 4, 2024, Bespoke Treatment filed an opposition. Plaintiff
filed no replies.
 
II.             
PROCEDURAL
ISSUES
 

Timing

 
Citing
Code of Civil Procedure sections 1005, subdivision (b) and 1010.6, subdivision
(a)(3)(B), Fahimian argues Plaintiff’s Motion is untimely because Plaintiff did
not serve the Motion sixteen days before the hearing. (Fahimian Opposition pp.
7-8.) Fahimian states the hearing is set for November 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s
Motion was due to be served no later than October 21, 2024, but Plaintiff
served the Motion on October 23, 2024. (Fahimian Opposition pp. 7-8.) 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b) provides that “all moving and
supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing.”  “Any period of
notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any
period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time
period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended
after service by electronic means by two court days[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1010.6(a)(3)(B).)
 
Plaintiff’s proof of
service shows Plaintiff served the notice of motion by email on October 22,
2024. October 22, 2024, is seventeen court days before the hearing.  However, “[a] trial court has broad
discretion to accept or reject late-filed papers.” (Jack v. Ring LLC (2023)
91 Cal.App.5th 1186, 1210.) Accordingly, this court exercises its discretion and
considers the Motion.
 
Also, Plaintiff filed
this Motion against two Defendants, so it should have been filed as two
separate motions. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114
Cal.App.4th 457, 460 [”But while it is mandatory for the court clerks to demand
and receive statutorily required filing fees, it is not… a jurisdictional
defect if the precise fee is not collected.”])¿¿ According to the rules, in the
future, Plaintiff is required to pay another filing fee in this scenario.
 

Meet and Confer

 
California
Code of Civil Procedure section¿1987.1 does not require that parties meet and
confer before the filing of a motion to quash a deposition subpoena. Thus, no
declaration by Plaintiff attesting to any efforts thereto is required. 
 

The Separate Statement 

 
Fahimian argues this
court should deny the Motion because Plaintiff failed to file a separate
statement. (Fahimian Opposition p. 8.)
 
Motions to compel or
quash production of documents at depositions must be accompanied by a separate
statement unless no response has been provided to the discovery. (CRC
3.1345(a)(5), (b)(1).) 
 
Plaintiff
filed no separate statement with the Motion. Thus, this court finds that this
requirement has not been met and denies the Motion without prejudice.
 

Sanctions

California Code of Civil Procedure
§¿1987.2, subdivision (a) states, “in making an order pursuant to motion made
under… Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the amount of the
reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including
reasonable attorney's fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed
in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more of the
requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.”
Plaintiff seeks $8,770 in monetary
sanctions against Defendants. (Motion p. 11.) Plaintiff is pro per and is
therefore not entitled to recover attorneys’ fees as a discovery sanctions.
(See Kravitz v. Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1015, 1020.)
(Motion p. 12.) This court also finds that Fahimian and Bespoke Treatment did
not oppose the motion in bad faith or without substantial justification and
declines to award Plaintiff the filing fee as a sanction. 
Bespoke Treatment seeks $2,250.00 in
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. (Bespoke Treatment Opposition pp. 15-16.)
This court finds that Plaintiff did not file the Motion in bad faith or without
substantial justification and therefore declines to award Bespoke Treatment
monetary sanctions.
 
III.           
CONCLUSION
For
the foregoing reasons, this court denies Plaintiff’s Motion.
