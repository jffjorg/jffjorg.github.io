As for the summary in English text, here it is:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash subpoenas duces tecum filed by Plaintiff Morgan Harris. The motion is denied because it was not served in a timely manner, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Although the motion was served 17 court days before the hearing, it should have been served 16 days before. The judge exercises its discretion to consider the motion, but finds that the requirement for a separate statement was not met, so the motion is denied without prejudice. The judge also declines to award monetary sanctions to either party, finding that the motion was not filed in bad faith or without substantial justification.
