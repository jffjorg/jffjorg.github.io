Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On February 25, 2022, Talbot Louis Wells (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against PIH Health Downey Hospital (“PIH”), Juan Jose Macias
Barreto (“Barreto”), and Does 1 to 100, asserting causes of action for (1)
assault, (2) battery, (3) infliction of emotional distress, (4) negligence, and
(5) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention arising from a physical
altercation occurring on March 15, 2020.
 
On May 19, 2022, PIH filed an answer to the
complaint.
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to
complaint adding Allied Universal Security Services Universal Protection
Service LPP as Doe 1. 
 
On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to
complaint adding Allied Barton Security Services LP as Doe 2. 
 
On March 27, 2023, Defendant Universal Protection Service
LP dba Allied Universal Security Services, erroneously served as Allied Barton
Security Services LP, (“Universal”) filed an answer and cross-complaint.
 
On June 20, 2023, Barreto filed an answer to the
complaint.
 
On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as
counsel.
 
On September 6, 2024, Barreto filed a motion for judgment
on the pleadings. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii).) 
“A motion
for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer,
and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by
matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is
therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  “The
standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the
same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the
pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322; accord Los
Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Torres Construction Corp. (2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 480, 494; Templo v.
State (2018) 24
Cal.App.5th 730, 735; Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial [2024] ¶ 7:275.)     
Discussion
Barreto moves for judgment on the pleadings based largely on the Court’s
order of September 6, 2024, in which the Court granted Barreto’s motion for an
order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Barreto’s
requests for admission.
The motion, however, is not timely. 
The motion is set to be heard on October 3, 2024.  The motion was served on Plaintiff by mail,
and so to be timely, the service had to be effected by no later than September
5: sixteen court days before the hearing (September 10) plus an additional five
days for mail service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005.) This motion, however, was
served on September 6.
Therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied without prejudice
on the grounds of untimely service. 
Conclusion
The Court denies
the motion for judgment on the pleadings without prejudice.
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
