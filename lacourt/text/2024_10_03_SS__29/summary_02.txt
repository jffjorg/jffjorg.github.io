And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from December 16, 2024, to a date at least 30 days after April 25, 2025, to allow the court to hear the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The defendants have shown good cause for the continuance, and it is in the best interest of justice to grant the motion. The trial date is advanced and continued to a date on or after May 27, 2025, and the final status conference and all discovery deadlines are reset accordingly.
