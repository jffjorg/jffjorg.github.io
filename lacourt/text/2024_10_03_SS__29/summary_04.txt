The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial to a date on or after April 7, 2025. The motion was granted due to good cause, which includes the parties' agreement to mediate the matter with a retired judge who does not have available mediation dates prior to the original trial date. Additionally, discovery has been delayed, and the parties are focusing on preparing for mediation. The judge has considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d), and has determined that a continuance is necessary to ensure the fair and just disposition of the case.
