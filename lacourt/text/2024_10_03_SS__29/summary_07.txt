```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motions to compel Plaintiff Mari Goto to respond to Defendant Bo Li's discovery requests are granted. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the requests, which included form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The judge notes that under California law, a party must respond to discovery requests within 30 days after service, and failing to do so generally waives all objections. The judge orders the Plaintiff to serve written, verified, and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests without objection within 15 days of notice. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff's failure to respond does not require a separate statement or meet-and-confer efforts.
