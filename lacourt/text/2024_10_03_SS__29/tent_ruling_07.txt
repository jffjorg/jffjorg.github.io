Background
On October 19, 2023, Mari
Goto (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bo Li (“Li”), Uber Technologies,
Inc. (“Uber”, Rasier LLC (“Rasier”), Rasier-CA, LLC (“Rasier-CA”), and Does 1
through 40, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence, common
carrier negligence, negligence per se, negligent hiring, retention, and
supervision, and vicarious liability, arising out of an automobile accident
occurring on October 19, 2021.
On February 2, 2024, Uber,
Rasier, and Rasier-CA filed an answer to the complaint.
On March 11, 2024,
Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Fredy Garcia Hernandez (“Hernandez”) and
Jairo Sandoval (“Sandoval”) as Does 1 and 2. 
On April 25, 2024, Hernandez
and Sandoval filed an answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Li,
Uber, Rasier, and Rasier-CA.
On May 14, 2024, the Court
granted Uber’s motion to compel arbitration and stayed litigation of Plaintiff’s
claims against Uber (only).  At last
report (on July 26, 2024), the arbitration remains pending.
On August 2, 2024, the
Court granted the stipulation for arbitration of Plaintiffs, Raiser, and
Rasier-CA.  The Court stayed litigation of
Plaintiff’s claims against Rasier and Rasier-CA (only).
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely written responses, the requesting party may move for an
order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a
party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
