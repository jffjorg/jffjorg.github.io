And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling in the case of Jeffries v. Jeffries Johnson, Case No. 23SMCV01545. The Defendant, Johnson, filed a motion to dismiss the partition action on October 17, 2023, arguing that the Plaintiff, Jeffries, waived the right to partition the property. However, the motion was filed eight court days before the scheduled hearing date, which is untimely. Additionally, the motion did not include a proof of service, and there is no evidence that it was served on Jeffries. The Judge finds that the Defendant must comply with the statutory requirements regarding filing and service. The motion is therefore denied without prejudice.
