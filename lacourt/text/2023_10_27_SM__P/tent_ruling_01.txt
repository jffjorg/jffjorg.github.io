Jeffries v.
Jeffries Johnson, Case No. 23SMCV01545
Hearing Date
October 27, 2023 
Defendant Jeffries
Johnson’s Motion to Dismiss Partition Action 
 
Defendant Johnson, in pro per, filed this motion to
dismiss plaintiff Jeffries’ action on October 17, 2023. Johnson argues Jeffries
waived the right to partition the property, so the complaint should be
dismissed with prejudice. No opposition was filed.
Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §1005 states “all moving and supporting papers” connected with a motion
“shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.” If the
motion is served by mail, this deadline is increased by five calendar days.
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1013. Johnson’s motion was filed on October 17, eight
court days before the scheduled hearing date of October 27.  The motion is untimely. 
 
Additionally, Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. §1005.5 requires service of the motion. The motion did not
include a proof of service, and there is no evidence it was served on Jeffries.
There is no opposition, further evidence of lack of service. 
 
Defendant must
comply with the statutory requirements regarding filing and service. DENIED
without prejudice.
