Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Southside Neighborhood Stabilization 2021-7 LP and Southside Community Development & Housing Corporation (the "Southside Defendants"). The Court has determined that the Southside Defendants have met their burden of showing that there are no material triable issues of fact in the case, and therefore, summary judgment is granted in their favor and against the Plaintiff, Leon Fingerhut.

The Court has also scheduled an Order to Show Cause for February 2, 2024, as to why the Complaint should not be dismissed as to the remaining defendants. The Southside Defendants are required to file their proposed judgment so that it can be ruled upon by or before February 2, 2024.

The Court's decision is based on the evidence submitted by the Southside Defendants, which the Plaintiff has not opposed or responded to. The Court has taken judicial notice of various documents, including the Deed of Trust, Notice of Default, Substitution of Trustee, Notice of Trustee's Sale, Assignment of Deed of Trust, and Trustee's Deed Upon Sale.

The Court has determined that the Plaintiff lacks standing, that the Trustee's Deed is conclusive, and that the Plaintiff has not alleged any procedural irregularities or prejudice. The Court has also determined that the Plaintiff's claims for quiet title, cancellation of instrument, wrongful foreclosure, slander of title, and declaratory and injunctive relief are all without merit.
