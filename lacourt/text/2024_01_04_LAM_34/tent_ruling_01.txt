BACKGROUND:
 
I.         
Preliminary Note on Background Issues
 
This case arises
from transactions involving a single piece of real property: a single-family
residence located at 2096 Ridge Point Drive, Los Angeles, California 90049. The
claims and issues underlying this case appear to have been litigated multiple
times by the same parties across multiple cases. 
 
For the sake
of clarity, the Court uses the term “Subject Property” to refer to the real
property located at 2096 Ridge Point Drive, Los Angeles, California 90049. 
 
Finally, the
Court notes that there is some confusion across the filings about whether the
name of one of the parties is “Leon Fingergut” or “Leon Fingerhut”. The Court
uses “Leon Fingerhut”, as that appears to be the party’s name in instances when
he submitted filings in propria persona.
 
II.       Background for Case No. 23STCV00752
 
On January
13, 2023, Plaintiff Leon Fingerhut filed his Complaint against Defendants
Southside Neighborhood Stabilization 2021-7 LP; Southside Community Development
& Housing Corporation; U.S. Bank, National Association; Rushmore Loan
Management Services LLC; and Attorney Lender Services, Inc. The causes of
action listed in the Complaint arise from transactions involving the Subject
Property. 
 
On February
28, 2023, the Court related cases Nos. 23STCV00752 and 21STCV32101. The Court
also found that Case Nos. 21STCV32101 and 22SMUD00173 were not related after a
prior judicial officer working on these cases accepted a peremptory challenge
in Case No. 22SMUD00173. 
 
On June 5,
2023, Defendants Southside Neighborhood Stabilization 2021-7 LP and Southside
Community Development & Housing Corporation (“Southside Defendants”) filed
their Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On June 20,
2023, Defendants U.S. Bank, National Association, Rushmore Loan Management
Services LLC, and Attorney Lender Services, Inc. filed their Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On June 21,
2023, Defendant Attorney Lender Services, Inc. filed its Declaration of
Nonmonetary Status. 
 
On July 17,
2023, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to substitute Doe 1 with Beltway Capital,
LLC. 
 
On October 2,
2023, Southside Defendants filed their Motion for Summary Judgment. In support
of their Motion, Southside Defendants concurrently filed: (1) Declaration of
Louis Amaya; (2) Separate Statement; (3) Request for Judicial Notice; and (4)
Proof of Service. 
 
No opposition
or other response has been filed to the Motion.

IV.      Legal Standard       
 
“A
party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is
contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have
elapsed since the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party
against whom the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general
appearance that the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown,
may direct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (1)(a).)
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment
bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of fact and that
he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. That is because of the general
principle that a party who seeks a court’s action in his favor bears the burden
of persuasion thereon. There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only
if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying
fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable
standard of proof.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th
826, 850, citation omitted.) 
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment
bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the
nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of
production, he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a
burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence
of a triable issue of material fact.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850; Smith v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474, [applying the summary
judgment standards in Aguilar to motions for summary adjudication].) 
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the court must
therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder
could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this
manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to identify
issues rather than to determine issues. Only when the inferences are
indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the
evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder
v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839, citation omitted.) 
 
“The trial court may not weigh the evidence
in the manner of a fact finder to determine whose version is more likely true.
Nor may the trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation
of credibility.” (Binder, supra, at p. 840, citations omitted;
see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Dep’t of Transp. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840,
864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may
not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the light most favorable to
the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that
party”].) 
 
“On a motion for summary adjudication, the
trial court has no discretion to exercise. If a triable issue of material fact
exists as to the challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If
there is no triable issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's
Wharf Bay Cruise Corp. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320,
citation omitted.) 
 
V.        
Discussion
 
Southside
Defendants move for summary judgment on the Complaint. (Motion, p. 28:4–7.) 
 
Southside
Defendants argue: (1) that each cause of action lacks merit because Plaintiff
was not an eligible bidder and therefore lacks standing; (2) that each cause of
action lacks merit based on the conclusive presumption of compliance with all
statutory procedures created by the recitals in the Trustee’s Deed; (3) that
each cause of action lacks merit because Plaintiff cannot allege any procedural
irregularity resulting in prejudice to him; (4) that each cause of action lacks
merit because Civil Code section 2924m does not confer a private right of
action on the Plaintiff; (5) that each cause of action lacks merit because
Plaintiff failed to tender; (6) that the first cause of action for quiet title
lacks merit because Plaintiff has no title or any right to title; (7) that the
second cause of action for cancellation of instrument lacks merit because
Plaintiff has not and cannot establish that the Trustee’s Deed is invalid; (8)
that the third cause of action for wrongful foreclosure lacks merit because Plaintiff
does not allege or prove any of the requirement elements; (9) that the fourth
cause of action for slander of title lacks merit because Southside Defendants
neither conducted the sale nor recorded the Trustee’s Deed and, in any event,
the record of the Trustee’s Deed is privileged; (10) that the fifth cause of
action for declaratory and injunctive relief lacks merit because there is no
actual controversy or irreparable injury, and in any case these are merely
remedies; and (11) that the remaining causes of action lack merit. (Motion, pp.
13:24–25, 17:18–20, 19:2–3, 20:3–4, 20:20, 21:21–22, 22:12–13, 23:4–5,
23:23–25, 24:14–16, 25:15, 26:20, 27:17.)
 
Neither
Plaintiff nor any of the other defendants have opposed or otherwise responded
to the Motion. Thus, it appears that they are not contesting Southside
Defendants’ arguments. 
 
Upon
considering the evidence submitted, the Court determines that Southside
Defendants have met their initial burden on summary judgment to show that there
are no material triable issues of fact.  Plaintiff
– who has not opposed this Motion for Summary Judgment – has not met his
subsequent burden. Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate here.
 
VI.      Conclusion 
 
The Motion
for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. Summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of
Southside Defendants and against Plaintiff. 
 
The Court
schedules an Order to Show Cause for February 2, 2024 as to why the Complaint
should not be dismissed as to the remaining defendants. The Southside
Defendants are to file their proposed judgment so that it can be ruled upon by
or before February 2, 2024.
