Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Lively Root Technologies Inc. and Colin Barceloux. The court sustains their demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud with leave to amend, but overrules their demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract. The court also deems their motion to strike portions of the complaint moot.

The court finds that the complaint adequately pleads the elements of a cause of action for breach of contract, including the existence of an implied contract between the parties and the defendant's breach of that contract. However, the court finds that the complaint fails to plead the elements of fraud, including misrepresentations, knowledge of falsity, and intent to defraud.

The court gives plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies in the second cause of action. In the meantime, the court deems the motion to strike moot.
