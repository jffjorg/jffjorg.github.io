 Case Number:  23PSCV03652    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  G Defendants Rita Hernandez, Alfredo Hernandez, and  FRAAI Management Group, Inc.’s Motion for Order to Stay Unlawful Detainer Respondent: Plaintiff Maria  Mercy Moreno TENTATIVE RULING Defendants Rita Hernandez, Alfredo Hernandez, and  FRAAI Management Group, Inc.’s Motion for Order to Stay Unlawful Detainer is  DENIED. BACKGROUND This is an unlawful detainer  action. In September 2018, Defendants Rita Hernandez, Alfredo Hernandez, and  FRAAI Management Group, Inc. (FRAAI, collectively FRAAI Defendants) agreed to  lease commercial property in Covina from Plaintiff Maria Mercy Moreno for a 3-year  term with a monthly rent of $6,200. Subsequently, the lease allegedly converted  to a month-to-month tenancy. On September 15, 2023, the FRAAI Defendants  allegedly failed to comply with a 30-day notice to quit by Moreno. On November 22, 2023, Moreno  filed a complaint against the FRAAI Defendants, all unknown occupants, and Does  1-10 for unlawful detainer. On December 4, 2023, the  FRAAI Defendants filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for  January 22, 2024, with a case management conference and OSC Re: Failure to File  Proof of Service on April 30. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL  NOTICE The FRAAI Defendants’ request  for judicial notice of filings in a separate action brought by the FRAAI  Defendants against Moreno (Case No. 21STCV45867) is  GRANTED. ANALYSIS The  FRAAI Defendants move for a stay of the present action pending the resolution  of a separate action for declaratory relief regarding the same Covina property.  For the following reasons, the court DENIES their motion. Legal Standard “Trial  courts generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests  of justice and to promote judicial efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of  Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)  They also have inherent  powers to manage and fashion procedures to control litigation and ensure the  orderly administration of justice.  (Cottle v. Superior Court (1992) 3  Cal.App.4th 1367, 1376-79; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(3)  and (a)(5).) Discussion On  December 16, 2021, the FRAAI Defendants filed a complaint against Moreno that  requests declaratory relief. They allege they entered into an agreement with  Moreno in which they would be provided with an irrevocable option to purchase  the Covina property. (Case No.  21STCV45867, Complaint, ¶ 10-11.) They also requested a judgment declaring that  Moreno cannot demand past-due rent as a condition of lease renewal or purchasing  the Covina property. (Case No.  21STCV45867, Complaint, ¶ 10-11.) In this case, the FRAAI  Defendants argue this action should be stayed pending the resolution of their  declaratory judgment action. In arguing so, they do acknowledge that they are  generally estopped from denying a landlord’s title during the pendency of their  tenancy. (Evid. Code, § 624 [“A tenant is not permitted to deny the title of  his landlord at the time of the commencement of the relation.”]; see People  ex rel. Department of Public Works v. Rice (1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 207, 211.)  Instead, in citing to Greenhut v. Wooden (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 64, 68-69  (Greenhut), they argue title may be litigated when either party has put  the title at issue by filing a prior action for declaratory relief and a  judgment quieting title. The court finds this argument fails as it misstates  the law. In Greenhut, the court  noted “that when a landlord not only seeks possession of real property, but  also attempts to quiet title thereto as against the tenant, either by cross  complaint or otherwise, the tenant is not estopped from denying the  landlord's title . . . .” (Id., at p. 69, quoting Yuba River Sand Co.  v. City of Marysville (1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 421, 425.) Nowhere in Greenhut  does it say that the tenant may be the one to put the title at  issue. Instead, this exception relies on the landlord’s conduct. (See, e.g.,  American Enterprise, Inc. v. Van Winkle (1952) 39 Cal.2d 210, 220 [holding  this exception applies when lessor brings an action to place the title at  issue]; San Juan Gold Co. v. San Juan Ridge Mut. Water Ass’n (1939) 34  Cal.App.2d 159, 168 [“When a landlord by his pleadings not only seeks to  recover possession, but also to quiet his title, the tenant is not estopped to  deny his title but may set up his own superior title.”]; Collier v. Johnson (1926)  79 Cal.App. 322, 325 [holding this “exception is given effect when the  landlord, by the form of procedure instituted by him, puts his title in issue”].) Here, the underlying  declaratory judgment action was brought by the FRAAI Defendants, not Moreno.  Furthermore, Moreno did not file any cross-complaint in that action. And in the  present action, Moreno has only sought possession of the premises and  forfeiture of the lease agreement. Because Moreno was not the one who placed  the title at issue, the exception that the FRAAI Defendants rely on as the  basis for their stay request is inapplicable. Accordingly, the FRAAI  Defendants’ motion is DENIED. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the  FRAAI Defendants’ motion for a stay of the present action is DENIED.
