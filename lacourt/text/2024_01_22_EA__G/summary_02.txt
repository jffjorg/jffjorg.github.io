And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Puente Hills Volkswagen, a defendant in a lemon law action. The plaintiffs, Chenxu Wang and Wei Lu, alleged that their leased 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 had defects and that the defendant failed to make unspecified repairs. The defendant demurred to the fourth cause of action, alleging that it was barred by the economic loss rule and failed to state a claim.

The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the economic loss rule prevents tort recovery for purely economic losses, such as the alleged breach of contract. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for negligent repair.

The judge notes that there is an exception to the economic loss rule for professional services contracts, but the plaintiffs did not provide any binding authority that establishes whether vehicle repair service contracts meet this exception. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs failed to allege how the defendant's failure to make unspecified repairs caused damage to other subcomponents of the vehicle.

The judge orders the plaintiffs to amend their complaint within 20 days to address the issues raised in the demurrer.
