And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Rita Hernandez, Alfredo Hernandez, and FRAAI Management Group, Inc., have filed a motion for an order to stay the unlawful detainer action brought by plaintiff Maria Mercy Moreno. The defendants argue that the action should be stayed pending the resolution of their declaratory judgment action, which is also related to the Covina property. However, the judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendants' argument is based on a misstatement of the law. The judge notes that the exception to the general rule that a tenant is estopped from denying a landlord's title only applies when the landlord brings an action to quiet title, and that the defendants are not entitled to a stay of the present action. The judge also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of filings in their separate action against Moreno.
