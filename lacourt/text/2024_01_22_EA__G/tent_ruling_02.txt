 Case Number:  23PSCV02916    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Mesa Imports, LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Complaint
 
Respondent: Plaintiffs Chenxu Wang and Wei Lu
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Mesa Imports, LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to
amend.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. In August 2021, Plaintiffs Chenxu
Wang and Wei Lu allegedly entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Volkswagen Group of
America, Inc. (Volkswagen) by leasing a 2021 Volkswagen ID.4. Wang and Lu
allege the vehicle was delivered with transmission, electrical, and engine
system defects.
 
On September 20, 2023, the Wang and Lu filed a complaint
against Volkswagen; Mesa Imports, Inc., doing business as Puente Hills
Volkswagen; and Does 1-10, alleging (1) breach of express warranty, (2) breach
of implied warranty, (3) violation of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2,
subdivision (b), and (4) negligent repair.
 
On December 14, 2023, Puente Hills Volkswagen filed the
present demurrer. Prior to filing, Puente Hills Volkswagen’s counsel attempted
to meet and confer with Wang and Lu’s counsel through emails and a phone call but
was not successful. (Oaks Decl., ¶ 3-6.)
 
A hearing on the present demurrer is set for January 22,
2024, with a case management conference and OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of
Service on February 28.
 
ANALYSIS

Puente Hills Volkswagen demurs to Wang and
Lu’s fourth cause of action for negligent repair on the grounds that it is (1)
barred by the economic loss rule and (2) fails to allege sufficient facts to state
a claim. For the following reasons, the court SUSTAINS Puente Hills
Volkswagen’s demurrer with leave to amend.
 
Legal Standard

Demurrer
 
A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Economic Loss Rule
 
The economic loss rule prevents tort recovery for “‘purely
economic losses,’ meaning financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property
damage.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922.)
This is because “conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious
only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.)
Economic loss can include “damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and
replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits.” (Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988 (Robinson),
quoting Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473, 482 (Jimenez).)
 
Discussion
 
In
this case, Wang and Lu allege Puente
Hills Volkswagen owed them a duty “to use ordinary care and skill in storage,
preparation, and repair of the Subject Vehicle in accordance with industry
standards.” (Complaint, ¶ 64.) But it is unclear if this alleged duty is
contractual or based on an independent duty. When
it is unclear if an action arises from a contract or noncontractual duty, “the
action will be considered based on contract rather than tort.” (Arthur L.
Sachs, Inc. v. City of Oceanside (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 315, 322.) Because Wang and Lu’s negligent
repair action is based on a contractual duty to repair and they have not
alleged any facts establishing an independent noncontractual duty, their fourth
cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule.
 
Wang and Lu contend there is an exception to the economic
loss rule for professional services contracts. Indeed, such an exception does
exist to ensure “that the consumer receives the services the professional
agreed to provide.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th
905, 933.) “In such settings, professionals generally agree to provide ‘careful
efforts’ in rendering contracted-for services,¿but ‘most clients do not know
enough to protect themselves by inspecting the professional’s work or by other
independent means.’” (Ibid, quoting Rest.3d Torts, Liability for
Economic Harm (June 2020) § 4, com. a., p. 22.) Such professional services can
include those offered by doctors, attorneys, accountants, and stockbrokers. (See
Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176,
188.) But Wang and Lu do not provide any binding authority that establishes
whether vehicle repair service contracts meet this exception.
 
Wang and Lu also rely on Jimenez which holds
“California decisional law has long recognized that the economic loss rule does
not necessarily bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective product (e.g.,
a window) causes to other portions of a larger product (e.g., a house) into
which the former has been incorporated.” (Jimenez, supra, 29
Cal.4th at p. 483.) But Wang and Lu have failed to allege how Puente Hills
Volkswagen’s failure to make unspecified repairs caused damage to other
subcomponents of the vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 62-65.)
 
Accordingly, Puente Hills Volkswagen’s demurrer to this
cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, Puente Hills Volkswagen’s demurrer
to Wang and Lu’s Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to
amend as to the fourth cause of action.
