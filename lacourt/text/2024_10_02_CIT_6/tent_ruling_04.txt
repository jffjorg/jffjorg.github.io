Shiyi Zhang, et al.  Plaintiff’s  Motion for Orders Compelling Deposition of Defendant Shiyi Zhang and Awarding  Sanctions Against Defendant Shiyi Zhang and Defendants’ Attorney(s) of Record  MacDonald & Cody, LLP in the Amount of $5,310.00  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of  Defendant Shiyi Zhang. Defendant Shiyi Zhang must appear for deposition within  30 days of the Court’s order.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions as to  Defendant Shiyi Zhang only in the reduced amount of $1,810.00, to be paid to  Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of the Court’s order.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a personal injury action. On February 14, 2023, plaintiff  Shanhui Zhu (Plaintiff) filed this action. On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff  filed the operative First Amended Complaint against defendants Shiyi Zhang  (Zhang), Yuan Yin Fu, and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for  negligence, negligence per se, and fraudulent transfer.  On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the  deposition of Defendant Zhang. On September 18, 2024, Defendant Zhang opposed  the motion. Plaintiff did not reply.  LEGAL  STANDARD  (a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party  to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,  or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section  2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails  to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection  any document, electronically stored information, or  tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice  may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and  the production for inspection of any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice.  (b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with  both of the following:  (1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or  tangible thing described in the deposition notice.  (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to  attend the deposition and produce the documents,  electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition  notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent  to inquire about the nonappearance.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025,  subds. (a), (b).)  PRELIMINARY  ISSUES              The Court notes that Plaintiff’s  motion was filed on September 10, 2024, i.e., one day late, per the October 2,  2024 hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) However, the Court  notes that Defendant Zhang did not raise this issue in the opposition.  Accordingly, the Court will still consider Plaintiff’s motion, but admonishes  Plaintiff to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going  forward. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d); Juarez v. Wash  Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.)  DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b)(2),  Plaintiff was required to contact Defendant Zhang to inquire about the  nonappearance before bringing this motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.  (b)(2).) The Court finds Plaintiff’s efforts to inquire about the nonappearance  sufficient. (May Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.)              Analysis  Plaintiff indicates having served Defendant Zhang with a notice of  deposition on June 20, 2024, for a deposition scheduled on July 19, 2024.  Plaintiff contends Defendant Zhang did not object to the deposition; instead,  on July 17, 2024, Zhang’s counsel stated that she had not had any communication  with Zhang confirming her appearance at the deposition, and that her  understanding was Zhang was in China. Plaintiff indicates having attempted to  obtain alternate deposition dates, but to no avail.  In opposition, counsel for Zhang concedes that Plaintiff noticed  Zhang’s deposition for July 19, 2024. Counsel for Zhang indicates having  advised Plaintiff of Zhang’s unavailability and to take the deposition off  calendar to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. Counsel for Zhang states that  their attempts to communicate with Zhang have been unsuccessful, and that there  is no indication Zhang will appear for deposition. Counsel for Zhang contends  that sanctions should not be awarded against counsel given the extent to which  they have advised Plaintiff of their difficulty in locating Zhang.  The Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to an order  compelling Zhang’s appearance at a deposition. First, counsel for Zhang  concedes that Zhang should have appeared for the deposition. (Opp., 3:8-10.) Second,  Zhang filed an answer to the complaint. (Answer (12/29/23).) Zhang therefore  has made a general appearance in this action and consented to the jurisdiction  of this Court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1014; Nobel Floral, Inc. v. Pasero (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 654, 658.) Therefore, whether Zhang  is in China does not absolve Zhang of her responsibility to participate in this  litigation. (See Wilson Decl., ¶ 4.) Even assuming Zhang is in China, there  does not appear to be any reason that Zhang cannot appear remotely for the  deposition. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion and orders  Defendant Zhang to appear for deposition within 30 days of the Court’s order.  With respect to monetary sanctions, the Court finds  that counsel for Zhang does not appear to be at fault for Zhang’s failure to  appear. (See Wilson Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Accordingly, the Court will award monetary  sanctions only against Zhang, but in the reduced amount of $1,810.00, comprised  of 2.5 hours preparing the motion and 1 hour appearing at the hearing on the  motion, multiplied by the reduced hourly rate of $500.00,[1] plus the $60.00 filing fee.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of  Defendant Shiyi Zhang. Defendant Shiyi Zhang must appear for deposition within  30 days of the Court’s order. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions as to Defendant Shiyi Zhang only in the reduced amount of $1,810.00, to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of the Court’s order.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
