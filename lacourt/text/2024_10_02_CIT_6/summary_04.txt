And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant Shiyi Zhang. The court orders defendant Zhang to appear for deposition within 30 days of the court's order. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against defendant Zhang in the reduced amount of $1,810.00. The court finds that counsel for defendant Zhang is not at fault for defendant Zhang's failure to appear, and therefore does not award sanctions against counsel. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
