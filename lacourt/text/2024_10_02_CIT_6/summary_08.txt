And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The motion is unopposed, and the Court finds that the plaintiffs have substantially complied with the requirements for seeking to leave to amend. The plaintiffs seek to amend their complaint based on information recently discovered in bank documents received from Chase Bank for the defendant's bank records. The amended complaint alleges that the defendant took funds from the plaintiffs' mother and aunt's bank accounts, and that the defendant improperly acquired their bank accounts and Social Security checks. The Court construes the lack of opposition to this motion as a tacit admission that the plaintiffs' arguments are meritorious. The Court grants the motion and orders the plaintiffs to file and serve the Second Amended Complaint within 5 days of the Court's order. The Court also orders the plaintiffs to give notice of the Court's ruling within 5 calendar days of this order.
