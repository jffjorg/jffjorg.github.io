```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion of Alex Vandenberg, counsel for plaintiff Quinlan Jones, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion is unopposed, and the court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal. However, the court notes that the counsel did not provide proof of service of the moving papers on the plaintiff and defendants, and therefore denies the motion without prejudice. The court orders counsel to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
