And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for leave to submit a tardy expert designation. The defendants, Sunrise Senior Living, LLC, et al., sought to add an expert witness, Ms. Mitchell, to their team. The plaintiffs, Herbert Hall, et al., opposed the motion, arguing that the addition of Ms. Mitchell's testimony would be duplicative and would prejudice them by allowing them to have an extra expert to opine on the same subjects as their other two experts.

The judge finds that the defendants' delay in submitting the expert designation was due to a calendaring error and that they promptly sought leave to submit the designation and served the proposed expert designation on the plaintiffs. The judge also finds that the proposed expert's testimony is not duplicative of the defendants' other designated witnesses.

As a result, the judge grants the motion and orders the defendants to make Ms. Mitchell immediately available for deposition. The defendants are also ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
