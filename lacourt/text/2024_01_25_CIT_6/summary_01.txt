And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Jing Li. The motion, filed by Matt Putterman of Putterman Law, APC, is unopposed. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion must be made on the correct forms and served on the client and all parties. In this case, the court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a proper ground for withdrawal. However, the court denies the motion without prejudice because the proposed order was not filed with the moving papers, and the declaration failed to provide the time and place for the Case Management Conference. The court orders counsel to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five calendar days.
