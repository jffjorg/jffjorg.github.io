RETAIL VENTURES ONE, LLC’S NOTICE OF MOTION TO REMOVE
INVALID MECHANICS LIEN is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from a contract for improvements to certain real
property. Plaintiff DON SOINI, JR. dba DON'S RETAIL SERVICES alleges the
following against Defendants RETAIL VENTURES ONE, LLC, a Delaware Limited
Liability Company; P&K BUILDERS, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company;
KDM CALIFORNIA LLC: In May 2023, Plaintiff entered into a written subcontract
with P&K, a general contractor, to perform certain construction work. The
value of the labor, materials, equipment, and services supplied by Plaintiff is
at least $82,636.60, but, despite demands, P&K has refused to pay Plaintiff
per the contract and change order. 
 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff
filed suit asserting the following causes of action (COAs):
 
(1) BREACH OF WRITTEN CONTRACT;

(2) FORECLOSURE OF MECHANICS
LIEN; 
(3) COMMON COUNTS - GOODS AND
SERVICES RENDERED; 
(4) COMMON COUNTS -ACCOUNT
STATED; 
(5) COMMON COUNTS - AMOUNT
AGREED, and (6) STATUTORY VIOLATIONS
 
On April 2, 2024, Retail filed the instant motion.
 
On April 3, 2024, the court (department G) denied Defendant's
Ex-Parte Application for Order Advancing and Shortening Time to hear its Motion
to Remove Invalid Mechanics Lien due to a lack of showing of irreparable harm.
 
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Retail. 
 
On April 15, 2024, the court
found cases 24PSCV00945 and 24PSCV00993 related, with 24PSCV00945 deemed as the
lead case. 
 
On April 26, 2024, the court
held its Status Conference Re: Related Case. Counsel for Retail appeared. The
court’s minute order provides that the mechanic’s lien motion was to remain as
previously set. 
 
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed KDM. 
 
Discussion
 
Retail brings forth
the motion because Plaintiff Don Soini, Jr. is an unlicensed contractor.
Effectively, as an unlicensed contractor, Plaintiff could not file a mechanic’s
lien (Motion
p. 4, citing Slatkin v. White (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 963, 968)
let alone foreclose on his or her mechanic’s lien (Motion p. 4, citing Lewis
& Queen v. N.M. Ball Sons (1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 154–155; Cash v.
Blackett (1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 233, 237.) In fact, as an unlicensed
contractor, Plaintiff may not bring or maintain any action for the collection
of compensation for the performance of any act or contract. (See Contractors
State License Law (CSLL) § 7000 et seq; MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser
Ornamental & Metal Works Co., Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 412.)
 
Here, not only does Plaintiff not allege that he is a
licensed contractor (Bus. & Prof. Code § 7031(a)),[1]
but Retail has found no record for Plaintiff on the Contractors State Licensing
Board and found no record for Plaintiff. (Motion p. 5.)
 
Absent an opposition, Plaintiff has failed to meet his
burden to establish the probable validity[2] of
his mechanics lien because he has failed to demonstrate he was licensed by the
Contractors State License Board at the time of the alleged work. 
 
Therefore, as Plaintiff does not allege that it is licensed
by the Contractors State License Board, the December 28, 2023 recorded
mechanics lien is invalid.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.[3]
