  Case Number:  20STCV25187    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  B SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIACOUNTY OF LOS ANGELESDEPARTMENT BTENTATIVE RULINGYARI DE LEON, an individual, vs. MATTHEW FEDERGREEN, an individual. Case No.: 20STCV25187 Hearing Date: OCTOBER 24, 2024Defendant Matthew Federgreen’s motion to compel the independent medical examination of Plaintiff Yari de Leon is granted. Defendant’s request for sanctions is also granted in the reduced amount of $1,772.67.Defendant Matthew Federgreen (“Defendant”) moves to compel the independent medical examination (“IME”) of Plaintiff Yari de Leon (“Plaintiff”), contending that there is good cause for the motion because Plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. (Notice of Motion, p. 5:11-17.)“Unless otherwise limited by order of the court …, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action …, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)Where any party seeks to obtain discovery by a physical examination, the party shall obtain leave of the court. (CCP § 2032.310(a).) The Court shall grant the motion only for good cause shown. (CCP§ 2032.320(a).)Meet and ConferOn May 17, 2024, defense counsel served a Demand for Physical Examination of Plaintiff on plaintiff’s counsel, to be conducted on July 8, 2024, by orthopedic surgeon Philip S. Yuan, M.D. (“Dr. Yuan”). (Babadjanian Decl. ¶ 6; Exh. D [Demand].) On June 14, 2024, the examination was re-noticed with an amendeddate of July 15, 2024, to accommodate a change in Dr. Yuan’s schedule. (Ibid. at ¶ 7; Exh. E [amended Demand].) On July 8, 2024, defense counsel sent plaintiff’s counsel an email confirming Plaintiff’s attendance for the July 15th examination. (Ibid. at ¶ 9.) Plaintiff’s counsel replied that Plaintiff was unavailable on that date. (Ibid.; Exh. F [meet and confer email].) On July 16, 2024, defense counsel offered to withdraw any motion to compel Plaintiff’s examination if Plaintiff stipulated to a date and time regarding their availability for an IME. (Ibid. at ¶ 11; Exh. F.) Defense counsel received no response. (Ibid. at ¶ 13.) On July 24, 2024, defense counsel emailed plaintiff’s counsel for a final opportunity, giving Plaintiff’s counsel one day to confirm whether Plaintiff would appear for an August 19, 2024, examination. (Ibid. at ¶ 14.; Exh. I [July 24, 2024 email].) Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant satisfies the meet and confer declaration requirement.Separate Statement RequirementsA motion for “medical examination over objection” must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a).) Here, Plaintiff did not object to Defendant’s noticed IMEs. (Babadjanian Decl. ¶ 8.) Accordingly, a separate statement is not required.Good CauseDefendant contends that there is good cause to compel Plaintiff’s IME because Plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. In her response to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Plaintiff claims injuries to her neck and back. (Exh. A [Plaintiff’s Response to Form Interrogatories, Set One] Nos. 6.2.) Plaintiff also contends that her neck and back pain is worsening. (Ibid. at No. 6.3.)Plaintiff did not object to Defendant’s noticed IMEs or oppose this motion. Without an IME, Defendant cannot fully evaluate Plaintiff’s injuries and prepare a defense for trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant has shown good cause to compel Plaintiff's IME.Required Specifications of the Proposed IMEA motion for an examination must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the examination. (CCP § 2032.310(b).)Defendant provides a scheduled IME for November 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., to be conducted by Dr. Yuan, an orthopedic surgeon, at 2760 Atlantic Ave., Long Beach, CA 90806. (Notice of Motion p. 2:1-7.) Defendant states that the IME “willbe conducted for the purposes of determining, evaluating and assessing plaintiff’s physical condition and claims of injury in controversy in this action.” (Ibid. at 15-16.) The examination “will be consistent with the practices of orthopedic surgery in Southern California and consultations in connection with such practices.” (Ibid. at 22-23.) Finally, the exam may include the taking of x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs as the performing physician deems necessary. (Ibid. at 27-28.)Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant provides the required specifications of the proposed IME.SanctionsDefendant moves to impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $2,589.54.Here, sanctions are appropriate since Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the July 15, 2024, IME and failure to reschedule a subsequent examination constitutes a misuse of the discovery process under CCP § 2023.010.The requested $2,589.54 consists of the following: .8 hours for meet and confer communications with opposing counsel; 7.5 hours to prepare this motion; 1.5 hours in anticipation for preparing a reply; 1 hour for attending this hearing; .3 hours for preparing a notice of ruling, all at the hourly rate of $160.17 per hour; a $61.65 filing fee; and a $750.00 non-appearance fee which defense counsel incurred for the July 15, 2024, IME. (Babadjanian Decl. ¶ 17.) Prior to the July 15, 2024, IME, Defendant put Plaintiff on notice of the $750.00 non-appearance fee. Accordingly, the Court finds this fee reasonable. However, as Plaintiff did not oppose this motion, and this motion largely involves a simple fact pattern, the Court reduces the amount of attorney work hours to six. Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the reduced amount of $1,772.67.ConclusionFor the reasons set forth above, the motion to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical examination is GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $1,772.67.Dated: October 23, 2024Hon. Karen MoskowitzJudge of the Superior Court
