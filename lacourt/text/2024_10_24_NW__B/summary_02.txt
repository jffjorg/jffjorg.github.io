And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Justin Yael Bustillo to approve the compromise of his claim. The petition was filed by Petitioner Karen Maria Orozco, who is also the guardian ad litem for the Claimant. The judge found that the petition was deficient in several ways, including the failure to disclose information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise and the failure to provide a declaration or other admissible evidence to support the reasonableness of the Claimant's settlement amount. Additionally, the judge noted that Defendant Jose Santiago, who answered the complaint, is not participating in the compromise as required by the rules. As a result, the petition is denied, and Petitioner is put on notice that further deficient filings may result in sanctions.
