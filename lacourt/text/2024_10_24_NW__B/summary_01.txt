And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants defendant Matthew Federgreen's motion to compel plaintiff Yari de Leon's independent medical examination (IME) to evaluate her physical injuries. The court finds that defendant has shown good cause for the motion, as plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. The court also grants defendant's request for sanctions against plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel in the reduced amount of $1,772.67. The sanctions are awarded due to plaintiff's failure to appear at the scheduled IME and failure to reschedule a subsequent examination, which constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The court reduces the amount of attorney work hours and the non-appearance fee to $750.00, which was previously put on notice to plaintiff.
