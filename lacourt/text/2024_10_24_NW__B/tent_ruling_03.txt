PARTY: NoneEXPEDITED PETITION FOR APPROVAL OFMINOR’S COMPROMISE OF A DISPUTED CLAIM(CCP § 372, CRC, rules 7.950, 7.950.5)TENTATIVE RULING:The Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Gianna Singh is DENIED.ANALYSIS:I. BackgroundOn May 27, 2022, Plaintiff Gianna Singh (“Claimant”) by and through herguardian ad litem Manny Singh (“Petitioner”) filed an action for general and motor vehicle negligence against Defendants YSL Roofing (“YSL”), Silvio Hernandez (“Hernandez”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”). Petitioner was appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant on June 8, 2022.On September 5, 2023, Petitioner filed a Notice of Settlement.On April 11, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Expedited Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of Claimant.On June 5, 2024, the matter was assigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East. Petitioner was ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of this notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this notice. The Court notes that Petitioner has failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.II. Legal StandardCourt approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (CCP § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code § 3500.Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; CRC Rule 7.950.) (Italics added.)Under CRC Rule 7.950.5, an expedited petition for minor’s compromise without a scheduled hearing is permitted as long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain additional conditions.III. Discussion & ConclusionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive$2,000.00. $200.00 will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount for medical expenses. (MC-350EX Item 17b.) $500.00 will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount for attorney’s fees. (MC-350EX Item 17e.)The fee agreement between Petitioner and Petitioner’s counsel is reasonable as it represents a 25% contingency fee of the proposed $2,000.00 settlement. (MC-350EX Attachment 14A.) Petitioner provides some information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise. Claimant did not suffer any physical injuries; however, she does suffer anxiety when traveling in a car. (MC-350EX Item 7.) Claimant was seen by a chiropractor, who ultimately determined that treatment was not necessary. (MC-350EX Item 8.)Notably, Petitioner and Plaintiff Harjot Singh are both to receive $7,000 in this settlement. However, Petitioner fails to provide the reasoning for this apportionment. (See Item 12b.) Therefore, Petitioner fails to meet the requirements of CRC 790.5.Accordingly, the Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Gianna Singh is DENIED. The Court will set an OSC Re: Sanctions, pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule 2.30, since this is Petitioner’s second denial for deficiencies.Petitioner is ordered to give notice.
