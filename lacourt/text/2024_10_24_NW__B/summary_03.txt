And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Gianna Singh to approve a settlement of her disputed claim. The petition was filed by her guardian ad litem, Manny Singh, and seeks court approval for a settlement of $2,000.00, with $200.00 deducted for medical expenses and $500.00 for attorney's fees. The court finds that the petition does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 7.950.5, as it fails to provide sufficient information for court approval and does not demonstrate a reasonable apportionment of the settlement. The court also notes that the petitioner failed to file proof of service of the notice of case reassignment and failed to provide reasoning for the apportionment of the settlement. As a result, the petition is denied, and the court will set an OSC Re: Sanctions, pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule 2.30, since this is the petitioner's second denial for deficiencies.
