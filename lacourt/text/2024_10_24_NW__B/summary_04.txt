And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the expedited petition for approval of minor's compromise filed on behalf of Claimant Matthias Barreno Riestra. The petition was filed incorrectly on the wrong form, MC-350, instead of the required MC-350EX. Additionally, the petition lacked a declaration regarding the reasonableness of the settlement's apportionment. The court notes that the petitioner failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment. The court also finds that the proposed settlement's merits would not be approved due to the lack of evidence regarding the reasonableness of the settlement's apportionment. The court advises the petitioner that future deficient filings risk sanctions under CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule 2.30.
