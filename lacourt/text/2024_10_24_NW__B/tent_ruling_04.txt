PARTY: NoneEXPEDITED PETITION FOR APPROVAL OFMINOR’S COMPROMISE OF A DISPUTED CLAIM(CCP § 372, CRC, rules 7.950, 7.950.5)TENTATIVE RULING:The Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Matthias Barreno Riestra is DENIED.ANALYSIS:I. BackgroundOn June 17, 2022, Plaintiff Matthias Barreno Riestra (“Claimant”), by and through hisguardian ad litem Sandra Riestra (“Petitioner”), filed an action for general and motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Leonel Mayorquin (“Mayorquin Sr.”), Leonel Mayorquin Jr. (“Mayorquin Jr.”), and Does 1 to 30 (collectively “Defendants”). Petitioner was appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant on June 20, 2022.On June 5, 2024, the matter was assigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. Petitioner was ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of this notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this notice. The Court notes that Petitioner has failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.On August 23, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant expedited petition for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor.II. Legal StandardCourt approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (CCP § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code § 3500.Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; CRC Rule 7.950.) (Italics added.)Under CRC Rule 7.950.5, an expedited petition for minor’s compromise without a scheduled hearing is permitted as long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain additional conditions.III. Discussion & ConclusionAs a preliminary matter, Petitioner used the incorrect form for their expedited petition.Petitioner filed on MC-350, but an expedited petition must be filed on MC-350EX. (CRC Rule 7.950.5.) Petitioner’s proposed order indicates that Petitioner intended to file an expedited petition. (See MC-351, Item 1a.) The petition on form MC-350 cannot be approved since a non-expedited petition requires a hearing. (Prob. Code § 3505.)Accordingly, the instant petition must be denied. Nonetheless, for Petitioner’s benefit, the Court chooses to analyze the proposed settlement’s merits.Petitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive$15,000.00. $147.47 will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount for medical expenses. (MC-350 Item 16b.) $5,000.00 will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount for attorney’s fees. (MC-350 Item 16c.) An additional $640.00 will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount for other expenses. (MC-350 Item 16d.) Accordingly, Claimant will receive a net settlement of $9,212.53.Claimant is represented by counsel with a retainer agreement. (MC-350 Item 17a(2).) The retainer agreement is provided as Attachment 17(a) and supports the 33% contingency feesought. Additionally, Petitioner provides information and medical records that bear upon the reasonableness of the compromise. Claimant suffered severe head trauma from the motor vehicle accident.However, no declaration was provided regarding the reasonableness of the settlement’s apportionment. Petitioner and Plaintiff Dylan Riestra are to receive $11,000 and $4,000 in settlement, respectively. (MC-350 Item 11b(5).) A declaration or other evidence regarding this apportionment is required. Additionally, Petitioner improperly completes Item 21, identifying herself as the Claimant.Accordingly, the petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Matthias Barreno Riestra is DENIED. The Court advises Petitioner that future deficient filings risk sanctions pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule 2.30.Petitioner is ordered to give notice.
