And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Defendant, Robert Azinian, moves to strike or tax the costs sought by the Plaintiff, WVS SPE LLC, in the amount of $51,635.95. The Plaintiff brought an action against the Defendants for breach of written guaranty and obtained a judgment in its favor. The Defendant argues that the costs are unreasonable and not recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.

The Court denies the Defendant's Motion to Strike or Tax, finding that the fees sought by the Plaintiff are reasonable and recoverable. The Court also finds that the costs for "other" expenses, including transcript and court reporter fees, were reasonably necessary to the litigation and therefore recoverable.

The Court orders the Plaintiff to file and serve an Amended Judgment consistent with this ruling and to give notice.
