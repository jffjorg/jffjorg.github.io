And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff had served responses to the defendant's interrogatories, but objected to them on various grounds, including relevance, burden, and privilege. The judge has found the defendant's interrogatories to be relevant and proper, and has rejected the plaintiff's boilerplate objections as meritless. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified and code-compliant responses to the defendant's interrogatories without objection, except as to privilege or work product, within 20 days of the ruling.
