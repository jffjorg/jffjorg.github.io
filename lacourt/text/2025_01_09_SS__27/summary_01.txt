And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on the release agreement signed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants were negligent in failing to address, alleviate, or remedy a dangerous condition that caused his slip and fall incident at SoFi Stadium. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were based on a general negligence theory and lacked specific allegations of regulatory violations.

The judge also found that the release agreement was enforceable and applied to all Stadium Defendants. The agreement released the defendants from liability for personal injuries or property damage, including those arising from violations of law. The judge concluded that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the defendants had violated California Building Code section 1003.4 or ASTM F1637-19, which would have exempted the release agreement from enforcement.

The judge noted that the area in front of the concession stand, where the plaintiff fell, was not a designated "exit access" or "exit discharge" and therefore did not fall within the scope of CBC section 1003.4. The judge also found that CBC section 1003.4 governed the design and construction of means of egress, not ongoing maintenance issues.

As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's claims. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and the opposing party may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
