And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition, citing failure by the plaintiff to appear at the scheduled deposition and failure to file an opposition to the motion. The court has ordered the plaintiff to sit for his deposition within 20 days of the ruling. Additionally, the court has imposed sanctions of $900 on the plaintiff and his attorney, payable to the defendant within 20 days of the ruling. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to act with substantial justification in failing to appear at the deposition and has therefore imposed mandatory sanctions.
