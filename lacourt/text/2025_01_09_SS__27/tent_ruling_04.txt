Background
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
action against Defendants Joseph Anthony Corrado and Lyft. 
In April 2024, Plaintiff first issued a
notice for Defendant Corrado's deposition. The deposition notice was amended
multiple times, and defense counsel repeatedly represented that they were
having difficulty communicating with Defendant.
On October 18, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff's Motion to Compel and ordered $1,500 in sanctions against Defendant
Corrado, payable within 20 days.
On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff issued a
second amended deposition notice for November 18, 2024. 
On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff
proceeded with the deposition as noticed. Defense counsel appeared, but
Defendant Corrado did not. Plaintiff obtained a certificate of non-appearance
and incurred $770.50 in costs. 
On November 20, 2024, defense counsel
stated that Defendant Corrado had agreed to comply with discovery but did not
provide any dates for the deposition. 
On November 22, 2024, Plaintiff
followed up on the deposition dates and sanctions payment, but Defendant
Corrado has neither provided dates nor paid the ordered sanctions.
Plaintiff now moves the Court for
monetary, issue, or terminating sanctions.
Defense counsel, in opposition, explains
that after the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
deposition on October 18, 2024, multiple attempts were made to contact
Defendant to obtain his availability, but these efforts were unsuccessful.
Defense counsel subsequently informed Defendant’s insurance adjuster of the
need for intervention.
On November 20, 2024, Defendant emailed
defense counsel, indicating that he would participate in discovery, including
his deposition. Relying on this representation, defense counsel resumed efforts
to secure deposition dates.
On December 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions. Despite renewed
attempts, defense counsel was still unable to reach Defendant. Defense counsel
again notified the insurance adjuster of the ongoing communication issues and
filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on January 29, 2025. Trial
is currently set for April 2, 2025.
Legal Standard
The
Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and “incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract
Society of New York, Inc.¿(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.)¿Discovery sanctions should be
appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a
greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process
warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will
curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also, e.g.,¿Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.)¿“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿
But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.’”
(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390
[citation omitted].) 
Discussion
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct.¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613;¿Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles¿(1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall”
for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if
the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co.¿(2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶¿8:2214-2220.)¿“[T]the
trial court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction, and we
must uphold the trial court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.” (Dept.
of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154,
19.) 
The
circumstances here do not yet warrant a terminating sanction for the following
reasons: (1) courts are instructed to employ an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, beginning with monetary sanctions and escalating to the
ultimate sanction of termination only if necessary. (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566,
604.) This is Plaintiff’s first motion for sanctions pertaining to Defendant’s
violation of a court order. The Court is hesitant to employ terminating
sanctions as its initial sanction; (2) Defendant has alleged that the insurance
adjuster has been informed about the ongoing lack of communication and the need
for intervention. Given the possibility that the insurance adjuster may
intervene, it cannot be said that the case has been completely abandoned by the
defense. 
However,
Plaintiff’s repeated failure to sit for his deposition warrants more than just
monetary sanctions again.  Without such
deposition, Plaintiff cannot fairly assess any claim that Defendant has
regarding liability.  Accordingly, the
Court grants issue sanctions and hereby deems Defendant to have admitted
liability.             The Court further imposes
monetary sanctions for the necessity of filing the present motion. Given
defense counsel’s demonstrated effort to diligently communicate with Defendant
Corrado, the Court finds it appropriate to impose monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,500 against Defendant Joseph Anthony Corrado only payable to
Plaintiff within 20 days of today.
