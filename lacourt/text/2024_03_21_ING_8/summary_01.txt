And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a court case between plaintiff Brice Head and defendant Paseo Verde, LLC, et al. The case is about a motion to strike a cross-complaint filed by Reynolds Development Corporation, the defendant. The plaintiff argues that the cross-complaint was filed too late and should be struck, but the defendant argues that it was allowed to file the cross-complaint because the trial date was vacated before it was filed. The court finds that the code of civil procedure allows the cross-complaint to be filed at any time during the course of the action, and since the trial date has been vacated, the court does not understand why the plaintiff would suffer prejudice if the cross-complaint is allowed. Therefore, the court denies the motion to strike the cross-complaint.
