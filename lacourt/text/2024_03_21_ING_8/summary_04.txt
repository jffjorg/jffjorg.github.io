```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to continue the hearing, citing the parties' inability to settle their dispute themselves. The judge notes that the site inspection revealed numerous violations of prior court orders and agreements, including the height and breadth of a hedge along the defendant's driveway, the condition of an olive tree, and the pruning of queen palms. The judge finds that the defendant has willfully disobeyed prior court orders and arbitration awards, and is inclined to hold him in contempt. The judge also notes that the defendant's claims that his privacy needs outweigh the plaintiff's view rights are not relevant, as these determinations were made by prior judges. The judge will issue a tentative ruling on the record presented by the date to be agreed upon for a continuance.
