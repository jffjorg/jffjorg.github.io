Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on two motions: (1) Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance and Production of Documents and (2) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents.

Regarding the first motion, the court is granting it in part. The court orders the agreed-upon May 21 deposition of BMW's PMK on the categories noticed on November 28, 2023, but will not rule on the objections to the document categories until after the deposition proceeds.

Regarding the second motion, the court will hear oral argument and make a further ruling or continue the hearing pending submission of supplemental declarations.

The court notes that BMW has failed to produce a PMK for deposition and has cancelled deposition dates multiple times. The court is satisfied that there was a good faith meet and confer process in 2023, but notes that the parties have not taken this motion off calendar. The court also notes that BMW has proposed a date for the PMK deposition, but the court does not believe this motion is mooted as the deposition date is continuously being unilaterally postponed by BMW.
