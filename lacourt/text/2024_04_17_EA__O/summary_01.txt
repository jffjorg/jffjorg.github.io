```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The court found several defects in the application material, including numerous duplicate filings and a lack of evidence to support the damages claimed. Specifically, the court noted that the damages claimed in the case summary did not match the amount sought in the proposed judgment. Additionally, the court found that no evidence was provided to substantiate the damages claimed, including paystubs to support the claims. The court has requested that the Plaintiffs re-file their application material with each filing labeled, and that they provide a courtesy copy of the relevant papers to be provided (and filed) at least 16 court days before the hearing.
