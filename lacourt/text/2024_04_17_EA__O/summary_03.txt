And here is the summary in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case is denied with prejudice. The plaintiff, Jose Estrada, alleges that he was injured in an accident caused by a hole in the road and filed a suit against the City of Baldwin Park for premises liability and general negligence. The City filed a demurrer, which was sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint and failed to respond to discovery motions and failed to appear at hearings. The judge finds that the plaintiff's conduct throughout the litigation has been intentional and not excusable neglect. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear at hearings and to respond to discovery motions was not a one-time mistake, but a repeated pattern of conduct. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion is denied with prejudice.
