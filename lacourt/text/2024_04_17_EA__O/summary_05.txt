```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this collections case/breach of contract case, Plaintiff Scott Kawaski alleges that Defendant Allcom, Inc. failed to make payments, resulting in default judgment. The Plaintiff served written discovery, but the Defendant failed to respond. As the Defendant is in default, it has no rights or obligations in the instant action, and the Plaintiff's motion to compel response to discovery is moot. The Defendant's obligation to respond to discovery ceased when default was entered against it. The Plaintiff's motion is therefore denied."
