Background
This is an employment
case. 
On May 16, 2022,
Plaintiffs Dong Kwon Lee (“Lee”) and Eun Sook Kim (“Kim”) filed suit against
Defendant 101 Sushi Roll and Grill.
On June 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)[1]
against Defendants SM.Kan Inc. dba 101 Sushi Roll and Grill (“Sushi 101”) and
individual Defendant Sungmin Jeon (“Jeon”)[2]
asserting the following causes of action: 
(1) Failure To Pay Overtime Wages In
Violation Of Labor Code § 204, 510 (2) Failure To Pay Minimum Wages In
Violation Of Labor Code § 1194, 1194.2, 1197.1 
(3) Failure To Provide Meal Periods In
Violation Of Labor Code § 226.7, 512 
(4) Failure To Provide Rest Periods In
Violation Of Labor Code § 226.7 
(5) Failure To Provide Split Shift Premium
Pay 
(6) Conversion 
(7) Failure To Provide Final Wages At
Separation In Violation Of Labor Code § 201, 203 
(8) Violation Of California Business And
Professions Code § 17200
 
On October 3, 2022,
the court granted prior counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel. 
On October 6, 2022,
default was entered against SM.KAN, Inc., a California corporation doing
business as 101 Sushi Roll &Grill and Jeon. According to the proofs
of service (POS) filed on 8/18/22, Defendants were served via substituted
service by giving the papers to Jon Kim—Manager—Person in Charge of Office at
15347 Gale Avenue in the City of Industry. Thus, service was proper. 
On February 17, 2023,
the court denied the default judgment. Though the ruling was to deny without
prejudice, the court stated that the FAC amounts to open-ended liability such
that should Plaintiffs seek default judgment, they are to file a new amended
complaint. That same day, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (SAC)
against the same defendants. 
On August 16, 2023,
default was entered against Sushi 101 and Jeon. 
On February 13, 2024,
Plaintiff filed numerous filings in support of its application for default
judgment. 
Discussion
There are a couple of
notable defects with the application material. 
First,
there are numerous duplicate filings. The court requests that Plaintiffs file pertinent application
material and appropriately label each filing (e.g., “Summary of Case for Lee”;
“Proposed Judgment for Lee”). 
Second,
the damages provided in the case summary do not match the amount sought in
default judgment. For
example, the case summary states that Lee “is entitled to $166,395.52 for
compensatory/statutory damages, in addition to attorney’s fees and costs” (Case
Summary p. 4:27-28), but the proposed judgment (JUD-100) form filed for Lee
seeks only $125,209.18. As for Kim, “Lee [sic] is entitled to
$122,430.21 for compensatory/statutory damages, in addition to attorney’s fees
and costs” (Case Summary p. 5:22-23), but the demand of the complaint as stated
on Kim’s proposed order is $91,363.98. Thus, as the explanation of damages do
not comport with the actual compensatory damages sought, that is a reason to
deny the default judgment application. 
Third,
and importantly, Plaintiffs have provided no evidence in support of their
damages. For example, no
paystubs have been provided to substantiate the claims (e.g., time period
worked or hourly wage). As iterated by the appellate court in Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, “[t]he
court must then compare the properly pled damages for each defaulting party
with the evidence offered in the prove-up.” (Id. at p. 272-273.) Here,
with no evidence provided, Plaintiffs have failed to meet the requirements of
CCP section 585. 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the application is denied without prejudice, notably for the lack of
evidence. Plaintiff is to re-file its application material with each filing
labeled. Additionally, the court requests a courtesy copy of the
relevant papers to be provided (and filed) at least 16 court days before the
hearing.
