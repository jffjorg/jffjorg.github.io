PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING DEFENDANT TO

Legal
Standard
 
Interrogatories: If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: (a)
The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise
the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection
to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product…. (b) The party propounding the interrogatories may move for
an order compelling response to the interrogatories.” CCP § 2030.290. 
 
RFPs: “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product….(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand.”
 
Discussion
 
On October
24, 2023, Plaintiff served written discovery to Allcom, the judgment debtor in
default, in the form of special interrogatories and requests for production. To
date, no response has been received. 
 
Here, perhaps Defendants has not
responded nor objected to discovery because the corporation is in default.” A defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is
not entitled to take any further affirmative steps in the action.(Bailey
v. Citbank, N.A. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 335, 347; Steven M. Garber &
Assocs. V. Eskandarian (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 813, 819.) In fact, a
defendant has no right to notice of subsequent proceedings nor even right to
participate in proceedings. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984)
155 Cal.3d 381, 385-386.) Therefore, the basis of Plaintiff’s discovery motion
is unclear when Defendant is in default (and default judgment has been
entered). 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as Defendant
is in default such that it has no rights nor obligations in the instant action,
the motion is moot.
