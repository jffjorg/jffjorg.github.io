##  Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22STCV04700
**Plaintiffs:** Claudia Maldonado and Salvador Mendoza
**Defendants:** Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network, Torrance Radiology Medical Group, Richard Huete, M.D., and Albert Grabb, M.D.

**Summary:**

The court denied the motion for summary judgment brought by defendants Albert Grabb, M.D., and Torrance Radiology Medical Group. The motion argued that the care provided to plaintiff Claudia Maldonado met the standard of care and did not cause her injuries.  

**Key Points:**

* **Medical Malpractice Allegations:** Plaintiffs allege medical malpractice based on the care provided to Claudia during her pregnancy, including an ultrasound interpretation that suggested a miscarriage.
* **Expert Testimony:** Both sides presented expert declarations:
    * **Dr. Roossin (Defendant's expert):** Opined that Dr. Grabb's interpretation of the ultrasound was within the standard of care and that his care did not cause plaintiff's injuries.
    * **Dr. Benson (Plaintiff's expert):** Opined that Dr. Grabb's interpretation fell below the standard of care and that it likely contributed to the decision to administer misoprostol, which ultimately led to plaintiff's hysterectomy.
* **Triable Issues of Material Fact:** The court found that Dr. Benson's testimony raised triable issues of material fact regarding the standard of care and causation, preventing summary judgment.

**Legal Authority:**

* **Code of Civil Procedure section 437c:** Governs motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication.
* **Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.:** Establishes the purpose of summary judgment as a mechanism to determine if trial is necessary.
* **Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.:**  Defines the burden on the moving party in a summary judgment motion.
* **Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.:** Explains the initial burden on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of triable issues.
* **Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center:** Discusses the standard of care in medical malpractice cases and the role of expert testimony.
* **Simmons v. West Covina Medical Clinic:** Defines the elements of a medical malpractice claim.
* **Starr v. Mooslin:** Explains the requirement of expert testimony in medical malpractice cases.


**Disputes:**

* **Standard of Care:** Whether Dr. Grabb's interpretation of the ultrasound fell below the applicable standard of care.
* **Causation:** Whether Dr. Grabb's interpretation contributed to the decision to administer misoprostol and ultimately led to plaintiff's hysterectomy.



**Next Steps:**

The case will proceed to trial.  

*Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the ruling.*

  case\_number: 22STCV04700
  hearing\_date: September 21, 2023
  moving\_parties:
    - Torrance Memorial Medical Center
    - Torrance Memorial Physicians Network
    - Torrance Radiology Medical Group
    - Richard Huete, M.D.
    - Albert Grabb, M.D.
  responding\_party:
    - Claudia Maldonado
    - Salvador Mendoza
  tentative\_ruling: denied
  background:
    - Claudia Maldonado and Salvador Mendoza filed a Complaint against the moving parties based on the medical treatment provided by defendants to Claudia regarding her pregnancy.
  legal\_authority:
    - The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve the dispute.
    - The trial judge must grant summary judgment if all evidence shows that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
  discussion:
    - Defendants Albert Grabb, M.D. and Torrance Radiology Medical Group requested summary judgment on the grounds that the care rendered to plaintiff Claudia Mendoza by defendants met the applicable standard of care, defendants did not cause plaintiff’s injuries, and since there is no liability as to these moving defendants, plaintiff Salvador Maldonado’s derivative claim for loss of consortium must fail.
    - The complaint alleges that around June 2020, plaintiff Claudia discovered that she was pregnant and consulted and engaged for compensation defendants to competently provide medical services.
    - Defendants ordered and performed an ultrasound on Claudia, which showed evidence of a fetus with a heartbeat.
    - As a result of these actions, Claudia was forced to undergo a hysterectomy.
    - The elements of medical malpractice are: (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence.
    - Defendants presented the declaration of radiologist Michael Roossin, M.D., who opines that Dr. Grabb’s interpretation of the ultrasound was within the standard of care.
    - Plaintiffs presented the declaration of radiologist Carol Benson, M.D., who opines that based on her education, training, and experience, and review of the ultrasound, Dr. Grabb’s report fell below the standard of care.
    - Plaintiffs also presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Ricardo Huete who testified that it was a judgment call that the pregnancy was not viable and that it was sufficient to rely upon the reports from the ultrasonographer.

significant\_statements:
  - The court finds that moving defendants have met their initial burden through the declaration of Dr. Roossin that Dr. Grabb’s treatment of plaintiff met the standard of care of his medical profession and did not cause plaintiff’s injury.
  - The court also finds that plaintiffs have met their responsive burden by presenting conflicting evidence through Dr. Benson’s expert testimony to raise triable issues of material fact as to whether moving defendants’ care and treatment rendered to plaintiff Claudia was within the applicable standard of care and whether defendants’ conclusions regarding the ultrasound caused and contributed to plaintiffs’ injuries.
  - Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
