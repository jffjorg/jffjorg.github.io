**Case Number:** 22STCV04700
**Plaintiffs:** Claudia Maldonado and Salvador Mendoza
**Defendants:** Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network, Torrance Radiology Medical Group, Richard Huete, M.D., and Albert Grabb, M.D.

**Summary:**

The court denied the motion for summary judgment brought by defendants Albert Grabb, M.D., and Torrance Radiology Medical Group. The motion argued that the care provided to plaintiff Claudia Maldonado met the standard of care and did not cause her injuries.  

**Key Points:**

* **Medical Malpractice Allegations:** Plaintiffs allege medical malpractice based on the care provided to Claudia during her pregnancy, including an ultrasound interpretation that suggested a miscarriage.
* **Expert Testimony:** Both sides presented expert declarations:

    * **Dr. Benson (Plaintiff's expert):** Opined that Dr. Grabb's interpretation fell below the standard of care and that it likely contributed to the decision to administer misoprostol, which ultimately led to plaintiff's hysterectomy.
* **Triable Issues of Material Fact:** The court found that Dr. Benson's testimony raised triable issues of material fact regarding the standard of care and causation, preventing summary judgment.

**Legal Authority:**

* **Code of Civil Procedure section 437c:** Governs motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication.
* **Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.:** Establishes the purpose of summary judgment as a mechanism to determine if trial is necessary.

    - Claudia Maldonado

  tentative\_ruling: denied
  background:
    - Claudia Maldonado and Salvador Mendoza filed a Complaint against the moving parties based on the medical treatment provided by defendants to Claudia regarding her pregnancy.
  legal\_authority:
    - The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve the dispute.
    - The trial judge must grant summary judgment if all evidence shows that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
  discussion:
    - Defendants Albert Grabb, M.D. and Torrance Radiology Medical Group requested summary judgment on the grounds that the care rendered to plaintiff Claudia Mendoza by defendants met the applicable standard of care, defendants did not cause plaintiff’s injuries, and since there is no liability as to these moving defendants, plaintiff Salvador Maldonado’s derivative claim for loss of consortium must fail.
    - The complaint alleges that around June 2020, plaintiff Claudia discovered that she was pregnant and consulted and engaged for compensation defendants to competently provide medical services.
    - Defendants ordered and performed an ultrasound on Claudia, which showed evidence of a fetus with a heartbeat.

    - Plaintiffs also presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Ricardo Huete who testified that it was a judgment call that the pregnancy was not viable and that it was sufficient to rely upon the reports from the ultrasonographer.

significant\_statements:
  - The court finds that moving defendants have met their initial burden through the declaration of Dr. Roossin that Dr. Grabb’s treatment of plaintiff met the standard of care of his medical profession and did not cause plaintiff’s injury.
  - The court also finds that plaintiffs have met their responsive burden by presenting conflicting evidence through Dr. Benson’s expert testimony to raise triable issues of material fact as to whether moving defendants’ care and treatment rendered to plaintiff Claudia was within the applicable standard of care and whether defendants’ conclusions regarding the ultrasound caused and contributed to plaintiffs’ injuries.
  - Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is DENIED.

## Case Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22STCV04700
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Plaintiffs:** Claudia Maldonado and Salvador Mendoza
**Defendants:** Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network, Torrance Radiology Medical Group, Richard Huete, M.D., and Albert Grabb, M.D.

**Background:**

Claudia Maldonado sued the defendants for medical malpractice related to her pregnancy. She claims that  Dr. Grabb's interpretation of an ultrasound, which suggested a miscarriage, led to her receiving misoprostol and ultimately a hysterectomy.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Standard of Care:** Did Dr. Grabb meet the accepted standard of care for radiologists when interpreting the ultrasound? 
* **Causation:** Did Dr. Grabb's interpretation directly cause the injuries suffered by Claudia Maldonado?

**Arguments:**

* **Defendants:** Argued that Dr. Grabb's interpretation was within the standard of care and that he did not cause Claudia's injuries.  They relied on the declaration of radiologist Dr. Michael Roossin who supported their position.
* **Plaintiffs:** Argued that Dr. Grabb's interpretation was below the standard of care and contributed to Claudia's injuries. They relied on the declaration of radiologist Dr. Carol Benson, who offered a different interpretation of the ultrasound.

**Ruling:**

The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. 

**Reasoning:**

The court found that both sides presented conflicting expert opinions regarding the standard of care and causation. This creates a triable issue of fact, meaning the case needs to proceed to trial to determine the validity of each expert's claims.


**Significance:**

This ruling means the case will proceed to trial where a jury will ultimately decide whether the defendants are liable for medical malpractice.

**Case Number: 22STCV04700**

**Plaintiffs:** Claudia Mendoza, Salvador Mendoza

**Defendants:** Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network, Torrance Radiology Medical Group, Richard Huete, M.D., Albert Grabb, M.D.

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Ruling:** The motion for summary judgment is denied.

**Background:** The case involves medical treatment provided by defendants to plaintiff Claudia Mendoza regarding her pregnancy.

**Legal Analysis:**

* The purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve the dispute.
* The court must grant summary judgment if there are no triable issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
* The initial burden is on the moving party to show that there are no triable issues of material fact.
* If the defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists.

**Discussion:**

* Defendants Albert Grabb, M.D. and Torrance Radiology Medical Group request summary judgment on the grounds that they met the applicable standard of care, did not cause plaintiff's injuries, and therefore plaintiff Salvador Maldonado's derivative claim for loss of consortium must fail.
* Plaintiff Claudia Mendoza discovered she was pregnant in June 2020 and engaged defendants to provide medical services for her pregnancy.
* Defendants ordered an ultrasound on July 21, 2020, which was interpreted by Dr. Grabb as an irregular gestational sac in the lower uterine segment without a pole, suggesting an abortion in progress.
* Dr. Heute prescribed Claudia a drug to help purge the alleged deceased fetus.
* Another ultrasound was ordered and performed, revealing a fetus with a heartbeat.
* As a result, Claudia was forced to undergo a hysterectomy, depriving plaintiffs of the ability to birth additional children.
* The elements of medical malpractice include duty, breach, causation, and actual loss or damage.
* Defendants argue that their conduct fell within the community standard of care.
* Plaintiffs present the declaration of radiologist Carol Benson, M.D., who opines that Dr. Grabb's impression fell below the standard of care.
* The ultrasound demonstrated a normally developing pregnancy, not a failed pregnancy or abortion in progress.
* Dr. Benson opines that Dr. Grabb's report contributed significantly to Dr. Huete's conclusion that Claudia had experienced a failed pregnancy.
* Plaintiffs also present Dr. Huete's deposition testimony that it was a judgment call to conclude that the pregnancy was not viable.

**Court's Conclusion:**

* Defendants have met their initial burden through the declaration of Dr. Roossin.
* Plaintiffs have met their responsive burden by presenting conflicting evidence through Dr. Benson's expert testimony.
* Triable issues of material fact exist as to whether moving defendants' care and treatment rendered to plaintiff Claudia was within the applicable standard of care and whether defendants' conclusions regarding the ultrasound caused and contributed to plaintiffs' injuries.
* The motion for summary judgment is denied.
