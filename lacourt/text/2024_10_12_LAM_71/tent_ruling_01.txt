 Hearing
  Date:  October 11, 2024



 
Petitioner
State Farm Automobile Insurance Company’s unopposed motion to compel the
deposition of Respondent Mariam Ahmadi is granted.  Respondent is
ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this ruling.
Petitioner’s
request for sanctions against Respondent is denied.
 
          Petitioner
State Farm Automobile Insurance Company (“State Farm”) (“Petitioner”) moves unopposed
to compel
the deposition of Respondent Mariam Ahmadi (“Ahmadi”) (“Respondent”) to appear
for deposition within thirty (30) days of this Court’s ruling.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§2023.010, 2025.010, et seq.)  Petitioner
also requests sanctions in the total amount of $1,731.50 against Petitioner and
her counsel, comprised of $921.50 in costs incurred for failing to appear for
her previously noticed deposition and $810.00 for costs incurred on the instant
motion.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Meet and Confer
A motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Petitioner’s counsel’s declaration does not indicate if he
attempted to meet and confer with Respondent’s counsel.  (See Decl. of Deenihan.)  Petitioner’s counsel’s declaration does not
substantially comply with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Regardless, the Court in its discretion will
consider Petitioner’s motion.
 
Background
On March 21, 2024, Petitioner served on
Respondent’s counsel a notice for the deposition of Respondent set for June 20,
2024, at 10:00 a.m.  (Decl. of Deenihan ¶3, Exh. A.)  
Respondent did not appear for the
deposition and a notice of non-appearance was taken.  (Decl. of Deenihan ¶¶4-5, Exh.
B.)  
Petitioner filed the instant motion on
August 23, 2024.  As of the date of this
hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part,
“[t]he service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to
require any deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent
part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          The
Court grants Petitioner’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Respondent
to appear
for deposition within thirty (30) days of this Court’s ruling.  Respondent
was properly served with a deposition notice and failed to appear for a
properly noticed deposition.
          Accordingly,
Petitioner’s motion is granted.
 
Sanctions
Petitioner’s request for sanctions
against Respondent is denied on the basis Petitioner failed to meet and confer
with Respondent’s counsel on the instant motion.
The Court also notes that May 20, 2024,
Petitioner filed a notice of suspension of Respondent’s counsel.  It does not appear Respondent was served with
the notice of her deposition, nor the instant motion; rather, Respondent’s
counsel was served on March 21, 2024, and August 23, 2024, respectively.
 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s unopposed motion to compel is granted.  Respondent to appear for deposition with 30
days of this ruling.  Petitioner is
directed to re-serve Respondent directly with the notice of deposition
based on the likelihood Respondent had no knowledge of the deposition notice. 
Moving Defendants’ request for sanctions against
Plaintiff is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling directly to Respondent.
