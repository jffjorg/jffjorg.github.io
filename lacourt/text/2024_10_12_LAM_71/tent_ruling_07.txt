TENTATIVE RULING
 



ANGELIA BRADLEY,  
  
         vs.
 
ELAINE CHOU, et al.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV01611
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  October 11, 2024



 
Defendants Elaine Chou’s and Sharon Chou’s
unopposed demurrer to pro per Plaintiff Angelia Bradley’s complaint
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
          Defendants Elaine Chou (“Elaine”) and
Sharon Chou’s (“Sharon”) (collectively, “Defendants”) demur unopposed to
pro per Plaintiff Angelia Bradley’s (“Bradley”) (“Plaintiff”) complaint
(“Complaint”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 1.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the moving party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendants’ counsel declares that on August 1, 2024, she
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff regarding the instant demurrer and
left a voicemail, but never received a response.  (See Decl. of Movsessian ¶¶3, 5.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41. 
Accordingly, the Court will consider Defendants’ demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff filed her operative one-page
Complaint against Defendants on January 22, 2024, alleging twenty-eight causes
of action.
          Defendants filed the instant demurrer
on August 14, 2024.  As of the date of
this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to the 1st through 28th causes of action on the
basis each cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes
of action against Defendants and is defectively uncertain.  (Demurrer, pgs. 3-11; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Entire Complaint
A complaint, to be sufficient, must contain a statement of facts
which, without the aid of other conjectured facts not stated, shows a complete
cause of action.  (Going v. Dinwiddie
(1890) 86 Cal. 633, 637; Hawkins v. Oakland Title Insurance & Guaranty
Co. (1958) 165 Cal.App.2d 116, 122.)
Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint consists of a single page that lists
twenty-eight causes of action without a single factual allegation in
support.  Plaintiff fails to allege a
single element of any of the twenty-eight causes of action listed.
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,
6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th,
20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th causes of action in
Plaintiff’s Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th,
19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th causes of action
in Plaintiff’s Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
