And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the unopposed demurrer filed by defendants Elaine Chou and Sharon Chou to the complaint filed by plaintiff Angelia Bradley. The defendants argue that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is defectively uncertain. The judge agrees and sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' attempt to meet and confer, and the complaint lacks factual allegations to support the 28 causes of action listed. The judge will consider the defendants' demurrer and will not consider declarations or other extrinsic evidence. The plaintiff is granted 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
