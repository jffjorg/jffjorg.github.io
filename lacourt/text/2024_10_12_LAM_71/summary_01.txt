And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of State Farm Automobile Insurance Company's unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Mariam Ahmadi. Ahmadi failed to appear for a previously scheduled deposition and did not respond to the motion. The judge finds that Ahmadi was properly served with the deposition notice and that State Farm has shown good cause for compelling her attendance and testimony. The judge orders Ahmadi to appear for deposition within 30 days of the ruling. State Farm's request for sanctions against Ahmadi in the amount of $1,731.50 was denied, as State Farm failed to meet and confer with Ahmadi's counsel on the motion.
