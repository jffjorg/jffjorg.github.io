  Case No.:  20STCV05697
  Hearing Date:  March 18, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to establish
  admissions 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 13, 2020, Plaintiff
Cecile Lopez Macabagdal initiated this action against Defendants Norman Roy
Levine and Hancock Plaza Homeowners Association, Inc. arising from alleged
habitability issues. Defendant Levine was allegedly Plaintiff’s landlord.
However, Levine died in January 2021. On July 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint adding Herschel Manalo, the trustee of Levine’s estate, as a
Defendant. Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint on April 24,
2023. 
            On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to deem matters admitted as against Defendant Manalo.
Defendant filed his opposition on March 5, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Responses to requests for admission are
due thirty days after service of the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250(a).) If a party fails to timely respond to RFAs, the propounding party
may move to deem the matters admitted. (Id., § 2033.280(b).) The motion
must be granted unless the responding party serves substantially compliant
responses before the hearing on the motion. (Id., subd. (c).) Monetary
sanctions are mandatory regardless of whether the matters are deemed admitted
and regardless of substantial justification. (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
The Admissions
Plaintiff served the RFAs on November 14,
2023. (Burton Decl. ¶ 1.) Defendant requested an extension to January 9, 2024,
and Plaintiff granted it. (Id., ¶ 2, Ex. 2.) Defendant did not serve
responses by this date, and on February 9, 2024, Plaintiff requested verified responses
without objection by February 12, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3.) Defense counsel replied
that responses would be served by “tomorrow.” (Id., Ex. 3.) Plaintiff’s
counsel claims that at the time this motion was filed on February 14, 2024,
Defendant had not served any responses to the RFAs. (Id., ¶ 4.)  
            In opposition, defense counsel avers
that he emailed Defendant’s RFA responses on February 14, 2024 shortly before
Plaintiff filed the motion. (Uss Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 3.) Defense counsel spoke with
Plaintiff’s counsel telephonically to inquire about the filing of the motion
after responses had already been received. (Id., ¶ 12.) Plaintiff’s counsel
stated that their firm’s practice is to proceed with filing a motion once it
has been prepared. (Ibid.) On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served
a meet and confer letter requesting “further” responses to certain RFAs. (Id.,
Ex. 8.) This confirms that Defendant served responses at least prior to the
hearing on the motion. The responses are substantially compliant with Section
2033.220. (See Uss Decl., Ex. 4.) Therefore, the requests are not deemed admitted.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)    
II.
Sanctions
            Ordinarily, sanctions are mandatory against
the party “whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) However, Defendant’s
failure to timely respond would not have “necessitated” the motion if Defendant
had already responded prior to the motion being filed. Therefore, sanctions are
not warranted.  
III.
Relief from Waiver of Objections
            The failure to timely respond to
RFAs results in waiver of objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).)
However, the Court may relieve a party from this wavier if (1) the party serves
substantially compliant responses, and (2) the failure to timely respond was
caused by mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Ibid.)     
            As discussed above, the responses are
substantially compliant. Defendant’s failure to timely respond was also caused
by excusable neglect because defense counsel was out of office due to a medical
emergency and believed that another attorney from the firm would handle Defendant’s
responses to discovery. (Uss Decl. ¶¶ 19-21.)   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to establish
admissions is DENIED. Sanctions are denied. Objections are not waived.
