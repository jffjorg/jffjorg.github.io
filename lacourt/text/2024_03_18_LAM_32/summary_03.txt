And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference, which was filed on behalf of minor Ariana Nazaretyan. The plaintiffs argued that Ariana has a substantial interest in the case because she was exposed to uninhabitable conditions, suffered injuries, and is seeking significant damages. However, the judge found that Ariana's interest is "tangential" compared to the adult plaintiffs, who are the primary litigants and will provide most of the evidence. The judge concluded that the statute requiring preference for minors does not apply in this case, as the minor's interest is not substantial enough to warrant expedited trial.
