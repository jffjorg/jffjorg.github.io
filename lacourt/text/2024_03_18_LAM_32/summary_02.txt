English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from the defendant, Casa de la Familia, in part. The plaintiff seeks information about other complaints against Aquino, the defendant's potential knowledge of Aquino's pattern of misconduct, and the contact information of complainants. The Court finds that the information sought is directly relevant to establishing a pattern of misconduct and the defendant's knowledge thereof. The Court also finds that the defendant has not established a reasonable expectation of privacy in mere contact information and that the information sought is necessary to establish the defendant's liability.

The Court orders the defendant to provide further responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests within 15 days of the order. The production shall be subject to a protective order. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial justification.
