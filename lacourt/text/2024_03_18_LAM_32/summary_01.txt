And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's motion to establish admissions against defendant Herschel Manalo. The plaintiff had served requests for admission (RFAs) on November 14, 2023, and defendant Manalo failed to respond timely. However, defendant Manalo served responses on or before February 14, 2024, which are substantially compliant with the relevant code section. The court finds that defendant Manalo's failure to respond timely was caused by excusable neglect due to a medical emergency. Therefore, sanctions are denied, and the plaintiff's motion is denied.
