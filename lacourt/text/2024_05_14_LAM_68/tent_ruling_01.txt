Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record for Plaintiff
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On October 28, 2019, Plaintiff Kelechi Abanobi loaned Defendant Glen Quilter $15,000 pursuant to a
written promissory note. The amount was to be repaid no later than December 30,
2020. Defendant purportedly paid $1,500 and defaulted on the remaining balance.

 
On January 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1.
Breach Of Written Promissory Note; 2. Money Lent; 3. Intentional
Misrepresentation; 4. Negligent Misrepresentation; 5. Declaratory Relief. The
complaint also includes a second fifth cause of action for judicial foreclosure
indicating a secured interest against a non-named defendant. On March 3, 2022,
the clerk entered defaults against Glen Quilter; Financial Investor Group LLC;
Secure Deals 1 LLC. On march 115, 2022, the clerk entered a default against
Jaaron Quilter. 
 
On June 29, 2022, the court granted the order setting
aside the defaults against Glen and Jaaron Quilter. On July 14, 2022, and
August 31, 2022, Glen and Jaaron Quilter, both in pro per, filed General
Denials. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for Defendant The Ghaoui Group moves to be relieved
as counsel of record, due to a lack of communication with the client. 
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the the lack of communication with the client thereby imipacting the
attorney relationship. The will meet counsel in chambers, if requested. (Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court,
supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves v. Superior Court (1996)
51 Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.) The motion otherwise complies with all
procedural requirements. The motion is therefore granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client. 
 
OSC re: Default Judgment set for July 9, 2024.
