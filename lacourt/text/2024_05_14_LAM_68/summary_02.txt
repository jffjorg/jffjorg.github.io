And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The defendant, Samuel Welch, had moved to compel further responses to requests for production of documents numbers 4, 9, and 12 from plaintiff Glen'Nesha Denham. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses consisted of references to other items, which constitute an improper and factually incomplete answer. The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.240 within 30 days of the order. The judge also reserved the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion and invited the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the provision of supplemental responses, when possible.
