The plaintiffs moved to strike the answer, but the defendants argued that the motion was untimely and that they had filed an amended answer that resolved the concerns raised by the plaintiffs. The Judge found that the amended answer was timely filed and rendered the motion moot. The Judge also declined to grant the defendants' request for expenses.
