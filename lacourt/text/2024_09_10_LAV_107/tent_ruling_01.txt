I. BACKGROUND
 

Factual

 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs Pete Vithoulkas
(“Pete”) and Fatoumata Vithoulkas (“Fatoumata”) filed an action against
Defendants Pouria Ourmazdi, as an individual (“Pouria”), Pouria Ourmazdi, as
Trustee to the Everly Scott Living Trust (“Trust”), and Does 1 through 100 for
19 different causes of action. 
Plaintiffs allege that they were tenants of a residential property
located at 14934 W. Addison Street, Los Angeles, CA, 91403, and Defendants were
the landlords as owners and managers of the property.  The Complaint alleges numerous habitability
violations present on the property and the resulting damages sustained by
Plaintiffs.

On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this action
against Defendants.
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendants filed an Answer.
 
On July 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion
to Strike Answer in Its Entirety or Alternatively, Portions of the Answer, and
Request for Default (“Motion”).
 
On August 2, 2024, Defendants filed an amended Answer.
On September 5, 2024, Defendants filed a late
Opposition to the Motion.
 
II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
 

Timeliness
     of Filings

 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§430.40, subdivision (b), a plaintiff has 10 days after service of an answer to
file a demurrer to the answer.  Since a
motion to strike an answer may be brought, “within the time allowed to respond
to a pleading,” a motion to strike an answer must likewise be filed within 10
days after service of the answer.  (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 435, subd. (b)(1), 435, subd. (b); CRC Rule 3.1322(b).)  Judges have discretion as to whether to
consider or strike an untimely demurrer or pleading.  (McAllister v. County of Monterey
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d
193, 196, disapproved on other grounds
by Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6
Cal.3d 176.)
 
Here, the Answer was filed on June 28,
2024, and served electronically on the same day.  On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Strike Answer.  Although the
Motion was not filed timely, the Court, in its discretion considers the Motion.
 
The Court also notes that the Opposition
to the Motion was not filed timely, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005, subdivision (b).  However,
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subdivision (d), the Court,
in its discretion considers the Opposition.
 
III. LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may also strike all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.  (Id. at § 436, subd. (b).)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  (Id. at § 437.)
 
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5
requires that “[b]efore filing a motion to strike pursuant to this chapter, the
moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to
be raised in the motion to strike.” 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 435.5, subd. (a).)
 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel asserts that on July
15, 2024, he attempted to meet and confer with defense counsel by
telephone.  (Partiyelli Decl. ¶ 3.)  He was unable to reach defense counsel and
left a message on his phone.  (Ibid.)  Defense counsel did not return his call, and
the parties did not reach a resolution. 
(Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs move to strike the Answer,
filed by Defendants on June 28, 2024, on the ground that the Answer is not
drawn in conformity with the laws of the State of California and is irrelevant
and improper.  More specifically,
Defendants’ Answer contains a general denial to the verified complaint, which
is contrary to well-established law and Code of Civil Procedure section 431.30,
subdivision (d).  The answer to a
verified complaint must contain a specific denial to each allegation or a
denial according to Defendant’s information and belief.
 
Defendants oppose the Motion on the
following grounds.  First, the Motion is
untimely as it was not filed within 10 days of the Answer being served, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.40, subdivision (b) and 435,
subdivision (b)(1).  Second, Defendants
filed a timely amended answer on August 2, 2024, in conformity with Code of
Civil Procedure section 472, resolving Plaintiffs’ concerns about the original
Answer.  Third, Plaintiffs failed to file
a declaration demonstrating their efforts to meet and confer and they refused
to meet and confer in good faith. 
According to defense counsel, Plaintiffs failed to respond to multiple
attempts to meet and confer and resolve the issue without judicial intervention.  (Solberg Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.)  As a result, Defendants seek sanctions
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 in the amount of $1,400 for
unnecessarily opposing the Motion and appearing at the hearing.  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  Sanctions are calculated as follows: three
hours to draft the Opposition and an hour to appear at the hearing, at a
billing rate of $350 per hour.  (Ibid.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 472,
subdivision (a) states:
 
A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the
parties. The time for responding to an amended pleading shall be computed from
the date of service of the amended pleading.
 
Here, the Motion was filed on July 26,
2024, and set for hearing on September 10, 2024.  Defendants filed the amended Answer on August
2, 2024, prior to the deadline for filing an Opposition, as set forth in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).  Thus, the Court finds that the amended Answer
was timely filed and renders Plaintiffs’ Motion moot.
 
Although pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.5 the Court may order a party or its attorney to pay
reasonable expenses “as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that
are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,” the Court does
not find Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion in bad faith and declines to grant
Defendants’ request for expenses.
 
Accordingly, the instant Motion is denied
as moot.
 
Plaintiffs to give notice.
