And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further discovery responses filed by Plaintiff Maribel S. Medina. The Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) to interrogatories and requests for production.

Regarding the interrogatories, the Court finds that LACCD's objections to special interrogatories Nos. 15 and 16 are meritless. LACCD claims that the information sought is protected by the official information privilege, but fails to show that answering these interrogatories would violate the absolute or conditional privilege. The Court orders LACCD to serve further verified responses to these interrogatories within 30 days.

Regarding the requests for production, the Court finds that LACCD's responses are inadequate and incomplete. The Court orders LACCD to serve a privilege log and further verified responses to the disputed requests for production within 30 days. The Court also orders defendants Francisco C. Rodriguez and Steven F. Veres to serve similar responses.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff's need for disclosure outweighs the witnesses' privacy rights, and that a protective order will be sufficient to mitigate any intrusion. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's counsel should deal with these witnesses with courtesy and civility.

Finally, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions against the defendants, as they acted with substantial justification in opposing the motions. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer regarding a stipulated protective order within seven days.
