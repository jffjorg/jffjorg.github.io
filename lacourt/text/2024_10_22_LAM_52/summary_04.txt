And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Earthly Treats, Inc., has moved for judgment on the pleadings in this case, arguing that the packaging of its sweet potato tortilla chips is not deceptive and that the plaintiff, Simon Oh, has not alleged sufficient facts to support his claims. The court has reviewed the pleadings and has concluded that the issue of whether the packaging is deceptive is a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings. The court has also concluded that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the packaging was likely to mislead consumers.

The court has also considered the defendant's argument that the plaintiff lacks standing for injunctive relief, but has concluded that this is not a proper subject for judgment on the pleadings. The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and has allowed the case to proceed to trial.
