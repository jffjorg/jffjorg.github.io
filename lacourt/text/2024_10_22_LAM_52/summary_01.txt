And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Odalis C. Suarez's motion to set aside the order granting in part In Action Realtors, Inc.'s motion to tax costs. Suarez made a mistake or had excusable neglect in not submitting admissible evidence of costs, but acted with reasonable diligence in seeking relief. The judge finds that Suarez's mistake did not prejudice In Action Realtors, Inc. and that Suarez has met her burden of showing all $10,618.03 in costs claimed via her memorandum of costs were recoverable. The court sets aside its previous order and grants Suarez's motion to set aside.
