And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Cross-Defendants' motion for sanctions against Cross-Complainants and their counsel. Cross-Defendants alleged that Cross-Complainants' Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's Verbal Order Reopening Discovery was frivolous and lacked evidentiary support. However, the court found that Cross-Complainants' motion was based on facts that arose in connection with the Minute Order, which made express factual findings that precluded a finding of prejudice to support a continuance of the trial. The court also found that Cross-Complainants' motion was not objectively unreasonable, as it was based on a reasonable interpretation of the court's order and the applicable law. Therefore, the court denied Cross-Defendants' motion for sanctions.
