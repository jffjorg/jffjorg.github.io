Cross-Defendants ACA LLC’s and Damian Akhavi’s motion for
sanctions against Cross-Complainants and their counsel
Dennis P. Riley is denied.
 
Cross-Defendants ACA LLC (“ACA”) and Damian Akhavi (“Akhavi”)
(collectively “Cross-Defendants”) move for sanctions against Cross-Complainants and their
counsel, Dennis P. Riley, jointly and severally, in the amount of $12,570, including
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in preparing this motion and all
such fees that have been incurred as a direct result of Cross-Complainants’
filing of their Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s Verbal Order Reopening
Discovery and May 31, 2024 Order Continuing Trial Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§1008” (“Motion for Reconsideration”).  (Notice Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §128.7.)  Specifically, Cross-Defendants move for sanctions
on the ground the Motion for Reconsideration is frivolous, not warranted by existing
law, and the factual allegations contained therein lack evidentiary support.  (Notice Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §128.7.)  
 
Legal Standard
An attorney or unrepresented party who
presents a pleading, motion or similar paper to the court makes an implied
“certification” as to its legal and factual merit; and is subject to sanctions
for violation of this certification.  (C.C.P.
§128.7.)
A C.C.P. §128.7 motion involves a two-step process. The
moving party first serves the sanctions motion on the offending party without
filing it. The opposing party then has 21 days to withdraw the
improper pleading and avoid sanctions (the so-called “safe harbor” waiting
period). At the end of the waiting period, if the pleading is not withdrawn,
the moving party may then file the motion.  (C.C.P. §128.7(c)(1); Primo Hospitality
Group, Inc. v. Haney (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 165, 173-174; Martorana v.
Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 698-699.)
          Whether the
certificate is violated is tested objectively—i.e., whether the paper filed is
frivolous, legally unreasonable or without factual foundation. “The actual
belief standard . . . requires a well-founded belief. We measure the
truth-finding inquiry’s reasonableness under an objective standard, and apply
this standard both to attorneys and to their clients.”  (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 82; Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 124, 135; Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428,
440 [“A claim is objectively unreasonable if any reasonable attorney would
agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.”].)
Under §128.7, “it is not necessary to show the party acted
with an improper motive or subjective bad faith. But the fact that a party does
not actually believe in the merits of his or her claim is relevant to the issue
whether sanctions are warranted in the particular case.”  (Peake, 227 Cal.App.4th at pg. 449.)
 
Discussion
Cross-Defendants’ motion for sanctions is denied.
There is no violation of the certification unless the
“primary” purpose is to harass or cause needless delay or expense.  If a claim is “nonfrivolous,” then as a matter
of law it is “not presented for an improper purpose.”  (Ponce v. Wells Fargo Bank (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
253, 265.)
Here, Cross-Complainants’ motion for reconsideration was
based on facts that arose in connection with the Minute Order issued by the
court after the briefing and hearing on the motion for leave to amend as follows:
(1) The Minute Order made express factual findings that precluded a finding of
prejudice to support a continuance of the trial; (2) A Minute Order continuing
trial after the discovery cut-off does not operate to automatically reopen
discovery; (3) Pursuant to CCP §2024.050 a formal motion was required to be
brought to re-open discovery after the discovery cut-off; and (4) To the extent
the court intends to reopen discovery, the scope of such discovery must be
narrowly tailored to the circumstances.
Cross-Complainants’ motion was made after this Court, sua
sponte, continued the trial and Cross-Defendants thereafter took the
position that continuance “reopened discovery.”  C.C.P. §2024.050 contains specific mandatory
requirements that must be met to continue trial, which were not argued before
the court because Cross-Defendants did not seek that relief in their opposition.  This court was not presented with the
required analysis set forth in C.C.P. §2024.050(b)(3) that states in ruling on
a motion to reopen discovery a court must consider the “likelihood that
permitting the discovery . . . will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set.”
Therefore, Cross-Complainants’ motion for reconsideration
was not objectively unreasonable.  (See
Bockrath, 21 Cal.4th at pg. 82; Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb &
Taeb, 39 Cal.App.5th at pg. 135; Peake, 227 Cal.App.4th at pg. 440.)
Accordingly, Cross-Defendants’ motion for
sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Cross-Defendants’ motion for
sanctions is denied.

Moving
Party to give notice.
