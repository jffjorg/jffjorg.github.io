Documents (Set One) for Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38,
40, 41, 47, 54, 56, 57, 66, 74, 76, 77, 78, and 86 is granted.  Defendant is to provide
further Code-Compliant responses without objections within 10 days. 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant is

          Plaintiff Thelecia Dunning (“Dunning”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant Jaguar
Land Rover North America, LLC (“JLR”) (“Defendant”) to her Request
for Production of Documents (Set One) (“RFA”) to request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40, 41, 47,
54, 56, 57, 66, 74, 76, 77, 78, and 86  (“Requests”) and production of all responsive
documents corresponding to those requests, and to strike Defendant’s
objections.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-3;
C.C.P. §§2031.310, 128(a)(4), 2023.030(a).)  Plaintiff requests Defendant pay monetary
sanctions of an unspecified amount. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 3.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff’s 9/6/24 request for judicial notice of
(1) NHTSA’s Request Letter addressed to JLR, dated March 6, 2019 (P-RJN, Exh.
1); (2) JLR’s April 24, 2019 Response to NHTSA (P-RJN, Exh. 2); (3) JLR’s March
7, 2019, WPPM Retention Policy (P-RJN, Exh. 3); (4) Land Rover Warranty Codes and
Indexes (P-RJN, Exh. 4); and (5) the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and
Control (“DMAIC”) Process for JLR (P-RJN, Exh. 5), is granted, however, the
Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted.
 
Evidentiary Objections
Defendant’s 11/4/24 evidentiary objections to
Plantiff’s 9/6/24 request for judicial notice is overruled as to Nos. 1-6.  
The Court also notes Defendant failed to number its
evidentiary objections in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1354(b) [“All written
objections to evidence must be served and filed separately from the other
papers in support of or in opposition to the motion. Objections to specific
evidence must be referenced by the objection number in the right column of a
separate statement in opposition or reply to a motion, but the objections
must not be restated or reargued in the separate statement. Each written
objection must be numbered consecutively.”], emphasis added.)
 
Meet and Confer
On March 29, 2024, this Court held an IDC.  (3/29/24 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares that during the
IDC, the Parties and the Court agreed that Plaintiff would provide redefined
search terms by April 4, 2024, Defendant would provide supplemental responses
to the redefined search terms by May 6, 2024, and Plaintiff has until June 14,
2024, to bring a Motion to Compel. 
(Decl. of Stoliker ¶32.) 
Plaintiff’s motion complies with this Department’s requirement for an
IDC to be held prior to hearing a motion to compel further.  Therefore, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
 
Background
          On December
12, 2023, Plaintiff electronically served her RFP on Defendant.  (Decl. of Stoliker ¶19, Exh. 3.)  On January 16, 2024, Defendant electronically
served its responses to Plaintiff’s RFP. 
(Decl. of Stolkier ¶22, Exh. 4.) 
On June 13, 2024, Defendant electronically served its supplemental
responses on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of
Stolkier ¶23, Exh. 5.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on September 6, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on November 4, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
          Discussion
The Civil Discovery Act provides that a “party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any
motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2031.010.)

“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447.)  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts
have uniformly held that, for discovery purposes, information should be
regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
and produce documents concerning Defendant’s internal investigation and
analysis, among other things, of the Engine Defects.  (See Decl. of Stoliker ¶19.)  Specifically, Plaintiff sought documents
concerning: (A) The Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7); (B) JLRNA’s
Internal Knowledge and Investigation regarding the Engine Defects in 2019 Land
Rover Discovery Sport Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40);
(C) Summaries, Memoranda, and Power Points regarding the Engine Defects in 2019
Land Rover Discovery Sport Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 41, 47); (D) Song Beverly
Act and Buyback Policies and Procedures (i.e., RFP No. 54, 56, 57, 66); (E) Communication
With Governmental Agencies and Suppliers regarding the Engine Defects in 2019
Land Rover Discovery Sport Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 74, 76, 77, 78); and (F)
Other Documents Related To The Subject Vehicle’s Engine Defects (i.e., RFP No.
86).  (Decl. of Stoliker ¶20.)
 
A.   Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7
These requests seek production of documents
concerning the Subject Vehicle and are narrowly tailored to a specific issue in
this case.  The requested documents are
relevant to the issues related to Defendant’s good faith compliance with the
Song-Beverly Act, including breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.  (See
Korea Data Systems Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516 [stating
boilerplate objections “[lack] . . . the specificity the statute mandates” and
their use may be sanctionable].)  To the
extent documents are withheld due to an objection, the response must (1)
identify with particularity the document to which the objection is being made;
and (2) set forth the grounds for the objection, including the production of a
privilege log if the objection is based on privilege.  (C.C.P. §2031.240.)
JLRNA’s responses do not state that all documents or
things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control
of JLRNA and to which no objection is being made will be produced.  (C.C.P. §2023.310.)  JLRNA’s responses are therefore facially
defective and not Code-compliant.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
B.    Request Nos. 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, and
40 
These requests pertain to internal knowledge and investigation
related to the engine defects in 2019 Land Rover Discovery Sport vehicles.  This request is narrowly tailored towards the
applicable policies and procedures related to Plaintiff’s claims.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant.  Defendant’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, and 40 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege
log.
 
C.    Request Nos. 41 and 47
These requests pertain to summaries, memoranda, and PowerPoints
related to the engine defects in 2019 Land Rover Discovery Sport vehicles. 
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 41 and 47 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
D.   Request Nos. 54, 56, 57, and 66
These requests pertain to documents policies and
procedures related to the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and buyback
policies and procedures. This request is narrowly tailored towards the specific
issues in the case.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 54, 56, 57, and 66 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
E.    Request Nos. 74, 76, 77, and 78
These requests seek communications between Defendant
and any government agencies or suppliers regarding engine defects in 2019 Land
Rover Discovery Sport vehicles. This request is narrowly tailored towards the
specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 74, 76, 77, and 78 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
F.     Request No. 86
This request seeks all other documents related to
the Subject Vehicle’s engine defects. This request is narrowly tailored towards
the specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s response is not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce a
Code-Compliant response to RFP No. 86 and corresponding documents.  To the extent a response is protected by
privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
G.   Request Nos. 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38,
40, 41, 47, 54, 56, 57, 66, 74, 76, 77, 78, 86
JLRNA objected to these requests on the grounds of
undue burden but failed to identify the types or categories of ESI sources that
are not reasonably accessible.  
A responding party who does not search an ESI source
on the grounds of undue burden or expense must “identify in its response the
types or categories of sources of electronically stored information that it
asserts are not reasonably accessible.”  (C.C.P.
§2031.210(d).)  A failure to do so waives
“any objections it may have relating to that electronically stored information.”
 (Id.)  Therefore, Defendant has waived all objections
relating to ESI.  (See Stadish v. Superior
Court (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1141 [stating failure to set forth
particular ground for objection constitutes waiver of right to assert objection].)
          Accordingly,
Defendant is compelled to produce Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 17, 20,
22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40, 41, 47, 54, 56, 57, 66, 74, 76, 77, 78, and 86 and
corresponding documents, without objection. 

 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2031.300(c), “[t]he court may impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).”  (C.C.P. §2031.300(c).)
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$3,160.00 against Defendant.  (Decl. of
Stoliker ¶48.)  However, Plaintiff’s
notice of motion failed to provide sufficient notice to Defendant of the amount
of the sanction and against whom the sanctions were requested.  (C.C.P. §2023.040.)  Therefore, this Court cannot grant the
requested sanctions.
 
Conclusion
          Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant to Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40, 41, 47, 54, 56, 57,
66, 74, 76, 77, 78, and 86 is granted.  Defendant
is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 10 days.
          Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
