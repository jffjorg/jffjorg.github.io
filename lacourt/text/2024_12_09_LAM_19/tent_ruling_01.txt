(“Defendant”) alleging the following causes of action: Disability Discrimination In Violation Of FEHA; Disability Harassment In Violation Of FEHA; Disability Retaliation In Violation Of FEHA; Failure To Engage In The Mandatory Good-Faith Interactive Process In Violation Of FEHA; Failure To Provide Reasonable Accommodations In Violation Of FEHA; Failure To Do Everything Reasonably Necessary To Prevent Discrimination, Harassment And Retaliation From Occuring [sic] In Violation Of FEHA; Interference With CFRA Rights And Retaliation In Violation Of The FEHA & CFRA; Discrimination/Retaliation In Violation Of Labor Code Section 98.6; Failure To Provide Sick Days/Leave & Retaliation In Violation Of Labor Code Sections 246 & 246.5; Wrongful Termination/Adverse Actions In Violation Public Policy; Failure To Pay Wages In Violation Of Labor Code Section 201; Inentional [sic] Infliction Of Emotional Distress; Negligent Hiring And Retention; and Violation Of Business And Profession Code §17200, Et Seq.  Plaintiff filed the instant¿ Motion To Compel Defendant Pacifica Health Care Enterprises, Inc.’s Further Responses And Signed Verifications To Form Interrogatories (General), Set One, Pursuant To C.C.P. § 2030.300 Et Seq.; Request For $4,111.65 In Sanctions Against Defendant, Pacifica Health Care Enterprises, Inc. And/Or Its Attorney Of Record, Dariush G. Adli And/Or Adli Law Group, P.C., Pursuant To C.C.P. §§ 2030.300(D), And 2023.010 Et Seq. (the “Motion”).  GROUNDS FOR MOTION  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 et seq., Plaintiff moves for an order compelling Defendant to provide (1) a signed verification to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (general), Set One; and (2) further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 on the ground that Defendant’s response is deficient.   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, subdivision (d) and 2023.010 et seq., Plaintiff moves for an order imposing sanctions against Defendant and/or its attorney of record, Dariush G. Adli and/or Adli Law Group, P.C. in the amount of $4,111.65.  DISCUSSION  As an initial matter, Defendant failed to file any opposition, effectively conceding to the merits of the Motion and consenting to the Court granting the relief requested. (See Cal. R. Ct., 8.54(c) [“A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.”]; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Procedural Requirements  Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b); 2031.310(b)(2); 2033.290(b).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿However, a discovery motion need not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving parties failed to meet and confer in good faith.¿(See Obregon v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.)    The notice of motion must be served “within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing…”; otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(c); 2031.310(c); 2033.290(c); Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 745; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 1013 [extending notice time if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax].) The 45day time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)   Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request shall also be accompanied by a separate statement providing all information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses at issue. (Cal. R. Ct., 3.1345(a), (c).)  Here, in her declaration filed with the Motion, Plaintiff’s counsel attests that the responses in question were served on September 16, 2022. (April Ramirez Decl., ¶ 7.) Although the instant Motion was not filed and served until August 26, 2024, Plaintiff contends, with evidence, that the responses remain unverified. (Motion, p. 7; Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 7, Ex. 4.)  Thus, the Court finds that the Motion is timely. Plaintiff filed the requisite separate statement. The Court finds the declaration of April Ramirez satisfied the meet and confer requirements.   Merits  Legal Standards  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210, subdivision (a) provides that:  (a) The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An answer containing the information sought to be discovered. (2) An exercise of the party’s option to produce writings. (3) An objection to the particular interrogatory. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.210(a).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 provides that:  (a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits. (b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. (c) If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the propounding party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.240 provides that:  (a) If only a part of an interrogatory is objectionable, the remainder of the interrogatory shall be answered. (b) If an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be clearly stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.240.)  A motion to compel further responses to form or specially prepared interrogatories may be brought if the responses contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive response; and/or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a).)  If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure fully to answer the interrogatories. (Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221; Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  Although the burden of showing good cause does not exist in the case of interrogatories, in deciding a motion to compel further responses to form or specially prepared interrogatories, trial courts “must, of necessity, consider not only the stated objections to the interrogatories, but also the interrogatories themselves, as well as the pleadings, and the contentions of the interrogating party as to the purpose and validity of the interrogatories.” (Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 18–19.) “If the interrogatories stray too far and seek information which cannot reasonably serve the acknowledged purposes of pretrial discovery, the motion should be denied.” (Id. at p. 19.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.090, subdivision (b) provides that:  The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following directions: (1) That the set of interrogatories, or particular interrogatories in the set, need not be answered. (2) That, contrary to the representations made in a declaration submitted under Section 2030.050, the number of specially prepared interrogatories is unwarranted. (3) That the time specified in Section 2030.260 to respond to the set of interrogatories, or to particular interrogatories in the set, be extended. (4) That the response be made only on specified terms and conditions. (5) That the method of discovery be an oral deposition instead of interrogatories to a party. (6) That a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a certain way. (7) That some or all of the answers to interrogatories be sealed and thereafter opened only on order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.090(b); see Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.020(a) ["The court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence."].)  “The objection based upon burden must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum of work required, while to support an objection of oppression there must be some showing either of an intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate with the result sought.” (West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However, “[w]hen discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden.” (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)  Analysis  Motion to Compel  Verifications  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that, since Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (general), Set One included substantive responses, (Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 7, Ex. 4), Defendant was required to provide a verification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.250(a).)  Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for an order compelling Defendant to provide proper verifications for the responses.  Form Interrogatory No. 15.1  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant’s (unverified) response to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 is insufficient because it failed to provide complete and straightforward responses stating substantive information, witnesses, and documents contended to support each affirmative defense. Such discovery is relevant, and Plaintiff therefore has a right to discovery regarding the fifty five (55) affirmative defenses alleged in Defendant’s Answer.   Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for an order compelling Defendant to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatory No. 15.1. (See Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrators, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1097, 1106.)  Sanctions  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d) provides that:  The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(d).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 provides that:  A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought. (Code Civ. Proc., 2023.040.)  Given the lack of verifications, the incomplete response to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatory No. 15.1, and Defendant’s failure to file any opposition, the Court finds that an imposition of a monetary sanction is warranted.  After consideration of the declaration of April Ramirez, (see Ramirez Decl. at ¶¶ 12-15), and relying on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437), the Court finds that the hourly rate of $450.00 per hour is reasonable. The Court also finds the 5.5 hours to review the initial discovery responses, to meet and confer, and to prepare and file the motion papers is reasonable. The Court also awards 1.5 hours to prepare for and attend the hearing. However, given the lack of any opposition, the Court does not award the 2.0 hours requested to review the opposition and prepare a reply. Thus, the Court awards attorney’s fees for 7 hours, for a total of $3,150.00 in attorney’s fees.  The Court also awards $61.65 in costs for the filing fee, (Ramirez Decl. at ¶ 12), for a total award of $3,211.65.  As such, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $3,211.65.
