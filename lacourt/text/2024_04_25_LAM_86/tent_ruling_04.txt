[1]           LAAC § 8.33 is
submitted as Exhibit D to Respondent’s Request for Judicial Notice.


[2]           Notably, absent from the numerous cases
cited and discussed in Padilla, is Lundeen Coatings Corp. v. Department of Water & Power (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 816, which contains a
single footnote upon which petitioner relies. (Opp. at 13:21-24.) That is
because Lundeen is entirely inapt. In Lundeen, the Court stated
in passing that the Department of Water and Power was a department of the City
of Los Angeles and was therefore exempt from the requirement to file a statement
per Government Code § 53051, which did not apply to the “state, or a county,
city and county, or city.”  (Lundeen,
232 Cal.App.3d 816, 830 n.8.)  Lundeen
never addressed the question of whether a statute’s use of “city” necessarily includes
charter cities, let alone within the context of the home-rule doctrine of our
State Constitution.  “It is axiomatic
that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.”  (Padilla, 46 Cal.App.5th at 914,
quoting People v. Alvarez (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1176.)


[3]           The Court also notes, as respondents
suggest, that it is unlikely the City Council would have rescinded the
declaration if presented with a resolution, as the City Council has instead
renewed the declaration twice. (Reply at 10:2-5.)
 


[4]           Petitioner’s reference to a
communication from the Office of the City Clerk for the assertion that the time
to renew the declaration expired on October 4, 2023 is unavailing.
Interpretation of an ordinance is a legal issue for the Court. (Chun v. Del
Cid (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 806, 815.) When the language of an ordinance is
clear, resort to extrinsic aids is unnecessary. (Ibid.)
