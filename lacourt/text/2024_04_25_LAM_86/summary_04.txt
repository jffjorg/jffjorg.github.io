English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the petitioner's request for judicial notice regarding the renewal of a declaration. The Judge argues that the City Council's renewal of the declaration is significant, as it indicates that the Council would not have rescinded the declaration if presented with a resolution. The Judge also notes that the petitioner's reference to a communication from the Office of the City Clerk is unavailing, as the interpretation of an ordinance is a legal issue for the Court. The Judge cites various California court cases, including Lundeen Coatings Corp. v. Department of Water & Power, to support the argument that the statute's use of "city" does not necessarily include charter cities within the context of the home-rule doctrine of the California State Constitution.
