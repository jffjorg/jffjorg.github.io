And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is on the demurrer to the Verified First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus. The petition claims that the Mayor's declaration of a local housing and/or homelessness emergency is invalid due to lack of ratification and non-renewal within 90 days. The court finds that Government Code Section 8630 does not apply to charter cities like the City of Los Angeles. The court also finds that LAAC § 8.33 does not violate CES, as the Mayor's power to commandeer property is consistent with the California Constitution. The court sustains the demurrer in part and allows the petition to be amended to address the defects.
