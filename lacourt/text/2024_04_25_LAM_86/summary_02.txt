Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"The parties are directed to address and discuss the admissibility of extra-record evidence in the context of a traditional mandamus action challenging a quasi-legislative administrative decision. The court is considering the extent to which the holding in Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court (1995) applies to enacting a City ordinance. The parties are asked to consider whether the consideration of extra-record evidence depends on whether the issue before the court was considered by the Legislature. The court is also seeking clarification on the extent to which the passage of the Oil and Gas Drilling Ordinance was considered by the Los Angeles City Council and whether there was an opportunity to raise the issue and present evidence before the Council."
