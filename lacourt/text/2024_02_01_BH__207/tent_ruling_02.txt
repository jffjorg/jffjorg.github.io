MOTIONs
 
On August 10, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff Pacific Carpets, LLC’s (“Plaintiff” or “Pacific”) motion for
summary adjudication.  (See August 10,
2023 Minute Order.)  Pacific subsequently
dismissed the remaining causes of action, and judgment was entered in favor of
Pacific on November 20, 2023.  (See
November 20, 2023 Judgment.)  On January
30, 2024, the Court awarded Pacific its costs. 
(See January 30, 2024 Minute Order.)
 
Plaintiff now moves to recover
attorneys’ fees and prejudgment interest as the prevailing party.  Defendant Western National Builders (“WNB”)
has filed an opposition, and Defendants PPF AMLI 4242 Via Marina, LLC; PPF AMLI
4242 Via Marina GP, LLC, and Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland
(collectively, “AMLI”) have filed a separate opposition.  
 
Plaintiff has separately replied to
each opposition with respect to attorneys’ fees and filed a combined reply with
regard to the request for prejudgment interest. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
1.      Attorneys’
Fees
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs
to a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the
recovery of attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc.. § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021 provides “[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided
for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties
[….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717
provides “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.”  (Civ. Code § 1717(a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines
the “prevailing party” as follows: 
 
[T]he party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees as
to WNB, pursuant to the parties’ agreement and as to AMLI pursuant to Civil
Code section 8558.
 
            WNB
 
Paragraph 44(d) of the agreement
between Plaintiff and WNB provides, “In the event of any dispute regarding the
interpretation or enforcement of any of the terms and provisions of this
Subcontract, the prevailing party shall be entitled to actual attorneys' fees,
expenses and costs incurred.”  (Walker
Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex. A.)
 
            Although
the agreement purports to entitle the prevailing party to recover “actual
attorneys’ fees” incurred, Code of Civil Procedure section 1717 limits the
attorneys’ fees recoverable to “reasonable attorneys’ fees” incurred.
 
            Plaintiff
seeks, among other fees, $10,632.50 incurred in connection with bringing the
first motion for summary judgment, which the court denied due to Pacific’s
failure to include a certified copy of its licensure history with the filing
(see March 7, 2023 Minute Order) and $7,225.00 incurred in preparing the second
motion for summary adjudication, which was ultimately successful.  
 
            WNB
contends that $7,225 Plaintiff incurred in preparing the amended motion for
summary adjudication should be excluded from Plaintiff’s attorney fee award,
because the two motions were largely identical, and therefore the $7,225
incurred is unnecessarily duplicative and unreasonable.
 
            After
reviewing the entries, the Court disagrees. 
The time entries associated with the first motion for summary judgment indicate
time spent reviewing the pleadings, preparing an initial draft of the
memorandum of points and authorities, preparing the ancillary declarations, separate
statement, proposed judgment, and request for judicial notice, revising the
memorandum of points and authorities, checking citations, and finalizing the
filing.  By contrast, the time entries
associated with the second motion for summary adjudication indicate updating or
amending the existing motion and ancillary documents, with most of the time entries
describing updating the declarations, separate statement, and request for
judicial notice.  These time entries are
consistent with what one would expect from filing a second motion that is
derivative of the first. 
 
            AMLI
 
Civil Code section 8558, subdivision
(a) provides: “In an action to enforce payment of the claim stated in a bonded
stop payment notice, the prevailing party is entitled to a reasonable
attorney’s fee in addition to costs and damages.”
 
AMLI contends (1) Pacific is not
entitled to attorneys’ fees because the bond is necessary only for a
subcontractor to obtain payment from a lender, which AMLI is not; and (2) Pacific’s
requested fees are excessive insofar as they include fees related to Pacific’s
first (failed) motion for summary judgment and AMLI should be responsible only
for those fees incurred in bringing the single cause of action against AMLI,
not the entire lawsuit.
 
Unlike a mechanic’s lien, which
attaches to the real property at issue, a stop notice attaches to the owner’s
finances, as an additional and cumulative remedy, to protect subcontractors in
the event a senior lienholder forecloses on the property.  (Mechanical Wholesale Corp. v. Fuji Bank,
Ltd. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1647, 1654 (hereafter Mechanical Wholesale).)  A bonded stop notice requires the
owner’s lender to withhold and pay the subcontractor funds owed, and also
entitles the prevailing party to reasonable attorneys’ fees.  (Ibid.)  
 
With respect to Pacific’s
entitlement to fees, AMLI contends that it is not responsible for paying
Pacific’s attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with enforcing its bonded stop
notice, because the bond was not strictly necessary to compel AMLI’s
compliance, since AMLI is not a lender. 
AMLI does not cite to any case law standing for such a proposition.  The only case AMLI cites, Mechanical
Wholesale, held that in instances where the construction project occurs
outside of California but the lender is located in California, plaintiffs may
not recover attorneys’ fees pursuant to Civil Code section 8558.
 
Ultimately, Pacific served AMLI
with a bonded stop notice, requiring AMLI to set aside funds owed to Pacific,
which AMLI failed to do, continuing to pay WNB instead.  Thus, pursuant to the plain text of Civil
Code section 8558, AMLI is responsible for paying Pacific’s reasonable
attorneys’ fees incurred in bringing the instant action to enforce payment.
 
As for the amount of attorneys’
fees, the Court has already held, in connection with Pacific’s request for
costs, that Pacific is entitled to recover costs incurred in connection with
the first, unsuccessful motion for summary judgment.  (See January 23, 2024 Minute Order.)  Further, Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car
Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1133-1134, expressly authorizes
such attorneys’ fees “to the extent that those attacks led to a successful
claim.”  As previously held, here, they
did.  The only authority Defendant cites
in opposition are unbinding federal district court cases.  Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to
attorneys’ fees incurred in bringing the initial, unsuccessful motion for
summary judgment.
 
With respect to apportioning the
fees, as AMLI concedes, “courts have declined to apportion fees as to common
issues shared between claims or where the claims are so intertwined that it
would be impossible to separate them.” 
(AMLI’s Opposition at p. 7, fn. 4 (citing Bell v. Vista Unified
School Dist. (2000) 82 Call App 4th 672, 689).)  The Court previously held, “the claims
against AMLI (and the corresponding bonded stop notices) are ‘inextricably
intertwined’ with the contractual claims against WNB.”  (See January 23, 2024 Minute Order.)  Thus, the Court declines to apportion
attorneys’ fees.
 
2.      Prejudgment
Interest
 
Pacific seeks prejudgment interest as
follows:
 
·        
$42,872.59 from WNB, calculated at the legal
interest rate of 10%, pursuant to Civil Code section 3289, from the date the
final retention payment became due (October 24, 2020) through February 1, 2024;

 
·        
$47,536.55 from AMLI[1],
calculated at the legal interest rate of 10% pursuant to Civil Code section
8560 from the date Pacific served AMLI the bonded stop notice (June 16, 2020)
through February 1, 2024; and 
 
·        
$35,697.26 from Fidelity, calculated at the
legal interest rate of 7% from the date Pacific recorded its mechanic’s lien
(May 12, 2021) through February 1, 2024.
 
WNB
 
WNB contends the Court should
exclude from the prejudgment interest the 73 days between when the judgment was
entered on November 20, 2023, and the February 1, 2024 hearing date on
Pacific’s motion for prejudgment interest. 
Pacific counters that the order granting the attorneys’ fees and costs will
amend the judgment, and therefore the February 1 date controls.  
 
Pacific does not cite to any
authority supporting the proposition that the February 1 date controls.  Here, judgment was entered on November 20,
2023.  As such, interest accrued prior to
November 20, 2023 is prejudgment interest. 
To the extent Pacific seeks interest accrued after that date, Pacific
may seek postjudgment interest.  A
postjudgment order regarding costs or attorneys’ fees is ministerial in nature,
and does not substantively alter or amend the judgment.  (See Torres v. City of San Diego, 154
Cal.App.4th 214, 222 [“where the judgment is modified merely to add
costs, attorney fees and interest, the original judgment is not substantially
changed” and “When a party wishes to challenge both a final judgment and a
postjudgment costs/attorney fee order, the normal procedure is to file two
separate appeals: one from the final judgment, and a second from the
postjudgment order.”])
 
AMLI
 
AMLI argues that the correct
interest rate is 7%, not 10%, because AMLI and Pacific have no contractual
relationship.  Pacific counters that the
10% contractual rate of Civil Code section 3289 applies to stop payment notice
claims.  In support, Pacific cites to The
Rutter Group, California Practice Guide – Insurance Litigation, Chapter 6I. (Surety
Bonds) at 6:3280 (Interest).  That
provision merely provides, “A plaintiff who prevails on a stop payment notice
claim is entitled to interest at the legal rate from the date the stop payment
notice was served. [Civ.C. § 8560] (The legal rate is 10% per annum on contract
claims; see Civ.C. § 3289.)”  It does not
establish that a plaintiff may recover the 10% contractual rate against a party
with whom it has no contractual relationship, on a stop payment notice claim.
 
Therefore, the Court agrees with
AMLI that the appropriate rate is 7%.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees is granted.  Plaintiff
is entitled to recover the requested $95,297.50 in attorneys’ fees from WNB and
AMLI, jointly and severally.  
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for prejudgment interest is granted in part and denied in part.  Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest
as follows:
 
·        
$40,257.36 from WNB, calculated at the legal
interest rate of 10%, pursuant to Civil Code section 3289, for the 1,122 days from
the date the final retention payment became due (October 24, 2020) through
November 20, 2023; 
 
·        
$31,437.72 from AMLI, calculated at the legal
interest rate of 7% pursuant to Civil Code section 8560 for the 1,252 days from
the date Pacific served AMLI the bonded stop notice (June 16, 2020) through November
20, 2023; and 
 
·        
$33,081.36 from Fidelity, calculated at the
legal interest rate of 7% for the 922 days from the date Pacific recorded its
mechanic’s lien (May 12, 2021) through November 20, 2023.
 
Thus, of the
$40,257.36 total prejudgment interest to which Plaintiff is entitled, WNB,
AMLI, and Fidelity are jointly responsible for $31,437.72; WNB and Fidelity are
jointly responsible for the additional $1,643.64 balance up to $33,081.36; and
WNB is solely responsible for the additional $7,176.00 balance up to
$40,257.36.
 
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the
same.
