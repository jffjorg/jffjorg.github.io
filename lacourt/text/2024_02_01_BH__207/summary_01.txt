And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied Defendant Amy Goldman's motion for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff The Berman Law Group, APC. The Defendant sought $18,449.06 in attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the Plaintiff's complaint, which Defendant contends is meritless and was brought in bad faith. The Judge found that the Plaintiff acted in good faith in filing suit, which was based on a written agreement, and promptly investigated and dismissed the lawsuit once Defendant raised issues about the missing countersignature and two-year statute of limitations. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's method of personal service via process server at Defendant's place of business did not demonstrate bad faith warranting sanctions.
