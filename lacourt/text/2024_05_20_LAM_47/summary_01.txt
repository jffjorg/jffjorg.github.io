And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Defendant, PACE Funding Group, LLC, has moved for a protective order to prevent the Plaintiff, Ledle Arreola Garcia, from taking the deposition of the Defendant's CEO, Robert Giles. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant is engaged in a scheme to defraud homeowners, including herself, and seeks to depose Robert Giles to obtain relevant information. However, the Defendant argues that Robert Giles has no direct knowledge of the vetting or onboarding of contractors and that the Plaintiff has not shown good cause to depose him.

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion for a protective order, finding that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause to depose Robert Giles. The Court has also denied the Plaintiff's request to take the deposition of Robert Giles, finding that the Plaintiff has not carried her burden to demonstrate that Robert Giles has relevant, unique, or superior knowledge.

The Court has also declined to award sanctions to either side in connection with this motion, finding that the Plaintiff appears to have acted with substantial justification in pursuing the deposition of Robert Giles.
