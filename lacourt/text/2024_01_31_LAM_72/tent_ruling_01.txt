                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No: 
  23STCV10829
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 31, 2024
 Calendar Number:  16



 
 
 
Plaintiff Madison Plaza Homeowners Association (“Plaintiff”)
seeks default judgment against Defendants Cherissa C. Liang and Xiao-Yi Xiao
(collectively, “Defendants”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1)  legal
fees in the amount of $17,856.00;
 
(2)  costs
of litigation in the amount of $844.15;
 
(3) a permanent
injunction requiring Defendants to cease renting their property within Plaintiff
homeowner association for terms of less than 30 days; remove their property’s
listing from AirBnB; and submit a copy of any rental or lease agreement along
with a completed Owner/Resident Information Form to Plaintiff within 48 hours
of the beginning of any new rental of their property with a term of 30 days or
more.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment IN
PART. The requested attorney’s fees are reduced to $5,000.00. The Court will
strike out the $17,856.00 in legal fees from the proposed judgment and include
$5,000.00 instead.  The Court grants
costs and injunctive relief as requested.
 
Background
 
Defendants own property within Plaintiff homeowner
association. Property owners within the association are subject to governing
documents which include a set of rules and regulations. The governing documents
prohibit owners from engaging in short-term rentals of less than 30 days.
 
Defendants regularly rent their property within Plaintiff
homeowner association through AirBnB. Plaintiff contends that this violates the
above restrictions.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants C on May 15,
2023, alleging breach of Plaintiff’s governing documents and seeking injunctive
relief and damages.
 
On August 21, 2023, the Court entered default against Liang.
On August 29, 2023, the Court entered default against Xiao.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
           
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
The proof of service filed by Plaintiff on June 22, 2023
shows that Xiao was served on May 26, 2023 at 335 S. Madison Avenue, Unit 217,
Pasadena, CA 91101 by substituted service on Daniel Xiao, indicated to by
Xiao’s son or co-occupant.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed on December 13, 2023
pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Daniel C. Heaton avers that Xiao and Liang are not in
military service.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in its
Summary of the Case in Support of Plaintiff’s Request for Default Judgment.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“[W]hen recovering damages in a default judgment, the
plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint.” (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.)
 
          Plaintiff
does not seek damages in this case.
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff does not provide any interest computation.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff provides a memorandum of costs wherein Daniel C.
Heaton avers that Plaintiff spent $844.15 in costs on this action.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
          Plaintiff
requests a total of $17,856.00 in attorney’s fees, comprised of $4,992.00 in
pre-litigation attorney’s fees and an additional $12,864.00 in attorney’s fees
incurred during this litigation.
 
In this case, attorney’s fees are provided for by contract. Local
Rule 3.214 provides the schedule for attorney’s fees on default judgment in a
contract case, which applies “unless otherwise determined by the court.”
(California Rules of Court, Rule 3.214.) Here, there are no damages. Thus, this
case does not reach the minimum threshold for an award of attorney’s fees
within Rule 3.214’s default framework, which requires at least $0.01 in damages
for the minimum award of $75.00.
 
The Court finds that there is reason in this case to use the
discretion granted by Local Rule 3.214 to alter the default structure for
attorney’s fees. However, the amount of fees demanded by Plaintiff is excessive
in light of the fact that this is still a default judgment. The Court deems
that an award of $5,000.00 in attorney’s fees is appropriate for this case.
 
 
Local Rule 3.214 
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
          Plaintiff
provides a proposed form of judgment.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
          This
action is not based on a written obligation to pay money.
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
