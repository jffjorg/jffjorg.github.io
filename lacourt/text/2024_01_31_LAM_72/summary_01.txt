And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Madison Plaza Homeowners Association's request for default judgment against Cherissa C. Liang and Xiao-Yi Xiao, with some modifications. The association seeks default judgment, attorney's fees, costs of litigation, and a permanent injunction. The judge reduces the requested attorney's fees from $17,856.00 to $5,000.00, finding that the amount demanded is excessive in light of the fact that this is still a default judgment. The Court grants the costs of litigation in the amount of $844.15 and the permanent injunction requested by the association. The judge finds that there is reason to alter the default structure for attorney's fees, citing Local Rule 3.214, and awards $5,000.00 in attorney's fees. The proposed form of judgment is approved, and the written agreement is deemed unnecessary since this is not a case based on a written obligation to pay money.
