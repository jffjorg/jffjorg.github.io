And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will discuss the ex parte matter with the parties. The case involves a loan agreement between the defendant and Kihagi, the guarantor. Plaintiff filed the action on May 22, 2024, and sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on October 2, 2024. Judge Mandel granted the motion and appointed a receiver on November 22, 2024. However, Kihagi filed a 170.6 challenge on November 26, 2024, which was granted by Judge Mandel the next day. The matter was reassigned to this court.

The court will discuss several issues with the parties, including how the 170.6 challenge was filed and served, the current status of the preliminary injunction and receiver, and the effect of the 170.6 challenge on the earlier orders. The court is considering issuing a status quo order pending further briefing and a later hearing.
