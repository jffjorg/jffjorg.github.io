And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has before it a plaintiff's application to have King's auction off certain Michael Jackson paintings. The defendants oppose the auction, citing concerns about King's vouching for Jackson's signature but not verifying that he actually painted the artwork. The court finds these concerns unpersuasive and notes that King's only needs to verify Jackson's signature, not that he painted the artwork. The court also rejects the defendants' claim that King's is attempting to depress the price, as King's goal is to maximize the proceeds.

The court notes that the defendants have delayed the sale for a long time and have failed to sell the artwork despite multiple attempts. The court finds that the defendants' bankruptcy was in bad faith and intended to delay the sale. The court also finds that the defendants' credit bid proposal is flawed and notes that any profits from a subsequent sale would need to be taken into account.

The court concludes that the time has come to hold the auction, and it will allow the sale to go forward under the auspices of a King's auction. The proceeds will be held in conformity with the court's prior orders and will be divided after all claimants have had an opportunity to be heard. The court notes that the defendants can seek appellate review if they wish, but it will not stay its ruling or the effect thereof absent an order from the appellate court.
