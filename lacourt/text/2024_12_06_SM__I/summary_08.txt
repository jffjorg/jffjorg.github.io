And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for entry of judgment, citing the complexity of the case and the need to resolve the remaining issues. The case has a long history, with procedural twists and turns that have led to a jury verdict and a Statement of Decision. However, the judge finds that the Statement of Decision does not dispose of the entire case, particularly with regards to Illulian's claims of wrongful termination. The judge agrees with Rav-Noy that the Statement of Decision has an effect on any judgment, but finds that the issue of wrongful termination must be resolved by a jury. Therefore, the court will not enter judgment at this time, despite Rav-Noy's willingness to waive additional relief. The judge notes that the case will need to proceed to a new trial to resolve the remaining issues.
