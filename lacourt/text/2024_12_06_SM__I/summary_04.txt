And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to amend the complaint and a motion for summary judgment. The case is about a used car purchased with a remaining warranty, and whether the Song-Beverly Act applies. The California Supreme Court recently ruled that the Act only applies to new car purchases, not used ones. The plaintiff wants to amend the complaint to allege breach of warranty claims, but the defendant seeks summary judgment. The judge agrees that the motion for leave to amend should be heard soon, but wants to discuss with the parties how best to proceed, including scheduling and potential resolution. The judge is tentatively inclined to allow the amendment, but notes that the current trial date may not survive.
