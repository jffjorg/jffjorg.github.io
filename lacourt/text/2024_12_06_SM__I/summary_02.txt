And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's PMK. The plaintiff sent a deposition notice with a unilaterally chosen date, but invited the defendant to choose an alternative date. The defendant objected to the date but has yet to provide a new date. The plaintiff also seeks documents and a witness familiar with a particular defect. The parties have failed to have a meaningful meet and confer, and the judge orders them to resolve the matter between themselves without court intervention. The judge also appends a standard Song-Beverly order. The judge concludes that a defendant has two choices: resist discovery or provide the requested information.
