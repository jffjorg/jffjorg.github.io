 Case Number:  24SMCV05569    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  I The ex parte application is GRANTED.  This is a UD case.  Due to the court’s calendar, the earliest
hearing date was approximately eight weeks after the demurrer was filed.  While that is normally appropriate (although
the court’s goal is to shorten that period by half), it is not appropriate in a
UD case, which the Legislature has deemed to be a priority matter.  The court will discuss with the parties a
date for defendant to file its reply (if it so chooses) and for the hearing.  Obviously, the court is expressing no view as
to the demurrer’s merits.
