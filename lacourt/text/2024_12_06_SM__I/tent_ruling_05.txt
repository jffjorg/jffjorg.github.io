 Case Number:  23SMCV03920    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel responses is GRANTED and
sanctions are awarded against plaintiff, but not counsel, in the amount of
$405, payable within 30 days. 
 
Defendant served written discovery on September 5,
2024.  However, plaintiff has not
responded to the discovery even though defense counsel sent a letter inquiring
about that.  The court sees no basis for
that failure.
 
Plaintiff will serve verified responses without objection
other than privilege to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production no later than 20 days from today.  Documents will be produced at the same
time.  If plaintiff asserts a privilege,
a detailed log will accompany the production.
