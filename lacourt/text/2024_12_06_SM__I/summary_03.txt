And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel and sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,072.50. This is due to the defendant's notice for the deposition of the plaintiff's PMK, which was served on April 23, 2024, for a deposition on May 17, 2024. The notice stated that the defendant would move the deposition to a better date if necessary, but the plaintiff never objected to the notice or suggested alternative dates. Instead, the plaintiff's counsel contacted the defense counsel on May 16, 2024, to reschedule the deposition, but the plaintiff never followed up on the alternative dates.

As a result, the judge has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to provide three alternative dates for the deposition, no earlier than December 26, 2024, and no later than January 16, 2025. The defendant's counsel will then choose a date for the deposition from this range. The deposition will proceed from day to day, with breaks for lunch and afternoon tea. The parties may alter this scheduling order by written agreement.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff's PMK to appear on the chosen date and has warned that the plaintiff has acted in bad faith by not appearing for the deposition and refusing to suggest or provide a date.
