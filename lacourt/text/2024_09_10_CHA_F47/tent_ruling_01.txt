Motion filed on 5/16/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Luisa Antonia Ramirez and
Guadalupe Hernandez
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants Maelena Diata and Renato
Diata
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order setting aside the
Court’s 5/16/24 dismissal, without prejudice, of this action.  
 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 6/30/21.  On 6/27/23,
Plaintiffs Luisa Antonia Ramirez and Guadalupe Hernandez (Plaintiffs),
representing themselves, filed this action for: (1) Motor Vehicle and (2)
General Negligence against Defendants Maelena Diata and Renato Diata
(Defendants).
 
On 4/15/24, there were no appearances at the Case
Management Conference.  (See
4/15/24 Minute Order).  Therefore, the
Court continued the Case Management Conference and set an Order to Show Cause
Re Sanctions for Plaintiffs’ Failure to Appear/File Proof of Service for 5/16/24
at 8:30 a.m.  Id.  On 5/16/24, counsel for Defendants appeared,
but Plaintiffs did not.  (See
5/16/24 Minute Order).  Therefore, the
Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ complaint without prejudice.  Id.
 
On 5/16/24, Plaintiffs, still representing themselves,
filed and served the instant motion for an order setting aside the Court’s
5/16/24 dismissal of their complaint.  In
or around June 2024,  Plaintiffs engaged their
current counsel to represent them in this action.  (See Substitution of Attorney Forms
filed 8/12/24).  On 8/13/24, Plaintiffs
current counsel filed (served on 8/12/24) an additional/supplemental Motion and
Memorandum of Points and Authorities along with supporting declarations in
support of the original motion. 
Defendants have opposed the motion and Plaintiffs have filed a reply to
the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 473(b) provides in relevant part: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as
may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”   
 
Plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that their
failure to appear at the 5/16/24 Case Management Conference and Order to Show
Cause which resulted in the dismissal of the action was the result of their
mistake, inadvertence, surprise and/or excusable neglect.  Plaintiffs were present at the courthouse
before 8:30 a.m.; however, based on their observance of the procedure followed
by the family law courtrooms which are next to Department F47, Plaintiffs mistakenly
believed that they were not supposed to enter the courtroom until called which
resulted in Plaintiffs missing the hearing. 
(See Plaintiffs’ Decls. filed 8/13/24).  Additionally, Plaintiffs promptly moved for
relief upon learning of their mistake by filing their motion the same day the
case was dismissed.  Since Plaintiffs
have already filed the proofs of service for the summons and complaint, no
additional proposed pleading needs to be filed at this time.  (See Proofs of Service filed 4/12/24)    
 
Contrary to
Defendants’ assertion in the opposition, the fact that they will now have to
defend against this action does not constitute the type of prejudice which
warrants the denial of this motion under the circumstances.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is
granted.
