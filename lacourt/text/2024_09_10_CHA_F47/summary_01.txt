And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiffs, Luisa Antonia Ramirez and Guadalupe Hernandez, failed to appear at a Case Management Conference on May 16, 2024, and as a result, the complaint was dismissed without prejudice. However, the plaintiffs claimed that their failure to appear was due to a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge found that the plaintiffs' excuse was sufficient and that they had promptly moved for relief after learning of their mistake. The Judge also noted that the plaintiffs had already filed the proofs of service for the summons and complaint, so no additional pleading needs to be filed at this time. The Judge denied the defendants' assertion that the dismissal should not be set aside due to prejudice, finding that the defendants will not be unduly prejudiced by the setting aside of the dismissal.
