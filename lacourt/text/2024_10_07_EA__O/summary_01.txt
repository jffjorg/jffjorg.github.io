Significant Statements:
  - "The court finds that the following cases, 24PSCV00945 and 24PSCV00993, are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)."
  - "The statute's goal 'is to protect California residents who are sued by out-of-state plaintiffs when there is no reasonable possibility the out-of-state plaintiff will prevail. The section protects California residents by requiring the out-of-state plaintiff to post security to ensure payment of costs and attorney fees (if recoverable) in the likely event the plaintiff's action is defeated.'"
  - "The court would reduce the hourly rates of $575 and $650. It is an attorney's obligation to establish 'reasonable rates in the local community as a basis for [the fee] award.'"
  - "The court would deny the motion for a $500,000 bond because section 1030 does not provide for the recovery of attorney fees under these facts."
