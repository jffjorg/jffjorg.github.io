And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a dispute between P&K, a plaintiff, and Retail Ventures, a defendant, over a mechanic's lien. P&K, which does not have a valid California contractor's license, entered an agreement to perform preliminary construction work on a property and was paid $3,595,233.70. Retail moves to remove the mechanic's lien, arguing that P&K's lawsuit has no reasonable possibility of prevailing at trial. The court agrees with Retail, finding that P&K's claims are intertwined with its own complaint and that P&K has not offered any evidence to support its position. The court notes that the "reasonable possibility" standard is relatively low, and Retail need only show that it is reasonably possible that it will prevail at trial.
