[1] For clarity, SQS is not
a named defendant in this action. According to Retail, it “is not familiar
with and has no contract with SQS Construction. To Retail Ventures’ knowledge,
it has never worked with SQS Construction in any capacity.” (Motion to Remove
Mechanic’s Lien, p. 3, fn. 2.) 
 


[2] According to the CC,
which provides more details than the complaint, P&K, which does not have a
valid California contractor’s license, entered an agreement to perform
preliminary construction work related to remodeling the property for an
incoming tenant. After some work was performed, the parties entered a written
contract on 12/6/2022. Throughout the course of work, P&K issued several
change orders. In total, Retail has paid P&K $3,595,233.70 for its
unlicensed work on the Property.

references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. 
 


[4] The “reasonable possibility”
standard is relatively low. A defendant (here, Retail) need not show there
is no reasonable possibility that the plaintiff (here, P&K) will prevail at
trial, but only that it is reasonably possible that the defendant will prevail.
(Baltayan v. Est. of Getemyan (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1427, 1432.) 
 
 


[5] See also Alshafie
v. Lallande (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 421, 428 [“The
statute therefore acts to prevent out-of-state residents from filing frivolous
lawsuits against California residents.”].


[6] And here, the court
agrees with Retail that their CC claims are inherently intertwined with
P&K’s complaint, and in such a circumstance, 


[7] Briefly, however,
the court would find this requirement satisfied. Even if the AIA agreement
deems P&K a contractor and even if SQS’s PMQ (Rosa Santillana) is not a
reliable witness as she previously made false statements but at her recent
deposition she confirmed that SQS had no contractual relationship with Retail
and SQS never performed any contracting work or supervision on the project,
which undermines P&K’s position that SQS was the general contractor, the
standard is the reasonable possibility of prevailing at trial. And against that
evidence, P&K has offered none. 
 


[8] P&K filed
numerous objections, but all are overruled as they are boilerplate. It is fundamental that evidentiary objections must "make clear
the specific ground of the objection or motion." (Evid. Code section 353,
subd. (a).)
