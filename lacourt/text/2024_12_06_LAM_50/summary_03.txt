And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a settlement between Santiago Ramirez, a minor, and CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and Arus Zograbyan, M.D. The petition was filed by Martha Ramirez Moreno, Santiago's guardian ad litem. The settlement was reached in a negligence and emotional distress case brought against the defendants. The judge notes that the petition has some defects, including incomplete information regarding attorney's fees and a blank proposed order. However, the judge intends to grant the petition and approve the settlement, subject to the petitioner correcting the defects and subject to examination of the petitioner at the hearing.
