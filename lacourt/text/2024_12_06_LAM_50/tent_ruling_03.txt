  ORDER RE:
 
PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF
  PENDING ACTION




            
Background
Plaintiffs
Santiago Ramirez, a minor, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Martha Ramirez
Moreno; and Martha Ramirez Moreno (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on
May 25, 2023 against Defendants CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and
Arus Zograbyan, M.D. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) general
negligence and (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
The parties have
reached a settlement in this matter.

Martha Ramirez Moreno
as Petitioner for Claimant Santiago
Ramirez (“Petitioner”) now petitions for the Court’s approval of the settlement on
behalf of the Claimant.  
            Discussion
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated
with court approval. ((Prob. Code, § 3500.) “A
petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a covenant not to sue or
enforce judgment, on a minor’s disputed claim; a compromise or settlement of a
pending action or proceeding to which a minor or person with a disability is a
party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment for a minor or person
with a disability under Probate Code sections 3500 and
3600-3613 or Code of Civil Procedure section 372
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise,
covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the
petition must be submitted on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form
MC-350).” (California Rules of Court, rule 7.950, emphasis in
original.)  
Here, the petition is prepared on form
MC-350 and is verified by Petitioner. However, the Court notes a few
defects with the petition. 
First,
in Item 17(c) of the petition (form MC-350),
Petitioner checked both “has not” and “has” regarding whether the attorney
received attorney’s fees or other compensation in addition to that requested in
the petition for services provided in connection with the claim giving rise to
the petition. 
Second, Items 5 and 6 of the proposed order (Form MC-351) are blank. 
Third, it appears that Item 8(a)(3)(a) of the proposed order should
refer to “Department of Health Care Services,” not “Department of Health
Care Service.” (Emphasis added.)
Fourth,
Attachment 8b(2) of the proposed order provides, inter alia, that
“[a]ll sums constitute damages on account of personal injuries arising from an
occurrence within the meaning of Section 104(a)(2).”
It is unclear what specific Code section “Section
104(a)(2)” refers to. 
            Conclusion
In light of the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the petition and approve the
compromise, subject to Petitioner correcting the foregoing defects, and subject
to Plaintiffs’ examination of Petitioner at the hearing.

Petitioner is to give notice of this ruling.
