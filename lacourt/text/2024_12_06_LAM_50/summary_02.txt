And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiffs and an opposition filed by the defendants. The judge notes that the defendants' opposition was served on November 13, 2024, and the plaintiffs' reply was filed before the deadline. However, the judge also notes that the plaintiffs raised new arguments for the first time in their reply, which will not be considered because they deprive the defendants of an opportunity to counter the arguments. Specifically, the judge cites the California case of American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992), which states that points raised for the first time in a reply brief will not be considered.
