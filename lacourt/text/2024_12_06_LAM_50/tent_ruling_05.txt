[1]On November 18,
2024, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “[o]n
the Court’s own motion, the Case Management Conference scheduled for
11/18/2024, and Hearing on Special Motion to Strike under CCP Section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP motion) scheduled for
11/21/2024 are continued to 12/06/24…” 
 


[2]The proof of
service attached to Ms. Feldman’s November 12, 2024 declaration also states
that such declaration was served by overnight delivery on November 13, 2024. In
addition, on November 19, 2024, Ms. Feldman filed a declaration indicating, inter
alia, that “[o]n November 14, 2024, I caused to be filed an Opposition and
Supporting Declarations (the ‘Documents’) to MMA’s Special Motion to Strike the
First Amended Cross-Complaint…I executed a Proof of Service indicating that the
Documents were served by email and mail on November 13, 2024, and November 14,
2024…Service was actually made on November 14, 2024, via use of the Los Angeles
Superior Court’s approved eFiling Provider (https://california.courtfiling.net
) and was not sent by email or regular mail for that reason.” (November 19,
2024 Feldman Decl., ¶¶ 1-3.) 


[3]MMA demurs to each
of the causes of action of the Amended Cross-Complaint on the grounds of
uncertainty. The Court does not find that MMA has shown that any of the causes
of action are uncertain and overrules the demurrer on this ground.  


[4]The Court also notes that in support of the res
judicata argument, MMA relies on Castle v.
Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys. (C.D.Cal. Aug. 16, 2011, No. EDCV 11-00538
VAP (DTBx)) 2011 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 92004, a
non-binding federal district court case. 
 


[5]In light of the
foregoing, the Court does not address MMA’s remaining arguments in the
demurrer.
