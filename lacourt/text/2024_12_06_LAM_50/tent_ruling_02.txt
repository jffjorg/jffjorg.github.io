[1]Moreover, the
Court notes that as a practical matter, the instant Order does not cite to
Defendants’ “rough” trial transcripts. 


[2]As set forth above, Code of Civil Procedure section 659a provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he moving party shall have five days after that service to
file any reply brief and accompanying documents. These deadlines may, for good
cause shown by affidavit or by written stipulation of the parties, be extended
by any judge for an additional period not to exceed 10 days.” The Court notes
that the proof of service attached to Defendants’ opposition indicates that the
opposition was served on November 13, 2024. Five days after November 13, 2024
is November 18, 2024. An additional ten days after November 18, 2024 is
November 28, 2024. Plaintiffs’ reply was filed on November 22, 2024, before
November 28, 2024. 


[3]Plaintiffs’
reference to “Pineda’s statements” is confusing, as Plaintiffs appear to also
argue in the motion that the subject statements were made by Hillary Williams. 


[4]The Court notes
that Plaintiffs also appear to raise certain new arguments for the first time
in their reply, such as that Plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their
complaint to conform to proof at trial. The Court notes that “¿[p]oints raised
for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be
considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an
opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the
Court declines to consider the arguments raised for the first time by
Plaintiffs in the reply.
