```

The tentative ruling granted the defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, meaning that the court found that the evidence presented did not support the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion for new trial. The ruling was based on the court's findings that there was no substantive change of ownership and that the property management did not change. The defendant's argument that the notice of change of owner and/or property manager was inaccurate, incomplete, and invalid was also rejected.
