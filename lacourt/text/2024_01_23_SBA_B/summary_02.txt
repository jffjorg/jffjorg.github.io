And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, a motion filed by plaintiff's attorney, Jacob Brown, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was denied due to a lack of proof of service on the client, failure to provide a copy of the return receipt, and outdated hearing dates in the proposed order. The judge noted that the attorney-client relationship had broken down, making it difficult for the attorney to effectively represent the client. The judge also emphasized the importance of following the rules for filing a motion to be relieved as counsel, including providing notice to the client and serving the motion on all other parties.
