Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff, Emani Morris, to respond to their discovery requests. The plaintiff failed to serve responses to the defendants' initial form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for inspection and production of documents. The court finds that the discovery requests were properly served and that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process. As a result, the court awards sanctions in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff in the amount of $530, to be paid within 30 days. The court also orders the plaintiff to respond without objections to the defendants' discovery requests and to produce all responsive documents and things within 20 days.
