Date:                          January 23,

Moving Parties:                      Attorney Jacob Brown, Esq.
at Downtown Law Group for plaintiff Tanjanae Vaughn
Responding Party:                  None
Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel
The court considered the moving
papers.
RULING
The motion is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
On May 23, 2023, plaintiff Tanjanae
Vaughn filed a complaint against defendants John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence based on an incident on June 1, 2021
at Juniper St. and La Brea Ave., in Inglewood.
LEGAL STANDARD
The court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice.  See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d
398.
CRC Rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s attorney Jacob Brown,
Esq. seeks to be relieved as counsel of plaintiff.
Counsel states in his declaration
that “there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship that stands in the way of effective representations.”  Counsel states that he confirmed the client’s
address by mail, return receipt requested, but does not provide a copy of the
return receipt.  Further, there is no
proof of service of the motion on the client. 
Also, the proposed order does not contain plaintiff’s phone number and
lists hearing dates that have passed.
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Moving counsel is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
