And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Petitioner's motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings in the case. The Petitioner has a motorist policy with the Respondent and has demanded arbitration, which the Respondent has failed to respond to. The judge has found that the Petitioner has a valid arbitration agreement with the Respondent and that the Respondent's failure to respond to the demands for arbitration is grounds to compel arbitration. The judge has ordered the parties to arbitrate the dispute and has stayed the proceedings in the court.
