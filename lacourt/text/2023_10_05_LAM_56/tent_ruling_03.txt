MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).  
 
BACKGROUND
On
April 12, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint in eminent domain (the
“Complaint”).  On April 3, 2023, the
Court entered a Final Judgment in Condemnation (the “Judgment”).  
 
On
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for final condemnation order (the
“Motion”).  
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 1268.030, upon application of any party, the court shall make a
final order of condemnation if the full amount of the judgment has been paid as
required by CCP section 1268.010 or satisfied pursuant to CCP section 1268.020.  (CCP § 1268.030, subd. (a).)  The final order of condemnation shall
describe the property taken and identify the judgment authorizing the taking.  (CCP § 1268.030, subd. (b).)  The party upon whose application the order
was made shall serve notice of the making of the order on all other parties affected
thereby. Any party affected by the order may thereafter record a certified copy
of the order in the office of the recorder of the county in which the property
is located and shall serve notice of recordation upon all other parties
affected thereby.  (CCP § 1268.030, subd.
(c).)  Title to the property vests in the
plaintiff upon the date of recordation. 
(Id.)
 
The
Motion satisfies the requirements of CCP section 1268.030.  (See Declaration of David Graeler ¶¶
2-9.)  For this reason and because it is
unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
