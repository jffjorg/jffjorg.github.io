AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
MOVING
PARTY: Defendants Michael Schwab, Big Sky Venture Capital III, LLC, and Big Sky
Real Estate, LLC (collectively, “Moving Defendants”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least five court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a business relationship. 
On October 17, 2017, the Court granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’
first amended complaint (the “FAC”). 
Judgment was not entered for Moving Defendants due to the pendency of
the claims in their cross-complaint (the “XC”). 
On April 27, 2018, the Court awarded Defendant Big Sky Venture Capital
V, LLC 25 percent of its requested attorney’s fees to reflect the apportionment
for fees owed to Moving Defendants in the event they moved for attorney’s fees
in the future.  Judgment on the XC was
entered in Moving Defendants’ favor on May 10, 2023.  
 
On
July 11, 2023, Moving Defendants filed a motion for attorney’s fees (the
“Motion”) to recover $532,593.75 in fees, which represents 75 percent of the
fees claimed after summary judgment of the FAC was granted. 
            
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 1033.5, reasonable attorney’s fees may be awarded to a prevailing
party where they are authorized by a contract, statute, or law.  (CCP § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Unless authorized by either statute or
agreement, attorney’s fees ordinarily are not recoverable as costs.  (Reynolds
Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 128.)  Civil Code section 1717 provides: in any
action on a contract, where such contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the provisions of such contract,
shall be awarded to one of the parties, the prevailing party, whether he is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to costs and necessary disbursements.  (Civ.
Code § 1717, subd. (a).)  
 
The Motion provides evidence of a contractual basis
for attorney’s fees and includes time records. 
The Court finds that Moving Defendants have demonstrated their
entitlement to attorney’s fees.  For this
reason and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
