MOVING
PARTY: Petitioner
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served within
10 days of service as provided under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 1290.6.
 
BACKGROUND
            On July 7, 2023, Petitioner filed a
petition (the “Petition”) to establish jurisdiction over an underinsured
motorist action.  
 
 
On July 10, 2023, Petitioner filed a motion to
compel arbitration (the “Motion”) on the ground that Respondent has failed to
respond to Petitioner’s repeated demands to commence uninsured motorist
arbitration. 
 
DISCUSSION 
The
purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) is to move the parties in an
arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as
possible.  (Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp. (1983) 460
U.S. 1, 23.)  The FAA is consistent with
the federal policy to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of
private agreements to arbitrate.  (Mastrobuono v.
Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. (1995) 514 U.S. 52, 57.)  
 
California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.  (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97.)  Under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 1281, a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing
controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable, and
irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any
contract.  (CCP § 1281.)  On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy unless grounds exist not to compel arbitration.  (CCP § 1281.2.)  
 
 
            Under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (f),
disputes over damages in uninsured/underinsured motorist claims are to be
resolved in arbitration.  (See Ins.
Code § 11580.2, subd. (f).)  
 
            Petitioner has a motorist policy with Respondent.  (Declaration of Rackohn (“Rackohn Decl.”) ¶
2.)   Respondent has not responded to
Plaintiff’s demands for arbitration. 
 
            As it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  The Court STAYS
this matter pending the resolution of arbitration.  The
Court sets a status conference on March 6, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this
department.  The parties are ordered to file a joint status report by February
28, 2024.  
 
 
 
 
 Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
 
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
