```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the defendant's motion to vacate the default. The defendant, Kap Moon, argues that the service of process was improper and that the plaintiff, Young Lim, failed to prove service of the summons and complaint. However, the court finds that the process server, Curi Kenmark, credible and that the defendant was served with the papers. The court declines to consider any argument for substituted service and proper service on a competent member of the household. The defendant's attempts to evade service are unsuccessful, and the motion is denied. The defendant may still file an alternative, timely request for relief from the entered default.
