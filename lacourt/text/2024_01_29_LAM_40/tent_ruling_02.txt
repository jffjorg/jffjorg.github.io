Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Paul Auchterlonie sues Defendants Altior Healthcare, LLC
(Altior), PT Innercept Inc. (PT Innercept), Innercept, LLC (Innercept),
Paradigm Services Holdings, LLC (Paradigm Services), Paradigm Treatment
Centers, LLC (Paradigm Treatment), Psych Me, LLC (Psych Me), Jeff Settembrino
(Settembrino), Roberto Cantu (Cantu), Thomas Wilcop (Wilcop), and Does 1
through 50 pursuant to an August 25, 2023 First Amended Complaint (FAC).
(Defendant Innercept Holdings, LLC—the former legal name of Defendant
Altior— was dismissed without prejudice on October 20, 2023. Defendants Pine
Tree Equity IV, LP, Pine Tree Equity 111, LP, Paradigm Co-lnvestfund, LP, PTE
Principle IV – Shortridge, Shortridge Intermediate Holdings, LLC, and Paradigm
Intermediate, LLC were dismissed without prejudice on January 16, 2024.)
The FAC alleges claims of (1) Violation of Health and Safety Code § 1278.5,
(2) Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5, (3) Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy, (4) Tortious Interference with Economic Advantage, and (5)
Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations.
The claims arise from the following allegations, as modified by the dismissals
discussed above. Defendants Altior, PT Innercept, Innercept, Paradigm Services,
Paradigm Treatment, and Psych Me (the Entity Defendants) are owned, operated,
controlled, supervised and/or managed by Defendants Settembrino, Cantu, and Wilcop
(the Individual Defendants). All Defendants are alleged as alter egos of one
another. Plaintiff Auchterlonie was employed by Defendants Altior, Innercept
Holdings (Altior’s former name), Paradigm Treatment, one or more of the
subsidiary companies, and/or Does 1-50. Between January 2020 and January 2023,
Plaintiff reported and disclosed certain suspected illegal, unsafe, fraudulent,
and substandard conditions and services at the health facilities owned,
managed, and/or operated by all Defendants. These “Subject Conditions” included
accepting substance abuse patients who Defendants were unqualified to treat,
hiring therapists or clinical staff with little or no experience to safely
treat patients, and maintaining overnight staffing ratios that were below
California state standards and licensing requirements. These conditions also
posed a significant health risk for current and future patients utilizing the
services of Defendants. The reports, complaints, and disclosures were made to “the
appropriate health facilities, the owners and operators of the health
facilities and/or to the entities and agencies responsible for accrediting or
evaluating the facilities, and/or the medical staff of the facilities as set
forth in California Health and Safety Code § 1278.5.” Plaintiff had reasonable
cause to believe reporting the Subject Conditions disclosed a violation of
state or federal statutes, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local,
state, or federal rules or regulations as set forth in California Labor Code §
1102.5, and he refused to participate in such activities. As a result,
Plaintiff was subjected to continuous harassment, exclusion, humiliation,
intimidation, and retaliation from Defendants and their employees, agents,
and/or independent contractors, including, for example, Defendants terminating
Plaintiff’s employment.
Motions Before the Court
On September 26, 2023, Defendant
Altior Healthcare filed a demurrer challenging the FAC’s first through third
causes of action—the only three claims alleged against this Defendant—on the
ground of sufficiency of pleading.
That same day, Defendant Paradigm
Treatment filed an essentially identical demurrer challenging the FAC’s first
through third causes of action—the only three claims alleged against this
Defendant.
Also that day, Defendants Altior
Healthcare and Paradigm Treatment filed a motion to strike various portions of
the FAC.
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
opposed the two demurrers and the motion to strike. The oppositions to the two
demurrers are essentially identical.
On January 22, 2024, Defendants
Altior Healthcare and Paradigm Treatment filed essentially identical replies in
support of their respective demurrers.
That same day, these Defendants
filed a reply in support of their joint motion to strike.
The two demurrers and motion to
strike are now before the Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Per Defendants Altior and Paradigm
Treatment’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of the State of Delaware
Secretary of State filing showing the name change of Defendant Altior from
“Innercept Holdings, LLC” to “Altior Healthcare, LLC,” its current legal name.
(Mot., RJN, pp. 1-2, Ex. A; see Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453, subds.
(a)-(b); see Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire
Protection Dist. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 583, 600 [judicial notice may be
taken as to existence of document and legal effects deriving therefrom].)
 
Demurrers
Demurrer Sufficiency Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish
each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212,
superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty Legal Standard 
A demurrer to a pleading lies where
the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on other
grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations question].)
Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise
defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special
demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be
overruled where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to
apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet”].
I.
Demurrers, FAC, First Cause of
Action, Violation of Health and Safety Code §1278.5: OVERRULED.
A health facility shall not
discriminate or retaliate, in any manner, against a patient, employee, member
of the medical staff, or other health care worker of the health facility
because that person has presented a grievance, complaint, or report to the facility,
to an entity or agency responsible for accrediting or evaluating the facility,
or the medical staff of the facility, or to any other governmental entity.
(Health & Saf. Code, § 1278.5, subd. (b)(1).)
The FAC alleges that Defendants, as
Plaintiff’s employer, terminated Plaintiff after Plaintiff made reports
regarding unsafe conditions in the healthcare facilities run by Defendants in
the State of California. (FAC, ¶¶ 4, 15, 20-27, 28-38.)
The parties contest the sufficiency
of this claim on various grounds.
After review, the Court OVERRULES both
demurrers to this claim, which are based on essentially identical briefing.
Healthy and Safety Code section
1278.5 covers employees, in addition to patients, members of the medical staff,
and other health care workers of a health facility. (See Health & Saf.
Code, § 1278.5, subd. (b)(1).) Thus, relevant questions are whether Defendants
are alleged as a health facility and whether an employment relationship is
sufficiently alleged. The FAC, on its face, alleges that Defendants run
healthcare facilities and that Plaintiff was their employee, which the Court
finds sufficient, as discussed below. (FAC, ¶¶ 20-21; see also FAC, ¶ 50.)
The Court also notes that, per
Altior’s and Paradigm’s own authority in Jadwin v. County of Kern, the
legislative history of section 1278.5 shows that the statutory section was
amended because “[t]he ‘operative’ part of the statute only protected employees
and patients of the health facility” and “[t]he amendment expanded the statute’s
existing substantive reach to now include ‘members of the medical staff’ of the
health facility because, generally, physicians are not employees of the
hospital (nor patients).” (Jadwin v. County of Kern (E.D. Cal. 2009) 610
F.Supp.2d 1129, 1150, cited in Demurrers, pp. 4-5; People v. Leal (Jul.
25, 2023) 93 Cal.App.540 1143, 1157, fn. 1 [“‘[California courts] are … not
bound by the decisions of the lower federal courts even on federal questions,’
[though] ‘they are persuasive and entitled to great weight’”], citing People
v. Bradley (1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86.) Employees of health facilities are, as
a matter of law, a protected class of persons under section 1278.5.
Moving to whether the FAC
sufficiently alleges an employment relationship, the Court determines that it
does. While the designation of another party as an “employer” might appear to
be a legal conclusion, it can also be an ultimate fact. Identifying a person or
entity as an “employer” can be the conclusion of an inferential process in
which evidentiary facts become the premise for the conclusion that the entity
is the employee’s employer, e.g., by paying an employee a salary and benefits, issuing
a W-2 each year, wholly controlling or directing the employee’s labor, or other
factors. (See Gossman v. Gossman (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 184, 192 [In
discussing the differences between ultimate facts and legal conclusions, e.g.,
the inferential process of deriving an ultimate fact from evidentiary facts,
noting that “[t]he line of demarcation between what are questions of fact and
conclusions of law is not one easy to be drawn in all cases”].) For this
reason, the FAC sufficiently alleges, on its face, an employment relationship
between Altior and Plaintiff. (See, e.g., FAC, ¶¶ 21-22.) Paradigm Treatment is
also alleged as an “employer” of Plaintiff—though that allegation is not raised
explicitly until the third cause of action. (FAC, ¶ 50.) And because the FAC
directly names these two Defendants as Plaintiff’s employers, the demurrers’
“joint employment” and “alter ego” arguments are beside the point. (See Memoranda
in support of Demurrers, pp. 7-8.)
Next, the Court determines that
allegations that Defendants, among other things, “[a]ccept[ed] substance abuse
patients that Defendants were unqualified to treat,” “[h]ired [therapists or] clinical
staff with little or no experience to safely treat patients,” and “maintain[ed]
overnight staffing ratios that were below California state standards and
licensing requirements” show allegations of a complaint to a health facility
regarding “suspected unsafe patient care and conditions.” (FAC, ¶¶ 23(c), 23(d)-(e),
23(i), 28; Health & Saf. Code, § 1278.5, subds. (a), (b)(1).)
Moreover, the Court determines the
FAC alleges retaliation in the form of, among other things, termination of
employment based on Plaintiff making the above complaints. (FAC, ¶¶ 27, 28,
32-33.)
Last, the Court determines that the
reporting requirement was sufficiently met as alleged in paragraph 23 of the
FAC. While the Court agrees that the FAC could have more clearly elaborated on
the complaints made by Plaintiff to Defendants, for pleading purposes, the FAC
sufficiently alleges that for four years, Plaintiff reported what he perceived
as illegal conditions in the healthcare facilities, which posed dangers to
patients. (FAC, ¶¶ 21-27.) The bases for these allegations can be determined in
discovery.
The Court’s overall conclusion is
reinforced by the proximity in time alleged between Plaintiff’s complaints to
Defendants and Plaintiff’s termination. (Health & Saf. Code, § 1278.5, subd.
(d)(1) [rebuttable presumption that “discriminatory action was taken … in
retaliation against an employee, member of the medical staff, or any other
health care worker of the facility” if the discriminatory action occurs “within
120 days of the filing of a grievance or complaint by the employee, member of
the medical staff, or, … other health care worker”]; FAC, ¶¶ 23, 32 [reports
made through January 24, 2023; termination on or about January 24, 2023].)
As to uncertainty, the FAC
sufficiently alleges a protected person (Plaintiff), an employment relationship
with Defendants, and protected reporting by Plaintiff.
The Court thus finds that the FAC
sufficiently states a claim pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1278.5.
II.
Demurrers, FAC, Second Cause of
Action, Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5: OVERRULED.
In pursuing a Labor Code section
1102.5 whistleblower retaliation claim, a plaintiff has the burden to show “by
a preponderance of the evidence” that the employee’s protected whistleblowing
was a “contributing factor” to an adverse employment action, and if the
plaintiff succeeds in making this showing, the employer must in turn
demonstrate by “clear and convincing evidence” that the alleged adverse
employment action would have occurred “for legitimate, independent reasons”
even if the employee had not engaged in protected whistleblowing activities. (Lawson
v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 712 [citing to
Labor Code section 1102.6 and disapproving McDonnell Douglas framework
to whistleblower claims as held in Patten v. Grant Joint Union High School
Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1384].)
The second cause of action alleges
that Defendants, as Plaintiff’s employer, terminated him after he made
protected complaints under the Labor Code. (FAC, ¶¶ 4, 15, 20-38, 39-48.)
The parties contest the sufficiency
of the allegations supporting this claim.
After review, the Court OVERRULES
the demurrers to this claim, which are based on essentially identical briefing.
The Court first reasons that the
allegations of employment relationship and reports from Plaintiff to Defendants’
agents suffice for 1102.5 purposes. (See FAC, ¶¶ 4, 15, 20-21, 23-24; see also
FAC, ¶ 50; Discussion at Section I supra.)
The Court next reasons that the
specific violations alleged in the FAC sufficiently place Defendants on notice as
to the type of violations they are alleged to have engaged in, which
sufficiently satisfies section 1102.5, subdivision (b). (FAC, ¶ 23.)
The Court also reasons that while
Defendants’ section 1102, subdivision (c) argument has merit insofar as the
second cause of action must but does not clearly allege that the activity in
question actually would result in a violation or noncompliance with a statute,
rule, or regulation (FAC, ¶ 23), the Court cannot sustain a demurrer to a
portion of a cause of action. (Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1047
[“A demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of action or to
a particular type of damage or remedy”].) Thus, the second cause of action is
saved by the sufficiency of the section 1102, subdivision (b) allegations, and
any subdivision (c) bases can be elaborated in discovery.
Last, the Court determines that for
the above reasons, the second cause of action is not uncertain.
III.
Demurrers, FAC, Third Cause of
Action, Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy: OVERRULED.
“The elements of a claim for
wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are (1) an employer-employee
relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff’s employment, (3) the
termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and
(4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm.” (Yau v. Allen (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 144, 154.)
The third cause of action alleges
wrongful termination against Altior, Paradigm Treatment, and Does 1 through 50
based on allegations that Plaintiff was terminated from his employment with
these Defendants after reporting unsafe conditions and fraudulent activity in
Defendants’ health facilities. (FAC, ¶¶ 4, 15, 20-48, 49-56.)
The parties contest the sufficiency
of the allegations supporting this claim.
After review, the Court OVERRULES
the demurrers to this claim, which are based on essentially identical briefing.
The Court first determines that the
derivative nature of the claim is not fatal where the first and second causes
of action survived demurrer. (See discussions at Sections I-II supra.)
The Court next adopts its
discussion above in Sections I and II to determine that the FAC alleges an
employment relationship, its termination, and harm to Plaintiff.
Moreover, the Court notes that a section
1278.5 claim may support a wrongful termination claim. (See Shaw v. Superior
Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 983, 1004-1005 [“In light of the language of section
1278.5, subdivision (m), a health care employee whistleblower’s cause of action
for retaliatory termination under section 1278.5(g) is clearly in addition to
the health care employee whistleblower’s right (1) to bring a legal action for
damages for retaliatory termination under this court’s decision in Tameny,
supra, 27 Cal.3d 167, 164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, (2) to obtain a
jury trial in the Tameny action, and (3) to have the jury in the Tameny
action determine whether the employee was subjected to unlawful retaliatory
termination and, if so, the amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to
recover for such conduct”].)
Last, the Court notes that the
section 1102.5 claim may also viably support a wrongful termination claim. (See
Whitehall v. County of San Bernardino (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 352, 365 [In
discussing immunities in relation to affirming trial court denial of anti-SLAPP
against a § 1102.5 whistleblower claim, noting that “‘a wrongful termination
action is viable where the employee alleges he [or she] was terminated for
reporting illegal activity [that] could cause harm, not only to the interests
of the employer but also to the public[,]’” where “‘[a]n action brought under
the whistleblower statute is inherently such an action.’ [Citation.]”]; see
also FAC, ¶¶ 21-24 [whistleblower reports of presumed illegal activity or
unsafe conditions endangering patients].)
 
Motions to Strike
Legal
Standard
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)
For
the purposes of a motion to strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, the term “pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint, (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an
immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading entails (1) an
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense, (2) an
allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
I.
Order
Striking Paragraph 23 Subparts A-K: DENIED.
The
Court DENIES the motion to strike insofar as it seeks an order striking paragraph
23, subparts A-K from the FAC. The paragraphs are relevant to the FAC’s first
to third causes of action, as discussed above.
II.
Order
Striking Innercept Holdings, LLC: MOOT.
The
motion to strike is MOOT insofar as it seeks an order striking Innercept
Holdings, LLC from the FAC, which was mooted by Plaintiff’s October 20, 2023
dismissal of this Defendant.
