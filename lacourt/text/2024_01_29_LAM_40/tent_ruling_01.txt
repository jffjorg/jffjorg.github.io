Background
On February 25, 2021, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff)—as assignee of interests held by
State Compensation Insurance Fund (Assignor)—sued Defendant Addition Building
& Design, Inc. (Addition B&D), Michael Ross (dba Green Build Design LA)
and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Open Book Account, (3) Account Stated, and (4) Reasonable Value.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendant Addition B&D and Assignor entered into a written agreement
through which Assignor agreed to provide a policy of workers compensation
insurance to Defendant, bearing Policy No. 9203093-18 and providing coverage
for the period of January 11, 2018 through January 11, 2019, for which
Defendant agreed to pay premiums in accordance with the terms and conditions of
said policy, only for Defendant Addition B&D to default on payments as of
May 26, 2020, resulting in damages of $296,480.20, together with interest
thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from May 26, 2020.
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff
served (1) a third set of form and special interrogatories and requests for
production on Defendant Ross (FROGs, Set Three; SROGs,
Set Three; RPDs, Set Three) and (2) a third set of special interrogatories
and requests for production on Defendant Addition B&D (SROGs, Set Three;
RPDs, Set Three).
On November 7, 2023, due to complete
nonresponse from Defendants, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed a meet and confer
letter to Defendants’ counsel.
On November 7, 2023, due to ongoing
nonresponse, Plaintiff filed motions to compel initial responses to FROGs, Set
Three from Defendant Ross and initial responses to SROGs, Set Three, and RPDs,
Set Three, from Defendants Ross and Addition B&D. All five motions seek
awards of monetary sanctions and were served via mail and email on Defendants’
counsel.
The motions are unopposed by
Defendants Ross and Addition B&D and are now before the Court.
 
Motions to Compel Initial Responses – Interrogatories,
Production
Legal
Standard
A
motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did
not serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a)
[demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish
this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories],
2031.040 [demand to produce]);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b)
[interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and
(3)
No timely response (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories],
2031.300 [demand to produce]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].) 
Order Compelling Initial Responses: GRANTED.
Plaintiff shows the September 12, 2023
service of (1) FROGs, Set Three, SROGs, Set Three, and RPDs, Set Three on
Defendant Ross’s counsel and (2) SROGs, Set Three, and RPDs, Set Three, on
Defendant Addition B&D’s counsel. (All Motions, Frischer Decl., Ex. A,
Proof of Service.)
Plaintiff shows expiration of the deadline
for the initial responses and Defendants’ failure to serve responses to these
discovery requests. (All Motions, Frischer Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5 [service on Sep. 12,
2023; no responses as of November 6, 2023, meriting sanctions].)
A review of the discovery requests shows
that they are within the scope of discovery because they involve requests that go
to admissible evidence or matters reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. (All Motions, Frischer Decl., Ex. A.)
Plaintiff’s five motions are thus GRANTED re:
compelling initial responses to (1) FROGs, Set Three, SROGs, Set Three, and
RPDs, Set Three from Defendant Ross and (2) SROGs, Set Three, and RPDs, Set
Three, from Defendant Addition B&D.
Sanctions: GRANTED.
The Court must impose monetary sanctions
against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted withs
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
The Court finds that the complete failure to
respond to authorized methods of discovery—interrogatories and production
requests—supports monetary sanctions against Defendants Ross and Addition
B&D. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348, subd. (a).)
The Court also finds that the five motions
sufficiently support the requested sanctions through nearly identical
declarations from counsel, which specify the costs for filing each motion, the
reasonable fee rate charged by counsel, and the reasonable hours expended in
preparing each motion and expected to be expended in attending the hearing. (All
Motions, Frischer Decl., ¶ 5.)
All five requests for sanctions are thus
GRANTED, for a total monetary sanctions recovery of $5,308.25.
