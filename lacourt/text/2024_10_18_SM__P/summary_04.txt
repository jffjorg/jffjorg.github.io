And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of WVM Holdings, LLC v. Secured Capital Partners, Victor Franco Noval, and Jake Noval. The case involves allegations of fraudulent transfer and seeks to set aside allegedly fraudulent transfers related to the sale of property in Beverly Hills. The defendant's motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum is denied, and the motion to modify the subpoena to limit the scope to 2017 onwards is granted. The court also grants the defendant's request for a protective order to protect the privacy rights of the parties and non-parties.

The court finds that the financial records requested are relevant to the case and that the defendant's privacy rights are not being invaded. The court notes that SCP, a corporation, has no constitutional right to privacy, and that the defendant's claims of a "compelling interest" are not supported by the law. The court also finds that the subpoena is not overbroad and that the requested records should be produced.

The judge's ruling is subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented at the hearing.
