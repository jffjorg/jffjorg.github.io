Here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial in the case of Alvarez v. Kohan. The defendants, Emil Kohan, M.D. and Emil Kohan, M.D., Inc., are seeking to separate the issue of whether the statute of limitations bars the plaintiff's claims from the rest of the trial. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has determined that it is necessary to grant the motion under California Code of Civil Procedure section 597.5. The judge has also ordered the parties to present a proposal for how the trial on the issue of statute of limitations will be conducted. The plaintiff's failure to oppose the motion will be deemed as consent to granting the motion.
