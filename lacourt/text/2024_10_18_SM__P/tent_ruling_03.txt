Alvarez v. Kohan, Case no. 22SMCV01009
Hearing date October 18, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion for Order Bifurcating Trial
Plaintiff
Alvarez sues defendants Emil Kohan, M.D. and Emil Kohan, M.D., Inc. for medical
negligence and medical battery. Defendants seek to bifurcate trial under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §597.5 on the issue of statute of limitations. The motion to
bifurcate is unopposed.
“In
an action against a physician or surgeon... or a licensed hospital as the
employer of any such person, based on the person’s alleged professional
negligence, or for rendering professional services without consent, or for
error or omission in the person’s practice, if the answer pleads that the
action is barred by the statute of limitations, and if any party so moves or
the court upon its own motion requires, the issues raised thereby must be tried
separately and before any other issues in the case are tried. If the issue
raised by the statute of limitations is finally determined in favor of the
plaintiff, the remaining issues shall then be tried.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§597.5. “Where any party moves under Code of Civil Procedure section 597.5 to
have the statute of limitations issue heard and determined first, the trial
judge has no alternative except to grant the motion.” County of Kern v.
Superior Court of Kern County (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 396, 399-400.
The
court heard an ex parte application by defendants on 9/19/2024 at which
the court indicated an intention to grant the motion. Min. Order 9/19/2024. The
court ordered the parties to present a proposal as to what a court trial on the
issue of statute of limitations will look like, including the number and names
of witnesses and time estimates. Id. Defendants served notice of the
court’s 9/19/2024 ruling on plaintiff.
The
action is against a physician, and defendants’ action pleads that the statute
of limitations bars plaintiff’s claims. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §597.5 applies.
The motion is unopposed. “A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed as consent
to granting the motion.” Cal. Rules Ct. 8.54(c). The motion is GRANTED.
