Defendants’ Motion for Order
Requiring Plaintiff to File Satisfaction of Judgment
A
judgment may be satisfied by acceptance by the judgment creditor of a lesser
sum in full satisfaction of the judgment. Code Civ. Proc. §724.010(a). When a
money judgment is satisfied, the judgment creditor shall file an acknowledgment
of satisfaction of judgment. Code Civ. Proc. §724.030. If a judgment has been
satisfied, and the creditor has not filed a satisfaction of judgment, judgment
debtor may serve a demand that judgment creditor file an acknowledgment of
satisfaction of judgment. Code Civ. Proc. §724.050.
Defendants
contend plaintiff made an offer on 12/12/2022 that defendants accepted and
subsequently satisfied via the $120,000 paid between 1/23/2023 and 8/31/2023. The
declaration of counsel Small shows plaintiff conditioned acceptance of the
$120,000 on full payment on or before 1/20/23. Decl. Small II para. 1; ex. 1. 
Defendants
failed to satisfy plaintiff’s established necessary condition. Per Babaali’s
declaration, the full $120,000 was remitted. Decl. Babaali para. 7. This is not
disputed. However, the first payment of $50,000 was not remitted until
1/23/2023, 3 days after the established deadline. Id.; Decl. Small II
ex. 1. The subsequent payment was made months later.
Defendants
assert defendant Babaali appeared in pro per at a judgment debtor exam 8/28/2023,
at which plaintiff’s attorney informed him a final payment of $20,000 would settle
the matter in full. Decl. Babaali para. 20. Defendants further assert subsequent
payment of $20,000 was wired to plaintiff 8/31/2023 with the message “Paid in
full what I owed to Navitas upon receipt by Counsel." Decl. Babaali para.
22, ex. 2. 
Plaintiff
argues defendants’ 8/31/2023 payment does not constitute accord and
satisfaction. The court agrees. A unilateral message attached to a wire
transfer does not create a binding agreement between the parties. Defendants
fail to offer evidence or authority that a wire transfer can create an accord
under division 11 of the Cal. Com. Code. 
Further,
plaintiff asserts no such offer was made to defendant Babaali on 8/28/2023.
Decl. Small II pars. 7-8. Plaintiff argues defendants offered to satisfy the
matter for a final payment of $20,000. Id. at paras. 9, 13. 
Defendants
assert that plaintiff’s failure to respond to defendants’ offer or reject
defendants’ 8/31/2023 wire transfer constitutes acceptance of the final payment
of $20,000. Defendants also argue plaintiff’s failure to return the payments
received demonstrates acceptance of a partial sum in satisfaction of the full
judgment. These arguments are unavailing. 
Defendants
cannot create a unilateral condition of satisfaction as the party against whom
judgment was entered. Further, defendants cannot argue that a judgment can only
be satisfied by a single lump-payment. Plaintiff is not obliged to return
payments made towards satisfaction of a judgment. As plaintiff demonstrated,
defendants initially owed $155,258.30, of which only $120,000 has been
collected. Plaintiffs further assert that over $100,000 in remaining payments
and subsequent interest remain unpaid. Defendants have not satisfied the
judgment. DENIED.
