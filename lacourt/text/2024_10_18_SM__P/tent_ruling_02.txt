Plaintiff’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings

sues defendants Mehdizadeh and Pineapple Ventures, Inc. for breach of contract
and open accounting. Defendants cross-complained for breach of contract, breach
of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, professional negligence and
unfair business practices. The court issued sanctions on 5/17/2024 prohibiting
defendants from supporting their COAs. Min. Order 5/17/2024. The court granted
plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the cross-complaint. Min.
Order 8/2/2024. Plaintiff now moves for judgment on the pleadings for its
complaint. The motion is unopposed.

·        
August

The
court may take judicial notice of the content of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of
this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of
the United States.” Cal. Evid. Code §452(d). GRANTED.
“The
court may upon its own motion grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §438(b)(2). A motion for judgment on the pleadings should
be granted when, under “the pleadings, together with matters that may be
judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.” Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205,
1216.
Plaintiff
propounded discovery 3/22/2023. After defendants failed to respond the court ordered
responses without objections on 12/19/2023. After defendants failed to comply
with the order, the court granted plaintiff’s motion for issue and evidentiary
sanctions on 5/17/2024. 
Plaintiff
argues all defenses against its claims are barred by res judicata
following the dismissal with prejudice of defendants’ cross-complaint, which claimed
a COA for breach of the same contract that plaintiff sues over. Plaintiff also
argues defendants cannot furnish facts to support any defenses raised, as a
result of the court’s evidentiary sanctions. The court agrees.
Plaintiff’s
complaint is properly pled. Defendants are prohibited from supporting the
affirmative defenses under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.030(b) and from
introducing evidence per Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.030(c). Further, defendants
have not opposed this motion. Plaintiff sought damages of $32,968.75 plus
prejudgment interest plus attorney fees to be awarded after a noticed motion.
GRANTED.
