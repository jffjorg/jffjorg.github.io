And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Navitas Credit Corp. v. Babaali, in which defendants Hossein Babaali and Hossein Babaali, M.D. Inc. are seeking an order requiring plaintiff Navitas Credit Corp. to file a satisfaction of judgment. The plaintiff had originally received a judgment of $155,258.30 against the defendants, which they subsequently offered to compromise for $120,000 on December 12, 2022. The defendants paid $120,000 between January 23, 2023, and August 31, 2023, but the judge has ruled that this payment does not constitute a full satisfaction of the judgment.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion, finding that their attempts to create a unilateral condition of satisfaction are unavailing. The judge has also found that the plaintiff is not obliged to return payments made towards satisfaction of a judgment, and that the defendants have not fully satisfied the judgment. The matter will be heard further on October 18, 2024.
