And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings for its complaint and finds that it is proper and entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Plaintiff's complaint is properly pled and the Court agrees that all defenses against its claims are barred by res judicata following the dismissal with prejudice of defendants' cross-complaint. Furthermore, the Court notes that the defendants are prohibited from supporting their affirmative defenses under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030(b) and from introducing evidence per California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030(c). As a result, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings and awards the Plaintiff damages of $32,968.75 plus prejudgment interest plus attorney fees.
