And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Steven Romero's motion for a new trial. The motion was based on allegations of irregularity in the proceeding and juror misconduct. The judge found that the declarations presented by the Plaintiff were not credible and that the subsequent declaration from Juror #7, Annet Sasser, recanted her previous testimony. The judge also found that the declarations from other jurors corroborated Sasser's recanted testimony. As a result, the judge did not find evidence to establish misconduct or irregularity in the proceeding. The judge also ruled that the Plaintiff's new arguments raised in the reply were improper and not considered.
