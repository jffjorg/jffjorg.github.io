And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding two ex parte applications filed in the case of GPL v LLHOA. The first application seeks to release funds, while the second claims statutory exemption. The Judge notes that under Civil Code section 5260, it has a mandatory duty to ensure that essential services are protected from attachment. Preliminary findings suggest that the essential services include water, telephone, waste management, gas, electricity, liability insurance, and fire protection. Once the amount of these essential services is calculated, it will be released to the LLHOA. The remainder of the funds will be released to GPL.
