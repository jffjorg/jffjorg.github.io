 Case Number:  LC107621    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  T LC107621 GPL v LLHOA
There are two ex parte applications set: one to release funds and one claiming statutory exemption.
The court notes that under Civil Code section 5260, it is under a mandatory duty (“the court shall”) to ensure that essential services are protected from attachment.  The court preliminarily finds that those essential services would be water, telephone, waste management, gas, electricity, liability and fire insurance (but not D & O insurance), and fire protection. Once that amount is calculated, it will be released to the LLHOA.
Otherwise, the court will release the remainder of the funds held by the Orange County Sheriff to GPL.
