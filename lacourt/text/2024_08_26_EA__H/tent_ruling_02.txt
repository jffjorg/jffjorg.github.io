Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background
This is an unlawful detainer action regarding the commercial property
located at 2488 Peck Road, City of Industry, California 90601. 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff PPF Industrial Peck Center I, LP
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint, asserting the single cause of action of
unlawful detainer against Defendants Wayli Supply Chain LLC aka Wayli Supply
Chain (“Wayli”), Danny Wu (“Wu”), Shannon Huayin Cai Lee (“Lee”) (together,
“Defendants”) and Does 1-50. 
On February 8, 2024, Defendants’ defaults were entered. 
On February 13, 2024, a clerk’s default judgment for possession only was
entered. 
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for August 19, 2024.
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice. The following defect is noted: 
 Page BLI-iv of the Lease Agreement (Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of
Nicole Petsch) indicates that there was a security deposit of $91,500.00. It is unclear
to the Court whether or not the security deposit has been applied to the amount
outstanding or credited back to Defendants. The Court requests that a
supplemental declaration be provided in this regard.Accordingly, the application is denied without prejudice and Plaintiff is
directed to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned
issue.
