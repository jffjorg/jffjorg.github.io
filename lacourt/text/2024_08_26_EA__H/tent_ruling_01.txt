  Case Number:  23PSCV01900    Hearing Date:   August 26, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff Heavy Metal Steel Company, Inc.’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background  
Plaintiff Heavy Metal Steel Company (“Heavy Metal”) alleges as follows:
Heavy Metal is a licensed reinforcing steel construction contractor. On
April 5, 2022, Heavy Metal entered into a sub-subcontract with Sahara
Construction Company, Inc. (“Sahara”) to install the rebar required for the
mixed-use construction project called “Lumia Azusa II” in Azusa, California
(the “Lumia Project”). On or about August 31, 2022, Sahara informed Heavy Metal
that its rebar supplier could not supply further rebar in a timely manner.
Heavy Metal offered to take over supplying the rebar needed for the Lumia
Project at a price of 76 cents per pound including delivery, plus sales tax.
Sahara agreed, so Heavy Metal ordered rebar from InteRebar Fabricators LLC
(“InteRebar”). InteRebar made several deliveries of rebar to the Lumia Project
between September 5, 2022 and November 3, 2022 and invoiced Heavy Metal a total
of $621,300.91, which Heavy Metal included in its invoices to Sahara without
any markup. Heavy Metal also invoiced for its labor on the Lumia Project a
total of $802,705.00 on its subcontract with Sahara, plus change orders
approved by Sahara totaling $20,535.00. Sahara defaulted in paying the final
two invoices, dated October 3, 2022 and November 7, 2022. 
Sahara also owes Heavy Metal $9,962.87 on the sub-subcontract entered
into on the “Sony Adjacent” residential project—$18,052.10 on the
sub-subcontract entered into on the Righetti Ladera project and $300.00 for
services on the CHP Visalia project.
On June 26, 2023, Heavy Metal filed a complaint, asserting causes of
action for breach of contract and related claims against The Avenue Azusa, LLC
(“Avenue”), Pacific Empire Builders, Inc. (“PEB”), Sahara, Buchanan Mortgage
Holdings, LLC (“Buchanan”), Stewart Title Guaranty Company as trustee fbo
Buchanan (“Stewart Title”), InteRebar and Does 1-50.
On June 29, 2023, Heavy Metal filed two “Amendment[s] to Complaint,”
wherein BMH Lumia, LLC (“BMH”) was named in lieu of Doe 1 and Zions
Bancorporation, N.A. dba California Bank & Trust (“Zions”) was named in
lieu of Doe 2. 
On October 30, 2023, the Clerk entered default against Sahara. On
December 28, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Avenue, PEB, Buchanan, Stewart Title,
InteRebar, BMH, Zions and Does 3-25, with prejudice. 
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for August 26, 2024.  
Discussion 
Heavy Metal’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice. The following defects are noted: 
1.       Heavy Metal seeks statutory
penalties of $18,000.00 under Business & Professions Code § 7108.5 as to
the $45,000.00 in damages in connection with the ninth and tenth causes of
action. (See Arnold S. Rosenberg Supp. Decl., 3:4-6.) It is unclear to the Court
how Business & Professions Code § 7108.5 applies to the $45,000.00. Heavy
Metal is directed to provide an explanation to the Court.

2.       Linda D. Rosenberg
references unpaid invoices for Righetti in Paragraph 7 of her supplemental declaration filed July 16, 2024, but fails to attach the
invoices. The Court directs Heavy Metal to
include those invoices in its next submission.

3.       Any further default
prove-up application is to be full and complete. The Court will not review any piecemeal submissions going forward.
Accordingly, the Court denies Heavy Metal’s application without prejudice
and directs Heavy Metal to submit a new default judgment application that
addresses the aforementioned defects.
