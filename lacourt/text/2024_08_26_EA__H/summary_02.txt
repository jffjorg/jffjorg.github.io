And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the court is unsure whether the security deposit of $91,500.00 has been applied to the outstanding amount owed by the defendants. The court has requested that a supplemental declaration be provided to clarify this issue. The application for default judgment is denied, and the plaintiff is directed to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses the security deposit issue.
