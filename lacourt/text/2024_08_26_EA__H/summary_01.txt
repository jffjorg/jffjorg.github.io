The Court has denied the application without prejudice due to several defects. The defects include: (1) unclear application of Business & Professions Code ยง 7108.5 to the $45,000.00 in damages, (2) failure to attach unpaid invoices for Righetti, and (3) lack of a full and complete default prove-up application.
