And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Xavier Flores and Dana Jenkins, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Milagros Gibson. The complaint alleges causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence causing personal injury and property damage.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the personal injury claim, finding that the statute of limitations for personal injury has expired. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer as to the property damage claim, finding that the statute of limitations for property damage has not expired.

The judge has also considered the plaintiff's request to backdate the filing of the complaint, but has denied the request without prejudice to a noticed motion.

The judge invites oral argument or a request for a still further continuance before making a final ruling.
