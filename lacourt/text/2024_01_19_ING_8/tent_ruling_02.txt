 Tentative RulingHEARING DATE:  January 19, 2024 CASE NUMBER:  22TRCV00924 CASE NAME: Milagros Gibson v. Xavier Flores; Dana Jenkins MOVING PARTY: Defendants, Xavier Flores and Dana Jenkins  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Milagros Gibson (No Opposition)  TRIAL DATE:  Not Set.MOTION:  (1) Demurrer  Tentative Rulings:  (1) Defendants’ Demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the personal injury claim, but OVERRULED as to the property damage claim.      I. BACKGROUNDA. Factual On October 11, 2022, Plaintiff, Milagros filed a Complaint against Defendants Xavier Flores and Dana Jenkins (collectively “Defendants”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2) General Negligence.   Defendants filed a Demurrer to the Plaintiff’s Complaint.   B. Procedural On September 25, 2023, Defendants filed this demurrer. To date, no opposition has been filed.    On December 1, 2023, the original date of this hearing, the Court continued this motion, allowing opposition and reply briefs to be filed by deadlines governed by the continued hearing date of January 19, 2024. Nonetheless, no opposition was filed. Plaintiff did file a Supplemental brief in support of his application to date the filing of the Complaint as of October 8 or 10, 2022, perhaps in response to the defense opposition to Plaintiff’s ex parte application to back-date the filing date.      II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  With their demurrer, Defendants requested this Court take judicial notice of the following document:   Plaintiff MILAGROS GIBSON’S Complaint filed on October 11, 2022, (Exhibit A.)  This Court GRANTS Defendants’ request and takes judicial notice of the above document.   III. ANALYSIS   Legal Standard    A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Discussion   Here, the Complaint arises from an alleged accident that occurred on October 9, 2020, and alleges causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence causing personal injury to Plaintiff. Defendants demur to the Complaint on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because the causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations.  Statute of Limitations  Defendants argue that the demurrer fails to state a claim as the two causes of action are bared by the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1. A demurrer can be utilized where the dates in the complaint demonstrate that the cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. (Vaca v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 737, 746.) An action for personal injury must be brought within two years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) An action to recover for property damage is three years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (c).)¿¿  Here, the Complaint instructs that the alleged automobile accident occurred on October 9, 2020. As such, the statute of limitations for personal injury would have required that a Complaint be filed by October 9, 2022, which was a Sunday, meaning that the suit should have been field by October 10, 2022, a Monday. The Complaint in this action was not file-stamped until October 11, 2022. As such, the causes of action relating to Plaintiff’s personal injuries are time barred. However, the Complaint alleges that because of the accident, Plaintiff has suffered: (1) Loss of Use of Property; (2) Hospital and Medical Expenses; (3) General Damage; (4) Property Damage; and (5) Loss of Earning Capacity. Based on the relevant statute, Plaintiff could have brought her Complaint relating to property damage within three years, making that last date to file her claim October 9, 2023.   Thus, because Plaintiff’s action to recover damages for personal injury has a two-year statute of limitations, and because the Complaint was filed over two years after the date of the accident, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s causes of action relating to personal injury are time barred. However, Plaintiff’s causes of action relating to property damage are not. As such, the demurrer is SUSTAINED as to Plaintiff’s claim for personal injury, but is OVERRULED as to Plaintiff’s claimed property damage.   With respect to the Plaintiff’s renewed request for the Court to back-date the filing of the Complaint, the Court acknowledges that on October 14, 2022, it denied an ex parte application to alter the file-stamp on a public record, but that the denial was without prejudice to a noticed motion once the defendant had appeared.  On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a new ex parte application seeking essentially the same relief the Court denied a year earlier.  Instead of ruling on the ex parte application, which did not present good cause for emergency or other evasion of the normal times for noticed motions, the Court set a briefing schedule that in effect converted the ex parte application to a noticed motion to allow both sides ample time and opportunity to brief the issue and to submit evidence supporting their respective positions if needed.  The hearing date was continued to January 19, 2024 accordingly.  Defendant’s Opposition indicate that the ex parte application filed in November of 2023 made not mention of Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), made no admission of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and argues that the Complaint on its face shows a filing date that would be outside the two-year statute of limitations for bodily injury cases in CCP section 335.1.      Notwithstanding these specific arguments in the opposition papers, Plaintiff’s supplemental brief contains no declaration, no reference to Section 473(b), and no legal authority for the Court to alter the file stamp on a public record.  The Court invites oral argument or a request for a still further continuance.  Otherwise, the Court’s tentative would be to SUSTAIN the demurrer to the bodily injury causes of action and to OVERRULE the demurrer as to property damage claims.
