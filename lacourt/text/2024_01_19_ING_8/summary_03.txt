Summary:
The judge rules that the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is denied as to the first three causes of action, but granted as to the fourth and fifth causes of action under Section 1983. The judge finds that the statute of limitations for Section 1983 claims is governed by Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1, which provides a two-year statute of limitations. The judge also finds that the claims presentation requirement does not apply to childhood sexual assault claims. The judge grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the fourth and fifth causes of action with leave to amend to allege a basis for tolling of the statute of limitations.
