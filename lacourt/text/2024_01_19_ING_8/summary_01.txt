And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to tax costs filed by the defendants. The motion was filed to challenge the costs claimed by the plaintiffs for court reporter services. The plaintiffs claimed a total of $35,260.40 for court reporter fees, including $6,500 for "in-person coverage fees". The defendants argued that these fees were not properly described and were not reasonably necessary.

The judge has denied the motion to tax costs as to the "in-person coverage fee" because it is not properly described. However, the judge has granted the motion as to the "other" charges of $6,223.81 until the plaintiffs can direct the court to the specific items included in the over 80-page attachment to the cost bill.

The judge has also noted that the court reporter fees are reasonably necessary due to the extreme shortage of court reporters in California. The judge has requested further clarification at oral argument as to what is included in cost bill item 11 (court reporter fees) and what is not. The judge has also suggested that oral argument and perhaps a further hearing may be needed to address the over $6,000 in "other" charges.
