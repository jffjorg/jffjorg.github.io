```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the petition to compel arbitration, as the respondent failed to serve and file a timely response to the petition. The arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and the scope of arbitration is governed by the Memorandum of Understanding. The court finds that the dispute falls within the definition of a "grievance" under the Memorandum of Understanding, and the petitioner is therefore entitled to pursue this matter in binding arbitration.
