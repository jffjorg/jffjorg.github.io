STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a quiet title action, in which Plaintiff seeks to cancel a deed
of trust recorded by the previous owner of a parcel of real property. 
 
Defendant moves for attorney’s
fees. Plaintiff moves to tax Defendant’s memorandum of costs. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the
amount of $6,787.50, reflecting 9.05 hours of attorney time
at $750 per hour. 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to
Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. The Amended Memorandum of Costs is taxed as
follows:  (1) Item 10 in the amount of
$712.50;         (2) Item 11 in the
amount of $500.00; and (3) Item 16 in the amount of $150.00.  Defendant is, thus, entitled to recover a
total of $7,105.13 in fees and costs.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
 
            Defendant
moves for attorney’s fees following Plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of the
Complaint. 
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
            Defendant
contends that he is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to an
attorney’s fee provision in the Deed of Trust. 
 
            Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1021, the apportionment of attorney’s fees is left
to the agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.) However, a party who
prevails in an action is expressly entitled to recover costs, except where
otherwise provided by statute. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(b).) Attorney’s fees, as
authorized by contract, statute, or other law, are among these recoverable
costs. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10).) For the purposes of these statutes:
 
“Prevailing
party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose
favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than
monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing
party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the
court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion
costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules
adopted under Section 1034.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).) 
 
            Defendant
seeks to enforce the attorney’s fee provision in the Deed of Trust that was at
the heart of this dispute. This Deed of Trust provides:
 
            TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS DEED
OF TRUST, TRUSTOR AGREES:
 
            . . . 
 
(3)
To appear in and defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect the
security hereof or affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of
Beneficiary or Trustee; and to pay all costs and expenses, including costs of
evidence of title and attorney's fees in a reasonable sum, in any such action
or proceeding in which Beneficiary or Trustee may appear, and in any suit
brought by Beneficiary to foreclose this Deed.
 
            . . .
 
(13)
That this Deed applies to, insures to the benefit of, and binds all parties
hereto, their heirs, legatees, devisees, administrators, executors, successors
and assigns. The term Beneficiary shall mean the owner and holder, including
pledges, of the note secured hereby, whether or not named as Beneficiary
herein. In this Deed, whenever the context so required, the masculine gender
includes the feminine and/or neuter, and the singular includes the plural.
 
(Defendant’s Exh. 1.) The Deed of Trust defines the Trustor
as George Adam Adamian, the trustee as Escrow Professionals, Inc., and the
beneficiary as Violette Adamian. (Id.) 
 
            Defendant
contends that he is entitled to enforce the attorney’s fee provision against
Plaintiff because Plaintiff, as the subsequent purchaser of the property that
is the subject of the Deed of Trust, is the successor in interest to the
Trustor, and therefore subject to the deed. (See Complaint ¶ 19.) Defendant
argues that since Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this action on January 12,
2024, Defendant is the prevailing party under section 1032(a)(4) as a matter of
law. 
 
            Plaintiff
first argues in opposition that Defendant is not entitled to recover attorney’s
fees because Plaintiff is not a party to the deed of trust. This contention is not
well taken. Plaintiff admits in the Complaint that it is a successor to George
Adamian’s interest in the subject property because it purchased the property
from him on November 13, 2014. (Complaint ¶ 19.) Second, Plaintiff argues that
the fee provision in the Deed of Trust merely adds those fees to the secured debt,
citing Hart v. Clear Recon Corp. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 322, and Chacker
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 351. However, both cases cited
by Defendant concerned fee motions where the fees at issue were sought under
terms that expressly stated that fees and costs incurred to
protect the security would be added to the secured debt. (Hart, supra, 27
Cal.App.5th at 325; Chacker, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at 354.) There is no such
provision here. These arguments concerning the parties and language of the Deed
of Trust are unpersuasive. 
 
            Finally,
Plaintiff contends that Defendant cannot recover fees on the Deed of Trust
because Civil Code section 1717(b)(2) bars recovery in an action on a contract
where the Plaintiff voluntarily dismisses its claims. (Civ. Code § 1717(b)(2).)
Plaintiff is correct that Defendant cannot recover against Plaintiff’s contract
claims, such as quiet title, declaratory, and injunctive relief because they
sound in contract insofar as they concern the deed of trust. (Kachlon v.
Markowitz (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 316, 348.) However, Plaintiff also alleged
slander of title against Defendant, which is a tort. (See, e.g., Finch
Aerospace Corp. v. City of San Diego (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1248, 1253.) Tort
claims are not subject to section 1717. (Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17
Cal.4th 599, 619.) 
 
            Plaintiff
also argues that Defendant seeks to recover fees incurred following execution
of a full reconveyance by the trustee on January 3, 2024. (Declaration of
Elmira R. Howard ISO Opp. Exh. 3.) However, close reading of Defendant’s papers
shows that Defendant seeks fees incurred before that date. (See Declaration of
Robert Shtofman ISO Mot. ¶ 1.) This argument therefore goes to the
reasonableness of the fee request, not Defendant’s entitlement to fees. 
 
            In sum, the
Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated that he is entitled to recover attorney’s
fees incurred in defense of Plaintiff’s tort claims pursuant to the language of
the Deed of Trust, but not those expended to defend against Plaintiff’s
contract claims. 
 
Reasonableness of Fees
 
            Defendant
seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $13,500. 
 
Reasonable
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134
Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the
amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.) 
 
Here, Defendant seeks fees in the amount of
$13,500, based on 4.8 hours of attorney time incurred by Daniel J. Enowitz at
$750 per hour, 9.9 hours of attorney time incurred by Robert Scott Shtofman at
$750 per hour, and a further 3.3 hours anticipated by Attorney Shtofman at the
same rate. (Shtofman Decl. ¶ 1, Exhs. 2-3.) Defendant has submitted invoices
for the fees actually incurred to date. (Id.) Attorney Shtofman
testifies to his own skills, experience, and hourly rate. (Shtofman Decl ¶¶
2-3.) However, there is nothing in the record filling the same role for
Attorney Enowitz. Defendant has therefore failed to justify the request for
fees incurred by Attorney Enowitz. The Court also declines to award anticipated
hours not accounted for in Defendant’s billing invoices. 
 
As to the remaining fees, Plaintiff argues that
the fee request is not reasonable because the bulk of the fees were incurred
after the January 3, 2024 reconveyance and therefore were not fees incurred “to
defend an action or proceeding purporting to affect the security.” This
argument is specious. Fees incurred in litigating an action to completion,
including shepherding its dismissal and pursuing attorney’s fees, are fees
incurred in defending the action on their face. Plaintiff’s blunderbuss
attack on the fee request is, thus, unavailing. 
 
That said,
Plaintiff offers a more particularized challenge to the fee request, arguing
that the invoices show double billing with work done in the related cases.
Attorney Shtofman’s invoices for January 2, 2024, as well as January 4 at 3:49
PM, January 5 at 2:37 PM, and January 11 at 1:56 PM, all reference Mary
Lazarian, counsel for Plaintiff Kabala in the related action Kabala v.
Krzemuski, LASC Case No. 22STCV30044, or refer to the related action itself.
(Shtofman Decl. Exh. 3.) The Court agrees that these billing entries, totaling 1.7
hours of attorney time, should be reduced by half to account for double-billing
between cases, equivalent to 0.85 hours of attorney time at the same rate. 
 
Plaintiff
also asserts that the remaining fee requests are unreasonable because it was
unnecessary to incur fees on anything further in the matter, such as the fee
motion, the memorandum of costs, or the motion to tax costs, and because the
remaining invoices are administrative matters and correspondence. Plaintiff’s
assertions do not suffice to render these fee requests unreasonable. Defendant’s
invoices reflect a total of less than 10 hours of attorney time at an hourly
rate of $750, with none of the tasks described taking longer than an hour. (Shtofman
Decl. Exh. 3.) With the exception of the double-billed entries, Defendant’s
counsel appears to have exercised billing judgment in making efficient use of his
time to prevent runaway costs in light of his high hourly rate. The Court
therefore finds that the remaining fees, totaling 9.05 hours of attorney time
at $750 per hour, are reasonable. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is
GRANTED in the amount of $6,787.50, reflecting 9.05 hours of
attorney time at $750 per hour. 
 
//
Motion
to Tax Costs
 
            Plaintiff moves to tax costs sought via Defendant’s
Memorandum of Costs.
Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) A defendant who is dismissed from the action is the
“prevailing party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4).) This is so whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas, 17 Cal.4th at 606.)  
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
However, because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served
and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum
was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Here, Defendant served the amended
memorandum of costs by electronic service on February 5, 2024. (Amended Memorandum
of Costs POS.) This motion was filed and served on February 15, 2024. The
motion is therefore timely. 
 
Challenged Costs
 
            Plaintiff challenges four items in the memorandum of
costs: (1) Deposition Costs under Item 4 in the amount of $317.63; (2)
Attorney’s Fees in the amount of $7,500 under Item 10; (3) Court Reporter Fees
in the sum of $500 under Item 11, and (4) unspecified other costs in the amount
of $150 under Item 16.
1.      Item
4: Deposition Costs
 
            Plaintiff
first challenges Defendant’s request for $317.63 in “deposition subpoena costs”
under Item 4. (Amended Memorandum of Costs Item 4.) Deposition costs are
expressly permitted for taking, recording, and transcribing depositions,
interpreter fees at depositions, and travel expensed to attend depositions.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3).) Plaintiff contends that this cost item is
improper because there was no deposition in this action and no deposition
subpoenas served by Defendant. (Declaration of Elmira Howard ISO Mot. ¶ 6.) In
opposition, Defendant submits invoices showing the costs were incurred to
prepare responses to Plaintiff’s subpoena for records. (Defendant’s Exhs. 1-2
[invoices]; Exhs. 3-5 [subpoena for records].) As Plaintiff does not contest
this argument in reply, Defendant has justified this cost item.
 
2.      Item
10: Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
also challenges Defendant’s request for attorney’s fees. For the reasons stated
above in connection with Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, the Court
reduces Defendant’s fee request to $6,787.50.
 
3.      Item
11: Court Reporter Fees
 
            Plaintiff
contests Defendant’s request for $500 in Court reporter fees from iDepo
Reporters, invoiced for July 13, 2023. (Amended Memo. of Costs Item 11.) Court
reporter fees are expressly recoverable as established by statute. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1033.5(a)(11).) Plaintiff argues that the only hearing occurring near
that date in this matter was a July 17, 2023 Case Management Conference for
which a court reporter was not necessary and therefore should be disallowed
under section 1033.5(c)(2). In response, Defendant asserts that these costs are
reasonably necessary to the litigation. The Court does not agree. It is not “reasonably
necessary to the litigation” to hire a court reporter for a case management
conference. This cost item should be taxed.
 
4.      Item
16: Other Costs
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to tax Defendant’s request for $150 in other unspecified costs. (Amended
Memo of Costs Item 16.) As Plaintiff states, the Memorandum does not disclose
what this expense was or why it is recoverable. (Id.) In response, Defendant
argues that this cost was for photographs of the property, without explaining
what purpose those photographs served or why they were reasonably necessary to
the litigation. Defendant has not satisfied his burden to justify this cost
item. Item 16 must therefore be taxed.
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. The Amended Memorandum of
Costs is taxed as follows:
 
·        
Item 10 in the amount of $712.50
 
·        
Item 11 in the amount of $500.00
 
·        
Item 16 in the amount of $150.00.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $6,787.50,
reflecting 9.05 hours of attorney time at $750 per hour. 
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to
Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. The Amended Memorandum of Costs is taxed as
follows:  (1) Item 10 in the amount of
$712.50;         (2) Item 11 in the
amount of $500.00; and (3) Item 16 in the amount of $150.00.  Defendant is, thus, entitled to recover a
total of $7,105.13 in fees and costs.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
