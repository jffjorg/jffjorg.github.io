Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint is granted without leave to amend. The defendant had moved to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney fees, arguing that the provision in the Deposit Account Agreement (DAA) is an indemnity provision, not an attorneys' fees provision, and therefore is not subject to California Civil Code Section 1717. The judge agrees with the defendant, finding that the request for attorney fees is improper because the DAA does not contain a provision for the award of attorney fees in an action on contract. The judge also notes that the inclusion of attorney fees as an item of loss in a third-party claim indemnity provision does not constitute a provision for the award of attorney fees in an action on contract. As a result, the plaintiff's allegations regarding attorney fees should be stricken.
