And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Ravit Ohana and Sharon Ohana, granting their motion to set aside the default and default judgment against them. The defendants argued that they were never served with the summons and complaint, and the court found that the proofs of service presented by the plaintiff were improper. The defendants presented evidence that they were never authorized to accept service on behalf of the plaintiff, and that the service attempts were invalid. The court also found that the defendants had established a meritorious defense and that it is the policy of the law to favor a hearing on the merits. Therefore, the court has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment.
