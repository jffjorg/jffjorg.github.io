And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer with motion to strike the first amended complaint, filed by defendant Nai Capital, Inc. and Patrick Ortiz. The plaintiff, Almas & Son, LLC, has failed to file an opposition to the demurrer, which the judge considers to be a consent to the granting of the motion. Even if the plaintiff had opposed the demurrer, the judge agrees with the defendant that the language of the lease agreement is fatal to the plaintiff's claims. The lease agreement contradicts the plaintiff's allegations, stating that no representations were made by the broker and that the plaintiff relied on its own investigations and advisors, not the broker. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff's claims will be dismissed.
