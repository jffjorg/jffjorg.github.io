Faustino Pacheco Morales 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Faustino
Pacheco Morales and Defendants
Ravit and Sharon Ohana entered into an agreement whereby Plaintiff was to
transport dirt from one of Defendants’ properties to another. Plaintiff
submitted invoices for payments; however, Defendants have failed to pay. 
 
On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants asserting causes of action for breach of contract, common counts,
and quantum meruit.  
 
Request for entry of default was entered February 14, 2023.
The court then denied Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. Plaintiff
then sought request for entry of default again on June 12, 2023. 
 
On April 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint. Request for entry of default was again entered June 12, 2023 for
Ravit Ohana and June 15, 2023 for Sharon Ohana. The court entered default
judgment on November 9, 2023. 
 
[TENTATIVE] RULING:
 
Defendants’ Sharon Ohan and Ravit Ohana’s Motions to Set
Aside Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Ravit Ohana and Sharon Ohana move the court for
an order to vacate and set aside the Default and Default Judgment entered
against Defendants pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d)
and California Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section  473(d) provides that the “court may, upon
motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in
its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party,
set aside any void judgment or order.” Where a service of summons has not
resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action, the party
may move the court to set aside default and default judgment.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)  The motion must be made no later than two
years after entry of default or 180 days after service of a written notice that
default or default judgment has been entered.  (Ibid.)  The
party must act with diligence upon learning of the judgment.  (Trackman
v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180; Code Civ. Proc., §473.5, subd.
(a).) 
 
Defendants argue they were never served with the summons and
complaint and the proofs of service are facially invalid. Defendants point to
the proofs of service where service purportedly occurred on September 29, 2022;
January 9, 2023; and April 23, 2023. On September 29, 2022, Defendants were
purportedly served by substituted service on Maria Gonzalez; however,
Defendants contend they never authorized Ms. Gonzalez to accept service of the
complaint on their behalf. As to the January 9, 2023 proofs of service,
Defendants argue they are facially invalid because 3b. states substituted
service occurred but then checks off 5a. for personal service. Regarding the
April 23, 2023 proofs of service, Defendants, under penalty of perjury, attest
the proof of service is completely false and states they were never personally
served with any documents related to this case. (Ravit Decl. ¶7; Sharon Decl.
¶9.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues Defendants were properly
served on October 13, 2022 and April 23, 2023 by a registered process server
and Defendants have not been diligent in in seeking to set aside the default
and default judgment. Plaintiff contends Defendants had knowledge of the
lawsuit as early as February 14, 2023 when Plaintiff first sought to enter
default against Defendants. Moreover, Plaintiff contends Defendants do not have
a meritorious defense. 
 
The court finds service improper and grants Defendants’
motions to set aside default and default judgment. Plaintiff presents the
declaration of process server Ron Wilkinson. Wilkinson attests as to the January
9, 2023 and April 23, 2023 service of summons and complaint, Wilkinson knocked
on the door and Ms. Sharon Ohana opened the door. (Wilkinson Decl. ¶4, 6.)
Wilkinson attests he said “Sharon?” and to which a female purportedly responded
yes. (Wilkinson Decl. ¶4.) Wilkinson further attests he asked Sharon for her
husband, Ravit. (Wilkinson Decl. ¶6.) However, Sharon Ohana is a male and Ravit
Ohana is a female. (Sharon Decl. ¶3, Exh. A; Ravit Decl. ¶3, Exh. A.) As such,
the court finds Defendants evidence against service sufficiently rebuts that
presumption. (See Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1163.) The
court further notes Defendants have established a meritorious defense and it is
the policy of the law to favor, whenever possible, a hearing on the merits. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Sharon Ohan and Ravit Ohana’s
Motions to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED.
