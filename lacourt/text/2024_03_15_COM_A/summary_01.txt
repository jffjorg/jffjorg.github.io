And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and has denied it. The complaint alleges claims for slander and slander per se, but the court finds that the litigation privilege applies to the prior proceeding, which means that the statements made by the defendant are protected. The court also finds that the complaint does not allege facts supporting a claim for malicious prosecution. Since the complaint is not actionable, the court is dismissing the action.
