And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the information presented and has made some preliminary findings. The court notes that a declaration submitted by Mr. Allen was not part of the original complaint and therefore is not required to be considered. The court has also considered the defendant's challenge to the plaintiff's request for declaratory relief, which is based on the statute of limitations. The court finds that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to support this relief. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff has an opportunity to correct any errors in the complaint and to include additional allegations from a supplemental declaration.
