Plaintiff
also claims attorney’s fees, pursuant to paragraph 31 of the lease, but has not
included the amount. (Farasat Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 


[2]
Plaintiff cites a case that includes a demand for payment as an element for
this claim. However, upon reviewing the Guaranty Agreement, the parties agreed
to waive this requirement. Therefore, the court will deem it met (or
inapplicable).

The court is not bound by the captions or labels of a
cause of action in a pleading and the nature and character of a pleading is to
be determined from the facts alleged, not the name given by the pleader to the
cause of action.  Thus, regardless of whether the complaint gives the
causes of action a label imbued with personal property law meaning, it is the
facts behind the label which govern the nature and character of the primary
right sued upon.  (Ananda Church of
Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Insurance (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1273,
1281.)
