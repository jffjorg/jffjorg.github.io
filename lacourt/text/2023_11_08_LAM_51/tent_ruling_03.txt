TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
1.      The
court SUSTAINS Defendant Trevino’s Demurrer with leave to amend.
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 14, 2022, Plaintiff Arthur Ross Allen
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendants Jaime A. Calderon and Raul
Trevino.
 
On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related
Case.
 
On June 2, 2023, Defendant Raul Trevino (Defendant Trevino)
filed a Demurrer to the Complaint, which the court SUSTAINED on August 8, 2023
with leave to amend.
 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) with four causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2)
Conversion, (3) Unjust Enrichment, and (4) Declaratory Relief.
 
According to the
FAC, Plaintiff provided $200,000 to Defendants as an
investment to help Defendants invest in another company, 1041 Wall Street Inc.,
a marijuana growing and dispensary business. However, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants breached their agreement by failing to pay back Plaintiff’s original
investment and any net profits. Plaintiff also alleges that they are entitled
to some of the settlement monies that are held in a trust account based on
Defendants’ separate litigation with 1041 Wall Street Inc.  
 
On September 11, 2023, Defendant Calderon filed an Answer.
 
On October 3, 2023, Defendant Raul Trevino (Defendant
Trevino) filed the instant Demurrer. Plaintiff timely filed an opposition on October
25, 2023. Defendant Trevino’s timely filed a reply on November 1, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as
true. (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) Courts also consider exhibits
attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference. (See Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94 (Frantz).)
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior
to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and
confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41, and demonstrate that
they so satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41(a)(2) & (3). Upon
reviewing the Declaration of Aaron J. Flores, it does not appear that the
parties met and conferred prior to Defendant Trevino’s filing the instant
demurrer. (Flores Decl. ¶ 12.) 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
The court is unaware of any legal
authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion,
except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication [CCP § 437c (q)] or
a special motion to strike [CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019)
6 Cal.5th 931, 947-949.]  As such, the court respectfully declines to
rule on any of these objections.  The court is well aware of the rules of
evidence, and to how much weight, if any, should be given to any of the
proposed evidence.[1]
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Uncertainty
 
As a threshold matter, the court declines to develop
Defendant Trevino’s argument that the First and Fourth Causes of Action are
uncertain. “[D]emurrers for uncertainty
are disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible
that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Morris v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279,
292.) Here, the court does not agree with Defendant Trevino that the FAC is “so
incomprehensible” that he cannot “reasonably respond” to the claims against him.

 
Statute of
Limitations
 
Defendant Trevino contends that the statute of limitations
accrued at the latest on May 23, 2018 and that Plaintiff’s new allegations in
the FAC would make this date earlier, not later. As such, Plaintiff’s filing on
December 14, 2022 was after the limitations period ran.[2]
Plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations began to run on January 30,
2019, 60 weeks after the parties executed the Agreement on December 6, 2017.[3]

 
The
statute of limitations for breach of written contract is four years from the
date of the breach. (CCP § 337(a).) 
 
Upon
reviewing the FAC, Plaintiff has still failed to unambiguously alleged that the
statute of limitations does not bar the instant action. While Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants did not inform Plaintiff that they had filed a lawsuit on May
23, 2018 at the time of the lawsuit, reading the entire FAC in context, it is
clear that Plaintiff learned of the lawsuit at some time earlier.[4] The unanswered allegation is
WHEN? This is significant because this date would potentially trigger the
running of the statute of limitations. It could also defeat Plaintiff’s  performance contention (i.e., repayment of the
initial investment proceeds) was not due until January 30, 2019 (60 weeks after
the parties entered the Agreement) if Plaintiff had knowledge that there was no
longer any type of valid cultivation agreement because of the pending lawsuit.
(FAC ¶¶ 12, 25.) 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      The
court SUSTAINS Defendant Trevino’s Demurrer as to the two causes of action that
are challenged with 20 days leave to amend.[5]
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
