And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Raul Trevino to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Arthur Ross Allen. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency and uncertainty of the First and Fourth Causes of Action of the complaint. The Judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, finding that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge also declines to rule on evidentiary objections and notes that the statute of limitations for breach of written contract is four years from the date of the breach. The Judge finds that the complaint does not unambiguously allege that the statute of limitations does not bar the instant action, and that the Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient information to determine when the statute of limitations began to run.
