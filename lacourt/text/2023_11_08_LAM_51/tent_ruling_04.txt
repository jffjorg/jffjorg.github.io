The court notes that because Mr. Allen’s declaration was not an exhibit to the
FAC, the court is not obligated to consider it. (See Frantz, supra, at p. 94.)
 


[2]
Defendant Trevino’s challenge to the Fourth Cause of Action for Declaratory
Relief is on statute of limitations grounds only (contending that it fails
since the Breach of Contract claim fails). The court did not see any argument
from Defendant Trevino that addresses the elements of Declaratory Relief.
Accordingly, the court will not analyze whether Plaintiff alleged facts
sufficient to support such a cause of action or whether this cause of action is
uncertain.
 


[3]
Plaintiff cites Steiner v. Parker
(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 22, 25 to support his position that the limitations
period did not begin to run until expiration of the 60-week period.
 


[4]
Plaintiff alleges that he was “recently” told by Defendant Trevino that he was
not entitled to any settlement monies resulting from the June 2022 settlement
of the  May 23, 2018 lawsuit which
clearly suggests knowledge of the lawsuit at an earlier date. (FAC ¶ 18, 19,
20, 21, 22.)


[5]
This will also give Plaintiff an opportunity to cure purported scrivener errors
and include allegations Plaintiff deems appropriate from the supplemental
declaration attached to the Reply.
