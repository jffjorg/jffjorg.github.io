And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute over the enforceability of an agreement related to sexual harassment claims. The plaintiff is challenging the agreement based on the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Harassment Act of 2021, while the defendant argues that the Congressional intent was to limit the scope of the act. The judge agrees that the Congressional intent was to limit the scope, but finds that this argument is misplaced in this case. The plaintiff does not have any standalone employment-related claims that are not rooted in her underlying sexual harassment claims, and therefore there is a clear nexus between the claims. As a result, the judge determines that the agreement does not cover the subject dispute and will not address the issue of unconscionability.
