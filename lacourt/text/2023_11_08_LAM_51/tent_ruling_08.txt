As discussed below, Plaintiff challenges enforceability of the Agreement based
on the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Harassment Act of 2021 (“Act”),
not that the Agreement does not otherwise cover the subject dispute.

Defendant argues that the Congressional intent seeks to limit the scope of EFAA
and, while the court agrees, this argument is misplaced in this instance. The
portion of the Congressional record that Defendants cite states, in pertinent
part, “we agreed that harassment or assault claims should not be joined to an
employment claim without a key nexus.” (168 Cong. Rec. S624-01, S625)
(bolding added.) Notably, Plaintiff does not have any standalone
employment-related claims that are not rooted in her underlying sexual
harassment claims. Stated otherwise, here there is a clear nexus to the all the
claims and the sexual harassment allegations.

Both parties direct this court to cases from New York. Such cases are not
binding here. 


[4]
Because the court determines that the Agreement does not cover the subject
dispute, the court will not address unconscionability.
