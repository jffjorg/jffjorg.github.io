And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the nature and character of the causes of action brought by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is claiming attorney's fees under paragraph 31 of the lease, but has not specified the amount. The court has reviewed the Guaranty Agreement and has found that it waives the demand for payment, which is an element of the claim. The court also notes that the plaintiff is relying on a case that includes a demand for payment as an element, but this requirement is waived under the Guaranty Agreement. The court will deem the demand for payment met (or inapplicable). The judge is also considering the application of case law, specifically the case of Ananda Church of Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Insurance, which holds that the court is not bound by the captions or labels of a cause of action in a pleading. The judge will make a final ruling after considering the parties' arguments and evidence.
