And here is the English-text summary:

In a tentative ruling, Judge [Judge's Name] has decided to sustain the demurrer filed by the defendant, a public entity, without leave to amend. The plaintiff claims that the defendant had a duty to provide mirrors in the men's bathroom, and that the lack of a mirror triggered his condition, causing him great distress. The defendant argues that as a public entity, it is protected by sovereign immunity and that the plaintiff has not identified a specific statute that declares the entity to be liable or creates a specific duty of care. The Judge agrees, citing Koussaya v. City of Stockton (2020) and Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. County of Riverside (1980). The Judge also notes that the plaintiff did not comply with the claims presentation requirement and did not allege compliance with the claims procedure. The motion to strike is deemed moot. The Judge will ask the plaintiff about the possibility of amending the complaint to cure these defects, but notes that it does not appear that these defects can be cured by amendment.
