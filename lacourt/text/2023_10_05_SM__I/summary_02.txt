And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling dismisses the case without prejudice, citing the plaintiff's failure to prosecute and failure to abide by the court's final status conference requirements. The case has been ongoing for almost four years, and the plaintiff has not made any progress in preparing for trial. The judge finds the plaintiff's claims of a settlement agreement to be uncredible and notes that the plaintiff has a pattern of only taking action on the day of or day before a hearing. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not litigated the case and that the time has come to end the litigation.
