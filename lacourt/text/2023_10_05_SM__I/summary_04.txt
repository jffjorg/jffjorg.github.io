English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a good faith determination in an auto accident case. The settling defendant has tendered the full policy limits in return for a release, and two out of three plaintiffs have agreed to the settlement. The judge needs more information to determine whether the settling defendant acted in good faith, including verification of the defendant's claim that it has no meaningful assets to satisfy a judgment. The judge also wants more detail on how the settlement proceeds will be allocated and apportioned between economic and non-economic damages. The motion is denied without prejudice, pending additional information.
