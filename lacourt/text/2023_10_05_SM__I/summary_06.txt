And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The court has denied the request to join the demurrer, as it is not specific about the common basis of the joinder and the relief sought. The court has also granted the request for judicial notice.

The court has ruled on the demurrers to the first two causes of action, finding that the allegations are sufficient to survive a pleading motion. The court has also ruled on the demurrer to the quiet title claim, finding that the allegations sound in fraud and therefore the claim may proceed.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the injunctive relief claim, but notes that plaintiffs may be entitled to injunctive relief.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the UCL claim, finding that the allegations demonstrate a violation of Civil Code section 2924m.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for negligence, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a claim.

The court has given defendants 30 days to answer.
