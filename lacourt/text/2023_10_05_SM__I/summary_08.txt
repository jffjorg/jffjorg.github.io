And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the documents submitted by the parties and has some concerns. The judge questions the Bates numbers listed in the Exhibit List, wondering if they are actually page numbers or if there are indeed over 800 pages in some exhibits. The judge asks the parties to clarify this issue and draft a note to correct the problem. The judge also notes that the jury instructions are missing and will need to be submitted in proper format. The judge is unsure if Department 1 will accept the 95-page special verdict form, but will not order it to be redone. The judge hopes that the matter will be ready to proceed to Department 1 for long cause determination after the parties address the issues raised in the ruling.
