And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case filed by James C. Keller against West Angeles Housing Partners, L.P. The case involves allegations of civil fraud, violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, business malpractice, and other claims related to the rejection of Keller's application for low-income housing. The judge finds that the claims are untimely because they were filed more than four years after the alleged wrongdoing occurred. Additionally, the judge finds that the complaint lacks actionable conduct by the defendant and that no amendment to the complaint would cure the deficiencies. As a result, the judge sustains the defendant's demurrer, denies leave to amend, and takes the motion to quash off-calendar as moot.
