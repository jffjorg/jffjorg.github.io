  Case Number:  22STCV33046    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  39 Nam Suk Park v.
Huge USA, Inc., et al.
Case No. 22STCV33046
Motion to Compel     
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel Defendant Jer Sier Park (“Defendant”) to produce certain
documents demanded in the deposition notice. 
After this motion was filed, Defendant produced the requested documents
except for surveillance videos.  (See
Declaration of Samuel F. Izzo, ¶ 10.)  
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.280, subd. (e) states that the “demanding party”
shall pay “the reasonable expense” of “translat[ing] any data compilations
included in the demand into reasonably usable form.”  Defendant has advanced sufficient evidence
that it requires technical expertise to produce the surveillance video at issue.  (See Declaration of Peter Park, ¶¶ 7, 8.)
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.         The
motion is denied as moot with respect to everything except the surveillance
video at issue.  
 
2.         Defendant
shall obtain a quote from a vendor to transfer the surveillance video to a
usable format and provide the quote to Plaintiff’s counsel within fifteen (15) days.  
 
3.         Plaintiff
may obtain a quote from a competing vendor.
 
4.         The
Court continues the hearing on the motion with respect to the surveillance
video to March 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  
 
5.         At
that hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel shall be prepared to discuss whether his client
intends to pay these costs or will withdraw the motion with respect to
surveillance video.
 
6.         The
Court denies all requests for sanctions.
 
7.         The
Court advances and continues the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment to April 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
8.         The
Court advances and vacates the final status conference and trial dates.  The Court shall hold a trial setting
conference on April 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 

 
9.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
