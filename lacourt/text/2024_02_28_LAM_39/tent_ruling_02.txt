            Notice: The
Court posts this tentative order in advance of the hearing.  If Plaintiff does not appear, he shall waive
the right to be heard and shall submit to entry of this order.  
 
            Plaintiff
James C. Keller (“Plaintiff”), a self-represented party, filed this action
against Defendant West Angeles Housing Partners, L.P. (“Defendant”) asserting
the following causes of action: (1) Civil Fraud in violation of Government Code
section 14842.5(2); (2) Violation of Government Code section 129279(c)(1); (3)
Harassment and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act
(“FEHA”), Government Code section 12940(j); (4) Business Malpractice in
violation of Civil Procedure section 340.5; (5) Fraud; (6) Intentional Tort;
(7) Negligence; and (8) Common Counts.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that he applied
for residence at Defendant’s building and was rejected because his household
annual income was greater than the allowable limit.  Plaintiff alleges that was “fraudulent and
not true.”  Plaintiff alleges that he
submitted his intake rental application on July 8, 2019, and that he received a
“Notice of Application Ineligibility” on November 7, 2019.  Plaintiff alleges that he filed an appeal and
there was a hearing on November 20, 2019, following which he received a letter
dated December 9, 2019, stating: “A decision has been made to reinstate your
application.”  However, Plaintiff alleges
that he did not receive a unit and was placed on the wait list, which he
learned on December 23, 2019.  
 
Defendant moves to quash service of
the summons and complaint and, in the alternative, demurs to the claims based
upon the statute of limitations, among other grounds.  Based upon his allegations, Plaintiff’s
claims accrued no later than December 23, 2019. 
This case was filed almost four years later, on September 11, 2023.  This is problematic because the statutes of
limitations are as follows:
 
1.         Civil
Fraud in violation of Government Code section 14842.5(2) – This statute does
not apply to Plaintiff’s case but the statute of limitations for a fraud claim
is three years, per Code of Civil Procedure section 338(d).
 
2.         Violation
of Government Code section 129279(c)(1) – Assuming this claim arises under the
FEHA, the status of limitations is two years, per Code of Civil Procedure
section 12989.1.
 
3.         Harassment
and retaliation in violation of the FEHA – The statute of limitations is two
years, per Code of Civil Procedure section 12989.1.
 
4.         Business
Malpractice in violation of Civil Procedure section 340.5 – Even assuming this
claim applies to Plaintiff’s allegations, the statute of limitations is three
years.
 
5.         Fraud
– The statute of limitations is three years, per Code of Civil Procedure
section 338(d).
 
6.         Intentional
Tort – Plaintiff does not specify the intentional tort, but the statute of
limitations based upon Plaintiff’s allegations is two years, per Code of Civil
Procedure section 335.1.
 
7.         Negligence
– The statute of limitations for negligence is two years, per Code of Civil
Procedure section 335.1.
 
8.         Common
Counts – This claim relies on the underlying statutes of limitations.  
 
Emergency Rule 9 tolled the statutes of limitations from
April 1, 2020, through October 1, 2020, which was a period of 178 days.  However, this does not save Plaintiff’s
claims because the longest statute of limitations would have run on June 19,
2023.  This case was filed on September
11, 2023.  Therefore, the claims are
untimely.
 
            In
addition, Plaintiff fails to articulate any actionable conduct by Defendant.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant erred in
determining that he did not qualify for low-income housing and then changed this
decision when Plaintiff demonstrated the error. 
Without more, this conduct does not amount to fraud, housing
discrimination, harassment, retaliation, business malpractice, or any other
claim alleged by Plaintiff.      
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court sustains Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
            2.         The Court denies leave to amend, as no
amendment would cure the deficiencies in Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
            3.         The Court takes Defendant’s motion to
quash off-calendar as moot.
 
            4.         Counsel for Defendant shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
