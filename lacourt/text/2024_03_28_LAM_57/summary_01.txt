And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendants Crown Financial Partners LLC and Jonathan Beck (collectively, "Beck") to the fourth cause of action for negligence in the Plaintiffs' complaint. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend for two reasons. Firstly, the allegations in the Plaintiffs' complaint fail to show that Beck assumed a duty to the Plaintiffs' deceased family member Erez Talmor to ensure that premiums on Erez's life insurance policy were paid. Secondly, the statute of limitations on a negligence claim is two years, and on the face of the allegations in the complaint, Plaintiff Leora Talmor's negligence claim against Beck is time-barred because the claim accrued more than two years before she sued Beck. The Judge will elaborate on its reasons for sustaining the demurrer at the hearing this morning.
