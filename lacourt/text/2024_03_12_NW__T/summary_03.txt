And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Virtue at the Pointe, LLC against Defendant David McGarry. The Court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action for unjust enrichment, but has overruled the demurrer as to the other five causes of action. The Court has ordered Defendant to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days.

The Court has found that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to plead the first and third causes of action for business disparagement and libel, and the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action for interference with contract, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Court has also found that Plaintiff has complied with the pleading requirements for these causes of action.

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for unjust enrichment because it is a remedy and not a cause of action. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the other five causes of action because Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to plead these causes of action.

The Court's ruling is based on the allegations in the First Amended Complaint and the case law cited in the opinion.
