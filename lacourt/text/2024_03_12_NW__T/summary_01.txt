Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions: (1) a motion to compel further answers to special interrogatories, (2) a motion for evidence sanctions, and (3) a motion for good faith settlement. On the first motion, the judge orders the defendant to provide additional information about several individuals, including their last known addresses and job titles. On the second motion, the judge continues the matter to allow the court to review documents and deposition testimony. On the third motion, the judge grants the defendant's request for a determination of good faith settlement and allows them to review the settlement agreement in camera. The judge finds that the settlement agreement is within the ballpark of the plaintiff's recovery and that the defendant has sufficiently demonstrated that the settlement was entered in good faith.
