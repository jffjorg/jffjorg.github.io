And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer (motion to dismiss) and granted the motion to strike certain portions of the First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Rose Adele Cavanagh, alleges abuse, neglect, and negligence by the defendants, Pacifica SL Santa Clarita LLC, Pacifica Living Management LLC, W Lyons LLC, and Pacifica Companies LLC, while she was a resident at Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims for elder abuse/neglect, willful misconduct, unfair business practices, and battery are insufficiently pled or fail to state a claim.

The court gives the plaintiff 30 days to amend the First Amended Complaint to cure the defects. The court also warns the parties that failure to comply with the filing requirements may result in papers not being considered.
