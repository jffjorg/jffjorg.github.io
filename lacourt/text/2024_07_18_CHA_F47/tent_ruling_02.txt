SUMMARY OF
FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 8/10/23,
Plaintiff Alvaro Castellon (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants Roy
Esqueda; Estate of Brenda Marie Perez; Amanda Esqueda; Jennifer Helliwell, Joy
Arredondo and Does 1-50.  On 9/14/23,
Defendants Roy Esqueda, Amanda Esqueda, Jennifer Helliwell and Joy Arredondo
(collectively, Defendants) filed an answer to the complaint.
 
After taking the
depositions of Defendants Jennifer Helliwell and Roy Esqueda, pursuant to
Plaintiff’s request, Defendants stipulated to Plaintiff filing a First Amended
Complaint which added causes of action for conversion and fraud/concealment and
included a claim for punitive damages.  (See
3/15/24 Stipulation and Order).  Pursuant
to the stipulation, Defendants had 30 days to respond to the First Amended
Complaint after it was filed.  Id.  On 3/20/24, Plaintiff filed and served the
First Amended Complaint.  On 5/1/24,
pursuant to Plaintiff’s requests, separate defaults were entered against each
of the Defendants.  
 
When Defendants’
counsel became aware of the defaults, a request was made to Plaintiff to
stipulate to have the defaults set aside because they were the result of a calendaring
error on the part of Defendants’ counsel. 
(See Tran Decls.).  Plaintiff’s
counsel failed to respond to the request. 
(Tran Decls.).
 
Therefore, on 5/23/24,
Defendants each filed a motion to have the default entered against them set
aside.  On 5/29/24, at the Case
Management Conference, the Court advanced the hearings on the motions to 7/18/24
and the parties waived notice.  (See
5/29/24 Minute Order).  Plaintiff has not
opposed or otherwise responded to the motions. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to the
attorney declarations of fault that accompany each motion and the fact that the
motions were filed and served well within 6 months of the entry of default,
relief is mandatory.  See CCP
473(b); (Tran Decls.).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are
granted.  Defendants Roy Esqueda, Amanda
Esqueda and Joy Arredondo are ordered to separately file their Answer to the
First Amended Complaint which is attached to each of their motions as Exhibit
A.  Defendant Jennifer Helliwell is
ordered to reserve a hearing date for the demurrer and motion to strike
attached to her motion as Exhibits A and B and file and serve such pleadings
which indicate the reserved hearing date.
