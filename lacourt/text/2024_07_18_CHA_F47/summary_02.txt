And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions of the defendants (Joy Arredondo, Jennifer Helliwell, Roy Esqueda, and Amanda Esqueda) to set aside the defaults entered against them on May 1, 2024. The defaults were entered due to a calendaring error on the part of the defendants' counsel, and the defendants had filed and served their motions to set aside the defaults well within six months of the entry of default. The court has also ordered the defendants to file their Answer to the First Amended Complaint, which is attached to each of their motions as Exhibit A. Additionally, the court has ordered Defendant Jennifer Helliwell to reserve a hearing date for her demurrer and motion to strike, which is attached to her motion as Exhibits A and B, and to file and serve such pleadings which indicate the reserved hearing date.
