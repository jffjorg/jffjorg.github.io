SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from the care and services provided to
Plaintiff Rose Adele Cavanagh (Plaintiff) beginning on 7/24/20 while she was a
resident at Defendant Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita (the Facility), a
residential care facility for the elderly. 
Plaintiff alleges that all defendants owned, operated, managed and/or
controlled the Facility.  (FAC ¶¶11,
14-15).
 
Plaintiff alleges that between 9/13/20 through 12/10/20,
while she was in the care and custody of Defendants, she developed a Stage 2
wound on her coccyx because she was not properly turned.  (FAC ¶19). 
Plaintiff alleges that due to the worsening of the wounds she was transferred
out of Defendants’ care on 5/21/21 until 6/4/21 when she returned.  (FAC ¶¶20-21).  Plaintiff alleges that on 8/28/21, she had
developed a Stage 1-2 wound on her buttocks due to Defendants’ failure to turn
and reposition her throughout the day as required.  (FAC ¶22). 

 
Plaintiff alleges that on 5/5/22, Defendants’ employee “forcefully
transferred Plaintiff from her bed to her wheelchair when her left leg was
stuck in the bed – snapping Plaintiff’s left tibia and fibula requiring
surgery.”  (FAC ¶24).
 
On 8/2/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants
Pacifica SL Santa Clarita LLC dba Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita
erroneously sued as Pacifica Senior Living aka Pacifica Senior Living Newhall
aka Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita; Pacifica Living Management LLC; W
Lyons LLC; Pacifica Companies LLC dba Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita
(collectively, Defendants) for: (1) Negligence and (2) Elder Abuse.  In response to Defendants’ demurrer and
motion to strike addressing the original complaint, on 3/20/24, Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint against Defendants for: (1) Dependent and
Elder Abuse/Neglect, (2) Willful Misconduct, (3) Negligence, (4) Unfair
Business Practices (Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.) and (5)
Battery.  
 
After Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond to
Defendants’ meet and confer efforts regarding the First Amended Complaint, on
5/28/24, Defendants filed and served the instant demurrer to the 1st,
2nd, 4th and 5th causes of action in the First
Amended Complaint and motion to strike which seeks to strike portions of the
First Amended Complaint regarding punitive/exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees
and costs under Welfare & Institutions Code 15657, restitutionary
disgorgement pursuant to Business and Professions Code 15657 and treble damages
pursuant to Civil Code 3345.  The
demurrer and motion to strike were originally scheduled for hearing on 7/9/24.  On 6/21/24, Plaintiff filed a combined
opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike but failed to serve the
document on Defendants.  After Defendants’
filed and served notices of non-opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike
on 6/27/24, Plaintiff served the opposition on Defendants on 6/27/24, 2 days
late.  See CCP 1005(b).
 
On 7/2/24, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to
continue the hearing by at least 2 court days to allow Defendants to file a
reply.  On 7/5/24, the Court granted the
ex parte application, continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to
strike to 7/18/24 and allowed Defendants until 7/15/24 to file and serve a
reply.  Despite having 11 court days to
file and serve a reply after receiving the opposition, Defendants still argue
that Plaintiff’s failure to oppose the demurrer and motion to strike requires
that the Court sustain the demurrer in its entirety.  (See Reply, p.2:22-p.3:1).  
 
The Court finds that continuing the hearing on the
demurrer and motion to strike and allowing Defendants additional time to file
and serve their reply cured any prejudice Defendants may have suffered by the
delayed service of the opposition.  As
such, the Court considered the opposition arguments in ruling on the demurrer
and motion to strike.  
The Court further notes that the memorandum of points and
authorities filed in support of the demurrer exceeds the 15-page limit by 5
pages without court approval.  See
CRC 3.1113(d), (e).  Despite the
foregoing rule violation, the Court has considered the entirety of the
opposition.  See CRC 3.1113(g);
CRC 3.1300(d).  
 
The parties are warned that failure to comply with the filing
requirements in the future (i.e., timeliness, length of memorandums) may result
in papers not being considered. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
1st cause of action – Dependent and Elder
Abuse/Neglect
 
Statutory causes of action such as dependent adult/elder
abuse/neglect must be pleaded with particularity.  Covenant Care, Inc. (2004) 32 C4th
771, 790; Carter (2011) 198 CA4th 396, 410.  To recover for dependent adult/elder abuse/neglect,
a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is
liable for physical abuse as defined by Welfare & Institutions Code
15610.63 or neglect as defined by Welfare & Institutions Code 15610.57, and
that the defendant is guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in
the commission of the abuse/neglect.  See
Welfare & Institutions Code 15657; Delaney (1999) 20 C4th 23, 31-32;
Covenant Care, supra at 785.
 
Plaintiff has failed to plead facts to establish the necessary
egregious and willful misconduct by Defendant to state a claim for dependent
adult/elder abuse by Defendants.  With
regard to the pressure wounds suffered by Plaintiff while a resident at the
Facility, Plaintiff admits that she suffered from such injuries before she
entered the Facility.  (FAC ¶¶16-17).  Additionally, Plaintiff does not allege that
Defendants completely failed to care for her or treat the wounds.  Rather, Plaintiff alleges that she was “not
properly turned” and “not receiving proper care.”  (FAC ¶19). 
While such allegations are sufficient to support a claim for negligence,
they are insufficient to state a claim for elder abuse/neglect.  See Carter, supra
406-407, 410.  
 
The allegations regarding the incident that occurred on
5/5/22 which resulted in Plaintiff suffering a broken leg are also insufficient
to support a claim for elder abuse/neglect. 
Again, while the allegations are sufficient to state a claim for
negligence, they do not show the type of egregious and willful misconduct
necessary to state this statutory claim. 
(FAC ¶24); See Cochrum (2018) 25 CA5th 1034, 1044-1045; Delaney,
supra 31-32, 35; Civil Code 3294(c).
 
Even if Plaintiff had pled the type of egregious conduct
necessary to state a claim for elder abuse/neglect, she has not pled sufficient
facts to show the requisite authorization and/or ratification of such conduct
by any of the entity defendants.  See
Welfare & Institutions Code 15657(c); Civil Code 3294(b).  Rather, Plaintiff merely concludes that the conduct
alleged was authorized and/or ratified by managerial employees of
Defendants.  (See FAC ¶¶41, 50,
60).  Plaintiff has not pled that any
employee was unfit or that Pacifica Santa Clarita or any other Defendant was
aware of any wrongful conduct by an employee or knowingly hired any unfit
employee or authorized or ratified any act of the alleged abuse/neglect.  The vague allegations do  not comply with the requirement that each
specific element must be pled to state a cause of action for elder abuse/neglect.  See Covenant Care, supra
at 790.  
2nd cause of action – Willful Misconduct
 
Plaintiff’s willful misconduct cause of action is
duplicative of her negligence and/or elder abuse causes of action.  (See FAC ¶43).  In Berkley (2007) 152 CA4th 518,
relied on by Plaintiff to support her argument that the claim is not
duplicative, the Court of Appeal held that willful misconduct “is not a
separate tort, but simply “ ‘ “an aggravated form of negligence, differing in
quality rather than degree from ordinary lack of care.’”  Id. at 526 internal citations omitted.  To the extent that such a claim could be
deemed a different claim from negligence due to the stricter pleading requirements,
the claim is duplicative of the elder abuse/neglect cause of action which must
be based on willful misconduct, as set forth above.  (See FAC ¶46 whereat Plaintiff refers
to the Elder/Dependent Adult Abuse Act in the willful misconduct cause of
action).  Whether included in the
negligence claim or the elder abuse/neglect claim, Plaintiff has failed to
allege sufficient facts to support the following required elements for a claim
based on willful misconduct: (1) actual or constructive knowledge of the peril
to be apprehended; (2) actual or constructive knowledge that injury is a
probable, as opposed to a possible, result of the danger, and (3) conscious
failure to act to avoid the peril.  Simmons
(1976) 62 CA3d 341, 360.  
 
4th cause of action – Unfair Business
Practices (Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.)
 
A claim for unfair business practices may be based on unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business practices. 
See Business & Professions Code 17200; Daugherty
(2006) 144 CA4th 824, 837.  In order for
a private plaintiff to recover on such a claim, there must be a causal
connection between the harm suffered and the unlawful business activity.  Daro (2007) 151 CA4th 1079, 1099.  No such connection exists when the plaintiff would
have suffered the same harm whether or not the defendant complied with the
law.  Id.
 
This cause of action is based, at least in part, on
Plaintiff’s claims of abuse and neglect which form the basis of her insufficient
elder abuse/neglect claim.  (See
FAC ¶63).  As such, this claim fails for
the same reasons as the 1st cause of action.  Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to
establish that the harm she allegedly suffered was caused by Defendants’
purported failure to comply with various laws. 
(See FAC ¶¶28, 34).
 
5th cause of action – Battery
 
The elements of a battery cause of action are: (1) defendant
touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm
or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3)
plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant’s conduct; and (4) a reasonable
person in plaintiff’s position would have been offended by the touching.  So (2013) 212 CA4th 652, 669.        
 
While not entirely clear from the allegations within the
5th cause of action, it appears that this claim is based on the
5/5/22 transfer incident which resulted in Plaintiff suffering a broken
leg.  Plaintiff has failed to allege
facts to support the necessary elements of a battery claim.  Based on the totality of the allegations in
the First Amended Complaint, it is clear that Plaintiff consented to being
touched by Defendants’ employees for her care, including being transferred from
her bed to her wheelchair.  (See
FAC ¶¶17, 24, 72).  Also, Plaintiff has
not alleged facts which show that Defendants/Defendants’ employee touched
plaintiff with the intent to harm or offend plaintiff.  
 
Motion to Strike
 
Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to
support the damage allegations Defendants seek to have stricken.  The prayers for punitive/exemplary damages,
attorneys’ fees and costs under Welfare & Institutions Code 15657,
restitutionary disgorgement pursuant to Business and Professions Code 15657 and
treble damages pursuant to Civil Code 3345 relate to the 1st, 2nd,
4th and 5th causes of action which, as noted above, are
insufficiently pled.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained and the motion to strike is
granted.  Due to the liberal policy of
allowing leave to amend and since this is the first time the Court is ruling on
the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s pleading, Plaintiff is given the opportunity to
try to cure the defects in the First Amended Complaint.  A Second Amended Complaint is due to be filed
and served within 30 days.
