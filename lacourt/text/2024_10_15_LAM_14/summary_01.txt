And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to maintain the confidentiality of certain documents designated as confidential under the parties' stipulation. The documents in question include Quality Information Sheets (QIS) that report the evaluation of the field performance of the components of the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) in various Honda vehicles, as well as internal analyses and sales data. The defendant alleges that these documents contain trade secrets, and the court finds that the defendant has sufficiently justified the confidential designation of these documents. The court notes that the defendant maintained confidentiality during disclosure to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and that the lack of opposition to the motion amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious.
