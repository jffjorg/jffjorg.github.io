Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff's motion to set aside the August 28, 2024 order denying his motion for reconsideration. The Court finds that Plaintiff's arguments are without merit and that he has failed to show that the order denying the motion for reconsideration was entered due to fraud. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's 168-page motion to set aside was filed in bad faith and that he has filed many frivolous documents in this matter. As a result, the Court is considering whether limitations should be placed on court services for which Plaintiff's fees were waived. The Court sets an OSC re: revocation of fee waiver for November 8, 2024.
