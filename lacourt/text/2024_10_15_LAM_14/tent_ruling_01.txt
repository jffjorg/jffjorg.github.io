Discussion
The parties’ stipulations granted on August 2, 2022 and
November 28, 2022 provided a process for the partis to dispute the confidential
status of documents produced in discovery:
“In the event that counsel for a Party receiving
Documents, Testimony or Information in discovery designated as “Confidential”
objects to such designation with respect to any or all of such items, said
counsel shall advise counsel for the Designating Party, in writing, of such
objections, the specific Documents, Testimony or Information to which each
objection pertains, and the specific reasons and support for such objections
(the “Designation Objections”). Counsel for the Designating Party shall have thirty
(30) days from receipt of the written Designation Objections to either (a)
agree in writing to dedesignate Documents, Testimony or Information pursuant to
any or all of the Designation Objections and/or (b) file a motion with the
Court seeking to uphold any or all designations on Documents, Testimony or
Information addressed by the Designation Objections (the “Designation Motion”).
Pending a resolution of the Designation Motion by the Court, any and all
existing designations on the Documents, Testimony or Information at issue in
such Motion shall remain in place. The Designating Party shall have the burden
on any Designation Motion of establishing the applicability of its
“Confidential” designation. In the event that the Designation Objections are
neither timely agreed to nor timely addressed in the Designation Motion, then
such Documents, Testimony or Information shall be de-designated in accordance
with the Designation Objection applicable to such material.”
(See stipulations at ¶6.)
Here, the parties dispute whether the following
documents, identified by bates number, are confidential.
ARCE001119-001125 
ARCE001127-001162 
ARCE003389 –003733 
ARCE003734-004065 
ARCE004086-004179
ARCE005910-007200 
ARCE010072-036783 
ARCE037467-037563
Plaintiff objected to the confidential designation of
these documents on the grounds that they were not trade secrets because they
were assembled from non-confidential consumer sources, vehicle components
readily accessible to third parties, and do not reveal protected material.
The Evidence Code defines a trade secret as anything
defined as a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Sections Act. (Evidence Code,
section 1061(a)(1).) The Uniform Trade Secrets Act defines the term as
information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device method,
technique or process that derives independent economic value from not being
generally known to the public or others who may obtain economic value from its
disclosure and use and is the subject of reasonable efforts to keep the information
secret. (Civ. Code, section 3426.1(d).)  
Here, Defendant alleges that Arce 4109 to 4111, 4112 to
4121, 4122, 4123 to 4124, 4125 to 4126, 10072 to 10086, 10113, 10114, 10115,
10116, 10117, 10118, 10119 and 10120 are Quality Information Sheets (QIS) which
report the evaluation of the field performance of the components of the Collision
Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) in the 2017 and 2019 Honda CR-V and the 2018
to 2019 Honda Accord vehicles. (Inak Decl., ¶24.) Arce 4127 to 4138 contain confidential
data summarizing the QIS and internal analysis. (Id., ¶25.) These
documents are confidential because the information contained in the internal
analysis is trade secret material which would enable a competitor to analyze
the components and analyze them. (Id.)
Arce 4139 is a flow chart showing the process developed
by defendant for its investigation of Honda vehicles. (Inak Decl., ¶26.) The
process is confidential because a competitor could copy the process. (Id.)
Arce 4140 to 4145 contain internal analyses of a
scenario in Japan where CMBS activations unique to Japan’s railway crossings
were observed. (Inak Decl., ¶27.) These analyses are confidential because the
methodologies and processes used to evaluate the issue are trade secrets. (Id.)
Arce 7197 to 7200 contain confidential sales data
regarding the number of 2017-2019 Honda CR-V and 2018-2019 Honda Accord
vehicles were sold with service contracts. (Inak Decl., ¶ 28.) The information
is trade secret material because it shows that prevalence of Honda customers
buying service contracts and the ranges of coverage purchased. (Id.) A
competitor could access the data to assess the typical length of service
contracts sold by Honda. (Id.) 
Arce 10120 to 10132, 6932 to 6933, and 7194 to 7196
contain search terms and Defendant’s Confidential Response to NHTSA Preliminary
Evaluation 22-003 which contain all the confidential information identified
above.
The Court finds that Defendant sufficiently justifies the
disputed documents’ confidential designation because the documents meet the
definition of “Trade Secret” articulated in Civ. Code, section 3426.1(d). Although
Plaintiff’s counsel argued in meet and confer correspondence that the
information is no longer confidential after disclosure to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, Defendant maintained the documents’
confidentiality during disclosure by requesting confidential treatment under 49
CFR, section 512.15(d). Additionally, the motion is unopposed. The lack of an
opposition amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious. (See
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg
v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 (the party who
fails to argue an issue abandons that issue).) 
Here, because Defendant provides sufficient
justification for designating the disputed documents as confidential,
Defendant’s motion to maintain the documents’ confidentiality is GRANTED.
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to maintain the confidentiality of
the following documents is GRANTED:
ARCE001119-001125 
ARCE001127-001162 
ARCE003389 –003733 
ARCE003734-004065 
ARCE004086-004179
ARCE005910-007200 
ARCE010072-036783 
ARCE037467-037563
