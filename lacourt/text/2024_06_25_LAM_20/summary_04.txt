And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the motion for summary adjudication as to all issues, except for attorneys' fees and costs. The Judge finds that there is no opposition to the motion and that the defendants are liable for unpaid overtime wages, failure to provide accurate wage statements, and failure to pay all wages at termination. The Judge also finds that the defendants engaged in unfair business practices. The Judge denies the motion for attorneys' fees and costs, as a motion for summary adjudication cannot be directed at such relief. The Judge orders the defendants to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $176,118.25 and $5,930.70, respectively.
