And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The plaintiffs, Martin L. Waterman and the Law Offices of Waterman & Harris, filed a complaint for equitable indemnity and contribution. However, the defendants, Leslie Harris and Michelle Silver, personal representatives of The Estate of Howard Harris, demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts. The court finds that there is no substantive opposition to the complaint and therefore deems the subject causes of action abandoned. The demurrer is sustained. The court grants the request for judicial notice and allows the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their pleading. The court also grants the motions to compel, requiring the plaintiffs to provide initial responses to the defendants' form interrogatories and requests for production within 30 days. The court awards reduced sanctions of $1,000.
