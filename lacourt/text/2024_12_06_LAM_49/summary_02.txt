And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant, Air Venezia, LLC, contends that it was never validly served with the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Clare Sassoon, brought this action against Air Venezia and Michelle Levix, alleging that they attempted to evict her from her unit in Venice based on false claims and engaged in harassment and "dirty tricks". The defendant argues that the service was ineffective because the person who accepted the documents, Jessica Bosch, was not authorized to accept service on its behalf. The plaintiff has not opposed the motion, and the judge finds that there is no evidence to suggest that Bosch was authorized to accept service. Therefore, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service and has ordered that the moving party give notice, unless waived.
