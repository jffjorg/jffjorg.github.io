And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case between Plaintiff Claudia Rodriguez and Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. The case involves a breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, fraudulent concealment, and violation of the CLRA. The parties had previously reached a settlement agreement, which included a payment of $58,330.40 and the surrender of the subject vehicle. However, the motion to enforce the settlement agreement is premature because the settlement pieces remain in progress. The judge has continued the motion to a date to be determined at the hearing, and if the settlement check is not received by Plaintiff as of the date of the rescheduled hearing, judgment will be entered in Plaintiff's favor.
