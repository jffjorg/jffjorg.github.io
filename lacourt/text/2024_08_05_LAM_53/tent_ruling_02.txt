MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Scale Talent
Management, LLC   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff U.S. Reif SIC 6300 Wilshire, LLC
Motion to Set Aside Default
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff U.S. Reif SIC 6300 Wilshire, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action on September 28, 2023, alleging one cause of action for breach of
contract against defendant Scale Talent Management, LLC (“Defendant”). 
On November 17, 2023, while unrepresented by an attorney, Defendant
filed an answer to the Complaint.  (Nov.
17, 2023 Answer, PLD-C-010.)  On January
29, 2024, the court issued a minute order setting an Order to Show Cause re:
why Defendant’s answer should not be stricken because Defendant is a limited
liability company and is not represented by an attorney in this action.  (Jan. 29, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  Plaintiff served Defendant with a copy of the
court’s minute order on February 5, 2024. 
(Pl. Notice of Entry of Order filed Feb. 5, 2024, p. 5.)  
On April 15, 2024, the court issued a minute order ordering that
Defendant’s answer was stricken because Defendant is a limited liability
company unrepresented by an attorney in this action.  (April 15, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  Defendant’s default was subsequently entered by
the clerk on June 5, 2024.  (June 5, 2024
CIV-100, p. 1.) 
Defendant filed the pending motion to set aside entry of default on
June 20, 2024.  The court notes several
defects with Defendant’s motion. 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that Defendant has improperly filed
this motion as a self-represented defendant. 
(Mot., p. 1:4-5 [“Scale Talent Management, IN PRO PER”].)  However, Defendant is a limited liability
company and is therefore required to be represented by an attorney in this
action.  (CLD Construction, Inc. v.
City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145 [“a corporation, unlike
a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria
persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director, or
other employee who is not an attorney. 
It must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before courts
of record”].)  
In addition, the court finds that Defendant has not shown that the
court should set aside its default. 
First, as noted by Plaintiff in its opposition, Defendant’s filing,
although captioned as a “Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default,” does not appear
to be a complete motion.  Specifically,
Defendant has stated that it was providing “notice of [its] intent to
file a motion to set aside the entry of Default . . . .”  (Def. Mot., pp. 1:26, 2:9-10 [emphasis added].)
 Moreover, Defendant did not file a
memorandum in support of the motion as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1112, subd.
(a)(3).) 
Second, even if the court were to construe Defendant’s filing to be a
motion, Defendant did not present adequate argument, authority, or evidence
establishing that the court should set aside its default. 
Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the court denies Defendant’s
motion.  
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Scale
Talent Management, LLC’s motion to set aside entry of default. 
            The court orders plaintiff US Reif
SIC 6300 Wilshire, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 5, 2024
