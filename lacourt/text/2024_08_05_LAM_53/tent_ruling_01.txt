  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion for protective order and
  to stay plaintiff’s second set of written discovery
 



Motion for Protective Order and to Stay
Plaintiff’s Second Set of Written Discovery
Defendants Amazon Studios,
Inc., Genre Arts, Inc., Carlton Cuse, Carlton Cuse Productions, Skydance Media,
LLC, Skydance Television, LLC, Platinum Dunes Productions, Viacom, Inc.,
Potomac River Productions, Inc., and Paramount Pictures Corporation
(“Defendants”) filed the pending motion for a protective order and to stay the
second set of discovery served on them by plaintiff Dan Sackheim (“Plaintiff”)
on October 27, 2023, requesting that the court issue a protective order
excusing Defendants from responding to Plaintiff’s second set of
interrogatories and second set of document demands.  (Notice of Mot., p. 2:2-12.) 
On February 13, 2024, the
parties filed with the court an “Amended Stipulation and [Proposed]
Order to Continue Trial and Related Dates; Summary Judgment Hearings; and
Appoint Discovery Referee,” in which the parties stipulated that, inter alia,
the Hon. Benny Osorio shall be appointed as a discovery referee in this
action.  (Feb. 13, 2024 Amended Stip., p.
4, ¶ 5.)  Thereafter, on February 20,
2024, the court issued its “Order Appointing Referee,” in which the court
appointed Hon. Benny Osorio as a discovery referee in this action pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 638 “to hear and determine any and all
discovery motions and disputes relevant to discovery in the action and to
report findings and make a recommendation.” 
(Feb. 20, 2024 Order, ADR-110, ¶¶ 1, subd. (a), 3, 4, subd. (a)(2).) 
Thus, Defendants’ motion to
request the issuance of a protective order regarding discovery propounded on
them by Plaintiff must be heard by the discovery referee.  (Feb. 20, 2024 Order, ADR-110, ¶ 4, subd.
(a)(2).)  The court therefore orders that
defendants Amazon Studios, Inc., Genre Arts, Inc., Carlton Cuse, Carlton Cuse
Productions, Skydance Media, LLC, Skydance Television, LLC, Platinum Dunes
Productions, Viacom, Inc., Potomac River Productions, Inc., and Paramount
Pictures Corporation’s motion for a protective order and to stay second set of
discovery is taken off calendar.
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 5, 2024
