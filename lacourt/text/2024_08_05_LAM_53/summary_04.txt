And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that Defendant did not take an adversarial posture or express disagreement with the Plaintiff's complaints of sexual harassment. The Plaintiff alleged that she complained to Defendant's manager, Amber Edward, who assured her that she would report the harasser to Human Resources and transferred the Plaintiff to a different location. The Judge notes that these actions suggest that Defendant did not dispute the harassing conduct or take an adversarial posture. The Judge also references a previous case, Kader, which held that a plaintiff's allegations of harassment implied that the defendant did not dispute the conduct. Therefore, the Judge concludes that Defendant did not meet the requirements to dispute the alleged sexual harassment.
