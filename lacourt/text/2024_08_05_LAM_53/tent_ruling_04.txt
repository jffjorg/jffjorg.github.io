[1] As
set forth above, Defendant did not point to any other allegations in the
Complaint or evidence establishing that a dispute over the alleged sexual
harassment arose before this date.  Further,
while the court notes that Plaintiff has alleged that she complained to
Defendant’s manager, Amber Edward, Defendant did not argue that such complaints
constitute an assertion of a right, claim, or demand.  (Compl., ¶ 12, subds. (u), (z), (ee).)  Moreover, even if the court were to construe
those complaints to be a right, claim, or demand, it does not appear that
Defendant “expresse[d] disagreement or t[ook] an adversarial posture” because
Plaintiff has alleged that the manager “seemed to understand Plaintiff’s
perspective,” assured Plaintiff that she would report the harasser to Human
Resources, and informed Plaintiff that she reported the conduct, suggesting
that Defendant did not dispute the harassing conduct or disagree that nonmoving
defendant Jimenez was harassing Plaintiff. 
(Compl., ¶ 13, subds. (v), (z), (cc); Kader, supra, 99
Cal.App.5th at pp. 222-223, 224 [the plaintiff alleged that one of his
harassers threatened to fire him if he told anyone, implying that the
harasser-defendant did not dispute the conduct].)  Similarly, Plaintiff alleged that, when she
lodged a formal complaint requesting to be transferred, Defendant transferred
her to a different location, again suggesting that Defendant did not take an
adversarial posture as it related to her complaint.  (Compl., ¶ 13, subds. (jj), (kk).)  Finally, while the Complaint alleges that
manager Amber Edward yelled at Plaintiff and micromanaged her in retaliation
for making complaints, that allegation does not suggest that Defendant, by
engaging in such acts, was expressing disagreement with her complaints or
taking an adversarial posture.  (Compl.,
¶ 13, subd. (dd).)
