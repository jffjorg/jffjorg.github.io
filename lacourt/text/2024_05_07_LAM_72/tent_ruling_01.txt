Petitioner Roshon Woods (“Petitioner”) seeks approval of the
compromises of Plaintiffs Debraha Williams (“Debraha”), Josiah Williams
(“Josiah”)(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) (the Court uses first names for clarity
only, and means no disrespect to the parties).
 
The Court GRANTS the motions..
 
Background
 
This is a landlord-tenant case. Plaintiffs, who are minors, were
tenants at a property allegedly owned by Defendants Eva E Moreno and the Eva E
Moreno Trust and alleged a number of habitability issues at that property.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on March 3, 2022 through Woods,
their guardian ad litem, who is also their mother. The operative complaint is
the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which alleges (1) breach of the covenant
of quiet enjoyment; (2) breach of implied warranty of habitability; (3)
collection of rent on substandard dwelling; (4) intentional infliction of
emotional distress (“IIED”); (5) negligence; and (6) nuisance.
 
On October 4, 2022, the Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
to the first, second, and third causes of action without leave to amend.
 
On November 15, 2023, the parties entered into a settlement
agreement.
 
On April 19, 2024, Petitioner filed petitions for approval
of the compromises of Debraha and Josiah’s claims. No party has filed an
opposition.
 
On May 2, 2024, Petitioner filed an expedited petition for
approval of the compromise of a third plaintiff, Jazaha Williams
(“Jazaha”).  Petitioner did not request a
hearing on that petition.  As the Court
understands, that petition is not before the Court today.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372,
any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a disability must be
approved by the court. If the court is satisfied that the settlement is in
the best interest of the claimant, then the court shall approve the
settlement. (See Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)   
 
A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant
not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with
California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be
verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information
that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the
covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.)  The person compromising
the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the
represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.952.)   
 
Discussion
 
            No
party objects to the settlement here.
 
The parties engaged discovery in this case, including form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production.
Plaintiffs’ counsel also engage in discovery motion practice. Defendants have
not conceded liability.
 
 
The gross settlement value is $22,500.00. Each of Debraha,
Josiah and Debraha will receive a gross value of $7,500.00. 
 
The retainer agreement that Woods signed on behalf of
Plaintiffs provides for a 25 percent contingent attorney fee. Plaintiffs’
counsel has not received any other compensation. The Court finds this fee to be
reasonable. Under the settlement, the fee is divided evenly among the
Plaintiffs.
 
Debraha incurred $1,933.42 in medical expenses. Josiah
incurred $2,757.50 in medical expenses. Jazahah incurred $2,757.50 in medical
expenses. These amounts were incurred in the form of MediCal reimbursements. These
amounts are to be reimbursed from the proceeds of each Plaintiff’s respective
settlement.
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel has advanced costs, which he requests be reimbursed from the settlement
amounts. It cost $55.00 to serve each defendant, for a total cost of $110.00.
Plaintiffs will also need to pay the filing fee, which is $455.25, prior to
dismissal because the Court previously granted a fee waiver. Debraha’s
settlement will be charged $189.25 for costs of litigation. Josiah’s settlement
will be charged $187.00 for costs. Jazaha’ s settlement will be charged $189.00
for costs.  The differences in the cost
charges are not explained.  However,
because they are de minimis, the Court does not believe that they prevent the
Court from granting the motions.
