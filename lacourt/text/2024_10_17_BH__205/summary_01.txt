And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling on Focus Financial Partners, LLC's motion to compel responses to its Second Set of Requests for Production (2nd RFPs). The case involves a dispute over a non-compete provision between KSFB Management, LLC and Focus Financial Partners, LLC. Focus seeks to compel responses to its 2nd RFPs, which include requests for documents related to the negotiation of the non-compete provision, the negotiation of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement (ARMA), and the purchase of Ross Bennett Smith.

The Judge grants in part and denies in part Focus' motion. The Judge concludes that Focus has shown good cause for compelling production of certain documents, including documents related to the negotiation of the non-compete provision in the original management agreement, the negotiation of the ARMA, and the purchase of Ross Bennett Smith. The Judge also orders the production of documents showing where each KSFB Principal resides and works, as well as documents sufficient to show KSFB's document retention policies.

The Judge denies Focus' motion as to certain requests, including Request No. 6, which seeks all documents and communications relating to the negotiation and execution of the purchase of Ross Bennett Smith, and Request No. 9, which seeks all documents and communications between KSFB or any of its principals and any other person relating to the ARMA's non-compete, terminating any relationship with Focus or leaving Focus to start a new firm. The Judge notes that these requests are overbroad and will be limited to documents and communications that are relevant to the subject matter of the action.
