As for the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling:**

The court has reviewed the petition for expedited approval of minor's compromise filed by Mehrad Farkhan, the guardian of Alia Farkhan, a minor who was injured in a car accident. The accident occurred when Felix Sanchez's motorcycle rear-ended Mehrad Farkhan's car. Alia Farkhan suffered severe emotional distress and ongoing treatment as a result of the accident. The settlement represents the payment of the single-person policy limits of all liability insurance policies covering Sanchez.

The court finds that the petition meets all the requirements for an expedited petition for approval of a minor's compromise. The court also approves the payment of attorneys' fees of $3,750, representing 25% of the settlement proceeds. The court concludes that the requested attorneys' fees are entirely reasonable, considering the counsel's experience, time spent on the case, and the risk of loss borne by the attorney.

Based on the foregoing, the court grants the petition for expedited approval of minor's compromise.
