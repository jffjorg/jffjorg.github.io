Daily, Aljian, and Firm hereafter collectively referred to as “Attorney
Defendants.”
 


[2] In the
string of emails submitted, Defense counsel memorializes a tolling agreement
that he claims was reached in a verbal conversation. Plaintiff’s counsel first provides
a brief acknowledgement of receipt of the email and reserves his right to
review and respond later. In the next (and first substantive) response,
Plaintiff’s counsel disputes the existence of the tolling agreement. Plaintiff’s
counsel never agreed, either explicitly in writing or implicitly by silence, to
toll the deadline. Obviously the court makes no finding on what happened during
counsel’s verbal conversation, and no such finding would be relevant.
