And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the Plaintiffs' motion to compel Defendants Rokit, Lewis, and Becker to post an appellate bond of $675,881.24. The Judge states that the court cannot impose an appellate bond unless a stay is requested, and since no stay has been requested, the court cannot require the posting of a bond. The Judge also notes that the court does not go looking for disputes to resolve and that the court's role is to not interfere with the proceedings on appeal. The Judge references Code of Civil Procedure § 916, which provides that the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court, and Code of Civil Procedure § 917.1, which excepts money judgments unless an undertaking is given.
