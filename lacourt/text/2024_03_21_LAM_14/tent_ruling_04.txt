 Case Number:  23STCV24218    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  14 Ferro v CordobaCase Background
 
Residential Unlawful Detainer.
 
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed
her form Complaint in Unlawful Detainer against Defendants Matthew Isaac Calhoun
(“Calhoun”), Wolf Adler (“Adler”), and DOES 1-10. 
 
On November 21, 2023, this court
granted permission for Plaintiff to serve Defendants Calhoun and Adler by
posting at the residence in question. 
 
On January 10, 2024, the defaults
of Defendants Calhoun and Adler were entered. On that same day, Plaintiff
voluntarily dismissed Defendant DOES 1-10, without prejudice.
 
On January 12, 2024, the court
clerk entered a judgment for possession only against Defendants Calhoun and
Adler.
 
On February 7, 2024, Defendant
Calhoun appeared before this court on an ex parte application for stay of
enforcement. Plaintiff’s counsel was present. The court granted the application
and set this hearing date.
 
Instant Motion
 
            Defendant Calhoun now moves
this court, per Code of Civil Procedure §§ 473(d) and 473.5, for an order vacating
the default judgment and setting aside the default, on the grounds that he was
not properly served with process and had no knowledge of the lawsuit.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED. It is unopposed. This amounts to a concession by Plaintiff that the
motion has merit. See California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule
3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th
