The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ferro v. Cordoba, a residential unlawful detainer case. The case involves a dispute over whether the default judgment entered against Defendant Calhoun should be vacated. Defendant Calhoun moved to vacate the default judgment and set aside the default, alleging that he was not properly served with process and had no knowledge of the lawsuit. The judge granted the motion, finding that the default judgment should be vacated and set aside. The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(d) and 473.5, which provide for the vacation of default judgments and the setting aside of defaults under certain circumstances. The judge also cited California Rules of Court Rules 3.1113(a) and 3.1320(f), as well as a 2005 California Court of Appeal decision, Herzberg v. County of Plumas, in making its decision.
