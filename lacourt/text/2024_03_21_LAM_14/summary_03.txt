And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reviewing the email exchanges between the parties regarding a verbal conversation about a tolling agreement. The defense claims that a tolling agreement was reached, but the plaintiff disputes its existence. The plaintiff's counsel never agreed to toll the deadline, either explicitly in writing or implicitly by silence. The court will not make a finding on what happened during the verbal conversation, as it is not relevant to the dispute. The judge will consider the emails and the parties' arguments at the upcoming court hearing.
