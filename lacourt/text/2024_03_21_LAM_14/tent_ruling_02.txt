Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED as MOOT. No sanctions are awarded.
 
Governing Statute
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 2031.310 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response
is without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the following:
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
(2) The motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
…
(h) …the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Discussion
 
            On April 6,
2023, Plaintiff served Defendant Cordoba with Requests for Production (“RFP”).
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.260, Defendant Cordoba had 30 days
to respond. Since the RFP were served electronically, Defendant Cordoba had an
extra two court days to respond. Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1010.6(a)(3)(B). 30 days after April 6, 2023, was May 6, 2023, which was
a Sunday. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 12a-12b, the deadline was
automatically extended to May 7, 2023. The additional two court days made
responses due May 9, 2023 (a Wednesday).
 
            Defendant
Cordoba served responses on May 11, 2023 (a Friday). Plaintiff takes the
position in the moving papers that this late response amounts to a waiver of
all objections pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300(a). Defendant
Cordoba responds that the parties had stipulated, in writing as required by
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.270, to a response deadline of May 12,
2023. (Declaration of Shelly D. Song Exhibit 3). In the Reply, Plaintiff withdraws
his argument that objections were waived.
 
            This
exchange illustrates a point which would be fatal to any motion of this type:
the lack of a reasonable effort to meet and confer as required by Code of Civil
Procedure § 2016.040. The Declaration of Michael Killingsworth, submitted
with the motion, states that counsel “offer[ed]” to meet and confer by
telephone, and sent an email to Defense counsel. That is all the detail
provided. No exhibits are attached showing the nature of the email, or when it
was sent. Plaintiff’s counsel should have at least picked up the phone to talk
to Defense counsel prior to filing this motion. Had they done so, the issue
about the response deadline, at the very least, could have been cleared up
immediately.
 
            After the
motion was filed, this court brought counsel in for an Informal Discovery
Conference on January 5, 2024. In the joint IDC statement, filed December 26,
2023, Defense counsel objected to the lack of meet and confer about this
discovery. The court ordered the parties to meet and confer that day and file a
stipulation reflecting any agreements. (Minute Order of January 5, 2024). 
 
            The
stipulation, filed by counsel on January 12, 2024, lists this motion as “no
resolution reached.” No further details are provided. 
 
            On March 5,
2024, Defendant Cordoba served supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s RFP. (Declaration
of Shelly D. Song Exhibit 9). The service of these responses renders the motion
MOOT.
 
            Two other
issues require discussion. First, the Separate Statement provided by Plaintiff as
required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a) is not properly formatted.
Rule 3.1345(c) requires that counsel separately identify at least (1) each
question, (2) the response, and (3) a statement of the reason a further
response is needed. It is insufficient to quote several questions in sequence,
then give a block reason why they should all receive further answers. The
separate statement must proceed with question, answer, and reason, in that
order, one question at a time.
 
            Second,
Defense has requested sanctions. However, under the circumstances, the
imposition of sanctions would be unjust. It would be odd for Plaintiff to file
a motion, get supplemental responses in response to the motion, and then get sanctioned
for bringing the motion. Usually, under those circumstances, there is a strong
argument for awarding sanctions to the moving party. For the reasons given
above, that argument would not have been so strong here. Nevertheless, the
court appreciates Plaintiff’s courteous decision not to ask for sanctions in the
moving papers.
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff failed
to properly meet and confer before filing this motion, and filed a deficient
separate statement. Defense served supplemental responses to the RFP after the
motion was filed. Therefore, the motion is DENIED as MOOT. However, because the
motion resulted in the service of supplemental responses, it would be unjust to
sanction Plaintiff for bringing it. Therefore, no sanctions are awarded.
 
(2)       Defense
Form Rogs
 
            Defendant
Cordoba now moves this court for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve further
responses to Defendant Cordoba’s Form Interrogatories, Set No. One (“Form Rogs”).
Defendant Cordoba also seeks sanctions of $5,000. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED as MOOT. No sanctions are awarded.
 
Governing Statute
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 2030.300 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate.
(3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A motion under subdivision
(a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.
…
(c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.
(d) The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Discussion
 
            On November
23, 2022, Defendant Cordoba served the Form Rogs on Plaintiff. On May 24, 2023,
Plaintiff served verified responses. Counsel did not reach an agreement to toll
the 45-day deadline contained in Section 2030.300(c). (Declaration of Reed Aljian
Exhibit F).[2] 45 days
after May 24, 2023, is July 8, 2023. Since that day was a Saturday, pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 12a-12b, the deadline was automatically extended
to July 10, 2023, which is when this motion was filed.
 
            Prior to
the filing of this motion, counsel spoke over the telephone. (Declaration of
Reed Aljian ¶ 8). Defense counsel also sent Plaintiff’s counsel a letter.
(Id Exhibit G).
 
            After the
motion was filed, this court brought counsel in for an Informal Discovery
Conference on January 5, 2024. The court ordered the parties to meet and confer
that day and file a stipulation reflecting any agreements. (Minute Order of
January 5, 2024).
 
The stipulation, filed by counsel
on January 12, 2024, lists this motion as “Potentially Resolved.” It says that
Plaintiff will provide further responses within 21 days.
 
Plaintiff served amended responses on
February 2, 2024. (Declaration of Michael Killingsworth Exhibit H). The service
of these responses renders the motion MOOT.
 
            Under the
circumstances, the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. Prior to the motion,
there was only one attempt to meet and confer in real time. After the motion,
when brought in again via the IDC, counsel were able to reach an agreement for
supplemental responses, which were provided on the timeline given in the
agreement. It would be improper for this court to reward this cooperation with
sanctions.
 
Conclusion
 
            Defense
served supplemental responses to the Form Rogs after the motion was filed. Therefore,
the motion is DENIED as MOOT. However, the supplemental responses were timely
given pursuant to an agreement worked out by counsel, and it would be unjust to
sanction Plaintiff for his cooperation. Therefore, no sanctions are awarded.
 
(3)       Defense
Special Rogs
 
Defendant Cordoba now moves this
court for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve further responses to Defendant
Cordoba’s Special Interrogatories, Set No. One (“Special Rogs”). Defendant
Cordoba also seeks sanctions of $5,000. Plaintiff in turn seeks $1,000 in sanctions.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED as MOOT. No sanctions are awarded.
 
Discussion
 
            On November
23, 2022, Defendant Cordoba served the Special Rogs on Plaintiff. On May 1,
2023, Plaintiff served responses. On May 29, 2023, Plaintiff served
supplemental responses. (Declaration of Reed Aljian, Exhibit E). 
 
            Counsel did
not reach an agreement to toll the 45-day deadline contained in Section
2030.300(c). (Declaration of Reed Aljian Exhibit G).[3] 45
days after May 29, 2023, is July 13, 2023, a Thursday. Since the responses were
served electronically, Plaintiff had an extra two court days to respond. Code
of Civil Procedure § 1010.6(a)(3)(B). That makes the deadline July 17,
2023, which is when this motion was filed.
 
            Prior to
the filing of this motion, counsel spoke over the telephone. (Declaration of
Reed Aljian ¶ 9). Defense counsel also sent Plaintiff’s counsel a letter.
(Id. Exhibit F). Finally, counsel exchanged several emails. (Id. Exhibit G).
 
            After the
motion was filed, this court brought counsel in for an Informal Discovery
Conference on January 5, 2024. The court ordered the parties to meet and confer
that day and file a stipulation reflecting any agreements. (Minute Order of
January 5, 2024).
 
The stipulation, filed by counsel
on January 12, 2024, lists this motion as “Potentially Resolved.” It says that
Plaintiff will provide further responses within 21 days.
 
Plaintiff served amended responses on
February 2, 2024. (Reply p. 4:8). The service of these responses renders the
motion MOOT.
 
            Under the
circumstances, the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. Prior to the motion,
there was only one attempt to meet and confer in real time. After the motion,
when brought in again via the IDC, counsel were able to reach an agreement for
supplemental responses, which were provided on the timeline given in the
agreement. It would be improper for this court to reward this cooperation with
sanctions.
 
Conclusion
 
            Defense
served supplemental responses to the Special Rogs after the motion was filed. Therefore,
the motion is DENIED as MOOT. However, the supplemental responses were timely
given pursuant to an agreement worked out by counsel, and it would be unjust to
sanction either counsel for their cooperation. Therefore, no sanctions are
awarded.
 
(4)       Defense
RFP
 
Defendant Cordoba now moves this
court for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve further responses to Defendant
Cordoba’s Requests for Production, Set No. One (“RFP”). Defendant Cordoba also
seeks sanctions of $5,000. Plaintiff in turn seeks $1,000 in sanctions.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED as MOOT. No sanctions are awarded.

23, 2022, Defendant Cordoba served the RFP on Plaintiff. On May 1, 2023,
Plaintiff served responses. On May 29, 2023, Plaintiff served supplemental
