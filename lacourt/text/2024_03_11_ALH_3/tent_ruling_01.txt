[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.

8:30
  a.m.
March

Ira M.
 Steinberg seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant
 Pei Wei Asian Diner, LLC (“Defendant”) on grounds that withdrawal
 has been requested. This motion is brought because Defendant has not retained
 successor counsel yet, therefore a substitution of attorney cannot be
 submitted. Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this
matter is set for September 16, 2024, and no prejudice will result from
granting this motion. Accordingly, this unopposed motion to be relieved is
GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of this
Order on Defendant and all parties who have appeared.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 11th
day of March 2024
