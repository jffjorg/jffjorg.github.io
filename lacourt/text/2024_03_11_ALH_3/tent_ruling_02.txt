II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face.  (City of Atascadero v.
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445,
459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the
factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which
may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell v. California Department
of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations
are to be liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) A demurrer may be
brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action
asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).) The court may,
upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a); Stafford v. Shultz (1954)
42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim
is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with California law, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) An immaterial or irrelevant
allegation is one that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense;
is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or
defense; or a demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations
of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subd. (b).) The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
III.    DISCUSSION
A.  
Allegations
of the Complaint
Plaintiff alleges a fraudulent scheme
perpetuated chiefly by Chen, in concert with Chen’s distant relative, Defendant,
among others. (Compl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff alleges that in or around June 2017,
Defendant told Plaintiff’s daughter, Elaine, that Chen wished to exchange
American dollars with Chinese yuan (Chen needed yuan) and asked Elaine if Plaintiff
would be able to assist. (Compl., ¶ 3.) At the time, Elaine was in a serious
relationship with Defendant, and Plaintiff intended to buy a property for
Elaine in Los Angeles. (Compl,, ¶¶ 3, 37, 39.) Therefore, Plaintiff agreed to
help Defendant exchange the money in order to help Defendant and build a good
relationship with the family of her future son-in-law. Plaintiff would provide
¥6,880,000 in exchange for USD$1,000,000. (Ibid.) Plaintiff having
remitted ¥3.5 million, roughly half the agreed sum, to Chen’s relative in
China, co-defendant Jian, Chen asked Plaintiff if she needed to use the sum of
$1 million USD urgently and, if not, whether Plaintiff would be willing to lend
the amount at an interest rate of 7.5%. (Compl., ¶¶ 4, 41.) Plaintiff agreed to
lend the $1 million and the remittance of the entire amount of yuan was complete
by July 17, 2017. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.) The period of this initial loan was one
year, from July 5, 2017, to July 5, 2018. (Id., ¶ 44.) Plaintiff alleges
that this transaction “spiraled into a web of false representations and
fraudulent statements where Defendants repeatedly assured Plaintiff that [Chen]
and [Harris] were both members of a high social class and were able to pay back
the loan sum at any time.” (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff alleges these
representations caused her to enter into consecutive agreement extensions with
Chen from 2018 to 2021. (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
Plaintiff made efforts to seek
repayment of the loan during these years, but was induced to “fork out more
money purportedly for various scheme and ventures which Defendants were
involved in.” (Comp., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff alleges that she sustained damages in
excess of $1,493,049.24, consisting of the loan of $1,075,000, a penalty of
$107,500 and interest of $310,549.24, plus additional interest. Plaintiff also
requests attorney fees, litigation fees, and travel expenses paid to realize
her creditor rights. (Compl., ¶ 10.) 
B.  
Demurrer
1.  
First
and Thirteenth Causes of Action for Breach of Contract, Fifth Cause of Action
for Account Stated, Sixth Cause of Action for Promissory Estoppel, and Seventh
Cause of Action for Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
“The elements of a cause of action for
breach of contract are: (I) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse
for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.” (Coles v. Closer (2016) 2 Cal.App 5th 384, 391 ) “Facts
alleging a breach, like all essential elements of a breach of contract cause of
action, must be pleaded with specificity.” (Levy v. State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 CaL App. 4th 1, 5.) Implied in every contract is the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which acts “as a supplement to the
express contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in
conduct which (while not technically transgressing the express covenants)
frustrates the other party’s rights to the benefits of the contract.” (Racine
& Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1026, 1031-1032.) 
In the alternative to a breach of
contract claim, a plaintiff may assert a cause of action for promissory
estoppel or a common count for an account stated. (See Fleet v. Bank of
America N.A. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1413.) “The elements of
promissory estoppel are (1) a promise, (2) the promisor should reasonably
expect the promise to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee
or a third person, (3) the promise induces action or forbearance by the
promisee or a third person (which we refer to as detrimental reliance), and (4)
injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 803, reh’g denied
(Apr. 11, 2013), review denied (July 10, 2013).) 
As for an account stated, it is “based
on prior transactions between the parties” and a plaintiff must allege that “the
items of an account are true and that the balance struck is due and owing.” (Professional
Collection Consultants v. Lauron (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 958, 968 [quoting Maggio,
Inc. v. Neal (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 745, 752].)  “‘[A]n element essential to render the
account stated is that it receive the assent of both parties, but the assent of
the party sought to be charged may be implied from his conduct.’” (Id. [quoting
Hansen v. Fresno Jersey Farm Dairy Co. (1934) 220 Cal. 402, 408].) “When
a common count is used as an alternative way of seeking the same recovery
demanded in a specific cause of action, and is based on the same facts, the
common count is demurrable if the cause of action is demurrable.” (McBride
v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394.)
“Under California law, only a signatory
to a contract may be liable for any breach.” (Clemens v. Am. Warranty Corp.
(1987) 193 Cal. App. 3d 444, 452.) Here, Plaintiff does not allege that
Defendant was a party to the alleged loan agreement or the subsequent
extensions.  Instead, Plaintiff attaches
copies of WeChat messages and loan agreement extensions showing that the
agreement and subsequent extensions were between Plaintiff and Chen. (Compl.,
¶¶ 45, 63, 68, 74, 83, 102; Exs. E, K, N, R). Furthermore, without a contract,
Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of the implied covenant and fair dealing
necessarily fails. Accordingly, the demurrer to the First, Seventh, and
Thirteenth Causes of Action is SUSTAINED. 
Similarly, Plaintiff’s claims for promissory
estoppel and account stated fail because she does not allege that any
transaction took place between her and Defendant or that Defendant made any
promise. Although Plaintiff alleges in passing that Defendant “promised” to
“recover[] the loan from [Chen], there are no facts identifying when this
promise was made.” (Compl., ¶ 60.) Therefore, the demurrer to the Fifth and Sixth
Causes of Action is SUSTAINED. 
2.  
Second
Cause of Action for Conversion
“"Conversion is the wrongful
exercise of dominion over the property of another. The elements of a conversion
are the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property at the
time of the conversion; the defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or
disposition of property rights; and damages.” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v.
Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 15 451-452.) 
Plaintiff argues that paragraphs 118
through 124 outlines the facts and allegations of conversion. (Opp., p. 6.)
However, none of the allegations address Defendant in particular, or that
Defendant stole or otherwise received Plaintiff’s property. Accordingly, the
demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is SUSTAINED. 
3.  
Third
and Fourth Causes of Action for Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation
The elements of fraud are: (1) misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity
(scienter); (3) intent to defraud or induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance;
and (5) damages. (See Civil Code §1709.) Fraud actions are subject to strict
requirements of particularity in pleading. (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.) Negligent
misrepresentation requires assertion of an untrue fact that is believed by the
defendant to be true, lack of reasonable ground for the belief, defendant’s
intent to induce plaintiff’s reliance upon the representation, plaintiff’s
justifiable reliance upon the representation, and resulting damage. (Moncada
v. West Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 781; Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) A claim for fraud or negligent
misrepresentation must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies,
Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands that a
plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails
to allege any specific representations that he made regarding Chen’s ability to
repay the alleged loan. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff fails to allege
that he knew that the assurances were false at the time that he made them.
Last, Defendant argues that any assurances were made after Plaintiff already
loaned the money to Chen, therefore Plaintiff does not adequately allege the
element of reliance. 
In opposition, Plaintiff broadly argues
that she adequately alleges Defendant’s false assurances and her reliance on
them. Plaintiff generally alleges that Defendant “had always painted a picture
of [Chen] as being a trustworthy person” by describing her as a “role model for
the Chinese community.” (Compl., ¶ 61.) But Plaintiff only alleges a specific
misrepresentation by Defendant when he spoke with Elaine in October 2017, and “dismissed
any such notion of non-payment and assured Elaine that as a respectful role
model in the community, [Chen] would not default on the loan.” (Compl., ¶ 48.) At
this time, Defendant also told Elaine that he had “no single shred of doubt
that [Chen] would pay back the loan.” (Compl., ¶ 52.) As Defendant points out,
this alleged statement was made months after the initial loan was already
agreed to. 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the Third
and Fourth Causes of Action is SUSTAINED. 
4.  
Eighth
and Ninth Causes of Action for Conspiracy and Aiding and Abetting
A civil conspiracy requires an express
or tacit agreement only to commit a civil wrong or tort, which then renders all
participants 'responsible ... for all damages ensuing from the wrong. (Navarrete
v. Meyer (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1293.) Similarly, “ ‘[l]iability may
. . . be imposed on one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional
tort if the person (a) knows the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty
and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b)
gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result
and the person’s own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of
duty to the third person.’” (Fiol v. Doellstedt (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
1318, 1325-26 [quoting Saunders v. Superior Court (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th
832, 846]; see also Schulz v. Neovi Data Corp. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th
86, 93.) “Mere knowledge that a tort is being committed and the failure to
prevent it does not constitute aiding and abetting.” (Fiol, supra,
50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1326.) 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant:
(1) referred Plaintiff to Chen for the purpose of the initial currency
exchange, (2) knew that Chen would not be paying back the loan “from the very
beginning”, (3) maintained a relationship with Elaine for purposes of
defrauding her. (Compl., ¶ 39-40, 53.) However, Plaintiff does not state facts showing
an agreement between Defendant and any other co-defendant to commit a wrong or
tort. She also does not state any facts supporting Defendant’s alleged
knowledge of Chen’s intention to defraud Plaintiff, nor does she allege any
conduct by Defendant which would constitute a breach of duty owed to her by
Defendant. Instead, the only allegations of a conspiracy pertain to an alleged
scheme involving loans backed by the Small Business Administration from the Paycheck
Protection Program (“PPP”). (Compl., ¶ 28.) 
Therefore, the demurrer to the Eighth
and Ninth Causes of Action is SUSTAINED. 
5.  
Tenth
Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment
California does not recognize unjust
enrichment as an independent cause of action. (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1370.) There are also no allegations to support a
theory of restitution because Plaintiff does not allege that Defendant received
a benefit and retained it at her expense. (Lectrodryer v. SeouIBank (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726.)
Accordingly, the demurrer to the Tenth
Cause of Action is SUSTAINED. 
6.  
Eleventh
and Twelfth Causes of Action for IIED and NIED
The elements of intentional infliction
of emotional distress are (1) extreme and outrageous conduct (2) directed to
the plaintiff by defendant, (3) with the intention of (4) causing, or reckless
disregard of the probability of causing, (5) severe or extreme emotional
distress. (Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903.)
Negligent infliction of emotional distress is not an independent tort; it is
merely convenient terminology descriptive of the context in which the
negligence occurred. (Long v. PKS, Inc. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1293,
1297.) Damages for severe emotional distress are recoverable in a negligence
action when they result from the breach of a duty owed to the plaintiff that is
assumed by the defendant or imposed on the defendant as a matter of law, or
that arises out of a relationship between the two. (Id.) Under either
theory, for conduct to be outrageous it must be so extreme as to exceed all
bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community. (See Ess v.
Eskaton Properties, Inc. (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 120, 130.) Generally,
conduct will be found to be actionable where the recitation of the facts to an
average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor,
and lead him to exclaim, “Outrageous!” (Id.)
Here, Plaintiff only alleges that Chen
and Harris inflicted outrageous conduct (whether intentionally or negligently)
and caused her emotional distress. Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to the
Eleventh and Twelfth Causes of Action is SUSTAINED. 
B.  
Motion
to Strike 
Because the Court sustains Defendant’s
demurrer in its entirety, the motion to strike is moot and taken off calendar. 
Defendant’s demurrer to 
IV.    CONCLUSION
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED in
its entirety to each cause of action in the Complaint. 
Defendant’s motion to strike is moot
and taken off calendar.
