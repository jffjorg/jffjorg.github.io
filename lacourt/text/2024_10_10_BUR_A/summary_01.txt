Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Ford Motor Company's motion to compel Dionisio Alcala's attendance at deposition. The plaintiff has failed to appear for deposition on multiple occasions, and Ford Motor Company has attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff to schedule alternative dates. The judge finds that the plaintiff's objections to the deposition notice are invalid and that Ford Motor Company has demonstrated its attempts to schedule the deposition. The judge orders the plaintiff's deposition to occur no later than October 31, 2024, and awards $560 in sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel for the plaintiff's continuous refusal to appear for deposition.
