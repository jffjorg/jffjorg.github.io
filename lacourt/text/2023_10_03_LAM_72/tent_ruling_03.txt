TENTATIVE RULING
 



ALICE CASTOR,
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
FLAME PIZZERIA, LLC, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No:  22STCV08380
 
 
RULING ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 3, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  3



 
 
          Plaintiff
ALICE CASTOR moves for leave to file a first amended complaint.
 
          The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.
 
          Background
 
          Plaintiff
Castor filed this employment suit against defendants Flame Pizzeria, LLC and
Enoc Guardado on March 8, 2022. (Guardado has since been dismissed, and his
name has been omitted from the body of the proposed amended complaint.)
 
          The attorney
for Flame Pizzeria withdrew with leave of court on March 14, 2023. Flame
Pizzeria, a corporate entity, failed to obtain counsel as required. The Court
struck Flame Pizzeria’s answer on April 19, 2023.
 
          Plaintiff now
moves to amend her complaint. Her motion asserts the amendment is necessary
because her initial complaint contains no prayer for a specific amount of
damages, meaning she cannot obtain default judgment. (Mot., 2:3-5; see Cal.
Code Civ. Proc., § 580.)
 
          Plaintiff’s
motion is granted. Plaintiff may file Exhibit A to the declaration of
Plaintiff’s counsel as the operative first amended complaint in this action. Defendant
is given thirty (30) days from service of the amended complaint or object to
the amended complaint.
 
          Plaintiff to
give notice of this order with a copy of the operative first amended complaint and
file proof of such with the Court.
