And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has vacated the default entered by the clerk on June 7, 2023. The plaintiff had sued the defendant for breach of lease and had filed a proof of substituted service on April 26, 2023. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's proof of service is invalid because it did not specify which unit of the residential building the process server left the summons and complaint at, and the copies of the summons and complaint were not mailed to the precise address where they were left. The judge has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re service for December 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. to give the parties an opportunity to resolve the issue of service.
