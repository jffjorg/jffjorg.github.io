## English Summary

This Tentative Ruling concerns a lawsuit filed by Towne Center, L.P. against Jay Yoon for breach of lease.  

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's attempt to serve the Defendant through "substituted service" was invalid. While the process server correctly served Mr. Yoon at his residence, the mailing address used in the proof of service did not specify a unit number. 

Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment and vacates the default previously entered against Mr. Yoon. 

The Court sets a new hearing date for December 12, 2024, to address proper service of process.

Summary:
The Judge, through this tentative ruling, denies Plaintiff Towne Center, L.P.'s request for default judgment against Defendant Jay Yoon in Case No. 23STCV07979. The Judge vacates the default entered by the clerk on June 7, 2023, due to Plaintiff's invalid proof of substituted service. The Judge sets an OSC re service for December 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The proof of service indicates that an occupant of the listed address informed Plaintiff's process server that there are other units with the same address. The process server determined that the Plaintiff lives in Unit C, and that is where the process server left the summons and complaint. However, Plaintiff's declaration of mailing indicates the summons and complaint were mailed to 20438 Osage Ave., without specifying any individual unit. Copies of the summons and complaint were not mailed to the precise address where they were left.
