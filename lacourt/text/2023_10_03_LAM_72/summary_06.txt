Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, David Truong, and granted his motion to compel further discovery responses from the defendant, Minh Hang Thi Nguyen. The defendant had failed to provide Code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite the parties' agreement to extend the deadline for the plaintiff's motion. The judge found that the defendant's responses did not comply with the Civil Discovery Act and that the plaintiff had good cause to seek the compliant responses to which he is entitled. As a result, the judge ordered the defendant to provide the plaintiff with Code-compliant responses to all of the plaintiff's Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) within 20 days of the order. The judge also imposed sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $2,497.50, which includes $375 in attorney's fees and $60 in costs, to be paid to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of the order.
