And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion to compel further responses as moot. The motion was filed by Defendant in response to Plaintiff's deposition notice, but the parties have since agreed to a deposition date of October 13, 2023, making the motion unnecessary. The judge has also continued the trial date and discovery cut-offs to permit the current motion to be heard and any subsequent deposition taken.
