Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of WEST CASITAS, LLC vs. SWING HOUSE STAGES, INC, et al. The court has denied the motion for attorney's fees filed by Kanon Ventures, LLC, Mark Beskind, Jeff Stauffer, Ara Tavitian, and Avedis Tavitian (the "Kanon Parties") as to Genoveva Winsen, one of the cross-complainants. The court has granted the motion as to Swing House Stages, Inc., but has deferred the amount of the attorney's fees to be awarded.

The court has ruled that the Kanon Parties are not entitled to attorney's fees from Genoveva Winsen because she would not have been personally entitled to fees from them if she had prevailed. The court has also ruled that the Kanon Parties' motion for attorney's fees is not supported by the facts and that the amount of fees requested is unreasonably high.

The court has set a hearing for November 21, 2023, at 8:30 am to hear argument on a reasonable amount of fees to be awarded against Swing House Stages, Inc. in favor of the Kanon Parties. The court has also ordered the parties to submit briefing on the matter of reasonability.
