 Hearing Date:  October 3, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  4



 
 
          Defendant’s
motion is denied as moot.  
 
          Plaintiff
sued Defendant on April 7, 2022 for various violations of the Song Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act, California’s “lemon law.”
 
          Defendant
noticed Plaintiff’s deposition on May 8, 2023, for May 26, 2023. (Declaration
of Arash Yaraghchian (Yar. Decl.), ¶ 3.) Plaintiff objected to the deposition
notice on May 23. (Id., ¶ 3 and Ex. C.) Defendant repeatedly attempted
to reschedule the deposition but received no response from Plaintiff’s counsel.
(Id., ¶ 4.) Defendant filed the instant motion on August 24, 2023.
 
          On
September 7, 2023, upon Defendant’s ex parte application, the Court continued
the trial date and discovery cut-offs to permit the current motion to be heard
and any subsequent deposition taken. On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed
opposing papers indicating the motion is moot, the parties having agreed to a
deposition date of October 13, 2023. Defendant filed no reply indicating
otherwise.
 
          Neither
party having sought sanctions, no further court order is required.
