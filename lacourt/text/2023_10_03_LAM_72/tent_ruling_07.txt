         v.
 
 
JAY YOON,
 
                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No:  23STCV07979
 
 
RULING ON REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 3, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  7



 
 
          Plaintiff
Towne Center, L.P. sued defendant Jay Yoon on April 11, 2023, alleging a single
cause of action for “Breach of Lease.”
 
          Plaintiff
filed a proof of substituted service on April 26, 2023, and the clerk entered
defendant’s default on June 7, 2023. Plaintiff now seeks default judgment.
 
          The court
DENIES Plaintiff’s request for default judgment and VACATES the default entered
by the clerk on June 7, 2023.  The Court
sets an OSC re service for December 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
 
          Plaintiff’s
proof of substituted service is invalid.
 
          A party
effects “substituted service” of process on an individual when it “leav[es] a
copy of the summons and complaint ... at his or her usual mailing address, ...
with the person who is apparently in charge thereof, and by thereafter mailing
a copy of the summons and complaint ... to the person to be served at the place
where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
415.20, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff’s proof of service indicates that an occupant of the
listed address, 20438 Osage Ave., Torrance, CA 90503, “inform[ed plaintiff’s
process server] that there are other units with the same address.” (The court
takes judicial notice of Los Angeles County Assessor records reflecting that
the property located at the address in question is a residential building with
four separate units.)
 
The process server determined that the plaintiff lives in
Unit C. The occupant of Unit C confirmed the plaintiff lives there. That is
where the process server (properly) left the summons and complaint.
 
          However,
plaintiff’s declaration of mailing indicates the summons and complaint was mailed
to 20438 Osage Ave., without specifying any individual unit.
 
          Copies of the
summons and complaint were not mailed to the precise address where they were
left.
 
          Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is denied. The court will direct the clerk to
vacate entry of Defendant’s default.
