Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf Treu in the case of Dejur McDaughtery v. Serenity Recuperative Care, Inc. (Case No. 23STCV21839). The case involves allegations of gender-based harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination against the Defendant. The Plaintiff, Dejur McDaughtery, a transgender male, filed a Request for Default Judgment on June 6, 2024, seeking judgment against the Defendant in the total amount of $1,251,277.74.

The Judge denied the Plaintiff's request without prejudice, citing the lack of evidence supporting the claimed damages. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff must provide additional evidence to support his claimed damages, and that the Court cannot grant any emotional distress damages based on the evidence provided.

The case has a complex history, with the Plaintiff filing a First Amended Complaint on February 26, 2024, alleging multiple causes of action, including gender-based harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination. The Plaintiff also alleged that he was subjected to severe emotional distress as a result of the Defendant's actions.

The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 585, which permits entry of a judgment after a defendant has failed to timely answer after being properly served. The Judge also cited Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, which holds that a plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.
