And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by Thomas Wesley Pentz, the plaintiff, to allow alternative service of the application and order for appearance and examination, and the civil subpoena (duces tecum) to Marchel Gabrielle Auguste, the defendant. The judge finds that Auguste has consented to electronic mail service and that electronic service is deemed complete at the time of transmission or notification of service. The judge also notes that Auguste did not file an opposition to the motion, which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. The judge concludes that granting the motion is warranted and orders that the documents be served on Auguste electronically.
