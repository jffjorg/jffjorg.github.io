The Court grants Pentz’s request to electronically serve the (1) Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, and (2) Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) on Respondent Auguste.BACKGROUND On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff Thomas Wesley Pentz (“Pentz”) filed a Complaint (the “Pentz Lawsuit”) against Defendant Marchel Gabrielle Auguste, aka Shelly Auguste (“Auguste”). On September 16, 2021, Pentz filed a First Amended Complaint for (1) Stalking; (2) Trespass; and (3) Distribution of Private Materials (Revenge Pornography) Civ. Code section 1708.85. Pentz alleges, among other things, in his Complaint that Auguste stalked Pentz online, showed up at his residence uninvited and repeatedly sent sexually explicit photographs and videos of Pentz to his friends and family. On June 25, 2021, Marchel Gabrielle Auguste filed a Complaint (the “Auguste Lawsuit”) against Thomas Wesley Pentz. In Auguste’s First Amended Complaint filed on August 10, 2022, she alleges causes of action for (1) Sexual Battery; (2) Gender Violence; (3) Violation of the Ralph Civil Rights Act; (4) Violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act; (5) Action Based on Civil Code § 1708.85; (6) Intentional Intrusion Into Private Affairs; (7) Battery; (8) Assault; (9) Defamation; (10) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (11) Fraud.    Auguste has sued alleging, among other things, the following: (i) Pentz communicated with her when she was a minor; (ii) groomed her; (iii) gave her an STD; (iv) ejaculated inside her; (v) raped her; (vi) defamed her and (vii) committed revenge porn against her. Auguste alleges that all the aforementioned acts caused her severe emotional distress. On August 1, 2021, Pentz filed a Notice of Related Case. On September 14, 2021, the Court ruled the Pentz Lawsuit 21STCV16321 and the Auguste Lawsuit 21STCV23647 were related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 21STCV16321, the Pentz Lawsuit, is the lead case.   On September 21, 2022, Petitioner Pentz filed a petition to confirm arbitrator’s award in favor of Pents against Respondent Auguste, with the case no. 22STCP03439. On April 28, 2023, the Court found the following cases, 21STCV16321 and 21STCV23647 and 22STCP03439, are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 21STCV16321 is the lead case.   On May 24, 2024, Petitioner Pentz filed the instant Motion for an Order Allowing Alternative Service of (1) Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, and (2) Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) to Respondent. No opposition was filed. On August 28, 2024, Pentz filed a notice of non-opposition. ANALYSIS Pentz moves the Court for an order allowing alternative service of (1) the Application for and order for Appearance and Examination and (2) Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) For Personal Appearance and Production of Documents, Electronically Stored Information, and Things at Trial or Hearing by delivery to Auguste of said documents by electronic mail to Auguste to her personal email address – “shellym101@hotmail.com”. Pentz asserts that alternative service is warranted because (1) Auguste refused to provide her personal physical address to the Court and opposing counsel; (2) Auguste agreed to accept service on all matters via electronic mail; and (3) the proposed alternative method is reasonably calculated to provide notice to Auguste and an opportunity to be heard.On September 6, 2022, an arbitrator rendered an award in favor of Pentz and against Auguste. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 7.) On June 2, 2023, this Court confirmed the Award, and Judgment was entered on the Award. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 9.) At the time, Respondent was represented by two law firms who accepted electronic service. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 10.) In or around June 2023, Auguste’s then-counsel, filed Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel in the Civil Lawsuits. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 11.) During the hearing for those motions, Pentz contends that Auguste stated she would not give the Court her current address and agreed to accept email service on all matters at shellym101@hotmail.com. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 12.) Pentz further contends that August agreed to accept electronic service as personal service. (Ibid.)Pursuant to Auguste’s consent to electronic mail service, on January 18, 2024, Petitioner served a copy of (1) the Application for and order for Appearance and Examination and (2) Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) For Personal Appearance and Production of Documents, Electronically Stored Information, and Things at Trial or Hearing on Auguste via electronic service to her email address “shellym101@hotmail.com”. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. A and B). Pentz states that few days later, Auguste responded to the email service confirming that she had received the email, and stated that she has retained a new law firm for the matter and to contact the new firm. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 17). At no time did Petitioner’s counsel receive any communication from a new counsel, nor did any new counsel of record substitute in to this matter. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 18). On February 15, 2024, Auguste did not appear for the hearing and Pentz contends the Court directed counsel to submit an application/motion allowing service by electronic mail. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¿19). Pentz asserts that electronic service here is proper. Pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1010.6, consent, or a withdrawal of consent, to receive electronic service may only be completed by the party or person entitled to service or his or her attorney. Electronic service is deemed complete at the time of the electronic transmission of the document or at the time that the electronic notification of service of the document is sent. (CCP §1010.6(a)(4)(A); Cal Rules of Ct 2.251(i).) Here, Auguste’s former counsel and Auguste herself, have not withdrawn consent to receive electronic service. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 23.) Auguste has also responded to electronic communication, which confirms that she is able to receive electronic service and that electronic service is reasonably calculated to provide her notice. (Yeghiayan Decl. ¶ 24.) Auguste did not file an opposition. “A party who has not timely filed written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an opportunity to offer oral argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition creates an inference that the motion or demurrer is meritorious.”¿ (Id.)¿ “In such cases, the court may hear argument limited to a request for a continuance of the hearing in order to afford an opportunity for written opposition.” (Id.) “[T]he rule is patently intended to prevent the introduction of legal theories without prior notice to opposing counsel and the court.” (Id.) Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Pentz’s Motion for an Order Allowing Alternative Service of (1) Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, and (2) Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) to Auguste. CONCLUSIONPetitioner Pentz’s Motion is GRANTED. The Court grants Pentz’s request to electronically serve the (1) Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, and (2) Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) on Respondent Auguste.
