 N/A



 
Here, Plaintiff submitted a declaration in
support of his request for default judgment. In Plaintiff’s declaration he
provides a summary of the case and computation of prejudgment interest. (McDaughtery
Decl., ¶¶ 1-10, 12.) 
 
However,
the Court finds Plaintiff must provide additional evidence supporting his
claimed damages. “[I]f the relief requested in the complaint is more
complicated than that, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary
relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or
the exercise of judgment to ascertain (such as emotional distress damages, pain
and suffering, or punitive damages), the plaintiff must request entry of
judgment by the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) In such cases, the
plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment
requested.” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267,
287.) The Court may award emotional distress damages “as appears by the
evidence to be just,” or order the damages be assessed by a jury. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 585(b).)
 
Plaintiff seeks general and special damages in the amount of
$400,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $800,000 which is solely
supported by the following statement: “for the severe emotional distress caused
by the severity of Defendants’ harassment, discrimination, and retaliation.” (McDaughtery Decl., ¶
11.) Plaintiff does not provide the Court
with any factual detail regarding his claimed emotional distress or how
Plaintiff arrived at this amount. Accordingly, the declaration fails to meet
the particularity requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 585(d): “[t]he
facts stated in the affidavit or affidavits shall be within the personal
knowledge of the affiant and shall be set forth with particularity.” The Court
cannot grant any emotional distress damages based upon the evidence
provided. 
 
For the reasons stated herein,
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.   
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
