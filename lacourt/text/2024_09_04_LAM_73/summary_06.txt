And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Wesco Insurance Company, is granted its request for default judgment against the defendant, Jerry Selvin Sanchez dba Swish Cleaning Services. The plaintiff had previously filed a request for default judgment, but it was denied due to incomplete paperwork. The plaintiff re-filed its request and submitted all the necessary documents, including a declaration from a representative of the insurance company. The declaration provided a summary of the case, attached invoices showing the payments due, and computed interest and costs. The judge found that the plaintiff had complied with all requirements for a default judgment and therefore granted the request. The judgment is for $59,586.84, which includes the amount demanded in the complaint, interest, and costs.
