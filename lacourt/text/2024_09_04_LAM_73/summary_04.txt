And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, Citibank, N.A. and Jesse Nathan Tyre-Karp, to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Steven Schuman. The court has sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action with 20 days leave to amend.

The court has found that the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged the existence of a valid contract between himself and Citibank. The court has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and promissory estoppel fail because a conditional commitment is not a clear and unambiguous offer.

The court has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of its own file and has taken notice of the exhibits attached to the FAC.

The court has ruled that the defendants' demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
