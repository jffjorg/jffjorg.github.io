I. BACKGROUND
 
On September
26, 2023, Plaintiff Wesco Insurance Company filed the instant action against Defendant
Jerry Selvin Sanchez individually and dba Swish Cleaning Services.
 
The Complaint
alleges three causes of action for breach of contract. Plaintiff alleges it
provided Defendant with Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance coverage
in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Plaintiff performed an audit on the three policies and
found the premium basis estimate provided by the Defendant was inaccurate.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is obligated to pay the actual audited total
premium and fees, but Defendant has refused to make further payments. 
 
On April 18, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.  
 
On
May 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Request for Default Judgment. The Court denied Plaintiff’s
request without prejudice for failure to correctly fill out JC Form CIV-100.
 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff again filed a Request
for Default Judgment. Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendant
in the total amount of $59,586.84, consisting of the amount demanded in the
complaint of $52,367.00, $6,659.84 in interest and $560.00 in costs.
