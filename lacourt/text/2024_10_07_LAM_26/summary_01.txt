And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to her Form Interrogatories and has ordered the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,993.91. The defendant failed to provide a timely response to the Interrogatories and did not serve a response until more than two months after the filing of the motion. The court has found that the defendant waived any objections to the Interrogatories, except those based on constitutional or privacy rights of third parties. The defendant has also not established that its failure to serve responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. As a result, the defendant is ordered to serve answers to the Form Interrogatories without objections (except as stated above) within 20 days. If the defendant files a motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2030.290(a) within 10 days, the court's order will be stayed.
