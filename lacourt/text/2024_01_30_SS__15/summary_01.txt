And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiffs, PTI Union, in a case with case number 21STCV21966. The plaintiffs had previously filed a motion to quash, which was granted after their counsel failed to appear at the scheduled hearing due to a computer glitch. The plaintiffs argue that their counsel was kept in a waiting room and was unable to appear, and therefore, the court should reconsider its decision. The defendant, PTI Union, argues that the computer glitch is not a new fact, circumstance, or law required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, and that the plaintiffs' counsel should have called the court on the phone when they were stuck in the waiting room. The judge grants the motion for reconsideration and sets the motion to quash for a new hearing on February 8, 2024. The judge suggests that the parties could have resolved this issue without a motion, and that professional courtesy dictates that they should have agreed to a stipulation setting the motion to quash for a new hearing date.
