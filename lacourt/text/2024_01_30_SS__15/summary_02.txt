And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs have no evidence that the plaintiff, Roberto E. Sotomayor, was exposed to asbestos-containing products from the defendant, Plastic Sales, Inc. The judge agreed, finding that the plaintiffs' interrogatory responses were vague and lacked specific evidence of exposure. The judge also noted that Sotomayor's deposition testimony did not mention asbestos exposure. The plaintiffs argued that they needed a continuance of the hearing to take the deposition of the defendant, but the judge found that they had not presented sufficient evidence to justify the need for a continuance. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant is to file a proposed judgment within five days.
