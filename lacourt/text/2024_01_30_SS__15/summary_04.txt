And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by New Hampshire Insurance Company to intervene and vacate the default judgment entered against Refinery Maintenance. The motion is granted because the same reasons apply as in Mechling v. Asbestos Defendants (2018). New Hampshire Insurance Company is required to file its answer immediately. The parties are to meet and confer to agree on a discovery schedule, including confirmed dates for depositions and any motion for summary judgment. A joint report containing the discovery schedule and confirmed dates must be filed by February 23, 2024. Given the age of the case, the parties should prepare for a trial date this year.
