  Case Number:  21STCV21966    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATON
            Defendant
PTI Union filed a motion to quash, set for hearing on December 20, 2023.  On that day, counsel for Plaintiffs did not
appear, and the court granted the motion to quash.  On January 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion
for reconsideration, stating Plaintiffs’ counsel had logged into the court’s
remote hearing system but was kept in the waiting room.  During the time he was in the waiting room,
his matter was called.  Plaintiffs ask
for the motion to quash be put back on for hearing.
            Defendant
argues the court should not reconsider the grant of the motion to quash because
the computer glitch that prevent Plaintiffs’ counsel from appearing at the
argument is not a new fact, circumstance or law required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, and that Plaintiffs’ counsel should have called the
court on the phone when he was stuck in the waiting room.
            The
parties should have been able to resolve this without a motion.  Professional courtesy dictates that they
should have agreed to a stipulation setting the motion to quash for a new
hearing date, given that the computer glitch was not Plaintiffs’ fault.
            The
motion is GRANTED.  The motion to quash
filed by PTI Union is set for hearing on February 8, 2024 at 9 a.m. 
            The
moving party is to give notice.
