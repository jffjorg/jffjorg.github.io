And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC (Defendant) on January 3, 2024. The Plaintiffs, Jerry Kudenov and Kathryn Kudenov, are seeking to hold the Defendant liable for Kudenov's mesothelioma diagnosis, which they claim was caused by exposure to asbestos in Defendant's talc. The Defendant argues that it is not subject to California's personal jurisdiction because it is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Connecticut, and that the Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence that the Defendant's talc was used in a specific product to which Kudenov was exposed. The Judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons, but has given the Plaintiffs the opportunity to conduct discovery on the use of Defendant's talc in Paco joint compound during the time Kudenov used the product. The case is continued to April 29, 2024 for discovery, and the parties are permitted to file supplemental opposition and reply briefs.
