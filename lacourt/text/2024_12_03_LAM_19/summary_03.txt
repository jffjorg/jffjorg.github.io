And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kun Hwa Gehres (Petitioner) against SMS USA Inc. (Respondent) regarding the release of property from a mechanic's lien. The Petitioner filed the petition on August 15, 2024, alleging that the Respondent failed to bring an action to enforce the lien within 90 days as required by law. The Respondent recorded the Claim of Mechanics Lien on March 27, 2024, and the Petitioner sent a written demand to the Respondent on July 8, 2024, which was not responded to.

The judge finds that the Petitioner has complied with the service and notice requirements of the petition, except for the notice of hearing. The Petitioner filed a Proof of Service of Summons on November 4, 2024, showing that the petition was personally served on an authorized agent for the Respondent, but the notice of hearing was not served by certified or registered mail as required by law.

As a result, the judge continues the hearing to give the Petitioner an opportunity to properly serve the Respondent with notice of the continued hearing date.
