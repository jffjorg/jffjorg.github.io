[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 16, 2024



 
On October 3, 2022, Plaintiff
Mat Baburyan filed this action against Defendant Safeco Insurance Company of America.
On
October 27, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication.  Plaintiff did not file
an opposition.
BACKGROUND FACTS
On
March 4, 2014, Plaintiff reported to Defendant that he was involved in an automobile
accident on February 28, 2014.  (Undisputed
Material Facts “UMF” 1.)  Plaintiff was insured
under Defendant’s Policy Number A2809077, which had Uninsured Motorist (“UM”) Coverage
and Medical Payment Coverage parts with limits. 
(UMF 2-3.)  The UM Coverage included
policy provisions that mirror Insurance Code section 11580.2, including an arbitration
provision.  (UMF 4-5.)
On
December 3, 2014, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted to Defendant medical bills of $10,040
and claimed that Plaintiff required future spine surgery at a cost of over $80,000.  (UMF 6.) 
On December 17, 2014, Defendant advised of its payment of the $5,000 Medical
Payments Coverage (“MedPay”) policy limit, and it offered to settle the claim for
$9,975 for medical bills plus general damages, less $5,000 offset for Medical Payments
benefits paid under MedPay.  (UMF 7.)  Defendant received a letter from Plaintiff’s counsel
demanding arbitration of the claim, but Plaintiff’s counsel later stated that the
“demand” was to protect the statute of limitations and not to initiate formal arbitration
because Plaintiff was still being treated. 
(UMF 8-9.)
On
August 4, 2016, Plaintiff provided Defendant with a report from an independent medical
examiner who opined that Plaintiff needed spine surgery.  (UMF 9-10; Ex. 16.)  To evaluate that medical opinion and whether the
procedure was related to the accident, Defendant retained Dr. Rosabel Young.  (UMF 10.)
On
April 20, 2017, Defendant offered to settle the claim for $67,000, but five days
later, Plaintiff rejected the offer and demanded UM arbitration.  (UMF 11.) 
Discovery proceeded in the UM arbitration proceeding from in or about May
2017 to January 2020.  (UMF 12.)
On
February 11, 2020 Defendant received a CCP section 998 Offer to Compromise from
Plaintiff in the amount of $250,000.  (UMF
13.)  On February 22, 2020 Defendant received
Plaintiff’s arbitration brief in which he asserts entitlement to “no less than $250,000.”  (UMF 14.) 
On June 17, 2020 Defendant received from Plaintiff’s counsel a demand to
settle the UM claim for payment of $225,000. 
(UMF 15.)  On June 23, 2020, Defendant
increased its offer of settlement to $82,500: $49,328 for past and future medical
specials and $38,172 in general damages for pain and suffering, minus $5,000 for
Medical Payments already made.  (UMF 16.)  Plaintiff rejected that offer, and the arbitration
proceeded on July 27, 2020.  (UMF 17.)
The
Arbitrator issued his Arbitration Award dated August 24, 2020 for $137,164: $42,164
for past and future medical specials and $100,000 for general damages, minus $5,000
for Medical Payments already made.  (UMF 18.)  The Arbitrator agreed with Defendant’s expert
who found that Plaintiff was not entitled to over $100,000 for future spine surgery.  (UMF 19.)
Defendant
received the arbitration award on August 28, 2020 and issued a check to Plaintiff
and his counsel the same day.  (UMF 20.)
DISCUSSION
For
each claim in the complaint, the defendant moving for adjudication must satisfy
the initial burden of proof by showing that one or more elements of a cause of action
cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520 (Scalf).)  Then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf,
supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)  To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
151, 162-163.)
A.        Defendant Has Shown that Plaintiff Cannot
Establish All Elements of Breach of Contract (First Cause of Action).
The
first cause of action alleges that Defendant breached its contract with Plaintiff
by unreasonably refusing to pay benefits due and payable.  (Complaint ¶ 68.)  The standard elements of a claim for breach of
contract are (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance,
(3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.  (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times
Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)
Defendant
argues that there is no breach because it paid all policy benefits per the policy
and arbitration award.  (Motion at pp. 10-11.)  It is undisputed that the policy had an arbitration
provision, the parties went to arbitration, the arbitrator rendered an award, and
Defendant issued a check to Plaintiff the same day that it received notice of the
award.  (UMF 5, 12, 18, 20.)  There can be no breach of contract when an insurer
pays all policy benefits that an insured is entitled to receive.  (Behnke v. State Farm General Ins. Co.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1468.)
Defendant
has met its initial burden of showing that Plaintiff cannot establish an essential
element of his claim.  The burden now shifts
to Plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact.  Plaintiff did not file any opposition.
Summary
adjudication of the first cause of action is granted.
B.        Defendant Has Shown that Plaintiff Cannot
Establish All Elements of Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Second Cause of
Action).
The
second cause of action alleges bad faith and breach of the duty good faith and fair
dealing when Defendant unreasonably withheld benefits due under the policy.  To establish a breach of the covenant of good
faith and fair dealing for insurance claims, a plaintiff must establish that (1)
benefits due under the policy were withheld, and (2) the reason for withholding
benefits was unreasonable or without proper cause.  (Love v. Fire Insurance Exchange (1990)
221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1151.)
“[B]efore
an insurer can be found to have acted tortiously (i.e., in bad faith), for its delay
or denial in the payment of policy benefits, it must be shown that the insurer acted
unreasonably or without proper cause. 
[Citations.]  However, where there
is a genuine issue as to the insurer’s liability under the policy for the
claim asserted by the insured, there can be no bad faith liability imposed on the
insurer for advancing its side of that dispute. 
[Citation.]”  (Chateau Chamberay
Homeowners Ass’n v. Associated Intern. Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 335, 347.)  “The genuine dispute rule does not relieve an
insurer from its obligation to thoroughly and fairly investigate, process and evaluate
the insured’s claim.”  (Wilson v. 21st
Century Ins. Co. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 713, 723 (Wilson).)  “[A]n insurer is entitled to summary judgment
based on a genuine dispute over coverage or the value of the insured’s claim only
where the summary judgment record demonstrates the absence of triable issues (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c)) as to whether the disputed position upon which the
insurer denied the claim was reached reasonably and in good faith.”  (Wilson, supra,
42 Cal.4th at pp. 724.)  “A genuine dispute
exists only where the insurer’s position is maintained in good faith and on reasonable
grounds.”  (Id. at p. 723.)
Defendant
argues that it was reasonably debatable whether Plaintiff’s alleged need for spine
surgery was compensable under the claim. 
(Motion at p. 12.)  It is undisputed
that the parties had differing expert opinions, and the arbitrator agreed with Defendant’s
expert who found that Plaintiff was not entitled to over $100,000 for future spine
surgery.  (UMF 9-10, 19.)
Defendant
made several settlement offers in increasing amounts, and its last offer of $82,500
($49,328 for past and future medical specials and $38,172 in general damages for
pain and suffering, minus $5,000 for Medical Payments) was close to the final arbitration
award of $137,164 ($42,164 for past and future medical specials and $100,000 for
general damages, minus $5,000 for Medical Payments).  (UMF 16, 18.) 
The major difference in the awards is the amount of general damages, and
an award of nonpecuniary damages “is ‘a matter on which there legitimately may be
a wide difference of opinion.’”  (Seffert
v. Los Angeles Transit Lines (1961) 56 Cal.2d 498, 508.)  Additionally, the arbitration award was over $100,000
below the policy limit and below Plaintiff’s CCP section 998 Offer to Compromise.  (Motion at p. 12; see UMF 3, 13, 18.)
Defendant
has met its initial burden of showing that Plaintiff cannot establish an essential
element of his claim.  The burden now shifts
to Plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact.  Plaintiff did not file any opposition.
Summary
adjudication of the second cause of action is granted.
C.        Defendant Has Shown that Plaintiff Cannot
Establish a Basis for Punitive Damages.
For
the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff cannot establish an underlying claim upon
which punitive damages may be awarded because Defendant did not act in bad faith.  (See Motion at pp. 14-15.)
Defendant
has met its initial burden of showing that Plaintiff cannot establish a basis for
punitive damages.  The burden now shifts to
Plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact.  Plaintiff did not file any opposition.
Summary
adjudication of punitive damages is granted.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.  Defendant
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
January 31, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
