**Summary**
The tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint and denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The ruling also grants the plaintiffs' request to add allegations about the lease and purchase of the vehicle and the defendant's agency relationships. The ruling is based on the court's finding that the Song-Beverly Act's express warranty provisions apply to used vehicles and that the defendant is liable for breach of implied warranty.
