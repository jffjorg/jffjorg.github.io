Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Mat Baburyan, filed a complaint against the defendant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, alleging breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The defendant argued that it had paid all policy benefits and that there was no breach of contract. The judge found that the defendant had met its initial burden of showing that the plaintiff could not establish an essential element of his claim, and that the burden now shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact.

The judge also found that the defendant had shown that the plaintiff could not establish a basis for punitive damages because the defendant did not act in bad faith. The judge granted summary adjudication of the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and summary adjudication of punitive damages.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented in the case, including the parties' settlement offers and the arbitrator's award. The judge found that the defendant's payment of the arbitration award and its settlement offers were reasonable and in good faith, and that the plaintiff's rejection of those offers was unreasonable. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claim for future spine surgery was not compensable under the insurance policy.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further evidence or arguments presented at the hearing on January 16, 2024.
