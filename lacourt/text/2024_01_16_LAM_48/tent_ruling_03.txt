[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR APPROVAL
  OF PAGA SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 16, 2024



 
On October 26, 2022, Plaintiff Irene
Rios filed this action against Defendants Samaritana Medical Clinic Inc., Providers
Medical Management Inc., and William A. Martinez for penalties under the Private
Attorney General Act (“PAGA”).

The parties have agreed on the terms of a settlement.  Under the proposed settlement, Defendants will
pay a Gross Settlement Amount of $150,000.00. 
Of that amount, $30,000.00 will be paid directly to PAGA Counsel and Plaintiff,
leaving a PAGA Settlement Amount of $120,000.00.  (Messrelian Decl., Ex. 1 at p. 5, ¶ 3.1.)  From the PAGA Settlement Amount, up to 33% will
be paid as attorney fees, up to $5,000.00 will be paid as costs, and up to $4,864.21
will be paid to a settlement administrator. 
Of the remaining amount, 75-percent will be paid to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency (“LWDA”) and 25-percent will be paid to the aggrieved employees
on a pro rata basis.  
A court must review and approve any penalties sought as part of a proposed
settlement agreement pursuant to Labor Code section 2699.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l).)  “[C]ivil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees
shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated
to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and
25 percent to the aggrieved employees.”  (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (i).) 
A.        Plaintiff Has Provided
Notice of the Settlement to LWDA.
A proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to LWDA at the same time
that it is submitted to the court for review and approval.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  Plaintiff’s counsel attaches proof that the settlement
was submitted to the LWDA at the same time the motion was filed.  (Messrelian Decl., Ex. 2.)
Accordingly, the Court finds that this requirement is satisfied.
B.        The Settlement is Entitled to a Presumption
of Fairness.
A presumption of fairness¿for a settlement agreement exists where:
(1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced
in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.¿(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
1794, 1802.)  The final factor does not apply
to PAGA.  (See Arias v. Superior Court
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 984 [representative actions under PAGA do not violate the
due process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].)
On September 19, 2023, the Parties attended a full day mediation session
with 16 experienced mediator Hon. Frederick P. Aguirre, where they reached a settlement.  (Messrelian Decl. ¶ 9.)  The settlement was therefore
reached through arm’s-length bargaining.
The parties engaged in discovery regarding Defendants’ policies,
practices, operations, time and payroll information, Plaintiff’s personnel file
(including time and payroll data for Plaintiff), and the time records and payroll
records for a group of 25 employees  (21%
sample) who were within the PAGA period. 
(Messrelian Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.)  Accordingly, there was sufficient investigation to allow counsel
and the Court to act intelligently.
There is no information about counsel’s experience in similar
litigation.  However, the Court takes judicial
notice of the fact that Plaintiff’s counsel was also counsel of record in at least
two other PAGA cases, Case Nos. 21STCV41387 and 21STCV43225,
in this Department.
The Court finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption
of fairness.
C.        The
Release is Permissible.
If the Court approves the PAGA settlement, the aggrieved employees
will release “any and all claims that were made or could have been asserted in the
Action.”  On only her own behalf, Plaintiff
also waives the protections of Civil Code section 1542.
This release
is limited to claims for civil penalties that arise from or relate to allegations
in Plaintiff’s Complaint in this action, and it is permissible.
D.        The Attorney Fees and Costs Are Reasonable.
A prevailing employee is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney
fees and costs incurred in the action.  (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (g)(1).)  Plaintiff’s
counsel will receive up to 33% of the PAGA Settlement Amount for attorney fees (estimated
at $40,000.00) and up to $5,000.00 in costs and expenses from the PAGA Settlement
Amount.  (Messrelian Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.1.)
The Court finds that the attorney fees and costs are reasonable.
E.        Conclusion
The motion for
approval of PAGA settlement is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
