And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date by approximately four months. The court found that there was good cause for the continuance due to the departure of previous counsel from the defendant's law firm. However, the court did not grant an extension of the non-expert discovery deadlines. The trial date is now set to a date on or after October 14, 2024.
