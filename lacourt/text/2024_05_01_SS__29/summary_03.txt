And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the two motions to compel Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security to provide responses to discovery requests are denied. The reason for this decision is that Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security has not appeared in the case and has not responded to the discovery requests. Additionally, the service of the discovery requests was made to Single Source Security, LLC, dba Protos Security, which is a different entity from Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security. Therefore, the motions to compel are denied.
