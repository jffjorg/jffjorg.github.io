Background
This case arises out of an alleged slip and
fall incident in a Sprouts market on North Western Avenue in San Pedro on
October 11, 2019.
On September 20, 2021, Edith Reynolds
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against SF Markets, LLC; Sprouts Farmers Market;
Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and Does 1 to 25, asserting causes of
action for negligence and premises liability. 
On September 30, 2021, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. as Doe 1. (Plaintiff named
additional defendants on November 5, 2021, and subsequently filed a request to
dismiss those defendants on May 23, 2022.)
On December 3, 2021, Defendant SF Markets,
LLC (“SF”) filed an answer. 
On October 12 and 14, 2022, Plaintiff amended
her complaint to name Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security as Doe 1
and Single Source Security, LLC as Doe 2.
On February 28, 2023, Single Source Security,
LLC filed an answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Prudent
Security Solutions, Inc. (“Prudent”) and Does 1 through 500.
On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Prudent as Doe 3.
On May 10, 2023, SF filed a cross-complaint
against Single Source Security, LLC dba Protos Security and Roes 1 through
50.  On the same day, SF amended the
cross-complaint to name Prudent as Roe 1.
On July 20 and 21, 2023, Prudent filed an
answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against SF; First Washington
Realty, Inc. (“First Washington”); GRI Park Plaza, LLC (“GRI”); Sprouts Farmers
Market; Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and Moes 1 through 30.
On August 1, 2023, SF, First Washington, and
GRI filed an answer to Prudent’s cross-complaint.
As is relevant to the motions before the Court
and set for hearing on May 1, 2024, SF served Form Interrogatories (Set One)
and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Single Source Security, Inc. dba
Protos Security on September 6, 2023. 
(Crossin Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) 
As to Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security, service was made
by electronic transmission to the attorneys at the Acker & Whipple
firm.  (Id., Exh. A.)
Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos
Security did not respond to the discovery. 
SF sent a letter to attorney Childers at the Acker & Whipple firm on
November 28, but no response was received. 
(Id., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)
On March 13, 2024, SF filed these two
motions.  No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is
no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer
efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
Requests for admission may be propounded on a party without leave of court 10
days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by that party,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
SF served Form Interrogatories (Set One) and
Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos
Security on September 6, 2023.  (Crossin
Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Single Source
Security, Inc. dba Protos Security was served by email to the attorneys at the
Acker & Whipple firm.  (Id.,
Exh. A.)
There are, however, two Single Source
Security entities that have been named in this action.  SF filed its cross-complaint against Single
Source Security, LLC, dba Protos Security. 
That entity has appeared in this action and is represented by the Mr.
Childers of the Acker & Whipple firm.
SF propounded the discovery at issue,
however, to a different entity: Single Source Security, Inc., dba Protos
Security.  That entity has been named as
a defendant to Plaintiff’s complaint but has not appeared (whether through the
Acker & Whipple firm or otherwise).  
Single Source Security, LLC and Single Source
Security, Inc. appear to be different entities. 
Service on one (LLC) is not service on the other (Inc.).  Accordingly, service of discovery directed to
Single Source Security, Inc. on counsel for Single Source Security, LLC is not
valid.
Accordingly, the two motions to compel Single
Source Security, Inc. to provide responses to the discovery requests at issue are
denied.  
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the two motions to compel.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
