 Case Number:  22STCV32931    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Continue Trial filed by Cross-Defendant Arko
Enterprise, Inc dba A1 Construction & Remodeling.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
This case arises out of a fall
incident on August 19, 2022 at premises located on Hatteras Street in
Tarzana.  On October 6, 2022, Plaintiff
Zara Leybovich (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants JMDG European
Design LLC dba Michel Clair Design (“JMDG”); Benjamin Leybovich; and Does 1
through 80, asserting causes of action for premises liability and negligence. 
 
On January 12, 2023, JMDG filed its
answer to the complaint.  On April 6,
2023, JMDG filed a cross-complaint against Benjamin Leybovich; Arko Enterprise
Inc. dba A1 Construction & Remodeling (“Arko”); and Roes 1 through 50. 
 
On May 17, 2023, the parties
represented that there was a settlement as between Plaintiff and JMDG.
 
On July 6, 2023, Benjamin Leybovich
filed an answer to JMDG’s cross-complaint and his own cross-complaint against
JMDG, Arko, and Roes 1 through 40.
 
On July 10, 2023, Arko filed its
answer to JMDG’s cross-complaint.
 
In July and August 2023, a number of
requests for dismissal were filed: Plaintiff dismissed her entire complaint;
JMDG dismissed the claims in its cross-complaint against Benjamin Leybovich,
and Benjamin Leybovich dismissed the claims in its cross-complaint against JMDG.

 
Accordingly, setting aside any claims
involving fictitiously named defendants, it appears that the following remains unresolved:
JMDG’s cross-complaint against Arko (which is at issue), and Benjamin Leybovich’s
cross-complaint against Arko (which is not at issue and as to which no proof of
service has been filed).
 
On April 4, 2024, Arko filed a motion
for summary judgment as to the claims against it in JMDG’s cross-complaint.  The motion is set for hearing on January 15,
2025.
 
Also on April 4, 2024, Arko filed
this motion to continue trial.  The
current trial date is July 24, 2024.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Arko timely filed its motion for summary judgment on April 4, 2024.
(Candelas Decl., ¶ 3.) The motion for summary judgment is scheduled to be heard
on January 15, 2025. (Id., ¶ 2.)
Trial is currently set for July 24, 2024.
No opposition has been filed.
The Court finds that there is good cause to continue trial.  Arko is entitled to have its timely filed
motion for summary judgment heard before trial.
Accordingly, the motion to continue trial is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the Motion to Continue Trial.
The trial date
is advanced and continued to late February 2025.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
