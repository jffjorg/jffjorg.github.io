And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Amilcar Rivas Moreno dba West Direct Logistic, has moved to vacate the entry of default and default judgment entered against him. The default was entered on September 30, 2024, and the default judgment was entered on October 2, 2024. The defendant argues that the default and judgment are void because he was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, North Mill Equipment Finance, LLC, filed a proof of service that states the defendant was served at his residence, but the defendant disputes this and claims that he was not at home at the time of service. The court finds that the defendant has sufficiently challenged the veracity of the proof of service, and therefore, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that service was accomplished as stated. Because no opposition was filed to the defendant's motion, the court grants the motion to vacate the default and default judgment. An order to show cause regarding the failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint is set for January 29, 2025.
