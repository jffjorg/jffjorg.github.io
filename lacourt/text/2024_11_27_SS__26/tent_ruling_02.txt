Moreno et al., Case No. 24STLC05505TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant Amilcar Rivas Moreno dba West Direct Logistic’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTERED ON OCTOBER 2, 2024 ARE HEREBY VACATED.AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR JANUARY 29, 2025 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.ANALYSIS:On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff North Mill Equipment Finance, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract and related claims against Defendant Amilcar Rivas Moreno dba West Direct Logistic (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on September 24, 2024 and default judgment on October 2, 2024.Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment on October 30, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionDefendant moves to vacate the entry of default and default as void for improper service pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), which states that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) As evidence that the default and judgment are void, Defendant submits their declaration disputing being sub-served with the Summons and Complaint at the correct address. (Motion, Moreno Decl., ¶¶2-3.)A proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) Plaintiff’s proof of service of the Summons and Complaint, filed on August 28, 2024, is attested to by a registered process server. (Proof of Service, filed 08/28/24, ¶7.) The burden, therefore, is upon Defendant to demonstrate that service was not effectuated in accordance with the statutory requirements. The proof of service states that Defendant was sub-served by leaving the papers at Defendant’s residence at 1060 W. 61st Street, Los Angeles, California, with a co-occupant. (Id. at ¶¶3-5.) Defendant, however, declares that their home address is 36834 Cobalt Street, Palmdale, California and that at the time of service, on August 6, 2024, 7:08 am, they were at work at 150 E. 157th Street, Gardena, California. (Id. at ¶¶3-4.) Defendant’s declaration sufficiently challenges the veracity of the proof of service such that the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate that service was accomplished as stated. No opposition to the instant Motion, however, has been filed.Therefore, the Court finds that service of the Summons and Complaint on Defendant is void for improper service and should be set aside under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d).ConclusionDefendant Amilcar Rivas Moreno dba West Direct Logistic’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTERED ON OCTOBER 2, 2024 ARE HEREBY VACATED.AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR JANUARY 29, 2025 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.Court clerk to give notice.
