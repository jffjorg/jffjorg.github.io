And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to stay the case. The case is stayed with the exception that the parties may continue to seek non-party discovery. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendants are under investigation by the EPA and have been charged with a felony by the Los Angeles District Attorney. The Judge notes that in ordinary civil actions with parallel criminal proceedings, a stay of the case is generally appropriate. However, this is not an ordinary case and the Judge is uncertain whether different rules of priority apply. The Judge also notes that the parties' briefing did not provide any authority that would require the court to deviate from the usual Fuller analysis. As a result, the Judge has decided to avoid the Fifth Amendment discovery morass altogether and has granted the motion to stay the case, with the exception of non-party discovery.
