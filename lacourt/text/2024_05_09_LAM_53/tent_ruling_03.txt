  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to sever unlawful

MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Artem Gerashchenkov      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Sever Unlawful Detainer Complaint from Civil Complaint
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
On September 29, 2023, the court issued an order granting the ex parte
application filed by plaintiff Aysia A. Rowe (“Rowe”) and ordering that (1)
this unlimited civil action filed by Rowe (Case No. 23STCV14562) (the “Civil
Action”) and the limited civil action for unlawful detainer filed by defendant
Artem Gerashchenkov (“Gerashchenkov”) (Case No. 23IWUD01124) (the “Unlawful
Detainer Action”) are related cases, (2) the Unlawful Detainer Action shall be
assigned to Department 53, and (3) the Civil Action and the Unlawful Detainer
Action are consolidated for all purposes. 
(Sep. 29, 2023 Minute Order, p. 1.)  On March 5, 2024, the court issued an order
reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action (which was filed as a limited
jurisdiction civil case) as an unlimited civil case.  (Mar. 25, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
Gerashchenkov now moves the court for an order severing the Unlawful
Detainer Action from the Civil Action on the grounds that the Second Amended
Complaint, filed by Rowe in the Civil Action on March 6, 2024, (1) removes Gerashchenkov
as a party and (2) does not assert claims involving title to the real property
at issue.
The court denies Gerashchenkov’s motion to sever, without prejudice,
because the court finds that the appropriate remedy would be for the court to
reconsider its prior orders deeming the cases related, consolidating the cases,
and reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Action as an unlimited civil action in
light of the new facts and circumstances presented.
First, as noted by Gerashchenkov, Rowe’s First Amended Complaint,
filed July 14, 2023, named Gerashchenkov as a defendant, but Rowe’s Second
Amended Complaint, filed March 6, 2024, does not name him as a defendant.  (SAC ¶¶ 2-3 [alleging defendants are
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and Newrez, LLC (collectively, “Civil
Defendants”)].)
Second, Rowe’s First Amended Complaint included a first cause of
action for quiet title which sought to quiet title to the real property that is
the subject of the Unlawful Detainer Action in favor of Rowe.  (FAC ¶¶ 94-105; Unlawful Detainer Compl., ¶ 1
[alleging entitlement to real property known as 2735 W. 94th Street, Inglewood,
California].)  But, in the Second Amended
Complaint, Rowe does not allege a cause of action to quiet title and does not seek
to quiet or adjudicate title to that property. 
Instead, in the Second Amended Complaint, Rowe alleges that the wrongful
conduct allegedly committed by Civil Defendants caused her to lose that property
and seeks to recover only damages against Civil Defendants.  (SAC ¶¶ 4 [alleging that Rowe’s mother
purchased the real property located at 2735 W. 94th Street, Inglewood,
California], 56; SAC Prayer, ¶¶ 1-5.)  Moreover, the Second Amended Complaint
concedes that Rowe lost title to the property. 
(SAC ¶ 68 [alleging that mismanagement of the property loan
resulted in “loss of equity and loss of the title of the Property in
foreclosure”].)   
Based on the new facts and circumstances discussed above, the court
finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to set an Order to
Show Cause why the court should not (1) reconsider and vacate (i) its September
29, 2023 order deeming the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action related,
(ii) its September 29, 2023 order reassigning the Unlawful Detainer Action to
Department 53 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, (iii) its September 29, 2023
order consolidating the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action for all
purposes, and (iv) its March 5, 2024 order reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer
Action as a civil unlimited case, and (2) issue a new order (i) finding that the
Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action are not related, (ii) denying the
request to consolidate the Unlawful Detainer Action and Civil Action for all
purposes, and (iii) leaving the Unlawful Detainer Action as a limited unlawful
detainer case.  (Paul Blanco’s Good
Car Company Auto Group v. Superior Court (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 86, 97 [“As
a general rule, trial courts have inherent jurisdiction to reconsider, vacate,
or otherwise modify their interim orders”]; State of California v. Superior
Court (Flynn) (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 94, 100 [“Even without a change of law,
a trial court has the inherent power to reconsider its prior rulings on its own
motion at any time before entry of judgment”].) 
ORDER
The court denies defendant Artem Gerashchenkov’s motion to sever. 
            The court sets for hearing on June
18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53, an Order to Show Cause why it should
not (1) reconsider and vacate (i) its September 29, 2023 order deeming case
numbers 23STCV14562 and 23IWUD01124 related, (ii) its September 29, 2023 order assigning
case number 23IWUD01124 to Department 53 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, (iii)
its September 29, 2023 order consolidating case numbers 23STCV14562 and
23IWUD01124 for all purposes, and (iv) its March 5, 2024 order reclassifying
the unlawful detainer case (Case No. 23IWUD01124) as a civil unlimited case,
and (2) issue a new order        (i)
finding that case numbers 23STCV14562 and 23IWUD01124 are not related, (ii)
denying the request to consolidate case numbers 23STCV14562 and 23IWUD01124 for
all purposes, and (iii) leaving case number 23IWUD01124 as a limited unlawful
detainer case. 
            Any response to the Order to Show
Cause shall be filed no later than nine court days before the hearing. 
 
            The court orders defendant Artem
Gerashchenkov to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
