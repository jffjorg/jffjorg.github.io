DEMURRER TO ANSWER
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order sustaining his demurrer to each of
the 24 affirmative defenses alleged by defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel,
Inc., and Andrew Salas (“Defendants”) in their answer to Plaintiff’s Third
Amended Complaint.
The court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrer to the first through third, fifth, seventh through 10th,
13th through 19th, 21st, 26th, 27th, 28th, and 33rd affirmative defenses
because Plaintiff did not specifically address those affirmative defenses in
his supporting memorandum of points and authorities and therefore has not met
his burden to show that those defenses do not state facts sufficient to constitute
a defense or are uncertain.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a), (b).) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the fourth affirmative
defense of statute of limitations because it states facts sufficient to
constitute a defense since Defendants have pleaded that Plaintiff’s action is
barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure
sections 335.1, 338, and/or 340.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 430.20, subd. (a), 458; Martin v. Van Bergen (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 84, 91 [statute of limitations is properly alleged by pleading
the specific section and subdivision].) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the sixth affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from
seeking recovery of damages based on his failure to mitigate damages.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 232; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 11th affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are “barred”
by the doctrine of unclean hands.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 237; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court sustains Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 12th affirmative
defense of laches because it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense since Defendants have pleaded this defense as a terse legal
conclusion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.20, subd. (a); Answer, ¶ 238 [“The Plaintiff’s claims are
barred by laches”]; Quantification Settlement Agreement Cases (2011) 201
Cal.App.4th 758, 812-813 [affirmative defenses must not be pled as terse legal
conclusions].) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 20th affirmative
defense of sovereign immunity because (1) it states facts sufficient to
constitute a defense since Defendants have pleaded that Plaintiff’s action is
barred pursuant to the tribal sovereign immunity doctrines, and (2) Plaintiff
has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground
that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” pursuant to those
doctrines.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20,
subds. (a), (b); Answer, ¶ 246; Demurrer, pp. 3:12-18, 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 22nd affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff’s action is “barred”
due to his own affirmative misconduct. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 248; Demurrer, p.
4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 23rd affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff’s causes of action
are “barred” by the equitable doctrine of waiver.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 249; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 24th affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from
obtaining the relief sought because Plaintiff consented to the acts about which
he complains.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 250; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 24th affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from
obtaining the relief sought because Plaintiff ratified the acts about which he
complains.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 251; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 29th affirmative
defense because (1) it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
since Defendants have specifically pleaded that Plaintiff’s claims are barred
pursuant to the privileges set forth by Civil Code sections 47, subdivisions
(a) through (e), and 48, subdivision (a), and (2) Plaintiff has not shown that
this defense is ambiguous or unintelligible on the ground that it states that
Plaintiff’s claims are “barred” under those statutes.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a),
(b); Answer, ¶ 255; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.)
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 30th affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are
“barred” because the statutes relied on by Plaintiff violate Defendants’
statutory and constitutional rights. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 256; Demurrer, p.
4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 31st affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are
“barred” because Defendants’ statements were true.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 257; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 32nd affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff’s claims are
“barred” because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate actual malice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (b);
Answer, ¶ 258; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
The court overrules Plaintiff’s demurrer to the 34th affirmative
defense because Plaintiff has not shown that this defense is ambiguous or
unintelligible on the ground that it states that Plaintiff is “barred” from
bringing this action because Defendants’ conduct was protected under the First
Amendment.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.20, subd. (b); Answer, ¶ 260; Demurrer, p. 4:7-11.) 
MOTION TO STRIKE ANSWER
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) striking Defendants’ answer in its entirety, or (2) in the
alternative, striking each affirmative defense alleged by Defendants. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to strike Defendants’ answer in its entirety because (1) Defendants’
answer is not irrelevant, false, improper, and (2) Plaintiff has not shown that
the answer was not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state or
a court order.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to strike each affirmative defense alleged in Defendants’ answer because
Plaintiff has not shown (1) that all of the affirmative defenses are false,
improper, or irrelevant, or that they were not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state or an order of the court, (2) that, as to the
second, fifth, eighth, ninth, 24th, 25th, 2th, 30th, 31st, and 34th affirmative
defenses, Defendants have improperly combined multiple defenses into one
defense, and (3) that Defendants have improperly alleged duplicate
defenses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436;
Mot., pp. 5:10-18, 6:18-21.)

Reyes’s demurrer to defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew
Salas’s first through 11th and 13th through 34th affirmative defenses.

Reyes’s demurrer to defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew
Salas’s 12th affirmative defense.

Reyes’s motion to strike.
