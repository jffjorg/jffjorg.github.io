And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to the defendant AIDS Healthcare Foundation's motion for summary adjudication. The defendant is seeking to dismiss the plaintiff Tammy Davis' first cause of action for sexual harassment in violation of Civil Code section 51.9. The defendant argues that it cannot be held vicariously liable for the sexual assault and harassment committed by Tony Rositas, a non-moving defendant. The court finds that the defendant did not meet its burden of showing that the first cause of action has no merit. The court also notes that the defendant did not address all legal theories underlying the first cause of action, including the creation of a hostile environment based on sex. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the first cause of action.
