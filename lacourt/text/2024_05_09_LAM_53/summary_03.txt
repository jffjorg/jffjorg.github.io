And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a proposal by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a motion to sever the Unlawful Detainer Complaint from the Civil Complaint. The defendant, Artem Gerashchenkov, moved to sever the complaints based on the Second Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff,aysia a. Rowe, which does not name Gerashchenkov as a defendant and does not seek to quiet title to the real property at issue. The court denied the motion to sever and instead set an Order to Show Cause why the court should not reconsider its prior orders consolidating the cases and reclassifying the Unlawful Detainer Complaint. The court finds that the new facts and circumstances presented by the Second Amended Complaint warrant reconsideration of the court's prior orders.
