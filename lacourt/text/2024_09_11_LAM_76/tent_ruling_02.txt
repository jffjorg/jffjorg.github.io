 Case Number:  24STCV04105    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  76       September 11, 2024 is the fifth time the instant demurrer and motion to strike have been set for hearing because of deficiencies in moving Defendant's effort to meet and confer and to ensure proper service of the moving papers.  The chronology of the continuances is set forth below.        Moving Defendant Geoffrey Alan Harris Lichtman has once again failed to follow the Court's order with regard to the meet and confer requirement for the demurrer, and appears to have failed to file proof of service of the demurrer and motion (though the Court notes that Plaintiffs have appeared for the hearing each time).  After four continuances of this demurrer and motion, it appears that Defendant will not comply with the Court's order.  Therefore, the Court orders the demurrer and motion to strike OFF CALENDAR.      Defendant shall answer the Complaint within 10 days of this order.        The case management conference is continued to November 4, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY:This demurrer and motion to strike was originally set for hearing on May 7, 2024.  Moving Defendant expressly
acknowledged in the moving papers that the parties did not meet and confer, but Defendant did not
present a declaration reflecting an attempt to meet and confer in accordance
with Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41 and § 435.5.
Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41 and §
435.5 exempt self-represented litigants only if they are incarcerated, or if the
proceeding is for forcible entry, forcible detainer, or unlawful detainer.
(Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41(d)(1); § 435.5(d)(1)(also inapplicable to a SLAPP
motion or motion brought less than 30 days before trial.) None of those
situations apply here.
On May 7, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike to June 7, 2024.        On
June 4, 2024, Defendant Lichtman submitted a Declaration indicating that he
attempted to contact Plaintiffs by telephone to meet and confer about the
punitive damages, which only pertains to the motion to strike, and fraud, which
is only part of the demurrer.  Lichtman
does not indicate that he left a message for each Plaintiff regarding a meet
and confer effort.  More
fundamentally, Plaintiff Vanessa Poydras filed a Declaration indicating that,
not only did Defendant fail to meet and confer regarding this motion, but he
also did not serve Plaintiff with the motions. This is consistent with the
proof of service not indicating the method of service.
On June 7, 2024, the
Court again continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike for Defendant is to properly serve Plaintiffs
with the demurrer and motion to strike and satisfy the meet and confer
requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41. Defendant was directed to
file a supplemental declaration reflecting compliance with this Court’s order
by July 8, 2024.
While Defendant did not file a
supplemental declaration, on July 9, 2024, Plaintiffs did.  Plaintiffs indicated they were
never served with the demurrer and motion to strike, and no meet and confer
effort occurred.
On July 12, 2024, a substitution
of attorney was filed, indicating that Defendant in pro per is now represented
by counsel, Dignity Law Group, APC. The Court continued the hearing on the
demurrer and motion to strike to August 5, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
On July 15, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed an opposition indicating that they were never properly served with the
demurrer and motion to strike and there has been no meet and confer.
On August 5, 2024, the hearing on the demurrer and
motion to strike was again CONTINUED to September 11, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Defense
counsel was ordered to file proof of service of demurrer and motion to strike
and serve plaintiffs. Defense counsel was also ordered to file a meet and
confer declaration regarding issues in demurrer within 10 days of the order.
As of September 10, 2024, the
Court has no indication that defense counsel has complied with the Court’s
order.  Four continuances without any sign of progress is enough.  The demurrer and motion to strike are placed OFF-CALENDAR, and
Defendant is ordered to answer the Complaint within 10 days.
