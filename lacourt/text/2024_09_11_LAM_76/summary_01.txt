And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The trustee under the deed of trust has filed a petition to resolve claims to undistributed surplus proceeds of the trustee's sale. Dermot Givens, who is acting in pro per, has moved to intervene in the action. The judge has denied Givens' motion to intervene because Givens did not submit a proposed complaint or answer in intervention as required by Civil Procedure Code, § 387(c). The judge has granted the requests for judicial notice made by Wasserman, Comden & Casselman, LLP, relating to various documents and filings. The dispute concerns a judgment entered in 2008 against Givens in the amount of $2,015,268.63, and Givens disputes the validity of this judgment.
