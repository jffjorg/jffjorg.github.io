Discussion
            Proposed
Dermot Givens, in pro per (attorney), seeks to intervene in this action, following
a trustee’s sale to resolve claims to undistributed surplus proceeds of the
trustee’s sale. The Petition sets forth the pertinent facts at ¶ 12 as follows:
The trustee provides the following
additional information relevant to the identity, location, priority of
potential claimants, and the conflict of claims: One claim has been received
from Dermot Givens as the former owner of the property. A second claim has been
received from Wasserman Law Group based on an abstract of judgment recorded
1-16-09 and renewed 5-11-17 for a judgment of $2,015,268.63 against Dermot
Givens. A third claim has been received from Landau and Landau based on an
abstract of judgment recorded 5-23-18 for a judgment in the sum of $104,884.22
against Dem10t Givens. A fourth claim has been received from Formosa Gardens
HOA for an HOA lien recorded 7-27-23 in the sum of $17,017.20 against the
subject property. Claimant Givens disputes the Wasserman Claim and requests
that funds be deposited with the court.
            Proposed
intervenor did not submit a proposed complaint or answer in intervention as
required by Civ. Proc. Code, § 387(c). Without such a proposed pleading, the
Court need not address the arguments made in the opposition.
            As such,
the motion to intervene is DENIED.
