OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant Avanti Hospitals, LLC



 
MOTION
Plaintiff
Guadalupe Encisco (“Plaintiff”) moves to reopen discovery for purposes of discovery
on Plaintiff’s recent surgeries. 
Defendant Avanti Hospitals, LLC (“Defendant”) opposes the motion.ANALYSIS
In exercising its
discretion in determining whether to re-open discovery, the court must consider
the necessity and reasons for the additional discovery, the diligence or lack
thereof by the party seeking to reopen discovery in attempting to complete
discovery prior to the discovery cutoff, and whether permitting the discovery
will prevent the case from going forward on the scheduled trial date or will
otherwise prejudice any party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff moves to
re-open discovery concerning surgeries she underwent on January 8 and 11,
2024.  (See Declaration of Raymond
Ghermezian.)  However, Plaintiff has not
submitted a discovery plan, as the court directed Plaintiff to do in its March
1, 2024 order.  Accordingly, the Court
continues the matter to July 17, 2024. 
Plaintiff is to file and serve a discovery plan no later than July 2,
2024.  Defendant may file a discovery
plan in response no later than July 9, 2024.  
   
Plaintiff is to
give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
