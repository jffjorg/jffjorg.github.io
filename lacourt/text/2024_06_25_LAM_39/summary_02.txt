Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel arbitration of claims brought by Plaintiff Ashley Bautista against Defendant Starbucks Corporation. The Defendant moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the parties had entered into an agreement to arbitrate their claims. The Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the agreement was unconscionable.

The court found that the Defendant had adequately demonstrated the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, and that the Plaintiff had not demonstrated that the agreement was unconscionable. The court considered the factors of oppression and surprise in determining whether the agreement was procedurally unconscionable, and found that the agreement was a contract of adhesion because the Defendant prepared the agreement and the Plaintiff had no opportunity to negotiate or discuss its terms.

The court also found that the agreement was not substantively unconscionable, as it provided for an accessible and affordable process for resolving disputes. The court noted that the agreement did not attempt to require the Plaintiff to waive statutory claims with administrative agencies, and that the Plaintiff had ample opportunity to read the agreement and seek advice if necessary.

The court granted the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, and ordered the case to be set for an order to show cause why it should not be dismissed following arbitration.
