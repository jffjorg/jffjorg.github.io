  order RE:
defendants jeffrey breitman’s and marla breitman’s
  motion to quash service of summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff Brian
Armstrong filed this employment action against Defendants FH Investment Partnership,
LP, Jeffrey Breitman, and Marla Breitman. 
            On December 11, 2023, Defendants Jeffrey
Breitman and Marla Breitman filed the instant motion to quash service of
summons. Plaintiff filed his opposition on January 5, 2023. Defendants filed
their reply on January 11, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
I.
The Law on Personal Service and Substitute Service
“A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) Alternatively, a summons may be served by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house,
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, in the
presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents
thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the
same location. (Id., § 415.20.) 
II.
The Proofs of Service at Issue
            Although the proofs of service at
issue have not been filed with the Court, Defendants attach the proofs to their
motion and argue that the representations made therein are false. Both proofs
of service were executed on November 13, 2023 by the same registered process
server. As to Jeffrey Breitman, the proof of service indicates substitute
service on November 10, 2023 at the address 512 N. Fuller Ave., Los Angeles, CA
90036 and avers that the documents were left with a co-occupant named Marla
Breitman. (Edgar Decl., Ex. A.) As to Marla Breitman, the proof of service
indicates personal service at the same time at the same address. (Id.,
Ex. B.) 
III.
Defendants’ Argument
            Defendants are brother and sister.
Jeffrey Breitman declares that he does not currently reside at the listed
address and has not resided there for over a year. (J. Breitman Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.)
Mr. Breitman further avers that he is not related to anyone currently living at
the address. (Id., ¶ 6.) Marla Breitman declares that she was in Japan
on November 10, 2023, the date of service listed on the proofs. (M. Breitman
Decl. ¶ 3.) Ms. Breitman also denies living at the listed address. (Id.,
¶¶ 6-7.)
 
IV.
Plaintiff’s Opposition 
            a. Mootness
            In opposition, Plaintiff first
argues that the motion is moot because it is directed at the original
complaint, and Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on January 4, 2024.
However, FH Investment filed an answer on December 26, 2023. “A party may amend
its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the
answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
472(a).) Because Plaintiff did not obtain leave of court, the First Amended
Complaint is improper and does not moot the jurisdictional issue.             
b. The Correct Address
            Plaintiff argues that he served FH
Investment Partnership, LP through Marla Breitman at the same address that it
served the Breitmans themselves. Defendants do not contend that service on FH
Investment was improper, and in fact, FH Investment answered the complaint. However,
Plaintiff has no evidence that he served FH Investment through Marla Breitman
at the same address. The document labeled as the declaration of Nicole Clancy,
filed on January 5, 2024, is not in fact a declaration, but a duplicate of Plaintiff’s
opposition brief. In any case, service on FH Investment at the address does not
necessarily establish service on the individual Breitmans. Ultimately, Defendants’
evidence remains unrebutted. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to quash is
GRANTED. The First Amended Complaint filed on January 4, 2024 is invalid.
