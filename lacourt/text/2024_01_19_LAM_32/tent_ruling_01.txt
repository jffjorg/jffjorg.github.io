  Case Number:  22STCV41020    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  32      JANE DOE,                         Plaintiff,             v.   LUIS DIAZ ROJAS,                          Defendant.           Case No.:  22STCV41020   Hearing Date:  January 19, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: plaintiff’s motion for protective order                 BACKGROUND             On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane  Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an  alleged sexual assault.              On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff  filed the instant motion for protective order. Defendant filed his opposition  on January 2, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on January 9, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD “The court shall limit the scope of  discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that  discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will  lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court may make this  determination pursuant to a motion for protective order by a party or other  affected person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.020(a).) “The issuance and  formulation of protective orders are to a large extent discretionary.” (Nativi  v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 316.) “[T]he  burden is on the party seeking the protective order to show good cause for  whatever order is sought.” (Id. at p. 318.) DISCUSSION             Plaintiff seeks a protective order preventing  her from having to answer various discovery requests propounded by Defendant in  November and December 2023. Plaintiff argues that the discovery is not  relevant, invades her privacy, and is intended to harass and intimidate her.  Plaintiff claims that Defendant and his counsel are dangerous people who should  not have access to her information.  Plaintiff makes broad generalizations  about different sets of discovery that do not articulate good cause for a  protective order. Plaintiff’s argument mostly fails to identify which discovery  requests are problematic or explain how. Plaintiff simply concludes that she  does not have to answer entire sets of discovery. A protective order may “limit  the scope of discovery,” not absolve the obligation to respond entirely. (See Code  Civ. Proc., § 2017.020(a).) However, Plaintiff is not required to answer  requests regarding her citizenship or immigration status, or provide  information on her “customers.”  Plaintiff cannot refuse to respond to  discovery based on her personal discomfort at disclosing information to  Defendant or his counsel. Plaintiff decided to file the lawsuit, thus  voluntarily subjecting herself to the judicial process. (See Bakman v.  Superior Court (1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 306, 314.) Plaintiff cannot now decline  to participate in discovery. (Ibid.) Defendant is entitled to obtain  information to disprove Plaintiff’s allegations and support his defenses.  Plaintiff’s restraining order against Defendant, Defendant’s unrelated criminal  charges, and defense counsel’s disqualification in another case have no bearing  on the discoverable information in this case.   // // // // CONCLUSION             Plaintiff’s motion for protective  order is GRANTED in part. Plaintiff is not required to answer requests  regarding her citizenship or immigration status, or  provide information on her “customers.”  Plaintiff must otherwise respond to the subject  discovery.

  Case No.:  22STCV41020
  Hearing Date:  January 19, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion for sanctions   




 


 




BACKGROUND

            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault. 

            On November 6, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories
and requests for production, ordering Plaintiff to provide further responses within
15 days. Plaintiff did not provide responses within 15 days, but instead filed
a motion for reconsideration of the November 6 order which the Court has
concurrently denied.

            On December 12, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion for sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to abide by
the Court’s November 6 order. Plaintiff filed her opposition on December 27,
2023. Defendant filed his reply on January 2, 2024. 

LEGAL STANDARD

The Court may impose monetary or
nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the discovery process is
defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized method of
discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a court order
for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb
misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery
process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached
that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should
not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled
to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d
952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court order;
and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Abuse of discovery may additionally be treated as
a contempt of court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(e).) 

DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff has not provided further
responses after the Court’s November 6, 2023 order. (Koorenny Decl. ¶ 5.)
However, the Court does not find sanctions are warranted given a motion for
reconsideration of the November 6 order was pending. Additionally, Plaintiff
has only disobeyed one court order, and the requested sanctions would be
disproportionate at this stage. 

            With that being said, the motion for
reconsideration has been concurrently denied, and Plaintiff must respond to the
discovery. Sanctions remain possible should Plaintiff fail to abide by her
discovery obligations without substantial justification.          

CONCLUSION

            Defendant’s motion for sanctions is DENIED.

     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration   




 


 




BACKGROUND

            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault. 

            On November 6, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories
and requests for production, ordering Plaintiff to provide further responses within
15 days. Plaintiff did not provide responses within 15 days and has not
provided further responses to date.  

            On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the November 6 order. Defendant
filed his opposition on January 5, 2024. 

LEGAL STANDARD

“When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to
the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall
state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 

Additionally, “the trial court retains the
inherent authority to change its decision at any time prior to the entry of
judgment.” (Darling v. Kritt (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1156.) “[S]ection
1008 does not govern the court's ability, on its own motion, to reevaluate
its own interim rulings.” (Ibid.) “[T]he only requirement of the court
is that it exercise ‘due consideration’ before modifying, amending, or revoking
its prior orders.” (Id. at p. 1157.)

DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff’s motion presents no new
facts or law justifying reconsideration of the November 6 order. Plaintiff merely
concludes that Defendant’s discovery requests are burdensome and improper
without specifying which requests are improper and how. The Court already
explained in the November 6 order that it is Plaintiff’s burden to justify her
objections to the interrogatories and that Defendant had demonstrated good
cause for the requests for production. Plaintiff has presented nothing to
change that. 

            To the extent that Plaintiff
requests reconsideration to obtain more time to respond than the 15 days
ordered by the Court, Plaintiff has had more than sufficient time by now. As of
the hearing on this motion, Plaintiff will have had over 2 months to respond to
the discovery. Defendant is not required to wait any longer. Plaintiff’s status
as a pro se litigant does not entitle her to more favorable treatment
than a party represented by counsel. (See Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.) 

CONCLUSION

            Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is DENIED.

  Hearing Date:  January 19, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to compel deposition   




 


 


BACKGROUND            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault.             On December 8, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff filed her
opposition on December 20, 2023. Defendant filed his reply on December 27,
2023. LEGAL STANDARD“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document … described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)DISCUSSION            On November 20, 2023, Defendant
served Plaintiff with a notice of deposition setting Plaintiff’s deposition for
December 11, 2023. (Koorenny Decl., Ex. 1.) Plaintiff has refused to be deposed
and has not provided an alternative date. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6.)            Plaintiff’s opposition does not
articulate any valid argument excusing her from being deposed. Plaintiff chose
to file the lawsuit and cannot now refuse to participate in discovery. Defendant
is entitled to ascertain evidence regarding Plaintiff’s allegations and his
defenses, whether by deposition or documents.             With that being said, Defendant has
not demonstrated good cause for RFP Nos. 60, 63, and 64, which request
documents regarding Plaintiff’s citizenship and immigration status. Those
documents need not be produced.             Sanctions are warranted because
Plaintiff’s failure to appear at deposition is unsupported by substantial
justification. The reasonable amount is $1,560, representing 3 hours at $500 per
hour, plus a $60 filing fee. CONCLUSION            Defendant’s motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED in part. Plaintiff shall appear for deposition and
produce the requested documents except RFP Nos. 60, 63, and 64.
