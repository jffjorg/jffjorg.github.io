And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made several rulings in this case.

First, the judge granted in part the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, limiting the scope of discovery to certain requests for information.

Second, the judge denied the defendant's motion for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's failure to provide further responses to discovery requests was not willful.

Third, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the November 6 order, finding that the plaintiff had not presented new facts or law to justify reconsideration.

Finally, the judge granted in part the defendant's motion to compel deposition, ordering the plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce certain documents, except for documents related to the plaintiff's citizenship and immigration status.

The judge's decisions are based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law. The judge emphasized the importance of protecting the parties' interests and promoting fair and efficient discovery.
