And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant argued that the judgment is void because it was unsupported by evidence, that the service of process was improper, and that there was attorney mistake. The judge found that the defendant's arguments had merit and that the default judgment should be set aside. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
