And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to quash service of summons. The first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff is invalid. The defendants, Jeffrey Breitman and Marla Breitman, contend that they were not properly served with the summons and complaint. They argue that they did not reside at the address listed on the proofs of service, and that they were not informed of the contents of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff has not provided any evidence to rebut the defendants' claims. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction over the defendants, and the motion to quash service of summons is granted.
