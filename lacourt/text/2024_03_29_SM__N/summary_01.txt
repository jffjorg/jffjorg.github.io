Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Ross Tarkhan's Motion to Quash Service of Summons. The Defendant had argued that the service of summons was defective due to a typographical error and the fact that he no longer resides at the address where he was served. However, the Judge found that the proof of service, executed by a registered California process server, creates a rebuttable presumption of proper service. The Defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption, and therefore, the motion to quash service of summons was denied. The Defendant is required to file a responsive pleading within 15 days of entry of this order.
