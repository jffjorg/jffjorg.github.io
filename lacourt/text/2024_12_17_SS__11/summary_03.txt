And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the People of the State of California's motion to seal certain exhibits and parts of the opposition brief. The motion is unopposed, and the judge finds that an overriding interest exists in keeping the exhibits confidential, as they are covered by a protective order in a multidistrict-litigation action pending in Ohio. The judge also finds that the motion is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to protect the overriding interest. The judge notes that the parties' agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to seal, and that only the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should be sealed.
