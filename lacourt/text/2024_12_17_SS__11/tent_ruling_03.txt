The result changes if the parent
company’s contacts “reflect more than passive investment or ownership of a
subsidiary.”  (Ibid.)  The necessary “question is . . . whether the defendant has
purposefully directed its activities at the forum state by causing a separate
person or entity to engage in forum contacts.” 
(Ibid.)

Plaintiff is not pursuing general jurisdiction. 
The mere fact that Ingenix had an office in California does not create
specific jurisdiction.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to seal is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants are Pharmacy Benefit Managers
(“PBMs”).  They “administer
prescription-drug benefits for health-plan sponsors, including employers,
government entities, and unions.”  [Citation.]  “When a beneficiary of a
prescription-drug plan goes to a pharmacy to fill a prescription, the pharmacy
checks with a PBM to determine that person’s coverage and copayment
information.”  [Citation.]  “[T]he PBM [then] reimburses the pharmacy for
the prescription, less the amount of the beneficiary’s copayment.”  [Citation.] 
“The prescription-drug plan, in turn, reimburses the PBM.”  [Citation.]
 
Plaintiff sued Defendants for their alleged
contributions to the opioid crisis. 
Plaintiff claims Defendants created a public nuisance.
 
(7/18/24 Ruling Re: Motion to Stay Pending
Appeal, p. 1.)  
 
A motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction is set for hearing on
December 17, 2024.
 
Here, the People move to seal certain exhibits filed in
opposition to the motion to quash (exhibits G through R, W, and Y) and the
portions of their opposition brief that discuss those exhibits.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records,
protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made. Such an arrangement ‘is
entirely inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551
and the constitutional values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Given these rules, the Court
finds that the People’s motion should be granted because:
 
* the
motion is unopposed;
 
*
Plaintiff only seeks to seal exhibits G through R, W, and Y and the parts of the opposition brief that address exhibits
G through R, W, and Y;
 
* exhibits G through R, W, and Y
are covered by a protective order in a multidistrict-litigation action pending
in Ohio (see Smith Decl., ¶¶ 2, 6-7);
 
* an
overriding interest exists in keeping the exhibits and corresponding
opposition-brief pages confidential;
 
* the
overriding interest supports sealing the exhibits and corresponding
opposition-brief pages;
 
*
there is a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the motion is denied; and
 
* the
sealing is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to protect the
overriding interest.
