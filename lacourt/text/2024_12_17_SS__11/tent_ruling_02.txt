[1]
Plaintiff makes another convincing argument in footnote 5:
 
Even if the
People were requiring PBMs to cover non-opioid drugs or treatment on their
formularies, which they are not, that is not the same as requiring plans
to cover non-opioid drugs or treatment. The People allege that PBMs design
formularies and choose which drugs appear on those formularies and what limits
to impose on drug utilization. Those formularies are then offered to health
insurers and payors. While many health insurers and payors adopt PBM’s standard
formulary offerings into their plans (ERISA and non-ERISA), giving PBMs
significant influence over which drugs are disseminated, [citation], it is
their decision whether to adopt the PBMs’ proposed formulary. [Citations.]
 
(Opposition,
pp. 5-6 n.5, emphasis in original.)

The SAC alleges additional theories. 
(See, e.g., id. at ¶ 281 [alleging that Defendants “assist[ed] in
promoting but fail[ed] to disclose the real risks and appropriate limits on the
use of opioids, fail[ed] to use the wealth of data available to them to
identify and address signs of over-prescribing, illegitimate and dangerous use
of opioids, misuse, abuse, and diversion, and fail[ed] to maintain effective
controls against diversion in the operation of their mail order pharmacies”];
see also id. at ¶ 292 [same].) 


[3]
Plaintiff claims the collusion is hidden from regulators.  Plaintiff should amend to allege a specific
nondisclosure/deception allegation.  This
is discussed further in the safe-harbor section.

“USP” means United States Pharmacopeia.

If Plaintiff tries to renege in the future, the Court would be inclined to
enforce the disclaimer.  Judicial
estoppel would be a potential basis for enforcement.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on UHG and the OptumInsight Defendants’ motion to quash is
continued.  
 
Plaintiff’s request for a discovery continuance is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants are Pharmacy Benefit Managers
(“PBMs”).  They “administer
prescription-drug benefits for health-plan sponsors, including employers,
government entities, and unions.”  [Citation.]  “When a beneficiary of a
prescription-drug plan goes to a pharmacy to fill a prescription, the pharmacy
checks with a PBM to determine that person’s coverage and copayment
information.”  [Citation.]  “[T]he PBM [then] reimburses the pharmacy for
the prescription, less the amount of the beneficiary’s copayment.”  [Citation.] 
“The prescription-drug plan, in turn, reimburses the PBM.”  [Citation.]
 
Plaintiff sued Defendants for their alleged
contributions to the opioid crisis. 
Plaintiff claims Defendants created a public nuisance.
 
(7/18/24 Ruling Re: Motion to Stay Pending
Appeal, p. 1.)  
 
Here, UHG and the OptumInsight Defendants move to quash for
lack of personal jurisdiction.
 
LAW
 
There are “two types of personal
jurisdiction[,]” general and specific.  (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. v. Superior Court (2017) 582 U.S. 255, 262 (“BMS”).)  Plaintiff only relies on specific
jurisdiction. 
 
“When
determining whether specific jurisdiction exists, courts consider the
‘relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’” (Halyard Health, Inc. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1062,
1070.)  “[C]ourts focus on the nature and
quality (not the quantity) of defendant’s activity in the forum state.”  (Edmond & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 3:240.) “[S]ingle
or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state” may be adequate as long
as the lawsuit relates to the “in-state activity.”  (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014) 571 U.S. 117,
127; see also Edmond & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:240.1 [same].)
 
To exercise
specific jurisdiction, a court must find purposeful availment (the defendant made
purposeful contacts with the forum), relatedness (the litigation arises out of
or relates to the defendant’s forum contacts), and reasonableness (the forum’s “assertion”
of specific jurisdiction “comport[s] with ‘fair play and substantial justice’”).
(Halyard Health, supra,
43 Cal.App.4th at 1070.)
 
Plaintiff bears the initial burden to
establish specific jurisdiction. (See Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods,
Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 449.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Allegations
 
UHG and the OptumInsight Defendants challenge
Plaintiff’s allegations.  They claim the
complaint lumps UHG and its subsidiaries together and refers to the
OptumInsight Defendants as a single entity. 
(See Motion, pp. 9-19; see also Reply, pp. 6-7.)
 
Plaintiff argues that group pleading is
permissible and that, prior to discovery, entity-by-entity allegations are not
required.  (See Opposition, pp. 3-5.)
 
The Court finds that the allegations fail to
satisfy Plaintiff’s burden.  “Jurisdictional
facts must be proved by admissible evidence.” 
(Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:387.)  “This generally requires documentary evidence
and declarations by competent witnesses.” 
(Ibid.)  “A properly verified
complaint may be treated as a declaration for this purpose.”  (Ibid.) 
“However, a pleading verified on behalf of a corporation has
no evidentiary weight.”  (Ibid., emphasis
in original.)  Similarly, “[a]n
unverified pleading has no evidentiary value in determining personal
jurisdiction.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:388, emphasis
in original.)  Plaintiff’s complaint is
unverified.  (See Motion, p. 11.)
 
Purposeful Availment and Relatedness
 
“The purposeful availment inquiry . . . focuses
on the defendant's intentionality.”  (Pavlovich
v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 269.)  “This prong is only satisfied when the
defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs his activities toward the forum
so that he should expect, by virtue of the benefit he receives, to be subject
to the court’s jurisdiction based on his contacts with the forum.”  (Ibid.)
 
For the relatedness prong, “‘the suit’
must ‘aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant’s contacts with the
forum.’”  (BMS, supra, 582 U.S. at
262.)  “In other words, there must be ‘an
affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an]
activity or occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore
subject to the State’s regulation.’” 
(Id.)
 
UHG and the
OptumInsight Defendants contend engagement in nationwide business is not enough
to demonstrate purposeful availment and relatedness.  (See Motion, pp. 12, 13; see also Reply, pp.
5, 8, 11-12.)
 
Plaintiff
asserts that “UHG purposefully directed its subsidiaries, including its
California subsidiary OptumRx, [Inc. (‘OptumRx’)] to engage in the conduct
alleged in the Complaint and, in doing so, purposefully directed its activities
to California.”  (Opposition, p. 10.)
 
As to
relatedness, the People claim UHG controlled “OptumRx with regard to policies,
such as the ‘aligned’ formulary and opioid utilization options in 2018” and
“spearhead[ed] the Optum Defendants’ response to the opioid epidemic in
2016[.]”  (Id. at p. 11.) 
 
The Court
agrees with UHG and the OptumInsight Defendants.  The People fail to meet their burden for two
reasons.  One, “neither ownership nor
control of a subsidiary corporation by a foreign parent corporation, without
more, subjects the parent to the jurisdiction of the state where the subsidiary
does business.”  (SK Trading
International Co. Ltd. v. Superior Court (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th
378, 388.)[1]  Two, the cited exhibits do not suffice:
 
* Exhibit V –
a website page from www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  It says Andrew Witty was named UHG’s vice
president and “Optum[’s]” chief executive officer in March 2018.  (Smith Decl., Ex. V; see also Opposition, p.
10.)  The statement does not demonstrate
UHG conduct directed at California, and it does not suffice to establish
alter-ego liability.
 
* Exhibit W –
slides from a November 2018 UHG presentation. 
The slides concern OptumRx and non-party UnitedHealthcare, Inc. but do
not mention California or, particularly, UHG conduct targeting California.  (See Smith Decl., Ex. W, pp.
0000262099-0000262104; see also Opposition, p. 11; Reply, p. 10.)
 
* Exhibit X –
another website page from www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  The page is dated August 1, 2019 and states
that UHG “is addressing the [opioid] crisis” by “applying and coordinating
capabilities, data and efforts across our companies[.]”  (Smith Decl., Ex. X, p. 1; see also
Opposition, p. 11.)  It is a generic
statement and says nothing about California. 
(See Reply, p. 10.)
 
* Exhibit Y –
slides from a November 2016 UHG program titled “Opioid Epidemic Task
Force.”  One of the slides lists six
goals that UHG hoped to implement via “a coordinated enterprise initiative” to
combat the opioid crisis.  (Smith Decl.,
Ex. Y, p. 0000428897; see also Opposition, p. 11.)  California is not discussed, and it does not
show control.  (See Reply, p. 10.)
 
Turning to
the OptumInsight Defendants, Plaintiff contends they “partnered with ‘opioid
manufacturers to convince prescribers, patients, and the public, including
in the County, that opioids were appropriate for long term use for the
treatment of chronic pain conditions and were not addictive.’”  (Opposition, p. 6, emphasis in
original.)  Plaintiff alleges that the
OptumInsight Defendants “performed these services in California and in the
County of Los Angeles.”  (Ibid.)
 
In support,
the People cite exhibits G, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, and U (see id. at pp.
7-9):
 
* Exhibit G –
a February 2012 “Statement of Work” between Purdue Pharma L.P. (“Purdue”) and
QualityMetric Inc. (“QM”).  Plaintiff
claims QM is OILS’s former name.  The
People contend the purpose of the agreement was for QM “to develop evidence to
support” “Purdue’s marketing of OxyCotin, which was nationwide and included
California.”  (Id. at p. 8.)  Nationwide conduct fails to prove purposeful
availment (see Reply, pp. 11-12), and there is no reference to California in
the cited pages.  (See Smith Decl., Ex.
G, pp. A-2 – A-3.)
 
* Exhibit K –
a December 2002 memo from Purdue concerning Ingenix Medical Education
(“Ingenix”).  According to Plaintiff, OI
used to be known as Ingenix.  The memo
states that Ingenix had a meeting with Purdue about a “chronic pain management
proposal[.]”  (Id. at Ex. K, p.
035000016492.)  Plaintiff does not
pinpoint a page addressing California, and, again, nationwide conduct, alone,
does not suffice.
 
* Exhibit L –
the December 2002 “Chronic Pain Management” proposal.  (See id. at Ex. L.)  Same analysis as exhibit K.
 
* Exhibit M –
a March 2003 “Utilization Characteristics of Long-Acting Opioids” proposal by
Ingenix for Purdue.  (See id. at Ex.
M.)  Same analysis as exhibit K.
 
* Exhibit N –
the November 2003 “Utilization Characteristics of Long-Acting Opioids” final
report.  (See id. at Ex. N.)  Same analysis as exhibit K.
 
* Exhibit O –
an October 2003 memo from Raafat Seifeldin to Patti Grossman.  Plaintiff does not identify the entity these
people worked for.  (See Opposition, p.
7.)  The memo purportedly shows that an
Ingenix “study abstract and manuscript” pertaining to the November 2003 final
report “was accepted for presentation in medical journals with nationwide
circulation[.]”  (Ibid.; see also Smith
Decl., Ex. O, p. 029000104870.)  Same
analysis as exhibit K.
 
* Exhibit P –
slides from an Ingenix presentation in 2000. 
The fourth slide lists “Marketing Services” as one of the services
Ingenix provided, and the sixth slide states that Ingenix had “[u]niquely
strong investigative sites in Los Angeles and London[.]”  (Smith Decl., Ex. P, slides 4, 6.)  Slides 28 through 38 detail a “Pain
Management Study” proposal for Purdue (see id. at Ex. P, slides 28-38), yet
Plaintiff fails to show that Ingenix actually did the study or that the study
was connected to California.  Plaintiff
also fails to show that the Los Angeles investigative site relates to this
case.  (See Reply, p. 12.)[2]
 
* Exhibit Q –
an October 2004 “Project Specification Order” between a company called i3
Research and Purdue.  (See Smith Decl.,
Ex. Q.)  Allegedly, i3 Research was a
division of Ingenix.  (See Opposition, p.
9.)  The document is unsigned, and
Plaintiff “does not establish that any work was performed, let alone that the
work both occurred in California” and related to the People’s claims.  (Reply, p. 13.)  Same analysis as exhibit P. 
 
* Exhibit R –
an August 2004 i3 Research proposal to Purdue. 
The proposal notes that many “phase I studies” had been conducted at i3
Research locations in either Glendale, California or London.  (See Smith Decl., Ex. R, p.
031000021495.)  Plaintiff has not
demonstrated that OI or OILS is liable for i3 Research or that that phase I
studies are related.  (See Reply, p.
13.)  Same analysis as exhibit P.
 
* Exhibits S,
T, and U – July 2024 LinkedIn profiles (exhibit S), a website page from www.indeed.com (exhibit T), and a March 2017
Drum and Bradstreet report.  Plaintiff
contends these exhibits prove that Ingenix, OI, and OILS had and/or have
locations and employees in California. 
(See Opposition, p. 9.)  What is
missing, though, is “evidence showing that those employees conducted any work
in California that has any substantial connection to . . . this
litigation.”  (Reply, p. 13.)
 
Ultimately,
while some of the exhibits arguably show purposeful availment (regarding the
OptumInsight Defendants, at least), they do not show relatedness.
 
Reasonableness
 
“Finally, it must appear that the
exercise of jurisdiction by local courts in the particular case would ‘comport
with fair play and substantial justice.’” 
(Edmond & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:244.)  “The burdens on the nonresident must clearly
outweigh the plaintiff’s and forum’s interests.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:247.)
 
The burden of
proof belongs to the defendant: “If plaintiff shows that the nonresident
defendant has ‘purposefully availed’ itself of benefits and protections of
forum law, that defendant bears the burden of proving it would be unreasonable
for local courts to exercise jurisdiction.” 
(Id. at ¶ 3:255.)
 
For now, it
is unnecessary to analyze this prong. 
UGH and the OptumInsight Defendants’ burden to show unreasonableness
does not arise unless and until Plaintiff shows purposeful availment and
relatedness. 
 
Jurisdictional
Discovery
 
Plaintiff
requests a discovery continuance.  (See
Opposition, pp. 13-14.)
 
UHG and the
Optum Defendants argue that a discovery continuance would be futile.  (See Reply, pp. 13-14 [claiming Plaintiff
does not demonstrate that discovery would reveal additional, related California
contacts].)
 
The Court believes Plaintiff’s request
should be granted.  A plaintiff is entitled to propound jurisdictional
discovery before a motion to quash is decided. 
(See In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I & II (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 100, 127 [instructing that “[a] plaintiff attempting to
assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is entitled to an
opportunity to conduct discovery of the jurisdictional facts necessary to
sustain its burden of proof”]; see also See Edmond & Karnow, supra, at ¶
3:380 [same].)
