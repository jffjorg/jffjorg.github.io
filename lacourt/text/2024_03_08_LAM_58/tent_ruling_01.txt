Department 58

Hearing Date:             March 8,
2024
Case Name:                Moreno
et al. v. Zuniga et al.
Case No.:                    23STCV15473
Motion:                       Petition
to Approve Compromise of Pending Action on Behalf of a Minor 
Moving Party:             Plaintiff
Simona Moreno
Opposing Party:          None

Tentative Ruling:      The
petition to approve compromise of pending action on behalf of a minor is granted.


             
            This is a habitability case. Plaintiffs Simona Moreno, Rufino Bravo
Santiago, Elizabeth Bravo, Maurico Alexander Bravo, and Patrick Bravo (a minor)
sued Defendant Maria Zuniga for (1.) negligence, (2.) breach of implied warranty
of habitability, and (3.) breach of Los Angeles Municipal Code section 45.33. 
            
            Plaintiffs have settled the case
with Defendant for $100,000. Plaintiffs now seek
approval of a compromise of a claim on behalf of minor, Plaintiff Patrick Bravo. 
 
Discussion
 
            Court approval is
required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) California Rules of Court, rule 7.950
provides that a petition “must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise.” The Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form
MC-350 and must be fully completed. 
 
            The Petition is properly filed on the Judicial Council form
and is verified. Plaintiff/Petitioner has also submitted the requisite
attachments with the Petition.  
            
            Of
the $100,000 in settlement funds, $5,000 will be allocated to minor Plaintiff, Patrick Bravo, while Plaintiffs Simona Moreno and Rufina Bravo Santiago
will each receive $42,500, and Plaintiffs Elizabeth Bravo and Maurico Alexander
Bravo will each receive $5,000. This amount compensates Patrick Bravo for his emotional
injuries suffered from the uninhabitable living conditions, which are less than
certain other adult Plaintiffs who also suffered property damage and rent
abatement. (Attachment 11b(3)-(6).)  
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel does not seek any attorney fees. (See Pet., ¶ 13.) 
Plaintiffs
have satisfied all of the procedural and substantive requirements.
Therefore, the petition is granted.
