And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Torie Fuller. The court also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,390. The court orders plaintiff to attend and testify at an in-person deposition on or before February 1, 2025, and to pay the sanctions within 30 days. The court finds that the plaintiff has refused to attend deposition, despite multiple attempts by the defendant to schedule a deposition. The court also notes that the plaintiff's counsel is absent on maternity leave, which may have caused the delay in the deposition. However, the court finds that the defendant has made a good faith effort to resolve the issue prior to filing the motion, and therefore grants the motion.
