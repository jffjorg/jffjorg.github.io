And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to conditionally seal documents submitted in response to the defendant's motion to lift stay and for leave to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff, Eric Kaufman, is seeking declaratory relief and a judicial declaration that certain provisions of the member agreements between him and the defendants are void and unenforceable. The member agreements include nonsolicitation covenants, Missouri choice of law and forum selection clauses, and notice requirements. The plaintiff argues that these provisions violate Business and Professions Code Sections 16600 and California public policy. The court notes that the documents submitted under seal contain information designated as "Confidential" by the defendants and that the federal protective order directs the parties to file such documents under seal in this California state court action. Since no opposition has been filed disputing the sealing of the documents, the court grants the plaintiff's motion.
