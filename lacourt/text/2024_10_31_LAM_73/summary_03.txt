And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Rolf Treu has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by 600 Tower, LLC to deem matters admitted and seek sanctions against Plaintiff Anthony Flores. The motion is based on the defendant's request for admissions, which were served on the plaintiff on September 30, 2024. The plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admissions, and the defendant argued that this failure was without substantial justification and necessitated the filing of a motion to compel a response and seek sanctions.

However, the plaintiff's counsel has provided a declaration stating that they were under the mistaken impression that objections had been served by prior counsel to the requests for admission, and that they did not realize they were required to respond. The plaintiff ultimately served responses to the requests for admission on October 9, 2024, without objections.

The court finds that the motion to deem matters admitted is moot since the plaintiff has now served responses, and the defendant's request for sanctions is also denied. The court has discretion to hold that a motion to compel is moot when the respondent serves untimely discovery responses after the motion has been filed.
