DEFENDANT 600 TOWER, LLC’S MOTION TO DEEM MATTERS ADMITTED AS TO
PLAINTIFF ANTHONY FLORES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS (filed 09/30/2024)
 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
 
Defendant 600 Tower, LLC’s Motion to Deem Matters Admitted in
Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff is MOOT.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On
June 7, 2023, Plaintiff Anthony Flores filed this action against Defendants 600
Tower, LLC; SBDTLA 1 LLC; SBDTLA 2 LLC; SBDTLA 3 LLC; SBDTLA 4 LLC; Greystar
California Inc.; Lea Kim; Barry Shy; Eric Shy; Rommy Shy; 600 S Spring Owner,
LLC and Does 1-100.
 
The
Complaint alleges causes of action for:
1.     Violation
of CA Civil Code § 1942.4
2.     Tortious Breach of the
Warranty of Habitability
3.    
Private Nuisance
4.     Business
and Professions Code § 17200, et seq.
5.      Negligence
6.     Breach of Covenant of
Quiet Enjoyment
7.     Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress
8.     Violation of Consumer
Legal Remedies Act, CA Civil Code § 1750, et seq.
9.     Violation of Los Angeles
Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance
10. 
False Advertising in Violation of Business and Professions Code §
17500, et seq.
 
Plaintiff
alleges he was a former tenant of 600 S. Spring Street, Apartment PH7, Los
Angeles, California 90014 (“Subject Premises”). Plaintiff further alleges
ongoing deficiencies on the Subject Premises and Defendants failed to make
requested repairs. Plaintiff further alleges Defendants failed to address
Plaintiff’s complaints and Plaintiff was ultimately constructively evicted
given the substandard environment was adversely impacting his health.
 
On September 30, 2024, Defendant 600 Tower, LLC (“Defendant”) filed a Motion to Deem Matters Admitted in Defendant’s Request for
Admissions, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff, arguing:
·       Plaintiff
failed to respond to Request for Admissions, Set One
·       Plaintiff’s failure to respond is without substantial justification and
Defendant has no choice but to seek this court’s intervention to obtain an
order compelling matters deemed admitted to Defendant’s Request for Admissions
and sanctions in the amount of $1,425.00 against Attorney Alex D. Mehdipour and
Plaintiff Anthony Flores as the result of incurring unnecessary legal fees and
costs.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that:
·       On March 28,
2024, Defendant 600 Tower, LLC served Plaintiff with Requests for Admissions,
Set One. 
·       On or about
May 28, 2024, a Substitution of Attorney was filed with the Court substituting
in Plaintiff’s current counsel of record. When current counsel substituted in
as counsel of record, counsel was under the mistaken impression that objections
had been served by prior counsel to the Requests for Admissions at issue.
·       On September
30, 2024, Defendant served the instant Motion without ever bothering to call or
email Plaintiff’s counsel. 
·       Plaintiff
served responses to Defendant’s Set One Requests for Admissions without
objections on October 9, 2024, effectively rendering the present Motion moot. 
In reply, Defendant argues that:
·      
Plaintiff’s responses do not comply with
Section 2033.220. 
·      
Sanctions are reasonable.
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.    
Legal Standard
 
When a party fails to
serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the
request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted.
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely
response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
B.    
Discussion
 
On September
30, 2024, Defendant 660 Tower, LLC served the instant Motion to Deem Matters
Admitted in Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One, Propounded on
Plaintiff.
 
On October 9,
2024, Plaintiff served responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One, without
objections. (Mehdipour Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. C.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states that on or about May 28, 2024, a Substitution of
Attorney was filed with the Court substituting in Plaintiff’s current counsel
of record. (Mehdipour Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) When
current counsel substituted in as counsel of record, counsel was under the mistaken
impression that objections had been served by prior counsel to the Requests for
Admissions at issue. (Mehdipour Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.)
Since
Plaintiff has served responses, the Court finds the instant motion to deem
matters admitted is moot. When respondents serve untimely discovery responses after parties
have filed motions to compel initial responses, courts have broad discretion as
to the ruling and may hold that the motion is moot. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., v. Klugman (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.) Since
the motion is moot, the Court does not award sanctions. 
 
Thus, the Court finds Defendant 600
Tower, LLC’s Motion to Deem Matters Admitted in Defendant’s Request for
Admissions, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff is MOOT. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Defendant 600 Tower, LLC’s Motion to Deem Matters Admitted in
Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff is MOOT.
