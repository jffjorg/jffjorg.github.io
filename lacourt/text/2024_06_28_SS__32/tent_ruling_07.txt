TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


June
  28, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


23STCV01948




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Dismiss the Trial Date, or in the alternative, Vacate the Trial Date 




MOVING PARTY:


Defendants Housing Partnership Network,
  Inc. and 6218 Compton LLC 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Chinenye Prince Ugorji 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff Chinenye Prince Ugorji (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Vanessa Boyle, 6218 Compton LLC, and Does
1 to 50 for injuries related to a dog bite. 
 
Plaintiff passed away on October 13, 2023. (Moloney Decl. ¶ 9, Exh.
E.) 
 
Defendants Housing Partnership Network, Inc. and 6218 Compton LLC
(“Defendants”) now move to either dismiss the Complaint or vacate the current
July 15, 2024 final status conference and July 29, 2024 trial date pursuant to
the Court’s authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 128. 
 
Plaintiff has filed an opposition asking that the Court vacate the
current trial date. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A court has the power to provide for the orderly conduct of
proceedings before it and to amend or control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(3), (8).) 
 
            Defendants contend that on January 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed
them that Plaintiff had passed away. The Certificate of Death provided to
Defendants shows that Plaintiff passed away on October 13, 2023.
(Moloney Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. E.) At the time, Plaintiff’s counsel asserted that
Plaintiff’s sister would likely be the successor in interest. (Id. ¶ 5.)
Defendants have filed the instant motion because Plaintiff’s counsel has not
provided any update on the successor in interest, and trial is currently
scheduled for July 29, 2024. Defendants provide no other basis for the Court to
dismiss the action, other than Code of Civil Procedure section 128, and the
argument that no substitution of plaintiff has been made.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff requests
that the trial date be vacated in order for the intended successor in interest,
Plaintiff’s sister, to be appointed. The Court notes that Plaintiff filed a
motion to appoint a successor in interest on June 7, 2024, currently set to be
heard on July 15, 2024. Defendants have not filed a reply to the instant
motion. 
 
Therefore, seeing as a motion to appoint a successor in interest has
now been filed, the Court denies the request to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint.
However, because the motion to appoint the successor in interest will be heard
close to the trial date, the Court continues the trial.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion is DENIED.
 
The Final Status Conference is continued from July 15, 2024 to November
5, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Trial is continued from July 29, 2024 to November 19, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
All discovery deadlines are associated with the new trial date.
 
To the extent good cause exists to further continue the trial date,
the parties shall first meet and confer and attempt to reach a stipulation. 
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
