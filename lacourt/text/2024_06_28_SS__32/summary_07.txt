And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV01948, which deals with a motion filed by the defendants to dismiss or vacate the trial date. The defendants argue that the plaintiff, Chinenye Prince Ugorji, died on October 13, 2023, and that no update has been provided on the successor in interest. The plaintiff's opposition requests that the trial date be vacated in order for the intended successor in interest, the plaintiff's sister, to be appointed.

The judge denied the request to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, but continued the trial date due to the pending motion to appoint the successor in interest. The final status conference is continued to November 5, 2024, and the trial is continued to November 19, 2024. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to resolve the matter before the hearing.
