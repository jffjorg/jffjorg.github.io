Plaintiff’s opposition only refers to Township Retail Services, Incorporated as
moving for summary judgment. However, this omission was not discussed by
Defendants in reply. 


[2] Defendants
do not discuss whether the role of Township Retail Services, Incorporated
(responsible for janitorial services at the premises) and Del Amo Fashion
Center Operating Company, LLC (owner of the premises) affects the duty
analysis. Instead, their motion appears to treat them as equal in the premises
liability/negligence analysis. Nevertheless, it appears Township Retail
Services, Incorporated controlled the property since Defendants set forth that
it managed and controlled the daily oversight of the maintenance and cleaning
of the premises. (See UMF 14.) 


[3] In
Defendants’ Reply to Plaintiff’s separate statement, Defendants state that “Jose
Duarte” was tasked with several responsibilities and walked through Zone 6 on
the date in question.” (Def. Resp. to Pl. Sep. St. 27.) Jose Mendez testified
that he did “go through Zone 6 where the incident occurred,” but no evidence
has been identified that indicates what time. (Mendez Depo. 34:6-8.)
