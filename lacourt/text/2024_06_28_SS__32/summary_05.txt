And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for additional sanctions filed by the Defendant City of Carson. The motion was opposed by the Plaintiff Larry Finley, who claims that the monetary sanctions imposed by the Court's previous order have since been paid. The Court finds that the Defendant has not complied with the safe harbor period required by Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, and therefore, the motion for additional sanctions is denied. Additionally, the Court declines to award further monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5, as this was not included in the Notice of Motion. The Defendant is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
