The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Shiki Seafood Buffet's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Lashabra Johnson's experts, Andrew S. Morris, D.C. and Alex J. Balian. The motion is granted in part because Plaintiff failed to produce the required documents, despite a meet and confer requirement. The Court also awards Defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $760.00 against Plaintiff and her counsel of record. The parties are to meet and confer to schedule the deposition and produce all requested documents. The ruling is subject to change if the parties do not submit on the tentative ruling.
