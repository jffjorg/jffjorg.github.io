And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Township Retail Services, Inc. and Del Amo Fashion Center Operating Company, LLC, and has determined that there is a triable issue of fact regarding constructive notice. Specifically, the court finds that there is a window of approximately 1.5 hours between the last inspection and the incident, which creates a triable issue of fact regarding whether the defendants had constructive notice of the dangerous condition.

The court has also considered the evidence presented by both parties, including the testimony of Jose Mendez, who was assigned to Zone 4 on the day of the incident, and Rosa Hernandez, who was responsible for Zone 6. The court finds that the testimony of these witnesses creates a triable issue of fact regarding the defendants' knowledge of the condition of the premises.

Based on the foregoing, the court denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and orders that the case proceed to trial.
