**Significant Statements**

"The purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute."
"A voluntary dismissal is presumed to be a favorable termination on the merits unless proved otherwise to a jury because the natural assumption is that one does not simply abandon a meritorious action."
"The Court concludes that Defendant has established that there is no triable fact of fact as to the sole issue on the Motion, which is that the voluntary dismissal of the Malpractice Claim was based on technical grounds, i.e. the mediation privilege and the statute of limitations, and it does not constitute a favorable termination because it does not reflect on the substantive merits of the underlying claim."
```
Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Keiko Shimada and has concluded that the voluntary dismissal of the Malpractice Action against Plaintiff Brian S. Detrick was based on technical grounds, specifically the mediation privilege and the statute of limitations. The judge has determined that this dismissal does not constitute a favorable termination because it does not reflect on the substantive merits of the underlying claim. Therefore, the judge has granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment and has ordered Plaintiff to file a proposed form of judgment within 10 days.
