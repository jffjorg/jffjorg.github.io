MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

MOVING PARTY: Defendant
KEIKO SHIMADA (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
BRIAN S. DETRICK (“Plaintiff”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving and opposition papers.  No reply has been filed.  Any reply was required to have been filed and
served at least five court days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
This
is an action for malicious prosecution initiated by Plaintiff against Defendant
on October 20, 2022.  The action stems
from a fraud and legal/professional malpractice case filed by Defendant against
Plaintiff on December 12, 2019 under LASC Case No. 19STCV44832 (“Malpractice
Action”).  (Defendant’s Separate
Statement in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment [“UMF”] 1-3.) 
 
            On May 6, 2024, Defendant filed the
present Motion for Summary Judgment (the “Motion”).  Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion
on November 7, 2024, which the Court deems as timely filed.  (11/14/2024 Order.)  No reply has been filed.
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS 
             Plaintiff objects to the entirety of the declaration
of Defendant (“Shimada Decl.”) on the ground that Defendant has represented
that she can only speak and read Japanese, as supported by a letter from
Defendant’s counsel and a Notice of Request for Interpreter.  (Declaration of Brian S. Detrick [“Detrick
Decl.”], ¶¶ 34-36, Exhs. G and H.)  Plaintiff
has submitted no authority for the contention that such an attestation is
required in the case of a writing as opposed to testimony.  The Court finds that no attestation under
oath by an interpreter pursuant to Evid. Code § 751 is required in the case of
the Shimada Decl.  On this and the other
grounds asserted in Plaintiff’s objections to the Shimada Declaration, those
objections are OVERRULED.
 
            Plaintiff also objects to portions
of the declaration of Defendant’s counsel, Ashleigh W. McCurchin (“McCurchin
Decl.”).  Plaintiff’s objections to the
McCurchin Decl. is OVERRULED as to No. 8, and SUSTAINED as to No. 11 on the
ground of hearsay.  
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Regarding
Defendant’s request for judicial notice of documents pertaining to the case of Shimada
v. Detrick, et al., Case No. 19STCV44832 in the Los Angeles Superior Court
(Exhs. i through iii), the Court takes judicial notice of the records’ existence,
but not of the truth of assertions within. 
(Evid. Code, § 452(c), (d); Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust
Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)  The request is GRANTED as to Exhs. iv and v, although
the request is unnecessary because these documents are matters filed in this
case.
 
DISCUSSION
            The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” 
(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, italics in original and quoting Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.”  (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
“On
a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party
to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material
fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A
defendant moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see
Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc., supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.) 
 
Once
the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff “to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion “shall not rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists
but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Ibid.; see Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Malicious
Prosecution
To
establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution of either a criminal or
civil proceeding, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the prior action: (1) was
commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal
termination in the plaintiff’s favor, (2) was brought without probable cause,
and (3) was initiated with malice.  (Robbins
v. Blecher (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 886, 887–88, citing Eells v.
Rosenblum (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1848.) 

 
            Defendant moves for summary judgment on the ground that there was no
substantive termination of the Malpractice Action on its merits.  Defendant contends that because the
Malpractice Action was not terminated in any manner that reflected on
Plaintiff’s innocence of the alleged misconduct, Plaintiff’s cause of action
for malicious prosecution cannot be supported. 
Thus, the sole issue for determination in this Motion is whether Defendant’s
voluntary dismissal of the Malpractice Action against Plaintiff constituted a
favorable termination as to Plaintiff on the merits for purposes of malicious
prosecution.
 
“To determine ‘whether there was a favorable
termination,’ we ‘look at the judgment as a whole in the prior action ....’
[Citation.] ‘It is not essential to maintenance of an action for malicious
prosecution that the prior proceeding was favorably terminated following trial
on the merits.’ [Citation.]  Rather,
‘[i]n order for the termination of a lawsuit to be considered favorable to the
malicious prosecution plaintiff, the termination must reflect the merits of the
action and the plaintiff’s innocence of the misconduct alleged in the
lawsuit.’”  (Alston v. Dawe (2020)
52 Cal. App. 5th 706, 721–22.)  “A
voluntary dismissal is presumed to be a favorable termination on the merits unless
proved otherwise to a jury because the natural assumption is that one does not
simply abandon a meritorious action.”  (Id.,
citing Olivares v. Pineda (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 343, 354.)
 
“A voluntary dismissal may be an implicit concession
that the dismissing party cannot maintain the action and may constitute a
decision on the merits. [Citations.] ‘It is not enough, however, merely to show
that the proceeding was dismissed.’ [Citation.] The reasons for the dismissal
of the action must be examined to determine whether the termination reflected
on the merits.” (Eells v. Rosenblum, 36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1854–1855; Camarena
v. Sequoia Ins. Co. (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1089, 1099–1100.)  A voluntary dismissal on technical grounds,
such as lack of jurisdiction, laches, the statute of limitations or
prematurity, does not constitute a favorable termination because it does not
reflect on the substantive merits of the underlying claim.  (Eells v. Rosenblum, supra, 36
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1855–1856; Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 857, 882; Sierra Club v. Superior Court (1985) 168
Cal.App.3d 1138, 1144; Stanley v. Superior Court (1982) 130 Cal.App.3d
460, 465.)
 
To support of its Motion, Defendant submits a letter
dated September 21, 2020 by Stephen R. Rykoff (the “Rykoff Letter”), who was
representing Plaintiff in the Malpractice Action, addressed to Michael R. Rhames,
counsel for Defendant in the Malpractice Action.  (UMF 7.) 
The Rykoff Letter notified Defendant of Plaintiff’s intent to file a
demurrer to the complaint in the Malpractice Action and outlined two grounds on
the basis of which Plaintiff intended to file the demurrer, namely the running
of the statute of limitations and the mediation privilege.  (UMF 8-9.) 

 
Specifically, the Rykoff Letter advised Defendant
that “[t]he rule of mediation confidentiality effectively shields an attorney’s
actions during mediation, including advising the client even if the advice
is incompetent or even deceptive. (Wimsett v. Superior Court (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 137, 152, Cassel v. Superior Court (2011) 51
Cal.4th 113.) (Shimada Decl., Exh. “A,” p. 1 (emphasis
added.).)  The Rykoff Letter further
stated: “Mr. Nakahara [Defendant’s attorney in the Malpractice Action]
discovered the alleged fraud no later than July 11, 2o16.  The statute of limitations based on discovery
for both fraud and legal malpractice commenced no later than July 11,
2016.  The statute of limitations for
both of these causes of action had run prior to the date that the Complaint was
filed on December 12, 2019.”  (Shimada
Decl., Exh. “A,” p. 2.)
 
The Rykoff letter specifically included a “MALICIOUS
PROSECUTION WARNING,” and demanded that the complaint be dismissed with
prejudice.  (UMF 10-12.)  Defendant declares that “on the advice of
counsel,” Defendant filed a Request for Dismissal with prejudice of the complaint
in the Malpractice Action which was entered on October 23, 2020.  (UMF 13; RJN Exh. ii.)  
 
The Court concludes that Defendant has
established that there is no triable fact of fact as to the sole issue on the
Motion, which is that the voluntary
dismissal of the Malpractice Claim was based on technical grounds, i.e. the
mediation privilege and the statute of limitations, and it does not constitute
a favorable termination because it does not reflect on the substantive merits
of the underlying claim.
 
Defendant
has thus met the initial burden of demonstrating that she is entitled to
judgment. Plaintiff has not met his burden to raise a triable issue of material
fact.
 
Accordingly,
the Motion is GRANTED.  Defendant has ten
days to serve a proposed form of Judgment. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.    
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing,
the motion will be placed off calendar.
