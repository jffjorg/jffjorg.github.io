```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel defendant Rockley Photonics, Inc. to provide further responses to plaintiff Melissa Ziebell's form interrogatories. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's responses were evasive and solely intended to prevent her from obtaining directly relevant information. The defendant, on the other hand, claims that the form interrogatory is excessively overbroad and seeks irrelevant information.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the form interrogatory is overly broad and has no direct bearing on the plaintiff's allegations. However, the judge finds that overbreadth alone is an insufficient ground for completely objecting to and not responding to a form interrogatory. As such, the motion is granted insofar as it relates to any civil action filed by any of the defendant's former employees for the past 10 years relating to their employment with the defendant arising from wage discrimination based on gender.

The defendant is ordered to serve supplemental, verified, and Code-compliant further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 209.2 within 20 days of the date of this order.
