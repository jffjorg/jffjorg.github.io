And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court notes that the plaintiffs claim they delivered a vehicle to the defendant's authorized repair facility on or around September 27, 2013, after a front right tire blew out. However, the defendant failed to raise this point in its initial papers and did not provide any evidence regarding the date of delivery. The court agrees with the reasoning set forth in the case of Dhital and finds it persuasive.
