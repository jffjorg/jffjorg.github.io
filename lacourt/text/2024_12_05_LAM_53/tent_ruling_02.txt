[1] The
court notes that Plaintiffs allege that they delivered the subject vehicle to
Defendant’s authorized repair facility on or about September 27, 2013, after
the front right tire blew out, which suggests that tender of delivery was made
at least as of September 27, 2013. 
(Compl., ¶ 51.)  However,
Defendant did not raise this point in its moving papers and, as set forth
above, did not present any other evidence regarding the date of tender of
delivery. 


[2] The
court finds that the reasoning set forth in Dhital is persuasive.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 8.1115, subd. (e)(1)
[“Pending review and filing of the Supreme Court’s opinion, unless otherwise
ordered by the Supreme Court under (3), a published opinion of a Court of Appeal
in the matter has no binding or precedential effect, and may be cited for
potentially persuasive value only”].)
