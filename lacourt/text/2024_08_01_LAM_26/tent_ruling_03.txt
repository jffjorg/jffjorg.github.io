Here,
Plaintiff submitted the declaration of Tran Van Tinh, the founder
of IMM Group. (Tinh Decl., ¶ 2.) Tinh provided a
summary of the case, attached the parties’ Finder’s Fee Agreement, attached an invoice
showing the payment due in the amount of $40,000 and a letter that was sent to
Defendant notifying them of their outstanding payment due. Plaintiff also
submitted the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Stephen Koehler, stating that
Plaintiff calculated the prejudgment interest at 10% per annum from April 11,
2023. (Koehler Decl., p. 1) Thus, Plaintiff claims $4,131.51 in pre-judgment
interest.
 
However,
the Court notes that Plaintiff has not explained how Plaintiff calculated its attorney’s
fees in the amount of $17,685 or costs in the amount of $ 1,379.94. Since
Plaintiff has not provided a basis for its attorneys fees and costs, the Court
will not grant Plaintiff’s request.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is DENIED.
