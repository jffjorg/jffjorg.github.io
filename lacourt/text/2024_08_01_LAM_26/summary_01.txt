And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion to reinstate their jury demand. The plaintiffs had previously waived their right to a jury trial, but argue that the waiver was inadvertent and that they should be allowed to reinstate their demand. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' motion is timely and that the defendants will not be prejudiced by the reinstatement of the jury demand. The judge notes that the defendants were on notice since November 29, 2022 that the case was scheduled for a jury trial, and that they will have over two months to prepare for the trial even after the hearing of this motion.

The judge also grants the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the dismissal of the Doe defendants. The plaintiffs argue that the dismissal was based on their and their counsel's inadvertence, and that they should be allowed to add the bond company, SureTec Insurance Company, as a party to the action. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' inadvertence is a proper ground for relief and that no opposition has been filed to this motion.
