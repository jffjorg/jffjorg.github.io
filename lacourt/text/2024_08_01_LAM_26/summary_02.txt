And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, IMM Group Company LLP, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Hollywood International Regional Center, LLC, alleging causes of action for account and breach of contract. The plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to pay amounts owed under a contract and invoiced the defendant on April 11, 2023, in the amount of $40,000. The plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment on April 24, 2024, seeking judgment against the defendant in the total amount of $63,196.45.

The court notes that the plaintiff has not explained how it calculated its attorney's fees in the amount of $17,685 or costs in the amount of $1,379.94. Since the plaintiff has not provided a basis for its attorney's fees and costs, the court will not grant the plaintiff's request. Therefore, the plaintiff's request for default judgment is denied.
