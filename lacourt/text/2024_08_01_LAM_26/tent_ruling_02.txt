TENTATIVE RULING

Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to reinstate jury demand. 
 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate dismissal of Doe Defendants. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 12, 2021, Plaintiffs Joelle Birnberg
and Alex Braunstein filed this action against Defendants Craftscape Creations,
LLC, Allen Abraham, and Does 1-10. Plaintiffs allege causes of action for: 
1.    
Breach of Contract,
2.    
Negligence,
3.    
Trespass, and 
4.    
Money Had and Received.
 
The
Complaint alleges the parties entered into an agreement for the performance of
landscape work on Plaintiff’s property. Plaintiff alleges there were several
problems with Defendants’ landscape work and Plaintiff had to hire contractors
to repair the damage to the property caused by Defendants’ workers and to
finish the work. 
 
On January 3, 2024, All Doe and
Roe Defendants in this action were dismissed without prejudice. 
 
On January 7, 2024, Plaintiffs served
Hector Esparza, who had been added by Doe Amendment.
 
Defendants Craftscape and Abraham were
dismissed from the action on March 28, 2024.
 
On
July 3, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Reinstate Jury Demand,
arguing:
·      
Plaintiffs move pursuant
to Code of Civil procedure section 631(g), to reinstate their jury demand.
·      
Plaintiffs’
late deposit of jury fees was inadvertent, and Plaintiffs moved promptly to
seek relief once they realized their inadvertence. No prejudice will result to
Defendant because this matter had been scheduled for a jury trial from November
29, 2022, to March 28, 2024, Defendant was served with Plaintiffs’ notice of
posting jury fees on May 7, 2024, and Defendant will have more than two months
to prepare for a jury trial even after the hearing of this motion.
 
Defendant
Hector Esparza filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
Plaintiffs
have waived their right to a jury trial and offer no just basis for the Court
to excuse the behavior which led to that waiver. Furthermore, Plaintiffs’
request for relief will prejudice Defendant Esparza.
 
Plaintiffs filed a reply, arguing:
·      
First, Plaintiff asserts Defendant’s opposition was untimely and
should be disregarded. 
·      
In Defendant’s opposition he merely makes conclusory statements
that Defendant would be prejudiced, Defendant has failed to make any actual
showing of prejudice. See e.g. Johnson-Stovall v. Superior Court (1993)
17 Cal.App.4th 808, 811 (requiring “specific” showing of prejudice). 
o  
In Johnson-Stovall, the Court gave notice to the plaintiff
that he had waived jury fees and the plaintiff acted upon this notice. Here,
Plaintiffs did not receive notice of any waiver but posted jury fees on their
own approximately a month after Craftscape’s dismissal when they discovered
Craftscape’s notice was no longer effective.
 
On July 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal of Doe Defendants, arguing:
·      
Plaintiffs move, under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b), this
Court for an order vacating the dismissal without prejudice of unnamed Doe
Defendants that was entered in this case on January 3, 2024. 
·      
Plaintiffs move on the grounds of the mistake and inadvertence of
Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel who did not become aware of Hector Esparza’s
status as a licensed, bonded contractor until very recently and after he was
served with process on January 7, 2024. 
·      
Plaintiffs cannot add the bond company, SureTec Insurance Company,
without an order vacating the dismissal of all Doe Defendants.
 
Defendant did not file an opposition. Plaintiffs did not file a
reply.
 
II.
DISCUSSION 
 
A.     Plaintiffs’
Motion to Reinstate Jury Demand
 
a.     Timeliness of
Opposition
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiffs argue in their
reply that Defendant’s opposition was untimely and should be disregarded. 
 
A court may properly consider
papers that are not timely filed pursuant to CCP section 1005(b) unless
“substantial rights” are affected.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d);
Code Civ. Proc., § 475.)  The appearance of a party at the hearing of a
motion and his or her opposition to the motion on the merits is a waiver of any
procedural defects or irregularities in a motion.  (Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.)
 
Here, the Court moved the hearing date on this motion from June 28, 2024
to July 19, 2024. (Court’s 06/18/24 Minute Order.) The Court stated in its
order that the deadlines for filing opposition and
reply remain governed by the original hearing date. (Ibid.) However,
Defendant filed their opposition on July 3, 2024, past the original deadline. 
 
Although Defendant’s opposition was untimely, the
Court does not find substantial rights were affected. Thus, the Court will
consider the motions on the merits. 
 
b.     Legal Standard
for Motion to Reinstate Jury Demand
 
“The right to a trial by
jury as declared by Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution
shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 631(a).)¿ CCP section 631 provides that “[a]t
least one party demanding a jury on each side of a civil case shall pay a
nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150), unless the fee has been
paid by another party on the same side of the case.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
631(b).)¿ The fee must be paid before the date scheduled for the initial case
management conference in the action.¿ (Id., § 631(c).)¿ A party waives
jury trial by failing to timely pay the fee, unless another party on the same
side of the case has paid that fee.¿ (Id., § 631(f)(5).)¿ 
 
“The court may, in its discretion upon
just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a
trial by jury.”¿ (Id., § 631(g).)¿ “The trial court should grant a
motion for relief of a jury waiver ‘unless, and except, where granting such a
motion would work serious hardship to the objecting party.’”¿ (Mackovska v.
Viewcrest Road Properties LLC (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1, 10 (quoting Boal
v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809).)¿ “When
there is doubt about whether to grant relief from a jury trial waiver, the
court must resolve that doubt in favor of the party seeking a jury trial.”¿ (Id.)¿ 
¿ 
“In a motion for relief from waiver of
a jury trial, the crucial question is whether the party opposing relief will
suffer any prejudice if the court grants relief.”¿ (Mackovska, supra,
40 Cal.App.5th at 10.)¿ “‘‘The prejudice which must be shown from granting
relief from the waiver is prejudice from the granting of relief and not
prejudice from the jury trial.’’”¿ (Id. (quoting Massie v. AAR
Western Skyways, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 405, 411).)¿ “‘The mere fact
that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se.’”¿ (Id. (quoting Johnson-Stovall
v. Superior Court (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 808, 811).)¿ “Denying relief where
the party opposing the motion for relief has not shown prejudice is an abuse of
discretion.”¿ (Id.)¿ 
¿ 
CCP section 631(g) authorizes the
court, in its discretion and upon just terms, to allow a trial by jury although
there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 631(g).)¿
“In exercising its discretion, a court is entitled to consider many factors,
including the possibility of delay in rescheduling the trial for a jury, lack
of funds, timeliness of request and prejudice to all the litigants.”¿ (March
v. Pettis (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 473, 480.)¿ Whenever a doubt exists
as to the propriety of granting relief, such doubt, by reason of the
constitutional guarantee, should be resolved in favor of according a litigant a
trial by jury.¿ (Bishop v. Anderson (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 821, 823.)¿
Further, it is prejudicial to deny a request for a jury trial after a waiver
when no prejudice is shown to the other party or to the Court.¿ (Id.)¿
“However, relief will be denied where the only reason for the demand appears to
be the party’s change of mind or where a demand for a jury is being used as a
‘pretext to obtain continuances and thus trifle with justice.’”¿ (March v.
Pettis (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 473, 480 (quoting Cowlin v. Pringle
(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 472, 476).)¿ 
 
c.      Merits of
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Reinstate Jury Demand
 
Plaintiffs move, pursuant
to Code of Civil procedure section 631(g), to reinstate their jury demand.
 
Plaintiffs filed their complaint on August 12, 2021. Plaintiffs
and the original named defendants Craftscape Creations, LLC and Allen Abraham
demanded a jury trial. On December 14, 2021, this Court scheduled a trial for
January 30, 2023. On November 29, 2022, the original Defendants Craftscape and
Abraham filed a notice of posting jury fees. On January 7, 2024, Plaintiffs
served Hector Esparza, who had been added by Doe Amendment. On March 29, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a dismissal as to Defendants Craftscape and Abraham. The
dismissal was entered April 2, 2024. On May 6, 2024, Plaintiffs realized that
the Craftscape Defendants’ dismissal rendered their jury demand ineffective and
posted jury fees the next day on May 7, 2024. (Paley Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Plaintiffs
failed to timely pay jury fees and thus waived trial by jury pursuant to Code
of Civil procedure section 631(f). Plaintiffs assert the waiver of jury trial
was inadvertent and that Plaintiffs moved promptly to seek relief once they
realized their inadvertence. Plaintiffs argue no prejudice will result to
Defendant because this matter had been scheduled for a jury trial from November
29, 2022, to March 28, 2024, Defendant was served with Plaintiffs’ notice of
posting jury fees on May 7, 2024, and Defendant will have more than two months
to prepare for a jury trial even after the hearing of this motion.
 
Defendant
opposes and argues he will be subjected to prejudice. Defendant also argues
Plaintiffs provide no evidence to show good cause. However, “[t]he trial court
should grant a motion for relief of a jury waiver ‘unless, and except, where
granting such a motion would work serious hardship to the objecting party.’”¿ (Mackovska,
supra, 40 Cal.App.5th at 10.) 
 
Here, the
Court does not find Defendant has shown it will suffer serious hardship if the
motion is granted. The Court notes that Defendant will
have more than two months to prepare for a jury trial even after the hearing of
this motion, which is sufficient time. Further, Defendant was on notice since November 29, 2022 to
March 28, 2024 that this matter was scheduled for a jury trial. In Defendant’s
opposition, he conclusively states he will be subject to prejudice, but does
not specify in what way he will be prejudiced. Thus, Defendant has not shown he
will be prejudiced other than having to try the case to a jury. As such, the
Court finds there is good cause to permit relief from waiver of jury trial in
this case because of counsel’s failure to timely post jury fees.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motion to reinstate jury demand is GRANTED.
 
B.     Plaintiffs’
Motion to Vacate Dismissal of Doe Defendants
 
a.     Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) provides, in relevant part: 
The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or
his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b).)  
 
“Section 473¿is often applied liberally where the party in default
moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion will not
suffer prejudice if relief is granted . . . [citation omitted].¿ In such
situations “very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting
aside the default . . . [citation omitted].”¿ Moreover, because the law
strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in
applying¿section 473¿must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default . . . [citation omitted].¿ Therefore, a trial court order denying
relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the
merits. . . . [citation omitted].”  (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985)
38 Cal.3d 227, 233-234 superseded by statute on other grounds as noted in Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle¿(1999) 21 Cal.4th 973.)  
 
Accordingly, the court has broad discretion to vacate the entry of
default, default judgment or a dismissal, but that discretion can be exercised
only if the defendant establishes a proper ground for relief, by the proper
procedure and within the set time limits. Pursuant to Code of Civil of
Procedure section 473(b), a motion to set aside/vacate a default cannot be
brought more than 6 months after the entry of default and must be made within a
“reasonable time.”  Similarly, a motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b) to vacate a default judgment must be made within
six-months of the entry of default judgment.  (CCP § 473(b).)  The
six-month time limit is jurisdictional.  (Rutan v. Summit Sports, Inc.
(1985) 173 Cal.App. 3d 965, 970.)  Six months is defined as half a year
for the purposes of this section which pursuant to section 6803 of the
Government Code is the equivalent of 182 days.  (Davis v. Thayer,
(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 901-904.) 
 
b.     Merits of Plaintiffs’
Motion to Vacate Dismissal
 
Plaintiffs move
to vacate the dismissal of Doe Defendants pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).
 
First, the Court finds that
Plaintiff’s motion has been timely made. Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), an application for relief must be made “no
more than six months” after entry of the dismissal. Here, dismissal was entered
on January 3, 2024. Plaintiffs had until July 3, 2024 to file this motion. Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion on June 10, 2024, within the six month period. 
 
Plaintiffs assert that the
January 3, 2024, dismissal of Doe Defendants be set aside on the grounds of
their and their counsel’s inadvertence. In support, Plaintiffs submit the
declarations of Plaintiff Birnberg and Plaintiff’s counsel Robin Paley. They
state that Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel did not know that Defendant was a
licensed, bonded contractor at the time the dismissal on January 3, 2024. (Paley
Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs discovered that Esparza had his own contractor’s
license on or around April 26, 2024, after Defendants Craftscape and Abraham
were dismissed from the action and Craftscape’s insurance company did not cover
Esparza. (Ibid.) Thereafter, Plaintiffs checked the Contractors State
License Board website, discovered that Esparza was bonded in 2019, and made
inquiries with the bond company, SureTec Insurance Company. (Ibid.) In
late May, Plaintiffs discovered that the 2019 bond had not been paid out. (Paley
Decl., ¶ 5.) However, Plaintiffs cannot collect from the bond company without
adding it as a party to this action. (Ibid.) Thus, without this
knowledge, Plaintiffs’ counsel inadvertently acquiesced in the dismissal of Doe
and Roe Defendants. Based on the forgoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ inadvertence is a proper ground for relief. The Court
also notes that no opposition has been filed to this motion. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate dismissal of Doe Defendants.
