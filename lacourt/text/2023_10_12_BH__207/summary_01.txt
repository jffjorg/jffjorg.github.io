And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to tax costs filed by the Josephs against MRB Construction, Inc. and Marvin Ramos. The case arises from an accident during the construction of a new home in 2019, and the parties have reached good faith settlement agreements in separate actions. MRB Construction, Inc. seeks to recover costs as the prevailing party in the cross-complaint against the Josephs.

The Court finds that MRB Construction, Inc. is the prevailing party with respect to the Josephs' cross-complaint against it, and is entitled to recover its reasonable costs incurred in defending against that cross-complaint. However, the Court cannot reasonably discern which costs were incurred in defending against the Josephs' cross-complaint versus which costs were incurred in defending against Hernandez's complaint, and therefore grants the Josephs' request to strike the memorandum of costs without prejudice. The Court orders that the Josephs shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
