And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge denies the defendant's motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel, Mary L. Caruso and Wilshire Law Firm, PLC. The defendant alleged that the counsel had improper contact with the defendant, including sending a preservation of evidence letter directly to the defendant and having a consultant deliver a copy of the letter to the defendant's manager. The plaintiff argued that the counsel was unaware that the defendant was represented by counsel at the time the letter was sent. The Judge finds that the defendant has not met its initial burden of showing that the plaintiff obtained confidential information materially related to the case. Therefore, the court declines to disqualify the counsel.
