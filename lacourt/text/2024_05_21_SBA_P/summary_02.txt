And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrers to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by defendants Amanda Pool and Stephen Snyder. The demurrers were based on the grounds that the SAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. The court finds that the SAC provides sufficient facts to allege a claim for fraud and breach of contract. The court also finds that the SAC provides sufficient facts to allege a claim for fraud against Pool and Snyder. The court overrules the demurrers and finds that the SAC states a cause of action.

The court notes that the SAC provides specific allegations as to how Pool breached the terms of the agreements. The court also finds that the SAC provides sufficient facts to allege a claim for fraud against Snyder. The court finds that the allegations are sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraud or deceit based on a promise made without any intention of performing.

The court also notes that Pool and Snyder's requests for judicial notice are granted in full, while Plaintiff's request for judicial notice is denied. The court declines to rule on the motion to strike, as it was never filed.

The court concludes that the SAC states a cause of action for fraud and breach of contract, and overrules the demurrers.
