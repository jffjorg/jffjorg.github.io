On September 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed the Complaint alleging five causes of action: (1) construction defect; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of warranty; (4) accounting; and (5) disgorgement of compensation.Defendant propounded and served Special Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) on Plaintiff on February 7, 2024. (Aragón Decl. ¶ 2.) The responses were due on March 12, 2024. Plaintiff never served his responses. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 3.)On March 13, 2024, Defendant's counsel wrote Plaintiff’s counsel to inform her that no responses had been received. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 4). On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated responses would be served without objections on March 29, 2024. (Id.)On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that she was further delayed on responses would be served on April 7, 2024. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 5). On April 9, 2024, Defendant’s counsel inquired about the status of responses and advised that if they were not received by April 12, 2024, Defendant would file a motion to compel and seek sanctions for the Plaintiff’s willful failure to respond. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 6). To date, Plaintiff’s counsel has not responded to this inquiry or provided responses, thereby necessitating this motion. (Id.)On April 17, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motions.On May 14, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition. As of May 16, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.VII. AnalysisLegal StandardA party must respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after service. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)Merits - Special Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One)Defendant propounded and served Special Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) on Plaintiff on February7, 2024. (Aragón Decl. ¶ 2.) The responses were due on March 12, 2024. Plaintiff never served his responses. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 3).On March 13, 2024, Defendant's counsel wrote Plaintiff’s counsel to inform her that no responses had been received. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 4). On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated responses would be served without objections on March 29, 2024. (Id.) On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that she was further delayed on responses would be served on April 7, 2024. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 5). On April 9, 2024, Defendant’s counsel inquired about the status of responses and advised that if they were not received by April 12, 2024, Defendant would file a motion to compel and seek sanctions for the Plaintiff’s willful failure to respond. (Aragón Dec. ¶ 6). To date, Plaintiff’s counsel has not responded to this inquiry or provided responses. (Id.)Therefore, the Court grants the motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production, Set One.Sanctions“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 states that misuses of the discovery process subject to sanction include “failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” and “making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery.” Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2023.010.Here, Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,400.00 for each Motion for a total of $4,200.00. Since Plaintiff did not file an opposition showing that there was substantial justification or that sanctions would be unjust, the Court finds that sanctions are warranted. However, the Court finds that the amount sought is excessive because the Motions are nearly identical, unopposed, and simple. Therefore, the Court reduces the amount to $1,200.00 which includes 2 hours of attorney time preparing the Motions at a rate of $325.00 per hour, 1 hour preparing for and attending the hearing, and service and filing fees for the Motions in the amount of $225. Thus, the Court GRANTS sanctions in a reduced amount of $1,200.00 for all three Motions, not each.VIII. ConclusionAccordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production, Set One. Plaintiff is ordered to serve without objections his responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production, Set One within 20 days of this order.Additionally, the Court GRANTS IN A REDUCED AMOUNT sanctions in the amount of amount of $1,200.00 for all three unopposed and nearly identical Motions, not each. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly or severally are ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,200.00 to Defendant within 30 days of this order.
