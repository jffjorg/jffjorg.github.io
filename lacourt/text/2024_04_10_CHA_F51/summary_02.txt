And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Danielle Mae Longboy, is overruled. The plaintiffs, Deokja O and Sehong O, have alleged facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for Cancellation of Instruments, Constructive Trust, Quiet Title, Slander of Title, and Partition by Sale and Accounting. The court finds that the defendant's acquisition of the subject property was wrongful and that the plaintiffs have a superior claim to the property. The court orders the defendant to file and serve an answer to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint within 30 days.
