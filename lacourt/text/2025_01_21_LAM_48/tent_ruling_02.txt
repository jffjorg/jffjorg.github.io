[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.

Plaintiff
Frank Rojas and Defendant Volkswagen Group Of America, Inc. have reached a settlement
in this Song-Beverly action.  On December
2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney fees, along with a memorandum of
costs.
As
the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees
and expenses.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)  California courts apply the “lodestar” approach
to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
Plaintiff
requests a total of $46,145.92, consisting of $39,762.50 in attorney fees, $3,000.00
in anticipated attorney fees for this motion, and $3,383.42 in costs.
Plaintiff
provides a copy of counsel’s billing records. 
(Rivero Decl., Ex. R.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel charges hourly rates of $200, $425, $500, $525, and $550.  Based on counsel’s experience, the type of case,
and the market rate, the Court concludes that these are reasonable hourly rates
for this matter.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s counsel spent excessive, unreasonable, and unnecessary time
on discovery.  (Opposition at p. 9.)  As the Court observes in the multitude of Song-Beverly
cases on the docket, experienced counsel have pre-written form pleadings, discovery
requests, discovery responses, and motion papers they use in these cases.  This is a basis for a slight deduction.
Defendant
also argues that the time incurred for this fee motion is excessive.  (Opposition at p. 10.)  Plaintiff billed 6.9 hours for the motion and
memorandum of costs, as well as 6 anticipatorily billed hours for the reply, hearing,
and finality of the motion.  The Court agrees
that this is excessive, and this is a basis for a slight deduction.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff seeks costs that are not allowable under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5  (Opposition at p. 11.)  A prevailing plaintiff in a Song-Beverly action
may recover all “costs and expenses . . . determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1794, subd.
(d).)  “[I]t is clear the Legislature intended
the word ‘expenses’ to cover items not included in the detailed statutory definition
of ‘costs.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North America,
Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)
The
motion for attorney fees and expenses is GRANTED IN PART.  The Court awards Plaintiff $37,000.00 in attorney
fees and $3,383.42 in costs and expenses.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
