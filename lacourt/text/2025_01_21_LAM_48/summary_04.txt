And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendants, Kimberly Young and Ashley Young, argued that the court lacks jurisdiction over them because they were not properly served with the summons and complaint. The evidence showed that the summons and complaint were found on a gate at the property where the defendants manage, but no one at the property accepted service on their behalf. The plaintiff, Paul Hosea Jackson, failed to oppose the motion and thus did not demonstrate effective service. The judge ruled that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendants and granted the motion to quash.
