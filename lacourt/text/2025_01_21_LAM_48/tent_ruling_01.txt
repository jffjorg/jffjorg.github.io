  CASE NO.: 22STCV18474
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  TO QUASH SERVICE OF ORDER TO APPEAR FOR EXAMINATION AND FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 21, 2025



 
On
September 18, 2024, Plaintiff QBN Capiral LLC filed, and the Court issued, an Application
and Order for Appearance and Examination (“ORAP”) for Defendant Teresa Gonzalez.  The ORAP was scheduled for November 19, 2024.  On that date, Defendant failed to appear, and
the Court ordered a bench warrant held until January 7, 2025 and continued the hearing.
On
January 6, 2025, Defendant filed a motion to quash.  At the January 7, 2025 ORAP, the Court continued
the ORAP and motion to quash to January 21, 2025.
A
judgment creditor must personally serve a copy of the order for appearance and examination
on the judgment debtor not less than 10 days before the date set for the examination.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (d).)  Personal service requires personal delivery of
a copy of the summons and complaint to the person being served.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.)
Item
6(a) of the proof of service (filed on November 15, 2024 at 11:21 a.m.) reflects
personal service at 11;00 a.m. on September 26, 2024 at 9240 Shellyfield Road, Downey,
California 90240.  The box for Item 6(a)(2)
is also checked: “(home) a competent member of the household (at least 18 years
of age) at the dwelling house or usual place of abode of the party.  I informed him or her of the general nature of
the papers.”
Defendant
argues that she was not personally served. 
She declares that she “was not served on that date [September 26, 2024] and
have never been served with the Order,” and her husband was not served with the
order.  (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 5.)  This and the proof of service’s contradictory
details of service demonstrate that no personal service was made.
Defendant
also argues that the November 19, 2024 ORAP was required to be taken off calendar
due to untimely filing of the proof of service. 
(Motion at pp. 8-9.)  For an ORAP proceeding,
“proof of service of an order . . . must be filed directly with the clerk in the
assigned department no later than 4:00 p.m., three court days before the hearing
date, unless otherwise ordered by the court.” 
(LASC Local Rule 3.221(b)(1).)  “Failure
to file proofs of service will result in the proceeding being taken off calendar
without costs awarded to the applicant.” 
(LASC Local Rule 3.221(b)(2).)  The
proof of service therefore must have been filed no later than 4:00 p.m. on November
14, 2024, but it was not filed until November 15, 2024 at 11:21 a.m.  Plaintiff does not refute these facts.  (See Opposition at p. 6.)
The
motion to quash is GRANTED IN PART.  The ORAP
originally scheduled for November 19, 2024 and thereafter continued is QUASHED
and taken off calendar.  The request for a
protective order “to halt Plaintiff’s harassing collection efforts against Teresa”
is denied without prejudice for lack of a showing of good cause.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
