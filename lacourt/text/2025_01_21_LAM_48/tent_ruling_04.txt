  CASE NO.: 24STCV19937
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO QUASH
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 21, 2025



 
On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff Paul Hosea Jackson filed this
action against Defendants Kimberly Young and Ashley Young.
On December 16, 2024, Defendants filed
a motion to quash service of summons and complaint.

A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further
time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion
and motion to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  “[I]f a defendant
is not validly served with a summons and complaint, the court lacks personal jurisdiction.”  (Lee v. An (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 558,
564.)  Substituted service requires leaving
a copy of the summons and complaint either at the individual’s dwelling house or
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address other than
a United States Postal Service post office box. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) 
Plaintiff must also mail a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the
summons and complaint were left.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).)
Defendants
argue that this Court lacks jurisdiction over them because they were not properly
served with the summons and complaint.  Defendants
manage a property at 4200 Leimert Park Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90008.  (A. Young Decl. ¶ 2; K. Young Decl. ¶ 2.)  On October 8, 2024, Ashley Young found a copy
of the Summons and Complaint on a gate at the property.  (A. Young Decl. ¶ 2; see K. Young Decl. ¶ 2.)  Neither Defendant was personally served, and no
one at the property accepted service on their behalf.  (Young Decl. ¶ 3; K. Young Decl. ¶ 3.)  Defendants have shown that they were not served
through personal or substituted service. 
No proof of service has been filed.
“When
a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper
service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction
by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
403, 413, fn. omitted.)  Plaintiff has not
opposed this motion and thus has not demonstrated effective service.
Accordingly,
the motion to quash service of summons and complaint is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
