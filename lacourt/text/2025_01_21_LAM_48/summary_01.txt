And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting in part the defendant's motion to quash the Order for Appearance and Examination (ORAP) for the defendant, Teresa Gonzalez. The ORAP was originally scheduled for November 19, 2024, but the defendant failed to appear and the court ordered a bench warrant held until January 7, 2025. The defendant then filed a motion to quash the ORAP, arguing that she was not personally served with the order and that the proof of service was filed late. The judge found that the defendant was not personally served and that the proof of service was filed after the deadline. As a result, the ORAP is quashed and taken off calendar. The judge also denied the defendant's request for a protective order to stop the plaintiff's collection efforts, but without prejudice.
