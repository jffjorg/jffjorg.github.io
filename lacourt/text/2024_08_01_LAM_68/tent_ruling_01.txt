  Case Number:  23STCV31057    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  68 Dept. 68Date: 8-1-24 c/f 7-23-23Case #23STCV31057Trial Date: Not SetDEMURRERMOVING PARTY: Defendant, Hippo Analytics, Inc.RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs, Faramarz MassachiRELIEF REQUESTEDDemurrer to the ComplaintSUMMARY OF ACTIONPlaintiffs Faramarz and Mojgan Massachi allege a burst pipe caused significant water damage in their home, thereby leading to the submission of a claim to Defendants Topa Insurance Company and Hippo Analytics, Inc. The parties subsequently disputed the claim adjustment process which led to an appraisal hearing. The appraisal panel found in favor of Plaintiffs.On December 19, 2023, Plaintiffs file their complaint for 1. Breach of Contract; 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and 3. Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq. Topa Insurance Company answered the complaint on January 22, 2024, and filed an amended answer on February 1, 2024.RULING: Overruled.Request for Judicial Notice: Denied.Defendant Hippo Analytics, Inc. (Hippo) submits a demurrer to the complaint on grounds that it is not a party to the insurance contract with Defendant Topa Insurance Company, and therefore cannot be held liable for the wrongful withholding of benefits due under the policy. Plaintiffs in opposition challenges reliance on extrinsic information that are improperly resolved in a demurrer. To the extent the entire demurrer depends on the judicial notice of Hippo as a non-party to the insurance contract, Hippo fails to present a successful demurrer. Hippo in reply reiterates its status as a non-party to the insurance contract, the validity of the request for judicial notice, and the naming of Topa Insurance Company as the only necessary party to the action. Hippo also adds in a new argument challenging the sufficiency of the breach of contract cause of action, due to the failure to either attach a copy of the contract or allege all terms of the contract.A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]The complaint itself omits any copy of the operative insurance policy. Plaintiffs only allege a policy “issued and administered by Hippo, and underwritten by Topa.” [Comp., ¶ 6.] Hippo is a named defendant in all three causes of action.Hippo depends on judicial notice finding the insurance contract is only between Plaintiffs and Topa. “Where ... judicial notice is requested of a legally operative document—like a contract—the court may take notice not only of the fact of the document and its recording or publication, but also facts that clearly derive from its legal effect. (Citation.) Moreover, whether the fact derives from the legal effect of a document or from a statement within the document, the fact may be judicially noticed where, as here, the fact is not reasonably subject to dispute.” (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 754.) A later court in a different appellate district considering an appeal from an insurer distinguished the Scott case on grounds that nothing in Evidence Code section 452 provided for judicial notice of a contract between private parties, as opposed to the “government document” reviewed in the Scott action under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c). (Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut v. Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 341, 354.) As for “indisputable accuracy” of a document, the court also cites to authority barring private contracts. (Id. at pp. 354-355 accord Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1145-1146.) The court therefore declines to consider the terms of the insurance policy, including any legally operative language identifying the parties.The Declaration of Kelly Yates is also not considered, as it provides extrinsic reference beyond the scope of the pleading. Finally, the court declines to consider the new argument submitted in reply regarding the challenge to the failure to present the terms of the contract in that such an argument improperly deprives Plaintiffs of the opportunity to respond. (See Reichardt v. Hoffman (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 754, 763-764.)An insurance adjuster in no way participates in the contractual relationship between the parties. (Henry v. Associated Indemnity Corp. (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1405, 1416.) Nevertheless, to the extent the demurrer to the breach of contract and bad faith claims solely and entirely depends on the lack of existence of any contractual relationship, the court finds Hippo improperly depends on extrinsic evidence beyond the scope of the demurrer, and improperly submitted new argument in the reply. The demurrer is therefore overruled on the subject causes of action.As for the third cause of action, Hippo challenges the sufficiency of the allegations. Plaintiff maintains the claim s properly stated against Hippo.“The UCL does not proscribe specific acts, but broadly prohibits ‘any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising....’” [¶] “‘A private plaintiff must make a twofold showing: he or she must demonstrate injury in fact and a loss of money or property caused by unfair competition.’ (Citation.)” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1359.) Fact specific pleading is not required in orderto allege an unfair business practice. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46–47.An “unlawful” practice “means any practices forbidden by law, be it civil or criminal, federal, state, or municipal, statutory, regulatory, or court-made.… ‘Unfair’ simply means any practice whose harm to the victim outweighs its benefits. (Citation.) ‘Fraudulent,’ as used in the statute, does not refer to the common law tort of fraud but only requires a showing members of the public ‘“are likely to be deceived.”’” (Saunders v. Superior Court (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 832, 838–839.) “[A]n unfair business practice also means” the relied upon public policy provision is “tethered” to a specific regulatory provisions. (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 81.) Fundamentally, recovery requires a direct harm to the consumer, and actual reliance. (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 326–327.)Other than citation to the standard followed up by a conclusion of no improper practices, since Hippo never issued the subject policy, the court finds insufficient support for the demurer to the instant cause of action. In addition the improper reliance on inadmissible extrinsic reference and unconsidered arguments in the reply, the operative complaint still contains examples of a pattern and practices designed to prevent, delay, interrupt Plaintiffs’ recovery of benefits under the policy. The court finds the complaint sufficiently articulates the claim for relief.Any arguments regarding the improper request for injunctive relief in no way undermines the validity of the entire claim. Hippo could have brought a motion to strike in order to address a claim for relief. The court declines to otherwise address the argument.The demurrer is overruled in its entirety. Hippo to answer the complaint within 10 days.Case Management Conference will be concurrently heard.Hippo to provide notice.
