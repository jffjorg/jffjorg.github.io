BACKGROUND¿ 
 
This is a
collections action in which Plaintiff alleges that on 6/24/21, Defendant executed a loan agreement “in the principal sum of
$20,000.00, which was payable in monthly installment payments of $411.58,
beginning on August 8, 2021, with one final payment of $411.18, due on July 7,
2026.” (FAC ¶ 5.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant defaulted on the loan
agreement on 7/8/22. (Id. at ¶ 6.)
 
On 10/28/22,
Plaintiff filed its original complaint against Defendant and dismissed
defendant The Estate of Gurdip Saran, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Breach of Unsecured Written Agreement; and (2) Common Count. On 1/5/23,
Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint (“FAC”), alleging: (1) Breach of Unsecured
Written Agreement; (2) Common Count; (3) Breach of Agreement; (4) Open Book
Account; (5) Account Stated; (6) Breach of Agreement; (7) Open Book Account;
and (8) Account Stated. Only the first and second causes of action are alleged
against Defendant.
 
On 2/10/23,
Defendants filed their answer. On 7/20/23, Plaintiff dismissed The Estate of
Gurdip Saran from the action without prejudice. On 1/3/24, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for summary judgment. No opposition has been filed to date.

ANALYSIS
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to
enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381–382.) 
 
As to each claim as framed
by the complaint, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment has met its “burden
of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has
proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on
the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the
plaintiff has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant “to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Id.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) 
 
A.   
Breach of Unsecured
Written Agreement
 
Plaintiff’s first cause of
action against Defendant alleges Breach of Unsecured Written Agreement. To
state this cause of action, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the
existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.)
 
Here, Plaintiff proffers evidence of the loan
agreement Defendants entered into with Plaintiff on 6/24/21. (Ex. 1 to Decl. of
Matthew Marquez.) Plaintiff asserts that it has performed all of its
obligations under the loan agreement, and that Defendant breached the agreement
by defaulting under the agreement, resulting in payment owed to Plaintiff in
the principal sum of $17,369.80 plus interest. (Marquez Decl. ¶¶ 17, 25–28.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has met its initial burden of proving each element of its cause of action for
Breach of Contract against Defendant. As Defendant has failed to oppose the
instant motion, she has likewise failed to meet her responsive burden to show
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to this cause of action.
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed motion as to its first
cause of action.

B.    
Common Count
 
Plaintiff’s second cause of action alleges against
Defendant Common Count. The required elements of a common count claim are “(1)
the statement of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e.,
goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment. A cause of action for money
had and received is stated if it is alleged the defendant is indebted to the
plaintiff in a certain sum for money had and received by the defendant for the
use of the plaintiff.” (Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
445, 460 [citations and quotation marks omitted].)
 
Here, Plaintiff proffers Defendant’s account
statements under the loan agreement, showing that “there remains a balance due
and owing from Defendant to Plaintiff in the amount of $17,369.80, plus
interest of $2,344.32, which is calculated at the Agreement rate of 8.49% (per
diem rate of $3.96 for 595 days) from August 27, 2022 to April 9, 2024, the
date of hearing on this motion, and costs of $999.50 (TOTAL OF $20,713.62).”
(Marquez Decl. ¶ 23; Exs. 2–3 to Marquez Decl.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has met its initial burden of proving each element of its cause of action for
Common Count against Defendant. The Court again notes that Defendant has failed
to oppose the instant motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the Court
grants Plaintiff’s unopposed motion as to its second cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff is to file a
proposed judgment within 10 days for Plaintiff and against Defendants in the
total amount of $20,713.62.
