The judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel the attendance of General Motors, LLC's Person Most Qualified at a deposition and the production of documents. The judge finds that General Motors, LLC has failed to meet and confer with the Plaintiff in good faith and has not responded to the Plaintiff's attempts to resolve the issues raised in the motion.

The judge has also granted the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,970.00, but has reduced the amount to $1187.50 due to the costs incurred by the Plaintiff's Counsel in preparing the motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.280, 2025.410, and 2025.450, and the California Rules of Court section 3.1345. The judge has also considered the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the facts of the case in making its decision.

The judge's ruling is intended to compel General Motors, LLC to produce documents and attend a deposition, and to impose monetary sanctions on the company for its failure to meet and confer with the Plaintiff in good faith.
