The judge also finds that the plaintiff's evidence is untrustworthy in certain respects and has excluded new evidence submitted in reply. The judge sustains some evidentiary objections to the defendants' evidence and will not permit the appointment of a receiver at this time. The judge's ruling is based on the parties' motions and evidence, including their declarations and exhibits.
