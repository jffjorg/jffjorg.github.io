And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement agreement was reached on June 9, 2023, after mediation, and provides for a payment of $37,500 to the plaintiff. The court finds that the parties intended to bind themselves to the terms of the agreement, despite the lack of a formal written agreement. The court has ordered the defendants to send the agreed-upon payment to the plaintiff's former counsel. The action will be dismissed with prejudice once the payment is made.
