And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for a protective order, which aimed to prevent the deposition of Panji Budiman in his individual capacity. The court finds that the defendants failed to provide any reasonable legal basis for preventing the deposition. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $5,883.50 against the defendants' counsel, Adli Law Group, P.C., for successfully opposing the motion. The court finds that the defendants' conduct was unjustified and that the plaintiff incurred reasonable expenses as a result.
