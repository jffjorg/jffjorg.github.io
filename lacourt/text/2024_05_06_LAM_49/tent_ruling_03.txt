 Case Number:  24STCV04733    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  49 Tammy Woloski v. Jeffrey Riddell, et al.DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT MOVING PARTY: Defendant Jeffrey Riddell, Trustee of The Jeffrey & Katrina Riddell Living TrustRESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Tammy WoloskiSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:Plaintiff Tammy Woloski is the assignee of a contract for the purchase of vacant land in San Bernardino County. Plaintiff alleges Defendants, as sellers of the property, cancelled the sales agreement and accepted a different offer. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for (1) breach of written contract and (2) declaratory relief.Defendant Jeffrey Riddell, Trustee of the Jeffrey & Katrina Riddell Living Trust, demurred to the Complaint. On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is MOOT by the filing of a First Amended Complaint.Plaintiff to give notice, unless waived.  DISCUSSION:DemurrerDefendant demurred to the Complaint on the grounds that any assignment to Plaintiff was invalid, and therefore she lacks standing to maintain the action. On April 19, 2024, within the time to file an opposition to the demurrer, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. The amended pleading substitutes GMG Development, LLC, the original assignor, as the Plaintiff in this action. Plaintiff also filed a declaration from counsel, Curtis Herron, stating that “Plaintiff, Tammy Woloski, has assigned back to GMG Development, LLC, any and all claims she may have had by virtue of the disputed Assignment.” (Herron Decl. ¶ 3.)Defendant objected to the First Amended Complaint in its “Notice of Non-Opposition to Demurrer,” stating it is “uncertain and skeptical as to the effect, if any, of the Declaration and the purported amendment.” (2: 7-8.) Defendant therefore asks the court to grant the demurrer in its entirety.Generally, the filing of an amended complaint within the time to file an opposition to the demurrer renders the demurrer moot. Defendant has not cited any authority demonstrating that the substitution of the new Plaintiff is improper. To the contrary, amendments to complaints are “liberally allowed” to substitute a plaintiff without standing for one with standing. (See, e.g., CashCall, Inc. v. Superior Ct. (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 273, 287; see also CCP § 473(a) [“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect…”].)Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is MOOT by the filing of the First Amended Complaint.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   May 06, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
