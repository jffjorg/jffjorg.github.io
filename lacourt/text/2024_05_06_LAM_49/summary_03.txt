And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tammy Woloski v. Jeffrey Riddell, et al. The Defendant demurred to the Complaint, arguing that Plaintiff lacked standing to maintain the action due to an invalid assignment. However, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, substituting GMG Development, LLC, the original assignor, as the Plaintiff. The Judge finds that the demurrer is moot due to the filing of the amended complaint, and that the substitution of the new Plaintiff is proper under California law. The Judge orders that the demurrer is MOOT and that the case will proceed.
