And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Oscar Health Plan of California, the defendant, regarding the third cause of action, which alleges a violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, also known as the unfair competition law (UCL). The defendant argues that the plaintiff, Antonina Prestigiacomo, has not pled facts to support her UCL claim. The court denies the motion, finding that the plaintiff has stated a claim under the UCL. The court also bifurcates the UCL cause of action and will hear it separately, without a jury, in the near future.
