And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant BHG Consulting Group's Motion to Quash Service of Summons. The Judge determines that the Defendant's motion is taken off calendar due to the fact that the Defendant is a suspended corporation and lacks legal capacity to prosecute or defend a civil action during its suspension. The Judge notes that the Defendant's arguments regarding the defective service of summons will be addressed if the Defendant refiles its motion at a later date. The Defendant is required to give notice of the ruling.
