  vs.
 
ENZO ZELOCCHI, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  22STCV35638   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 5, 2024




 
Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to provide a
list of 3 available dates within 10 days of entry of this order. Plaintiff, who
is representing herself after her counsel’s motion to be relieved was granted
on 10/3/2024, is sanctioned $1,400 payable within 30 days.
 
On 11/9/2022,
Plaintiff Iris Au (Plaintiff) filed suit against Enzo Zelocchi, Kenneth Childs
(Childs), and David Do, alleging: (1) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (2) attempted extortion; (3) aiding and abetting attempted extortion;
(4) false light; and (5) defamation per se. 

 
On 10/9/2024,
Defendant Kenneth Childs (Defendant) moved to compel Plaintiff to appear for
deposition. 
 
The motion is
unopposed.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that a Court order is necessary to compel Plaintiff to appear for
deposition after she failed to appear or file objections to Defendant’s Notice
of Deposition. 
 
CCP section
2025.450(a) states: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party …,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination …, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony….” 
 
            The
court takes Plaintiff’s non-opposition as a concession to the motion on the merits.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is
granted. Plaintiff is to provide a list of 3 available dates within 5 days of
entry of this order. Plaintiff, who is representing herself after her counsel’s
motion to be relieved was granted on 10/3/2024, is sanctioned $1,400.00.
($350/hr x 4.) 
 
It is so ordered.

IRIS AU 
 
  
        
  vs.
 
ENZO ZELOCCHI, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  22STCV35638   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 6, 2024




 
Defendant’s
motion to compel further discovery responses is GRANTED Plaintiff, who is
representing herself after her counsel’s motion to be relieved was granted on
10/3/2024, is sanctioned $1,400 payable within 30 days.
 
On 11/9/2022,
Plaintiff Iris Au (Plaintiff) filed suit against Enzo Zelocchi, Kenneth Childs
(Childs), and David Do, alleging: (1) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (2) attempted extortion; (3) aiding and abetting attempted extortion;
(4) false light; and (5) defamation per se. 

 
On 10/9/2024,
Defendant Kenneth Childs (Defendant) moved to compel Plaintiff to provide
further responses to his: (1) Form Interrogatories; (2) Requests for Admission
(RFAs); and (3) Requests for Production (RFPs). 
 
The motion is
unopposed.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
seeks to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to his (1) Form
Interrogatories; (2) Requests for Admission (RFAs); and (3) Requests for
Production (RFPs). Defendant explains: 
 
On June 6,
2024, Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Requests for Admission, Set One, and Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One to Plaintiff. Plaintiff did not respond to this discovery by
its initial due date.
 
…
 
It was
obvious at this point Plaintiff has abandoned her case. However, instead of
simply withdrawing as counsel, on August 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel (not
Plaintiff) served a single unverified objection and privilege claim (with no
documents and no privilege log) in response to all of the June 6, 2024, discovery;
then immediately thereafter filed a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel citing
among other reasons lack of communication with Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s counsel’s
unopposed Motion was granted by this Court on October 3, 2024.
 
            (Motion,
2: 6-18.)
 
The following
single objection was used for all Requests for Admission, all Requests for
Production, all Form Interrogatories (even 2.1 “State your name”) and all
Special Interrogatories: 
 
Objection.
Responding Party objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague,
ambiguous, and overbroad. This interrogatory is not reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence. Responding Party objects on the ground that the
interrogatory calls for an expert opinion prematurely, in violation of
California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2034.210, 2034.220, and 2034.270. This
request violates the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product
privilege. Code of Civi. Proc., §§ 2018.020; 2018.030.
 
            Plaintiff’s
responses are clearly deficient. The Court takes Plaintiff’s non-opposition to
be a concession to Defendant’s motion on the merits. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel further responses is granted.
Plaintiff, who is representing herself after her counsel’s motion to be
relieved was granted on 10/3/2024, is sanctioned $1,400.00. ($350/hr x 4.) 
 
It is so ordered.
