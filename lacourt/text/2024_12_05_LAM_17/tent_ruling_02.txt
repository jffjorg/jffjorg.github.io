 Case No.: 
  23STCV17983   
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  December 5, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion to dismiss is GRANTED. 
 
On 8/1/2023,
Plaintiff Andre Nesbit (Plaintiff) filed suit against Walgreens, alleging a
violation of the Unruh Act.  
 
            On
10/2/2024, Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues this action should be dismissed on the grounds that Plaintiff, a
vexatious litigant, failed to pay a security of $25,000 for the benefit of
Defendant Walgreen Co., as ordered by this Court on 5/28/2024. 
 
Under CCP
section 391.4, Defendant Walgreen Co. is entitled to mandatory dismissal for
Plaintiff’s failure to post security as ordered.  
 
The Court
takes Plaintiff’s non-opposition as a concession to Defendant’s motion on the
merits. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
