And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss the action is granted. The plaintiff, Andre Nesbit, filed a lawsuit against Walgreens alleging a violation of the Unruh Act. However, the defendant moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the plaintiff, who is a vexatious litigant, failed to pay a security deposit of $25,000 as ordered by the court. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to post the security and is entitled to mandatory dismissal under California Civil Procedure Code section 391.4. The plaintiff's non-opposition to the motion is considered a concession by the court. As a result, the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and the action is dismissed.
