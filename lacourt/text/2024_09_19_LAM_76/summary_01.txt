Summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Joe Parada's motion for summary adjudication as to Issue No. 1 re: the fourth cause of action. The Court finds that Defendant is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of Plaintiff's claim to the property. Plaintiff's claim is based on alleged unconscionability and unenforceability of the loan agreements, but Defendant's evidence shows that he purchased the property without knowledge of any adverse claim of interest or irregularity in the sale of the property. The Court also finds that the trustee's sale was valid and that Plaintiff's additional fact (AF) No. 3, which claims that the trustor was not in default, is insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact.
