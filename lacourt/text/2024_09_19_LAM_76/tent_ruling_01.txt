Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 263, 274). 
Discussion
Defendant Joe Parada moves for summary
adjudication as follows:
Issue No. 1: “Summary adjudication
should be granted to Parada on Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for quiet title
because Parada’s First Affirmative Defense—that he was a bona fide purchaser for
value of the Subject Property—constitutes a complete defense to such claim.     
 
            The
3AC alleges that Defendant Joe Parada purchased the subject property at a public
auction for $437,845.43. (3AC, ¶ 53; UF No. 2; RJ NExh. 2.) A Trustee’s Deed Upon
Sale was recorded on August 26, 2021, which transferred title of the property to
Parada. (Id. at ¶ 54; UF No. 3; RJN Exh.2.) 
 
The
Complaint in this action was filed on May 12, 2022. The Notices of Pendency of Action
were not recorded until December 2, 2021 and August 4, 2022—after Defendant purchased
the property on August 16, 2021. (UF Nos. 6, 7; RJN Nos. 3, 4.)
 
Defendant
argues that he is entitled to the conclusive presumption set forth in Civil Code,
§ 2924(c) in favor of bona fide purchasers for value and without notice. However,
this is not accurate, as that presumption only applies where a plaintiff challenges
statutory compliance with respect to default and sales notices, but not where the
challenge is to the enforceability of the loan agreement. 
 
The Bank Defendants assert that “[t]he statutory presumption of validity
upon sale to a bona fide purchaser … defeats [each of] the Orcillas’ claims seeking
to set aside the foreclosure sale.” We disagree with respect to the Orcillas’ equitable
cause of action to set aside the trustee’s sale.

“Under [Civil Code] section 2924, there is a conclusive
presumption created in favor of a [bona fide purchaser] who receives a trustee’s
deed that contains a recital that the trustee has fulfilled its statutory notice
requirements. Section 2924 reads in relevant part: ‘A recital in the deed executed
pursuant to the power of sale of compliance with all requirements of law regarding
the mailing of copies of notices or the publication of a copy of the notice of default
or the personal delivery of the copy of the notice of default or the posting of
copies of the notice of sale or the publication of a copy thereof shall constitute
prima facie evidence of compliance with these requirements and conclusive evidence
thereof in favor of bona fide purchasers and encumbrancers for value and without
notice.’” (Melendrez v. D & I Investment, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1238,
1250 [26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 413], fn. omitted (Melendrez).) This court has held that
a bona fide purchaser under section 2924 “‘is one who pays value for the property
without notice of any adverse interest or of any irregularity in the sale proceedings.’”
(Melendrez, supra, at p. 1250.)

Even assuming
Big Sur is a bona fide purchaser, its status as such does not bar the Orcillas’
first cause of action. “Section 2924’s conclusive presumption language for [bona
fide purchasers] applies only to challenges to statutory compliance with respect
to default and sales notices.” (Melendrez,
supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1256, fn. 26.) The challenge to the trustee’s sale asserted in the first cause of action
“does not involve a claim concerning whether [ReconTrust, the trustee,] followed
all statutory procedures with respect to the default and sales notices … .”
(Id. at p. 1256.) Instead, it is based on the alleged unconscionability, and consequent
unenforceability, of the loan agreements. We therefore hold that the conclusive
presumption for bona fide purchasers under section 2924 does not apply to bar the
Orcillas’ first cause of action. (Melendrez, supra, at p. 1256.)


(Orcilla v. Big Sur, Inc. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
982, 1000 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
 
Here, Plaintiff does not merely
challenge compliance with the default and notice of trustee’s sale. Nonetheless,
Defendant has presented evidence that he was a bona fide purchaser for value, and
as such, took title to the property free and clear of Plaintiff’s claim to the property.

 
[Civil Code] Section
2924 does not contain a definition of “bona fide purchaser” to guide us in evaluating
whether the conclusive presumption of the statute is to be applied to a particular
foreclosure sale in which the buyer has received a trustee’s deed containing the
requisite recitals. In the context of applying the presumptions applicable under
section 2924, however, we have recently held that a BFP “is one who pays value for the property without notice of any adverse
interest or of any irregularity in the sale proceedings. [Citations.]” (Nguyen,
supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 442.) 

 [*1251]  This definition of a BFP in the context of section
2924 is consonant with decisions defining the term under California’s recording
statutes, including sections 1107 and 1214. 
Thus, “a bona fide purchaser for value who acquires his interest in real
property without notice of another’s asserted rights in the property takes the property
free of such unknown rights. [Citations.]” (Citations omitted.) “ ‘The elements of bona fide purchase are payment
of value, in good faith, and without actual or constructive notice of another’s
rights. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Citation omitted.) The same elements exist
to determine whether a party who takes or purchases a lien is a bona fide encumbrancer.
(Citations omitted.) 
. . .  

 Thus, the two elements of being a BFP are that the
buyer (1) purchase the property in good faith for value, and (2) have no knowledge
or notice of the asserted rights of another. (Citation omitted.) The first element
does not require that the buyer’s consideration be the fair market value of
the property (or anything approaching it). (Id., § 82.02[2], pp. 82-77 to
82-79.) Instead, the buyer need only part
with something of value in exchange for the property. (See Horton v.
Kyburz (1959) 53 Cal.2d 59, 65–66 [346 P.2d 399] [rejecting contention that BFP
must give “adequate consideration” sufficient to obtain specific performance of
a contract].) Thus, while “the ‘adequacy’
or amount of the consideration given by a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer may
reflect upon his ‘good faith,’ it does not preclude the consideration from being
‘valuable.’ The objective of the [recording statutes protecting bona fide purchasers
and encumbrancers] is to protect persons who have invested substantial sums of money
or property, or who have performed valuable services, in reliance on an honest belief
that they are acquiring a good title or lien.” (Citations omitted [*1252].)

The second element required to establish BFP status
is that the buyer have neither knowledge
nor notice of the competing claim. (Citation omitted.) The rationale for this
requirement is that “[t]he recording laws were not enacted to protect those whose
ignorance of the title is deliberate and intentional … Their purpose is to protect
those who honestly believe they are acquiring a good title, and who invest some
substantial sum in reliance on that belief.” (Citation omitted.) “A person generally has ‘notice’ of a particular
fact if that person has knowledge of circumstances which, upon reasonable inquiry,
would lead to that particular fact. [Citations.]” (Citation omitted.)


(Melendrez v.
D & I Investment, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1250-52 [bold emphasis
added].)
 
            Defendant
submits evidence that he purchased the Subject Property without knowledge of any
adverse claim of interest or irregularity in the sale of the Subject  Property. (UF No. 5; Parada Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
            Defendant’s
evidence is sufficient to meet his burden that he was a bona fide purchaser for
value without notice of Plaintiff’s claim to the property. The burden shifts to
Plaintiff to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists as to Defendant’s
bona fide purchaser status. 
 
            None
of the facts cited or arguments made by Plaintiff in opposition go to whether Defendant
is in fact not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. 
 
            Plaintiff’s request for a continuance to obtain evidence is
denied. For purposes of Civ. Proc. Code, § 437c(h) regarding a request
in support of a continuance of the summary adjudication motion, “[i]t is not sufficient
under the statute merely to indicate further discovery or investigation is contemplated.
The statute makes it a condition that the
party moving for a continuance show ‘facts essential to justify opposition
may exist.’ “ (Citation omitted.)” (Cooksey
v. Alexakis (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 246, 254 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
Plaintiff has not made such a showing as to Defendant’s bona fide purchaser status.

 
A trustee’s sale may be held invalid
if the loan was in fact reinstated (Bank
of America v. La Jolla Group II (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 706, 711-13),
such that the trustee did not have the power to sell the property under the deed
of trust,.
 
Plaintiff’s additional fact (AF) No.
3 is that the trustor was not in default because all payments were made and no breach
had occurred, citing Plaintiff’s Exh. 3. However, Plaintiff’s Exh. 3 (attached to
the Declaration of Greta Curtis) is simply the underlying promissory note. Plaintiff
does not present evidence that the loan was never in default or that it was reinstated.

 
“Where the trustor
is precluded from suing to set aside the foreclosure sale, the trustor may recover
damages from the trustee. (Citation omitted.)” (Moeller v. Lien (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 822, 832
[bold emphasis and underlining added].)
 
            As such, the
motion for summary adjudication as to Issue No. 1 re: the fourth cause of action
is GRANTED.
