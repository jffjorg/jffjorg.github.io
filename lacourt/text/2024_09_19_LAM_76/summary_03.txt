And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving wage and hour violations, disability discrimination, and wrongful termination. The defendant, Rochelle Sterling, dba Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel & Spa, had filed a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents, as well as a request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel. However, the plaintiff has since served responses to the motion, making the motion moot. The court notes that the defendant should have filed separate motions and did not, and if the defendant requires further responses, it should file separate motions as appropriate. The court grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $690, which must be paid to the defendant's counsel within 20 days.
