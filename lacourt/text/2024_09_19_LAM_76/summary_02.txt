And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tri-Star vs. Brenntag Pacific, Inc. The case involves a chemical reaction and fireball at Tri-Star's premises, allegedly caused by a defendant's employee pumping caustic into a peroxide tank. The defendant, Brenntag Pacific, Inc., has moved for leave to file a cross-complaint, which the judge has granted. The defendant will file a stand-alone copy of the cross-complaint today, and it will be deemed served as of the date of the order.

The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 428.50 and 426.50, which provide for the filing of cross-complaints. The judge has also considered the defendant's explanation for the delay in seeking leave to file the cross-complaint, which was due to the discovery of relevant facts in May and June 2024. The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the defendant could have avoided the need for the cross-complaint by allowing the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint.

The judge's ruling is in line with the principle that a motion to file a cross-complaint at any time during the course of the action must be granted unless bad faith of the moving party is demonstrated, where forfeiture would otherwise result. The judge has also considered the factors outlined in Silver Orgs. v. Frank, which include oversight, inadvertence, neglect, mistake, or other cause, as insufficient grounds to deny the motion unless accompanied by bad faith.
