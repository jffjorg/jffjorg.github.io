AMANDA M. QUINTANAR 
  
        
  vs.
 
MERCEDES-BENZ USA, LLC, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  24STCV27595   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 10, 2024




 
            Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED, WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
            On
10/22/2024, Plaintiff Amanda M. Quintanar (Plaintiff) filed suit against
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (Defendnat), alleging violations of the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act.   
 
            On
1/10/2024, Defendant demurred to Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
            
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint is uncertain and ambiguous because it fails
to allege whether the vehicle at issue therein is a “new” motor vehicle under
the Song-Beverly Act and pursuant to Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2024) 17
Cal.5th 189, 195-96. 
 
If a vehicle
is purchased used and does not come with a new vehicle warranty at time of
purchase, then there is no viable cause of action under the Act. (Rodriguez,
supra, 17 Cal.5th at p. 195-196.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff does not allege that the car is new, and rather alleges facts which
suggest that the car is used.  
 
Plaintiff did
not oppose the motion, which the Court takes to be a concession to Defendant’s
motion on the merits. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s demurer is sustained, without leave to amend. 
 
It is so ordered.
