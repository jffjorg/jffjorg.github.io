 Case No.:

 Hearing
  Date:  January 8, 2025




 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. As such, the Court declines to award
sanctions at this time.
 
On 3/11/2024,
Plaintiff Dena Feingold (Plaintiff) filed suit against FCA US, LLC (Defendant).
On 3/12/2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging: (1)
breach of express warranty; (2) breach of implied warranty; and (3) Civil Code
section 1793.2(b).
 
            On
12/4/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to her Requests for
Production (RFPs).
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
argues that further responses are warranted to her RFP Nos. 10, 11, 20,
23-26, 28-29, 37-72.
 
             After review of the relevant discovery
responses, the Court finds some of Plaintiff’s requests to be overly broad in
scope. However, the Court also finds certain objections by Defendant to be
unfounded. In addition to all requested materials related to Plaintiff’s car
itself,
 
1.     
Defendant shall produce the “Warranty
Policy and Procedure Manual” published by Defendant and provided to its
authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the period of
purchase to present.
 
2.     
Defendant shall produce any internal
analysis or investigation regarding defects concerning the transmission defect
in vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle.
 
3.     
 Defendant shall produce any customer
complaints relating to defects that are similar to the alleged defects claimed
by plaintiff in vehicles within California for the same year, make, and model
of the subject vehicle, for the period of purchase to present.
 
4.     
 Defendant shall produce all documents
evidencing policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for
repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for the period
of purchase to present.
 
5.     
 Technical Service Bulletins and Recall Notices
for vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the
subject vehicle. 
 
6.     
 All other requests for further
production are DENIED.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is granted in part, denied in part. As such, the
Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
 
It is so ordered.

         vs.
 
GENERAL
  MOTORS, LLC 
  


 Case No.: 
  23STCV30836 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  January 10, 2025




 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further is DENIED, WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
On 3/11/2024,
Plaintiff Dena Feingold (Plaintiff) filed suit against FCA US, LLC (Defendant).
On 3/12/2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging: (1)
breach of express warranty; (2) breach of implied warranty; and (3) Civil Code
section 1793.2(b).
 
            On
12/4/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to her Special
Interrogatories. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendant should be compelled to supplement its responses to
Special Interrogatory Nos. 14, 20, 23, 25-26, 39, 41 and 43.
 
            After
review, the Court disagrees at this time. 
 
            The
Court finds inadequate meet and confer. To constitute adequate meet and confer,
counsel must “attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult and
deliberate.” (Townsend v. Superior Court (EMC Mortg. Co.) (1998)
61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1443). Additionally, CCP section 2016.040 provides that a
meet and confer declaration in support of a motion must state facts showing
that Plaintiff made a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s meet and confer letters simply declared the remaining requests at
issue valid, declared GM’s objections invalid, and demanded that GM supplement
its previous responses. This is insufficient. Plaintiff argues in reply that
she is not required to engage in further meet and confer efforts where it is
clear that doing so would bear no fruit. However, Plaintiff not set forth any persuasive
evidence to show a reasonable basis for believing meet-and-confer to be futile,
as sending meet and confer letters, without more, does not show that more
meaningful meet and confer could not take place. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further is denied, without prejudice. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
