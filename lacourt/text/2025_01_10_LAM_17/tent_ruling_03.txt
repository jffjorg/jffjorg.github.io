VETCOR MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  24STCV21417   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 10, 2025




 
Plaintiff’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED as to Defendants’ affirmative defenses, WITH 10 DAYS
LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
            On 8/22/2024, Plaintiff Teresita Perez (Plaintiff) filed
suit against Vetcor Management Company LLC dba Pasadena Pets Veterinary
Hospital, Jennifer Lopez, and Stansilav Avezov (collectively, Defendants),
alleging: (1) disability discrimination; (2) failure to provide reasonable
accommodation; (3) failure to engage in the interactive process; (4)
retaliation; (5) failure to prevent; (6) whistleblower retaliation (Labor Code
section 1102.5,6); (7) whistleblower retaliation (Labor Code section 232.5);
(8) wrongful termination; and (9) negligent hiring, supervision, and or
retention. 
 
            On 11/6/2024, Plaintiff demurred to Defendants’
twenty-two affirmative defenses. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff argues that all of Defendants’ affirmative
defenses are insufficiently pled as they fail to give Plaintiff “fair notice”
of Defendants’ defenses.
 
            After review, the Court agrees. 
 
In
pleading affirmative defenses, Defendants are under the same burden as
Plaintiff in pleading her Complaint. (2 Cal. Judges Benchbook Civ. Proc. Before
Trial § 12.27) (advising that a “determination of whether an answer states a
defense is governed by the same principles that apply in determining if a
complaint states a cause of action”) (citing South Shore Land Co. v.
Petersen (1964) 226 Cal. App. 2d 725, 732)
 
Here,
none of Defendants’ affirmative defenses contain any supporting allegations of
fact. As such, they are insufficiently pled, and are insufficient to provide
notice of the grounds for their defenses.
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s demurrer is sustained, with 10 days leave to
amend. 
 
It is so ordered.
