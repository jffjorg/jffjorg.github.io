I. Background
Based on the parties’
share surname (Norlund), for ease of discussion, the Court refers to the
parties by their first names. No disrespect is intended.
A. Relevant
Procedural History
On May 2, 2024, in LASC
action 20STCV27665 (the Lead Case), Richard and Sandra Norlund
filed a pro se Order to Show Cause (OSC) brief regarding Richard’s ability to self-represent
three of the trusts for which Richard is being sued as trustee: (1) Successor
Trustee of “Trust A” of the “Norlund Family Trust dated March 16, 1987” (Trust
A); (2) Successor Trustee of “Trust B” of the “Norlund Family Trust dated March
16, 1987” (Trust B); and (3) Trustee of “Richard L. Norlund Separate Property
Trust dated December 11, 1997” (Richard’s SPT). A hearing was set for May 9,
2024.
That same day, in LASC
action 23STCV19070 (the Butte Case), Richard Norlund filed a pro se
Order to Show Cause (OSC) brief regarding his ability to self-represent Trust
A, Trust B, and Richard’s SPT. A hearing was also set for May 9, 2024.
The two briefs are identical in
substance, but Richard and Sharon Norlund filed the brief in the Lead Case—a
case in which Richard and Sharon are Defendants—while Richard alone filed the
brief in the Butte Case—a case in which Richard is a Defendant but Sharon is
not.
On May 3, 2024, Sandra Norlund
filed a “reply”—in effect an opposition—to the May 2nd brief filed by Richard and
Sharon Norlund in the Lead Case.
On May 6, 2024, in the Lead Case,
Richard and Sharon Norlund filed a reply to Sandra Norlund’s May 3rd “reply,”
as filed by Sandra in the Lead Case.
That same day, in the Butte Case,
Richard filed a reply to Sandra Norlund’s May 3rd “reply,” as filed by Sandra
in the Lead Case. (No similar “reply” by Sandra appears in the Court’s record
for the Butte Case.)
On May 9, 2024, the Court heard the
ex parte applications and ruled: “… Richard Norlund and Sandra Norlund can
represent their own interests as beneficiaries but cannot represent a trust to
the extent there are additional beneficiaries of that trust. They may represent
a Trust to the extent they are the only beneficiaries.”
B. Motions Before the Court
On May 10, 2024, in the Lead Case,
Richard and Sandra Norlund filed a pro per ex parte application to advance hearings
on a forthcoming motion to self-represent Trust A, Trust B, and Richard’s SPT,
then scheduled for July 18, 2024.
That same day, Richard filed a pro
per ex parte application in the Butte Case that was identical in substance to
the ex parte application filed in the Lead Case.
On May 13, 2024, in the Lead Case,
Richard and Sandra filed their pro per motion for leave to self-represent. The
motion was set for hearing on July 18, 2024, under Reservation ID No. 1132.
That same day, in the Butte Case,
Richard filed a pro per motion for leave to self-represent that is identical in
substance to the motion filed in the Lead Case. The motion was set for hearing
on July 19, 2024, under Reservation ID No. 0514.
On May 16, 2024, the Court granted
the ex parte application in part, advancing the hearings on the two motions
from July 18 and 19, 2024, to June 11, 2024.
On May 29, 2024, Sandra
Norlund filed an opposition to Richard and Sandra’s motion in the Lead Case, as
well as an opposition to Richard’s motion in the Butte Case that is identical
in substance to the opposition filed in the Lead Case.
On May 30, 2024,
Richard Norlund—no signatures from Sharon Norlund—filed identical replies in
the Lead Case and the Butte Case. The reply in the Lead Case also attaches over
200 pages of exhibit documents, which were not filed in the Butte Case.
Richard and Sharon’s
motion in the Lead Case and Richard’s motion in the Butte Case are now before
the Court.
 
II. Motions for Leave to
Self-Represent, Lead Case and Butte Case: GRANTED in part and DEFERRED TO
ORAL ARGUMENT in part.
A.
Preliminary Note – Identical Briefing, Single Ruling
Given
that the briefing for all the papers before the Court is identical as between
the two cases—the Lead Case and the Butte Case—the Court provides a single
analysis of the arguments presented by the Norlund Defendants and Sandra
Norlund.
No
briefing from Nancy Hymas is before the Court.
B.
Relevant Law
“No
person shall practice law in California unless the person is an active licensee
of the State Bar.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6125.)
“A
non-attorney trustee who represents the trust in court is representing and
affecting the interests of the beneficiary and is thus engaged in the
unauthorized practice of law. (§ 6125.)” (Ziegler v. Nickel (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 545, 549, fn. omitted.)
“But
if a sole trustee is also the trust’s sole settlor and beneficiary, the
rationale of these cases ceases to apply: no interests are at stake except
those of one person.” (Aulisio v. Bancroft (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1516,
1519 (Aulisio); Boshernitsan v. Bach (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 883,
893-894 [same].)
C.
Court’s Past Ruling
On
May 9, 2024, the Court heard the May 2nd ex parte applications and ruled: “…
Richard Norlund and Sandra Norlund can represent their own interests as
beneficiaries but cannot represent a trust to the extent there are additional
beneficiaries of that trust. They may represent a Trust to the extent they are
the only beneficiaries.”
D.
Court’s Determination

The question before the Court is
whether Richard Norlund may represent Trust A, Trust B, and Richard’s SPT
despite not being a licensed attorney in the State of California.
The Court finds that Richard and
Sharon Norlund have partially made a sufficient showing supporting
self-representation.
The moving papers contain few, if
any, arguments in favor of Richard’s self-representation over Richard’s SPT.
The papers instead focus on Trust A and Trust B. For this reason, the Court
cannot determine, for example, whether entry into the 2019 settlement agreement
and its subsequent execution (including assignment of promissory note) in fact
fulfilled the purposes of Richard’s SPT. (Prob. Code, § 15407, subds. (a),
(a)(2).) Moreover, the requests for judicial notice filed on May 6, 2024, by
the Norlund Defendants include copies of Trust A and Trust B (with amendment)
but not Richard’s SPT. It may be that the parties do not really disagree as to
the SPT, but without further information and documents relating to Richard’s
SPT, the Court’s cannot say that Richard’s SPT has a single settlor, trustee,
and beneficiary as to satisfy Aulisio.  The Court will invite clarification at oral
argument as to whether Sandra disagrees about the SPT.
As to Trust A and Trust B, the
settlement agreement between the parties made Richard the sole trustee over
Trust A and Trust B. (20STCV27665, 3/20/24 SAC, Ex. R [settlement agreement
documents, including Exhibit A, which at Settlement Terms Relating to Trust A,
§ 2, and Settlement Terms Relating to Trust B, § 4, make Richard Norlund the
sole trustee over Trusts A and B].) Sections 14 and 10 in the Settlement Terms
Relating to Trust A and to Trust B make Richard sole beneficiary of the
residual property acquired by Trusts A and B that was not otherwise distributed
by the settlement agreement, in effect making Richard the sole beneficiary of
Trust A and B following the execution of the settlement. (20STCV27665, 3/20/24
SAC, Ex. R, Ex. A.) The settlors of Trust A and B were the parents of Richard
Norlund and Nancy Hymas, who are deceased. (5/3/24 RJNs, Exs. 14, Trust B, p. 1
[Trust made by Ernest and Gertrude Norlund] & Ex. 15, Trust A Restatement,
p. 1 [same]; 20STCV27665, 5/30/24 Exhibits, Exs. 3-4 [Ernest’s and Getrude’s
Certificates of Death].) Under these circumstances, the Court agrees that with
the passing of the settlors, Richard is the sole trustee and beneficiary of
Trust A and Trust B, and there is no interest at stake in representing Trust A
and Trust B other than Richard’s own interests. This showing satisfies Aulisio,
allowing the Court to GRANT Richard and Sharon’s motion in the Lead Case
and Richard’s motion in the Butte Case as relates to self-representation over
Trust A and Trust B.
