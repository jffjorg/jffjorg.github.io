```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering two motions by Richard Norlund to self-represent three trusts: Trust A, Trust B, and Richard's Separate Property Trust (SPT). The judge notes that the briefing is identical in both cases, so the judge will provide a single analysis. The judge finds that Richard Norlund has partially made a sufficient showing in support of self-representation, but notes that the papers focus on Trust A and Trust B, with little information on Richard's SPT. The judge grants Richard Norlund's motion to self-represent Trust A and Trust B, but defers decision on the motion to self-represent Richard's SPT until oral argument.
