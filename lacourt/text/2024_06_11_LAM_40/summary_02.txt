And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Hector Vasques and the production of documents described in the notice of deposition. The court also granted in part the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against The Hatch Group, Inc. and its counsel, Neda Cate, Esq., in the amount of $3,750.

The court denied the motion to compel the deposition of Hector Vasques based on the January 30, 2024, deposition notice, as Hector Vasques is no longer an employee of The Hatch Group, Inc. The court also denied the motion as it relates to the production of documents, finding that the documents are in the custody and control of Hector Vasques.

The court granted the request for sanctions, finding that The Hatch Group, Inc. and its counsel, Neda Cate, Esq., failed to submit to an authorized method of discovery prior to Hector Vasques leaving The Hatch Group, Inc. and made misrepresentations. The court awarded $3,750 in sanctions to the plaintiff.
