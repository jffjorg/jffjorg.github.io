  Case Number:  23STLC01716    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  26 X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc. v. Royal Case No. 23STLC01716TENTATIVE RULING:
            
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Admission, and Request for Sanctions, is DENIED. 
ANALYSIS:
On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.
filed the instant action for breach of contract against Defendant Royal
Personal Training (“Defendant”). On February 21, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 02/21/24.) Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses and Request for Sanctions, which came for hearing on
October 22, 2024. The Court noted a number of defects with the Motion to
Compel, including improperly filing a single discovery motion to compel
responses with respect to four separate sets of discovery and failing to attach
copies of the discovery requests served on Defendant. (Minute Order, 10/22/24.)
Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration on October 22,
2024 and additional notices of motion demonstrating that these defects have
been corrected.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s responses to Request
for Admission, Set Two, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (b). (Notice of Motion, p. 1:24-25.) This statute, however, does
not permit the Court to compel responses to Requests for Admission. Instead, it
allows the Court to deem the requests for admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b) [“The requesting party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.”].)
Also, as noted in the Court’s order dated November 25, 2024,
the number of discovery requests propounded by Plaintiff exceeds the number
permitted by Code of Civil Procedure section 94, subdivision (a).
Conclusion
Therefore, Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Admission, and Request for Sanctions, is DENIED. 
Court clerk to give notice.
