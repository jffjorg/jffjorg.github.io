And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's responses to request for admission and request for sanctions. The plaintiff filed the motion after the defendant failed to respond to discovery requests, but the judge found that the request for admission is not enforceable under California law. Additionally, the judge noted that the plaintiff's number of discovery requests exceeds the number permitted by law. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the court clerk is ordered to give notice to the parties.
