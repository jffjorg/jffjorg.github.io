Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to compel arbitration and stay court action. The plaintiff claims she was terminated from her job in retaliation for complaining about health and safety violations and taking medical leave. The defendant claims that the plaintiff electronically signed an arbitration agreement on November 21, 2016. The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay court action, citing the lack of evidence that the plaintiff saw the arbitration agreement and agreed to it. The judge has set an evidentiary hearing for November 8, 2023, to determine whether the plaintiff electronically signed the arbitration agreement.
