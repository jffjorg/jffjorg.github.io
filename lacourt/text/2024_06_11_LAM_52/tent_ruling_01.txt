  Case Number:  22STCV18567    Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
David Abbasi’s Motion for Terminating, Issue, or Evidentiary Sanctions Against Defendant
Jerry Davidson
Plaintiff/cross-defendant David Abbasi
moves for terminating and other sanctions against defendant/cross-complainant
Jerry Davidson.
This motion is untimely.  “[A]ny party shall be entitled as a matter of
right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have
motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date
initially set for the trial of the action.” 
(CCP § 2024.020(a).)  The deadline
to hear this discovery motion was 15 days before the prior trial date of June
24, 2024, which was Monday, June 10.  This
hearing is only 13 days before June 24.    
In his opposition, Jerry Davidson moves
for $2,315 in sanctions against plaintiff. 
Courts may impose monetary sanctions “on one unsuccessfully asserting
that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any
attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.  If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP § 2023.030(a).)  
Though plaintiff’s motion is unsuccessful,
he acted with substantial justification. 
Sanctions would not be just under the circumstances.  When plaintiff’s counsel reserved a hearing
for this motion, the earliest available date was June 11.  (Thompson Reply Decl., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff unsuccessfully attempted to advance
the hearing and extend the discovery motion cutoff.  Plaintiff also missed the deadline by only one
day.  In these circumstances, the court
exercises its discretion not to impose sanctions.  
Plaintiff David Abbasi’s motion for
terminating, issue, or evidence sanctions against defendant Jerry Davidson is denied.
