Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's application for entry of judgment against Defendant Phase 9 Motor Sports, but denies it against individual defendants Franz, Chisholm, and Frederick. The ruling states that the one final judgment rule prohibits entering a judgment against individual defendants while alter ego liability issues are pending. The judge concludes that any judgment entered now would not be final and would violate the one final judgment rule. The ruling also notes that the proposed judgment would not be a collateral final judgment, as the issue of individual defendants' liability remains at issue.
