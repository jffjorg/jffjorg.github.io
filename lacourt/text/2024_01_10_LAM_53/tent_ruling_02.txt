MOVING PARTIES:
            Defendants Fernando Gaytan and
Angie Coello
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello (“Defendants”) move the
court for an order awarding them attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount
of $287,063.74, consisting of attorney’s fees in the amount of $274,040 and
costs in the amount of $13,023.74, to be paid by plaintiffs Dennis Luna and
Vanessa Luna Bishop (“Plaintiffs”). 
“In
any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code,
§¿1717, subd. (a).)  Upon motion, the court shall determine who is the
party prevailing on the contract for purposes of section 1717.  (Civ.
Code, §¿1717, subd. (b)(1).) 
Plaintiffs
filed the operative Third Amended Complaint against Defendants and nonmoving
defendant Diana Gaytan on July 23, 2021, alleging causes of action for (1)
breach of contract, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3) unjust enrichment,
and (4) constructive eviction.[1]  On
March 6, 2023, the court granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  Thereafter, on May 1, 2023, the court entered
judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs.  (May 1, 2023 Judgment, p. 2:13-18.) 
First, the court finds that Plaintiffs’ first cause of action is based
on a contract providing for the recovery of attorney’s fees.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
“California courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’ in
Civil Code section 1717. 
[Citations.]  ‘ “As long as the
action ‘involve[s] a contract, it is “ ‘on [the] contract’ ” within the meaning
of section 1717.’ ” ’”  (Yoon v. Cam
IX Trust (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 388, 393.) 
“Although the phrase ‘on a contract’ in Civil Code section 1717 has been
liberally construed, it does not stretch to tort claims.  ‘ “[T]ort claims do not ‘enforce’ a contract”
and are not considered actions on a contract for purposes of section
1717.’”  (Orozco v. WPV San Jose, LLC (2019)
36 Cal.App.5th 375, 408.)  A cause of
action is considered to be on a contract “if (1) the action (or cause of
action)) ‘involves’ an agreement, in the sense that the action (or cause of
action) arises out of, is based upon, or relates to an agreement by seeking to
define or interpret its terms or to determine or enforce a party’s rights or
duties under the agreement; and (2) the agreement contains an attorney fees
clause.”  (Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc.
v. CMC Fabricators, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 230, 242.) 
Here, the first cause of action for breach of contract alleges that
Defendants breached the terms of the “Ancillary Agreement for Purchase of Real
Property” (the “Ancillary Agreement”), which states that the prevailing party
in an action (1) to enforce the terms of or seeking damages for the breach of
the Ancillary Agreement, or (2) arising from or related to the Ancillary
Agreement, shall be entitled to recover attorney’s fees.  (TAC ¶¶ 31-32; TAC Ex. B, Ancillary
Agreement, ¶¶ 4, 8.)  Thus, the
first cause of action for breach of contract is an action on a contract
providing for attorney’s fees and costs. 
(Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
Second, the court finds that the Ancillary Agreement allows for the
recovery of attorney’s fees for the second and third causes of action.  
Ordinarily, as set forth above, tort claims are not considered to be
on a contract within the meaning of Civil Code section 1717.  (Orozco, supra, 36 Cal.App.5th
at p. 408.)  However, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021, the measure and mode of compensation for attorneys “is
left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)  “‘As to tort claims, the question of whether
to award attorneys’ fees turns on the language of the contractual attorneys’
fee provision, i.e., whether the party seeking fees has “prevailed” within the
meaning of the provision and whether the type of claim is within the scope of
provision.  [Citation.]  This distinction between contract and tort
claims flows from the fact that a tort claim is not “on a contract” and is
therefore outside the ambit of [Civil Code] section 1717.’”  (Thompson v. Miller (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 327, 335.)  Thus, “[i]f a
contractual attorney fee provision is phrased broadly enough . . ., it may
support an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action alleging
both contract and tort claims: ‘[P]arties may validly agree that the prevailing
party will be awarded attorney fees incurred in any litigation between
themselves, whether such litigation sounds in tort or in contract.’”  (Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th
599, 608.) 
The court finds that the Ancillary Agreement is broad enough to
encompass the attorney’s fees incurred in successfully litigating the tort
claims set forth in the second and third causes of action.  As set forth above, the Ancillary Agreement
includes two provisions that provide for the recovery of attorney’s fees.  The second, broader provision states the
following:  “In the event of any
litigation arising from or related to this Agreement, or the services provided
under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from
the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs incurred including staff time,
court costs, attorney fees, and all other related expenses incurred in such
litigation.”  (TAC Ex. B, Ancillary
Agreement, p. 3, ¶ 8.)  The court
finds that the second and third causes of action for intentional
misrepresentation and unjust enrichment, respectively, arise from or are
related to the Ancillary Agreement because (1) the second cause of action is
based on the allegation that Defendants misled plaintiff Luna with the intent
to induce him to enter into the Ancillary Agreement, and (2) the third cause of
action for unjust enrichment is based on the allegation that Defendants
retained possession of the subject property without making the final payment
set forth in the Ancillary Agreement, such that Defendants were unjustly
enriched in the amount of $300,000.  (TAC
¶¶ 35-36, 43-44, 18.) 
Thus, the court finds that (1) the first cause of action is “on a
contract” within the meaning of Civil Code section 1717, since it (i) involves
the Ancillary Agreement which           (ii)
provides for the recovery of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party; (2) the
second attorney fee provision in the Ancillary Agreement is broad enough to
encompass the non-contract causes of action; and (3) Defendants are the
prevailing parties in this action since the court granted their motion for
summary judgment on March 6, 2023 and thereafter entered judgment in their
favor and against Plaintiffs on May 1, 2023.  The court therefore finds that Defendants are
entitled to an award of attorney’s fees. 
(Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 1021; Santisas,
supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 608.) 
Third, the court finds that Defendants have established a lodestar of $219,440.
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.¿
The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at
the fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)¿ 
Defendants
have submitted the declaration of J. Adrian Zamora, setting forth counsel’s
qualifications and experience.  (Zamora
Decl., ¶¶ 21-26.)  The court finds
that $650 is a reasonable hourly rate given the experience of counsel.  (Ibid.) 
The court further
finds that Defendants have shown that counsel reasonably expended 337.6 hours
in defending this action.  
Of the
413.6 hours set forth in the billing records, the court finds that 76 hours
were not reasonably expended, because (1) the fees incurred for the 11.9 hours
expended after judgment was entered (excluding those incurred in preparing the
fee motion and memorandum of costs, which the court has included in the 337.6
hours used in the lodestar calculation discussed below) and on appeal are not
recoverable by this motion, and (2) the 64.1 hours expended to prepare and file
Defendants’ special motion to strike were unreasonably expended since the court
denied Defendants’ motion on the ground that it was not filed within 60 days of
service of the complaint and was therefore untimely.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1702, subd. (b)(1)
[“A notice of motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up to and
including the rendition of judgment in the trial court” must be served
within the time set forth by California Rules of Court”] [emphasis added]; Jan.
13, 2021 Order, pp. 2-3; Zamora Decl., Ex. I, PDF pp. 83-84 [entries
associated with appeal and post-judgment work for 11.9 hours], 94-98 [entries
associated with special motion to strike for 64.1 hours].)  Thus, the court finds that Defendants have
shown that counsel reasonably expended 337.6 hours in defending against this
action.[2]   
The court
therefore finds that Defendants have established a lodestar of $219,440 (337.6
hours x $650 hourly rate).
Fourth, the
court grants Defendants’ request for costs in the amount of $13,023.74.  
Defendants
served their Memorandum of Costs (made on Judicial Council form MC-010) on
Plaintiffs on May 4, 2023 by mail. 
(MC-010, pp. 2-3.)  “Any notice of
motion to strike or tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of
the cost memorandum.”  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).)  “After
the time has passed for a motion to strike or tax costs or for determination of
that motion, the clerk must immediately enter the costs on judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(4).)  Here, although Plaintiffs filed
an “Opposition” to the request for costs and attorney’s fees on May 22, 2023,
they did not file a motion to strike or tax costs.  Thus, the clerk is required to enter the
costs requested by Defendants on the judgment. 
(Ibid.) 
Even if the
court were to construe Plaintiffs’ opposition as a motion to tax or strike
costs, the court would find that Plaintiffs did not demonstrate that any of the
costs requested were unreasonable. 
Plaintiffs argued only that (1) Defendants are not the prevailing
parties in this action because they did not obtain a net monetary recovery, and
(2) there is no contract providing for the award of attorney’s fees to either
party.  As set forth above, the court has
found that         (1) Defendants are the
prevailing parties since the court entered judgment in favor of Defendants and
against Plaintiffs on May 1, 2023, and (2) the Ancillary Agreement provides for
the recovery of attorney’s fees to Defendants as the prevailing parties in this
action. 
The court
therefore grants Defendants’ motion, in part, and finds that they are entitled
to an award of $219,440 in
attorney’s fees and $13,023.74 in costs. 
ORDER
The court grants in part
defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello’s motion for attorney’s fees as
follows. 
The court orders that
defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello shall recover a total of
$232,463.74, consisting of $219,440 in attorney’s fees and $13,023.74 in costs,
from plaintiffs Dennis Luna and Vanessa Luna Bishop. 
The court orders defendants
Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
