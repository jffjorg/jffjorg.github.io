[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
petition to approve compromise of claim on
  behalf of minor claimant evelyn melendez
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff and petitioner Sofia
Cruz     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition to Approve Compromise of Claim on Behalf of Minor Claimant Evelyn
Melendez
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed. 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Complaint in this action
on July 31, 2023, alleging four causes of action for (1) breach of implied
warranty of habitability, (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (3)
negligence, and (4) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 against defendant
Uranus LLC (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff and petitioner Sofia Cruz (“Petitioner”) seeks court
approval of the settlement made on behalf of minor claimant Evelyn
Melendez.  Defendant has agreed to pay a
total of $225,000 to settle this action, of which $2,500.01 is allocated to
minor claimant.  (Pet., MC-350,
¶¶ 10-11.)  Of the $2,500.01
allocated to minor claimant, $559.11 will be paid to counsel for attorney’s
fees, $263.56 will be paid for legal costs, and the remaining $1,677.34 will be
deposited into a blocked account with Pacific Premier Bank, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court. 
(Pet., MC-350, ¶¶ 10, 16, 18, subd. (b)(2).)
LEGAL STANDARD
The
compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only after it has
been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.  (Prob. Code,
§ 3500.)  The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise, and must be prepared on judicial council form MC-350. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION
The court has reviewed the
petition and finds the $2,500.01 settlement to be fair and reasonable, and in
the best interest of minor claimant Evelyn Melendez.  However, the court finds that Petitioner has
not supported the request for attorney’s fees. 

Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 7.955, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor . . . and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 7.955, subd.
(a)(2).)  Moreover, the mandatory
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability, made on Judicial
Council form MC-350, requires Petitioner to submit a copy of an agreement for
services provided in connection with the claim giving rise to the
petition.  (Pet., MC-350, ¶ 17, subd.
(a)(2).)  Although Petitioner has stated
that Petitioner and counsel have an agreement for services provided in
connection with the pending claim and has submitted a legal services agreement
with the petition, the agreement names as clients (1) Graciela Diaz, (2)
Gregorio Flores, (3) Javier Martinez, and (4) Fatima Garcia.  (Pet., MC-350, Attachments 17a, Legal
Services Agreement, ¶ 1.)  The agreement
does not name as clients Petitioner Sofia Cruz or minor claimant Evelyn
Melendez.  
Thus, the court finds that
Petitioner (1) has not submitted a complete petition, and (2) has not supported
the request for attorney’s fees by failing to attach the representation
agreement between counsel and Petitioner relating to minor claimant Evelyn
Melendez’s claim.
The court exercises its
discretion to continue the hearing on Petitioner’s petition in order to give
Petitioner an opportunity to submit the correct representation agreement. 

ORDER
            The court continues the hearing
on plaintiff and petitioner Sofia Cruz’s Petition to Approve Compromise of Claim on Behalf of Minor Claimant Evelyn
Melendez to January 24, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The
court orders plaintiff and petitioner Sofia Cruz (1) to file a supplemental
declaration of counsel attaching the legal services agreement between plaintiff
and petitioner Sofia Cruz in connection with minor claimant Evelyn Melendez’s
claim by no later than January 12, 2024, and (2) to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  January 10, 2024
