And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Robert B. Broadbelt III, has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to approve a compromise of claim on behalf of minor claimant Evelyn Melendez. The petition was filed by Sofia Cruz, the plaintiff, and seeks approval of a settlement agreement with Uranus LLC, the defendant. The settlement allocates $2,500.01 to minor claimant Evelyn Melendez, with $559.11 allocated for attorney's fees, $263.56 for legal costs, and the remaining $1,677.34 deposited into a blocked account. However, the Judge finds that the request for attorney's fees is not supported because the representation agreement between counsel and Petitioner is incomplete. The Judge exercises discretion to continue the hearing to give Petitioner an opportunity to submit the correct representation agreement. The hearing is scheduled for January 24, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
