[1] On
September 2, 2021, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause
of action without leave to amend.  (Sep.
2, 2021 Order, pp. 1, 5.) 


[2]
The court notes that Defendants have requested an additional $2,600 in
attorney’s fees, representing 4.4 hours at the $650 hourly rate, for the
preparation and filing of a reply to this motion.  (Zamora Decl., ¶ 44.)  The court denies that request since Plaintiff
did not file an opposition and Defendants therefore did not file a substantive
reply.
