And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $232,463.74. The defendants, Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello, are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs as the prevailing parties in the case. The court found that the defendants are the prevailing parties because they successfully litigated the case and obtained a judgment in their favor. The judge also found that the Ancillary Agreement, which is a contract between the parties, provides for the recovery of attorney's fees to the prevailing party. The court calculated the attorney's fees and costs based on the reasonable hourly rate of $650 and the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel. The total amount of attorney's fees and costs is $287,063.74, which includes $274,040 in attorney's fees and $13,023.74 in costs.
