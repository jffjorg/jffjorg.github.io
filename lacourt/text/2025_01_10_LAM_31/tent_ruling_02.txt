[1] Defendant also argues summary
judgment is proper because Defendant’s staff conformed to the applicable
standard of care at all times when providing care and treatment to Plaintiff,
and no conduct on their part caused or contributed to his fall.  However, the FAC does not allege Defendant’s care
and treatment of Salazar as a basis for Salazar’s claims. “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues: the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings. [Citation.]”¿ (FPI
Dev., Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 380.) Rather,
Plaintiff’s allegations center on Defendant’s failure to clean or maintain
Defendant’s premises.  (FAC, ¶ 17.)
