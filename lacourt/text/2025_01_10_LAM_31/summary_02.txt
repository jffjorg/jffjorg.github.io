And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argues that summary judgment is proper because their staff conformed to the standard of care and did not cause or contribute to the plaintiff's fall. However, the judge notes that the plaintiff's claims do not center on the defendant's care and treatment of the plaintiff, but rather on the defendant's failure to clean or maintain their premises. The judge cites a previous case, FPI Dev., Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 380, to remind that the pleadings and affidavits only serve to determine whether there are any triable issues of fact. The judge will consider the defendant's motion for summary judgment at the next court hearing.
