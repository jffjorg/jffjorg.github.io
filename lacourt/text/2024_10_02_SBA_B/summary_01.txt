And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Scott Dain, seeking an order imposing liability on third party Sandra Alfaro under Civil Code §3439. The motion is denied without prejudice. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden of showing authority to allow the Court to order third party Sandra Alfaro to pay damages in the case. The Judge notes that the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA) does not specifically authorize the imposition of liability by motion, and that the plaintiff has not filed a complaint against Alfaro, thereby denying her due process. The Judge also finds that the law cited by the plaintiff is in the context of an action against a defendant, not as to a third party after judgment has been entered.
