BACKGROUND
            On May 10, 2024, plaintiff John
Deere Construction & Forestry Company filed a complaint against defendants First
On Xite Equipment Services LLC, Vanessa Angela De La Torre, and Arturo De La
Torre for (1), (2), (3) breach of contract, (4) conversion, and (5) claim and
delivery.  Plaintiff alleges that on
February 2, 2022, defendants executed a retail installment contract – security
agreement with plaintiff for the purchase of a new John Deere 35G Compact
Excavator and a new FX45 Breaker. 
Defendants promised to pay the financed amount of $64,224.75, payable by
forty-six equal monthly payments of $1465.16. 
On April 28, 2023, defendants defaulted in making the payments to
plaintiff, and the entire unpaid balance of the contract was declared due and
payable.  Under the second cause of
action, plaintiff alleges that on March 22, 2022, defendants executed another
retail installment contract – security agreement for the purchase of a new John
Deere 317G Compact Track Loader and a new Kent FX55 SS Hydraulic Breaker.  Defendants promised to pay the financed
amount of $71,070, payable by forty-six equal monthly payments of
$1593.50.  On November 22, 2023,
defendants defaulted in making the payments to plaintiff, and the entire unpaid
balance of the contract was declared due and payable.  Under the third cause of action, plaintiff
alleges that on April 28, 2022, defendants executed a retail installment
contract – security agreement for the purchase of a used Trail King TKT12U Tilt
Utility Trailer and a new Furukawa FX45 Breaker.  Defendants promised to pay the financed
amount of $26,235, payable by thirty-six equal monthly payments of $788.15.  On January 28, 2023, defendants defaulted in
making the payments to plaintiff, and the entire unpaid balance of the contract
was declared due and payable.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            CCP §512.010 sets forth the
requirements in an application for writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(b) states: “The application
shall be executed under oath and shall include all of the following:   (1) A showing of the basis of the
plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the
property claimed.  If the basis of the
plaintiff's claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be
attached.
            (2)
A showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
            (3)
A particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
            (4)
A statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some part
of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
            (5)
A statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or
fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property
of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such
seizure.”
CCP §512.040(b) states:  “The writ will be issued if the court finds
that the plaintiff's claim is probably valid and the other requirements for
issuing the writ are established.  The
hearing is not for the purpose of determining whether the claim is actually
valid.  The determination of the actual
validity of the claim will be made in subsequent proceedings in the action and
will not be affected by the decision at the hearing on the application for the
writ.” 
CCP §511.090 states:  A “claim has probable validity where it is
more likely than not that plaintiff will obtain judgment against defendant on
that claim.”
            Further, “[a]t the hearing, the
court shall make its determinations upon the basis of the pleadings and other
papers in the record; but, upon good cause shown, the court may receive and
consider additional evidence and authority produced at the hearing or may
continue the hearing for the production of such additional evidence, oral or
documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and authorities.”  CCP §512.050.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks a writ of possession
for the following equipment:
1.
JOHN DEERE 35G COMPACT EXCAVATOR ID# 1FF035GXEMK295752; 
2.
FURUKAWA FX45 BREAKER ID# X45-13567; 
3.
JOHN DEERE 317G COMPACT TRACK LOADER ID# 1T0317GJENJ418943; 
4.
KENT FX55 SS HYDRAULIC BREAKER ID# X55-10980; 
5.
TRAIL KING TKT12U TILT UTILITY TRAILER ID# 1TKU02229NR128664; 
6.
FURUKAWA FX45 BREAKER ID# WRTY0022890
 
            Plaintiff explains that plaintiff
has a purchase money security interest in the above equipment, pursuant to
three separate written retail installment contract – security agreements with
defendants.  The contracts granted
plaintiff a security interest in the equipment. 
Plaintiff perfected its security interest in the equipment by filing a
UCC-1 Financing Statements with the Secretary of State.  Defendants defaulted on the payment
obligations under the contracts.  As a
result, plaintiff argues, it has the right to immediate possession of the
equipment pursuant to the terms of the contracts.  Plaintiff made a demand on defendants to
return the equipment, but defendants have refused to do so.
            The Court finds that the application
complies with the requirements set forth in CCP §512.010.  See Angela Johnson decl.; Donald T. Dunning
decl.  Plaintiff has met its burden to
establish the probable validity of its claims. 
            Plaintiff is not required to post an
undertaking as defendants have no positive interest in the equipment.  As of the date of the complaint, there is
due, owing, and unpaid the sum of $120,525.64, which exceeds the approximate
value of $97,765.  Pursuant to CCP
§515.020, the amount of defendants’ undertaking is set at $120,525.  
            The application is GRANTED.
 
ORDER
            The application is GRANTED.
See Order on CD-120 to be submitted
by plaintiff.
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
