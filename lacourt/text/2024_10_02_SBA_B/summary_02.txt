And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota). The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Anna Marie Farner and Joshua Wayne Farner (plaintiffs) alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act in connection with a 2022 Toyota Highlander.

The court found that while there is an agreement to arbitrate contained in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) between the plaintiffs and a non-party seller, Toyota cannot enforce it as a non-signatory under any theory. The court also rejected Toyota's arguments that it is an intended third-party beneficiary to the RISC.

The court declined to follow the holding in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC and instead followed the holding in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ochoa). The court found that Toyota's claims are not dependent on and inextricably intertwined with the obligations imposed by the sales contract, and therefore equitable estoppel does not apply.

As a result, the court denied Toyota's motion to compel arbitration and ordered the plaintiffs to give notice of the ruling.
