```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a global stay of proceedings in this case, pending the resolution of the criminal matter against the defendant or the defendant's waiver of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions. The parties are to file a joint status conference report 5 court days prior to the status conference hearing, which is set for October 23, 2024.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, but has done so without prejudice to refiling the motion after the stay is lifted. The judge has concluded that a global stay of all proceedings in this matter is necessary to protect the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights and to avoid inefficiency and injustice.
