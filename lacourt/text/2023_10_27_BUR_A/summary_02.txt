And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants failed to adequately represent him in prior legal matters, and has filed a complaint alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.

The defendants have demurred to the third cause of action for breach of contract, arguing that it is uncertain and duplicative of the cause of action for professional negligence. The Judge has found that the plaintiff's allegations in the third cause of action are clear, and that the cause of action is not duplicative of the cause of action for professional negligence.

The Judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike paragraph 46 of the second amended complaint and the second prayer for relief, finding that the plaintiff is entitled to seek consequential damages for breach of contract and attorney's fees.

The ruling is tentative until the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to it.
