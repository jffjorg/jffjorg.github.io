The court granted the defendant's motions to compel discovery responses and awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,055 against the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that the defendant is entitled to reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of the plaintiff's conduct.
