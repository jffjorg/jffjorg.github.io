ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Kegham Tokatlian
(“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Oscar Cordova (“Defendant”) in
connection with an alleged motor vehicle accident. 
 
Before the court are
several discovery motions brought by Defendant. Defendant requests the Court
issue an order compelling Plaintiff to respond to his Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents (“RFPD”). Defendant
also requests sanctions be granted in the amount of $435 with respect to each
motion. 
 
Plaintiff has filed
no opposition to these motions. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response and for a monetary sanction.  (C.C.P. § 2030.290(b).)  The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served.  All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. 
(See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902,
905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely response to a demand to
produce documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a
response.  (C.C.P. § 2031.300(b).)  Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product.  (C.C.P. § 2031.300
(a).)  Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains
relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents
demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses.  Likewise,
for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter
outside court before filing the motion. 
 
The Court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (C.C.P. § 2023.030(a).)

 
California Rule of Court Rule 8.54(c)
states, “A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the
granting of the motion.”
 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Request to Compel Responses & Deem
RFA Admitted
 
Defendant propounded his
Interrogatories and RFPD via e-mail on January 20,
2023. (Cadet Decl. ¶ 6, Exh 1.) Though Defendant does not explain as much,
it appears the initial discovery was sent to the incorrect email address. (Id.)
It appears Interrogatories and RFPD were propounded on the correct email
address for Plaintiff’s counsel on February 22, 2023. (Cadet Decl. Exh. 2.) Responses
were due March 26, 2023, though Defendant granted two extensions to May 1,
2023, and June 2, 2023. (Id.)  On August
24, 2023, Moving Parties sent Plaintiff’s counsel
a meet and confer letter providing an extension for all discovery to April 28, 2023.
(Cadet Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 2.) Defendant states he has received no discovery
responses as of filing this motion. (Id.)  
 
Based on
the foregoing, Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff’s initial response to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and RFPD are GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions 
 
As concerns motions to compel, the law only requires
sanctions if a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response. (C.C.P. §§ 2031.300 & 2031.290.) As such, any monetary sanctions
granted are within the discretionary power of the Court as per C.C.P. §
2030.290. As per C.C.P. § 2023.010(d), failure to respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process.  Further, it is
customary to grant sanctions where a party has filed a motion to compel, and
the other party fails to file an opposition. (C.R.C., Rule 3.1348(a).)  
 
Here, Defendant prepared and filed several motions
to compel, while Plaintiff has filed no oppositions. As such, the court awards
sanctions to Defendant with respect to the motions to compel in the amount of $1,055.
This amount is based on one hour of attorney work in preparing each motion and half
an hour for appearing at the hearing at a rate of $250 per hour, plus the $60
filing fee for each motion (((250 x 3 = 750) + 250 x .5 = 125)) = 875 + 180 = 1,055.).
(Cadet Decl. ¶¶ 8-10.)
