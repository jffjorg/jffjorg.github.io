And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion brought by Defendant Francesca de la Flor to sell the Kentucky Property, which was transferred to Oak Knoll in 2011. The 2013 judgment enjoined the sale of the property without a prior court order. The judge denies Defendant's motion to void the transfer of the property, but grants the motion to dissolve the injunction restricting the sale of the property. The judge finds that the transfer of the property was not voided by the 2013 judgment and that the satisfaction of the judgment has resulted in a material change in the facts, justifying the dissolution of the injunction. The judge also notes that the motivation for Defendant's motion has no bearing on the validity of the injunction and that any tax issues arising from the sale of the property are outside the scope of this motion.
