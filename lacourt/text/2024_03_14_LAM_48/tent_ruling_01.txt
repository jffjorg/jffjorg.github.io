[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER; DENYING
  AS MOOT MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 14, 2024



 
On
August 21, 2019, Plaintiffs Evan Vartanian (a minor, by and through his guardian
ad litem Crystal Vartanian), Crystal Vartaniana, and Nark Vartanian filed this medical
malpractice action against Defendants Sarah Badran M.D. and Children’s Hospital
Los Angeles.
On
September 19, 2023, Plaintiffs substituted Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Medical
Group (“CHLAMG”) for Doe 1.
On
October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
On
January 8, 2024, CHLAMG filed a motion to continue trial, and on January 9, 2024,
CHLAMG filed a demurrer.
DEMURRER
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
CHLAMG
argues that it must be dismissed because it was not served within the statutory
time limits.  “A plaintiff must serve ‘a defendant
within three years after the action is commenced against the defendant.’  (§ 583.210, subd. (a).)  ‘[A]n action is commenced at the time the complaint
is filed.’  (Ibid.)  Dismissal is mandatory where a plaintiff fails
to serve a defendant within the statutory time limits.  (§ 583.250, subd. (b).)  The three-year rule applies where the defendant
seeking dismissal was served as a Doe defendant named in the original complaint,
later amended to show his or her true name. 
[Citations.]  In short, a plaintiff
has three years from the date of filing the complaint to identify and serve a Doe
defendant.”  (Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S.
v. Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061.)  “Service requirements ‘are mandatory and are not
subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provide by statute.’  (§ 583.250, subd. (b).)”  (Id. at pp. 1061-1062.)
Plaintiffs
filed this action on August 21, 2019.  Accordingly,
all defendants must have been served by August 21, 2022.  Plaintiffs named CHLAMG on September 19, 2023,
and they filed a proof of service reflecting personal service on CHLAMG on December
6, 2023.  Plaintiffs’ amendment and service
are untimely with respect to CHLAMG.
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of CHLAMG would be a meaningless formality
because the statute of limitations has not yet run, so Plaintiff Evan will be able
to re-file a new lawsuit and incur more costs for all parties.  Plaintiffs also contend that there is no prejudice
to CHLAMG “in letting the current Doe amendment and service stand against it.”  However, the service requirements are mandatory.
The
demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
Defendant Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Medical Group is DISMISSED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Defendants
Sarah Badran M.D. and CHLAMG request a continuance of the April 22, 2024 jury trial
to September 9, 2024, or a date thereafter. 
When CHLAMG filed its demurrer, the first available hearing date was May
14, 2024—after the trial date.  The parties
seek to continue trial because “Defendant CHLAMG is entitled to have its Demurrer
heard prior to the start of trial.  If the
Demurrer is overruled, it is also entitled to conduct discovery on its behalf.”  However, on February 6, 2024, the Court advanced
the demurrer’s hearing date.  With the Court’s
concurrent order sustaining the demurrer and dismissing CHLAMG, the grounds for
this motion are now moot.
The
motion to continue trial is DENIED AS MOOT.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
