[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48

On
May 17, 2023, Plaintiff Tracyne Restrepo served a Notice of PMK Deposition and
Request for Production of Documents on Defendant Community Care Rehab Center
LLC.  On May 24 2023, Defendant objected
to the notice.  At the July 13, 2023
deposition, Defendant failed to produce all documents responsive to RFP Nos. 2,
4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19.  After
meeting and conferring, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses on
August 31, 2023.
If
a deponent fails to produce any document that is specified in the deposition notice
or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that production.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)
Defendant’s
response argues only that “Plaintiff’s Motion is moot as it is requesting the
production of documents that have already been provided to Plaintiff.”  According to Defendant, the documents were
provided in response to other requests for production on June 19, 2023, while
the deposition took place on July 13, 2023.
Even
if Defendant has already produced the requested documents in response to a
different discovery mechanism, the discovery statutes do not “suggest[] that
seeking documents under one statutory procedure bars a litigant from seeking
the same documents under the other.”  (Carter
v. Superior Court (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 994, 997.)  Defendant must also provide responses to this
discovery request.  It is not sufficient
to generally state that the documents have already been provided.  “Any documents or category of documents
produced in response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
shall be identified with the specific request number to which the documents
respond.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280,
subd. (a).)
The
motion to compel further responses is GRANTED. 
Defendant must provide supplemental responses, without objections, to
RFP Nos. s 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
