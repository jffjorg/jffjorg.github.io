And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The defendant had previously failed to produce all documents responsive to discovery requests, and the plaintiff had filed a motion to compel further responses. The judge ruled that the defendant must provide supplemental responses, without objections, to the discovery requests within 30 days. The judge also denied the request for sanctions. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court, and if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless there is a companion hearing.
