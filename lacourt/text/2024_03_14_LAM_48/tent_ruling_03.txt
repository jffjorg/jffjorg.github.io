  CASE NO.: 22STCV29035
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 14, 2024



 
On March 22, 2023, Defendant
Mathilde Rosa Barry (as personal representative of the Estate of Francisco
Edgardo Paredes) served Plaintiff Orloff & Associates APC with Requests for
Production, Set One.  (Schiller Decl. ¶
2.)  Plaintiff did not timely
respond.  (Schiller Decl. ¶ 3.)  On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff served written
responses, but it did not produce any documents.  (Schiller Decl. ¶ 4.)
On
June 29, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos.
3-14, 17-28, 31-32, 35-39, 42-43. 
Plaintiff did not file any opposition.
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the
protection of attorney work product. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
did not timely serve its initial responses, so it has waived all
objections.  Plaintiff also did not file
any opposition to this motion.
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to produce verified supplemental responses, without objections, to RFP
Nos. 3-14, 17-28, 31-32, 35-39, 42-43 of Defendant’s Requests for Production,
Set One within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is also granted.  Plaintiff’s
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $3,660.00 to Defendant within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
