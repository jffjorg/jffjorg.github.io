And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a new trial, which challenged the order granting the defendant's motion to stay the action. The plaintiff argued that the court prevented a fair trial by giving too much weight to the defendant's evidence and ignoring their own evidence. The court found that the plaintiff's evidence did not overcome the defendant's evidence and that the motion was denied on this ground.

The court also found that the plaintiff did not identify any error in law that required a new trial. The plaintiff argued that the court's ruling that enforcement of the forum selection clause would not diminish their unwaivable statutory rights under the Corporations Code was an error in law. However, the court found that the plaintiff did not have a viable claim under the Corporations Code and therefore did not have any unwaivable statutory rights.

The court concluded that the motion for new trial was denied and that no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
