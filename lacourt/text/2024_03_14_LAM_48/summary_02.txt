And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting in part the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Koen "Ken" Kim, a non-party witness, and denying the defendant's motion for a protective order. The plaintiff was injured at Wilfit Sports Club on November 8, 2019, and Koen "Ken" Kim was served with a deposition subpoena on January 4, 2024. Koen "Ken" Kim filed a motion for a protective order on January 16, 2024, claiming that participating in the deposition would be an undue burden due to his medical condition. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel Koen "Ken" Kim's deposition on January 31, 2024.

The judge found that Koen "Ken" Kim's deposition should be compelled, and he did not meet his burden of showing that a protective order was necessary. The judge also noted that Dr. Thomas Curtis, who provided a medical note supporting Koen "Ken" Kim's request for a protective order, testified that his practice was closed and he did not have a future appointment with Koen "Ken" Kim. Therefore, the judge found that the medical note no longer provided a valid basis for postponing the deposition.

The judge ordered Koen "Ken" Kim to appear for deposition within 30 days and denied the plaintiff's request for additional orders.
