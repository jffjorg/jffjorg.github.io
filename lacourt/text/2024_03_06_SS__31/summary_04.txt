And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is written by Judge Hon. Michelle C. Kim regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Tamiko B. Herron, Esq., the attorney of record for plaintiff David Tutokey. The motion is based on an alleged irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship between Tutokey and Herron's firm, Owen, Patterson & Owen, LLP. The court notes that Herron has confirmed Tutokey's address through certified mail and Westlaw, and assumes that if the confirmation is satisfactory, the motion will be granted. However, if the court is not satisfied with Herron's explanation at the hearing or if she is unable to show that she served Tutokey at a confirmed address, the motion may be denied. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and notes that if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
