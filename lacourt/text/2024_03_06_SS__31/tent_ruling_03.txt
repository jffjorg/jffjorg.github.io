 Case Number:  20STCV49439    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 03/06/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: EMILY GAVOUTIAN by and through her guardian ad litem NARINE AVAGYAN v. JACK KAHALE, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR EMILY GAVOUTIAN, Age 13 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiff/Claimant Emily Gavoutian (“Claimant”), by and through her guardian ad litem, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant for the total amount of $15,000. If the settlement is approved, $995.50 will be used for medical expenses, $3,750 for attorneys’ fees, and $599.50 will be used for costs.    However, the petition filed on November 8, 2023 is denied for the following reasons:  First, there is a discrepancy in the calculations. Petitioner accurately totals the expenses and fees sought from Claimant’s settlement as $5,345. However, $15,000 less $5,345 equates to the net settlement of $9,655, not $10,650.50 as provided. The Court is unclear as to whether there is an error on one of the expenses sought, or if the total net settlement is intended to be of a lesser value than stated. Petitioner, through counsel, must submit a new petition and correct any fee request or calculation errors.   Second, there are necessary Attachments absent from the petition. Because Medi-Cal paid Claimant’s medical expenses, Petitioner must attach a copy of the final Medi-Cal demand letter or letter agreement as Attachment 13c(2). Additionally, Petitioner must provide Attachment 14a (declaration from attorney explaining basis for the fee request, including a discussion of all applicable factors listed in CRC, rule 7.955(b)), and Attachment 14a (copy of the written attorney fee agreement.) ¿ Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
