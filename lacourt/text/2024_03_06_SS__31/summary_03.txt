And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, Emily Gavoutian. The petition was filed on November 8, 2023, and the settlement amount is $15,000. However, the petition is denied due to errors in calculations and the absence of necessary attachments. Specifically, the court is unclear about the net settlement amount and the court is missing attachments, including a copy of the final Medi-Cal demand letter and a declaration from the attorney explaining the basis for the fee request. The petitioner must file a new petition and correct the errors, and must provide the necessary attachments, at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
