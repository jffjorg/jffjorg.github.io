Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion to compel discovery responses and an unopposed motion to continue trial. The motion to compel discovery responses was filed by Kehe Distributors, LLC, which propounded discovery requests on June 15, 2023, and received no responses from Patrick Rayfield, the plaintiff. The judge finds that Kehe properly served the discovery requests and that the time to respond has expired, and therefore grants the motion to compel responses. The judge also awards sanctions to Kehe in the amount of $780, consisting of $200 per motion in attorney fees and $180 in costs.

The unopposed motion to continue trial was filed by Safeway Inc. and Kehe Distributors, LLC, which seek to continue the current trial date to August 12, 2024, or a date thereafter, to allow for discovery to be completed prior to trial. The judge grants this motion, finding that there is good cause to continue the trial date to allow for discovery to be completed. The judge also continues the May 22, 2024 trial date to a date to be determined.

The judge notes that parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and that any party intending to submit on the tentative ruling should send an email to the court. If no party submits, the parties should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
