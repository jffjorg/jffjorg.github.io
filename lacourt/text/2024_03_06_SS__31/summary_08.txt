  - "The Court is guided by Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995), which stands for the proposition that omission of the verification portion of the response containing fact-specific responses merely renders that portion of the response untimely and therefore creates a right to move for orders and sanctions as to those responses, but does not result in a waiver of objections made."

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants in part the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The Plaintiff failed to serve timely and verified responses to the Defendant's special interrogatories, which were propounded on October 25, 2022. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve verifications to the Defendant's special interrogatories within 15 days. The Judge also awards the Defendant sanctions in the amount of $300, which includes $240 in attorney fees and $60 in costs. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion and did not demonstrate otherwise. The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2030.260, as well as case law, including Leach v. Superior Court, Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, and Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court.
