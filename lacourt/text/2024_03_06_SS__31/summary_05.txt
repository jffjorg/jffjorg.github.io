Significant Statements:

  - "The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "Public entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable."
  - "The Court agrees that the defect is easily capable of cure by alleging Gov. Code § 835 (dangerous condition of public property) and Gov. Code § 815.6 (failure of City's Public Street Maintenance Department to perform its mandatory duties pursuant to enacted mandate)."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Susan Hill vs. City of Compton, et al. The City moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against it. The City argues that there is no statutory basis for liability and that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred. The judge agrees that the defect in the complaint can be cured by alleging statutory basis for liability, specifically Government Code sections 835 and 815.6. The judge grants the motion with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff five days to cure the defect. The judge notes that the City's argument that the claim is time-barred is not well-taken, as the plaintiff has not had an opportunity to respond to this argument.
