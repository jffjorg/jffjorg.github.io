And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendant sought terminating sanctions because the plaintiff failed to pay monetary sanctions ordered by the court. The court found that the plaintiff did serve the requested discovery, and imposing terminating sanctions would be grossly disproportionate to the type of misconduct. Instead, the court ordered the plaintiff and their counsel to pay the monetary sanctions of $960. The court also noted that sanctions orders are enforceable as money judgments, and the remedy to enforce payment is to obtain and levy a writ of execution on the debtor's assets. The court encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and scheduled a hearing for March 6, 2024, where the parties can appear remotely or in person to argue the motion.
