Background Defendant Kehe Distributors, LLC ("Kehe”) propounded (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) RPDs, set one, on plaintiff Patrick Rayfield (“Plaintiff”) on June 15, 2023. After granting Plaintiff three requests for an extension, with responses ultimately being due on October 27, 2023, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses to date. Kehe therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before February 22, 2024; the motions are unopposed. For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Kehe’s unopposed motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to defendant Kehe Distributors, LLC’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) RPDs, set one, without objections, within twenty (20) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  II. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Kehe seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,185.00 for each motion.     A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)        Here, Kehe’s counsel does not state the rate per hour in which she calculates the request for attorney fees. Further, the amount requested per motion is excessive. Therefore, Kehe is awarded $200 per motion only for attorney fees. Further, Kehe is awarded three motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $180, as costs.    Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Kehe Distributors, LLC, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $780, within twenty (20) days. Moving party is ordered to give notice.    MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL I. Background On July 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed this action against defendant Safeway Inc. for damages arising from boxes which fell onto Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed amendments to complaint naming Kehe as Doe 1, and Jyve Corporation as Doe 2. The Vons Companies, Inc. (“Vons”) filed an Answer to the complaint, noting that it was sued erroneously as Safeway, Inc. As a result, Plaintiff thereafter filed an amendment to complaint to correct defendant Safeway Inc. to Vons. Trial is currently set for May 22, 2024.     Defendants Kehe and Vons (“Defendants”) now move to continue the current trial date to august 12, 2024, or a date thereafter, to allow their anticipated motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”) to be heard and for discovery to be completed prior to trial.  As of February 22, 2024, no opposition has been received.  II. Legal Standard Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)  The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial.  (See generally, CRC Rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)  Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).) Defendants argue there is good cause to continue the trial date so that their intended MSJ may be heard on July 11, 2024, which is after the current trial date. Defendants aver that July 11, 2024 was the earliest date available. However, although Defendant reserved the MSJ hearing date, the Court notes that no MSJ has been filed to date. Here, the Court is guided by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918.  The Wells Fargo court therein held that a trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.  (Id. at 919.)  Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion. (Id.; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)  “We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment.  However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely motions.” (Id., at p. 530.) Defendant have not demonstrated that a timely MSJ has been filed for trial to be continued on this ground.  However, Defendants additionally argue a continuance is necessary because of a concern that Plaintiff will not respond to discovery in a timely manner. Defendants contend that even if Plaintiff serves responses as a result of the motions to compel, the timing would eliminate Defendants’ ability to serve supplemental discovery, schedule and depose witnesses, and impede the gathering of relevant evidence. On these grounds, the Court finds justification for a trial continuance. This is the second request for a continuance, and there is no apparent prejudice to any party, especially as no parties oppose the motion. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds good cause to continue the trial date to allow the parties sufficient time to conduct and complete discovery. Accordingly, Defendants’ unopposed motion to continue trial is GRANTED.      The May 22, 2024 trial date is continued to ______________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 31 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The May 8, 2024 Final Status Conference is continued to _______________ at 10:00 a.m. in Department 31.  All discovery and expert cutoff dates are continued to reflect the new trial date. The parties must plan all discovery and trial preparation accordingly.     Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 5th day of March 2024      Hon.
