Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and a motion to strike portions of the complaint (FAC) filed by defendant UWW, LLC. The IIED claim alleges that UWW's conduct was outrageous and intended to cause emotional distress to the plaintiff, Jerry Woldum, when a metal gate fell on him after he reported it to receptionists. The judge finds that the allegations do not rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression required to support a claim for punitive damages and sustains the demurrer to the IIIED claim without leave to amend. The judge also grants UWW's motion to strike portions of the FAC, including allegations of malice, fraud, or oppression, and punitive damages. The plaintiff is given 20 days to amend the complaint.
