And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment in a lawsuit brought by David Williamson and Magdalena Williamson against Kate Blackwood and Home as Art, Inc. dba Deasy Penner Podley. The lawsuit arises from the sale of a residence in Los Angeles, where the defendants allegedly failed to obtain all necessary signatures to complete the sale. The buyer, Jason F. Brown, discovered structural damage and sought damages, which the plaintiffs allege was caused by the defendants' failure to obtain the signature on a release form.

The defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot establish an element of the cause of action, namely proximate cause, and that the release form would not have prevented Brown from seeking damages for the disclosed conditions. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' failure to obtain the signature on the release form proximately caused damages and that the demand for arbitration falls within the scope of the first amended complaint.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendants' failure to obtain the signature on the release form proximately caused damages to the plaintiffs. The case will proceed to trial.
