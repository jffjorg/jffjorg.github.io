 Case Number:  21STCV24895    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Yuanbo
Tang.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On July 7, 2021,
Yuanbo Tang (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for negligence against Yu Chun Wong
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 75 based on a motor vehicle accident occurring
on July 16, 2019. 
 
On January 12,
2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service of the summons and complaint on
Defendant.  Defendant did not answer or
otherwise appear.  On July 7, 2023, the Court
rejected Plaintiff’s request for entry of default, as there was no proof of service
of a statement of damages.
 
Also on July 7,
2023, the Court (among other things) set an OSC re Dismissal for Failure to Enter
Default for October 20, 2023.
 
On October 20,
2023, Plaintiff did not appear.  The
Court dismissed the action without prejudice.
 
On April 18,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal. No opposition has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides for mandatory and
discretionary relief from dismissal. “The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Code of Civil Procedure
§ 473(b). Where such an application for discretionary relief is made, the
motion shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be
filed, or the application will not be granted. (Id.) The court must
grant relief from dismissal where the application is accompanied by an attorney
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
(Id.) In either case, the application must be made within a reasonable
time, and in no case exceeding six months after the judgment. (Id.) 
Discussion
Plaintiff requests the Court set
aside the dismissal of his complaint on October 20, 2023.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that he failed to appear on
October 20, 2023, due to a calendaring error in his office, and his own failure
to monitor his office staff.  (Herrera
Decl., ¶¶ 7 – 9.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has established that the
dismissal was through excusable neglect. 
As such, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion
to set aside dismissal.
 
The Court SETS ASIDE the dismissal
filed on October 20, 2023.
 
The Court SETS an OSC re Dismissal for Failure to Obtain
Entry of Default or, in the alternative, a Trial Setting Conference in
approximately 60 days.
