And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant for failing to provide discovery responses and failing to comply with court orders. The judge noted that the plaintiff has not shown a history of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been cured by lesser sanctions. The judge also stated that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the plaintiff and that the court's orders and the Civil Discovery Act should be complied with. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has not requested lesser sanctions in this motion.
