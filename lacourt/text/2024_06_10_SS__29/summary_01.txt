```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion to reopen discovery filed by the Defendant City of Compton is denied. The Defendant seeks to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of taking an independent medical evaluation of the Plaintiff. However, the Court finds that good cause has not been shown to reopen discovery. The Court is concerned that granting the motion would prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, which would be the seventh continuance of the trial date. The Court also finds that the Defendant's diligence in requesting the IME is not convincing, given that the Defendant had previously had ample opportunity to request the IME but failed to do so. The Court denies the Defendant's motion to reopen discovery.
