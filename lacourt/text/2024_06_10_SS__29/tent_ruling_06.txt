 Case Number:  21STCV38649    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Plaintiff Fernando
Sanchez.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This action arises from an alleged vehicle accident on November
16, 2019, on the Southbound Interstate 5 Freeway in or near Valencia,
California. On October 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Fernando and Hilda Sanchez filed a
complaint asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence, general
negligence, and loss of consortium against Defendant Ampac Logistics LLC and
Does 1 to 100.
 On November 1, 2021,
Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Rush Truck Leasing, Inc. (“Rush”) as
Doe 1 and Ampak Logistics Inc. as Doe 2. On December 17, 2021, Plaintiff
amended the complaint to name 3Power Logistics Management (“3Power”) as Doe 3. 
On January 5, 2022, Rush filed its answer and a
cross-complaint against Ampak Logistics, Inc. On March 9, 2022, 3Power filed
its answer. On October 11 and 12, 2022, Ampak Logistics, LLC (erroneously sued
as Ampak Logistics, Inc. and Ampac Logistics, LLC) (“Ampak”) filed its answer
and a cross-complaint against 3Power. On November 30, 2022, 3Power filed its
answer to Ampak’s cross-complaint. 
On February 8 and 10, 2023, at the request of Plaintiffs, the
Court dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiffs’ claims against Rush and 3Power.
On November 6 and 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff
Fernando Sanchez’s motion to compel Ampak’s responses to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. 
On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff Fernando Sanchez (“Plaintiff”)
filed a motion for terminating sanctions; the motion was denied on February 27,
2024, as Ampak never received proper notice of the orders granting the motions
to compel.
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second motion for
terminating, issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against Ampak. Moving
party did not appear at the hearing, and the motion was placed off calendar at the
hearing on April 17, 2024.
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a third motion for
terminating sanctions. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
On November
6 and 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel discovery
responses from Defendant as well as for monetary sanctions; Plaintiff has yet
to receive responses. (Tan Decl., ¶¶ 6, 14.)
 
Plaintiff
moves for terminating sanctions against Defendant for failing to provide
responses to discovery requests as well as failing to comply with this Court’s
order to do so.  
For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Plaintiff has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, a terminating sanction
would create such a windfall for Plaintiff as no lesser sanctions have been
pursued other than the initial monetary sanctions with the Court’s November 6
and 7, 2023 Minute Orders. While this is Plaintiff’s third motion for
terminating sanctions, the first motion was denied on February 27, 2024 for
lack of proper service, and the second motion was placed off-calendar on April
17, 2024.
Plaintiff does not request lesser sanctions
in this motion.
Accordingly,
the Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
