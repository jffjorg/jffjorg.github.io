And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Yuanbo Tang's motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint against Defendant Yu Chun Wong. The Judge finds that the dismissal was due to excusable neglect, as Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear in court on October 20, 2023, due to a calendaring error and his own failure to monitor his office staff. The Judge grants the motion and sets aside the dismissal, setting an OSC re Dismissal for Failure to Obtain Entry of Default or, in the alternative, a Trial Setting Conference in approximately 60 days.
