Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a
mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether,
despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
 
As to each cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant
moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the
cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense
to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to
show “that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved
each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff
or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication
may not simply “rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must
instead “set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material
fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant
requests judicial notice of this Curt’s ruling on Dr. Tu’s motion for summary
judgment, Plaintiff’s complaint, Dr. Tu’s separate statement filed with his
motion for summary judgment, and the amendment to complaint. The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s request as the records are all within this Court’s docket for this
matter.
 
Discussion
 
On September
18, 2018, Plaintiff underwent an epidural steroid injection by Dr. TU at
Defendant’s facilities. (Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”), No. 1.) Plaintiff
complained of numbness in her leg after the procedure, and when she went to
stand, Plaintiff fell onto her left side. (UMF, Nos. 2, 7.) 
 
On
September 17, 2019, Plaintiff served a notice to intent to sue on Dr. Tu and
the Roxbury Surgery Center. (UMF, No. 18.) Plaintiff’s complaint was filed on
December 13, 2019. (UMF, No. 19.) 
 
Plaintiff
knew at the time of the procedure she was at Defendant’s facilities, and
acknowledges that she read documents on the date of the procedure on
Defendant’s letterhead. (UMF, Nos. 36, 37.) Plaintiff signed an authorization
to release medical information on Defendant’s letterhead for her medical
records on August 8, 2019. (UMF, No. 39.) Plaintiff filed suit against
Defendant on May 13, 2022. (UMF, No. 40.)
 
Defendant
moves for summary judgment on two grounds: (1) that as a matter of law the
claim is barred by the statute of limitations; and (2) that Plaintiff cannot
establish the necessary elements for a medical malpractice claim against
Defendant.
 
Statute
of Limitations
 
In a
medical malpractice claim, “the time for the commencement of action shall be
three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,
or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury,
whichever occurs first.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 340.5.) 
 
Defendant
contends the injury was sustained on September 18, 2018.  She served a notice of intent to sue Dr, Tu
on September 17, 2019.  If Plaintiff had
discovered her injury by that date (as appears to be the case), Plaintiff would
have needed to sue Defendant by September 17, 2020.  Alternatively, at the latest, she needed to
sue Defendant by three years after the date of injury, or by September 18,
2021.
 
Plaintiff
did not name Defendant as a Doe until May 13, 2022, after both of those dates.
 
In many
circumstances, the naming of a Doe defendant is viewed as relating back to the
date of the filing of the complaint (here, on December 13, 2019).  But the relation back doctrine does not apply
when, at the time of the filing of the complaint, a plaintiff was actually aware
of the facts giving her a cause of action against the defendant.  (Hahn v. N.Y. Air Brake (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 895, 899-900.)
 
Here,
the undisputed facts show that by no later than August 2019, before she filed
the complaint, Plaintiff knew of the facts giving her a cause of action against
Defendant.  In her deposition, Plaintiff
stated that she knew her procedure took place at 90210 Surgery Medical Center
at the time of the procedure. (Exh. B, 5:24-25, 6:1-6.) Plaintiff also states
that she knew Defendant followed up with a phone call. (Id., 59:16-20.) Plaintiff
further identifies several documents from Defendant, with Defendant’s name on
them, from the date of the incident. (Id., 70:18-21, 71:11-16, 72:9-14,
76:18-25, 77:1, 77:25, 78:1-7, 78:23-25, 79:1-19, 82:16-25, 83:1-15, 84:8-25,
85:1-3, 119:2-23; see also Exh. E.) Defendant lastly present an authorization
to release healthcare information form from Plaintiff allowing Defendant to
release medical information from the September 18, 2018 procedure; the form was
on signed August 8, 2019. (Exh. N.)
 
The
Court finds that Defendant has met its initial burden on summary judgment of
showing that the statute of limitations provides “a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  This
shifts the burden to Plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the … defense.” (Ibid.)  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and
therefore has not done so.  
 
Accordingly, for this reason alone, Defendant
has shown that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The motion is granted on this basis.
 
No Breach of Duty
 
In a
medical negligence action a plaintiff must establish the following elements:
“(1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of [the] profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4)
actual loss or damage resulting from the professional’s negligence.” (Galvez
v. Frields (2001) 88 Cal.App.4tha 1410, 1420; Simmons v. West Covina
Medical Clinic (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 696, 701-02.)  “Both the standard of care and defendants’ breach must normally be
established by expert testimony in a medical malpractice case.” (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008), 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
A medical
professional breaches the duty of professional care by failing to act in
accordance with the prevailing industry standard of care. (See Folk v. Kilk
(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 176, 186.) “The standard of care
against which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly
within the knowledge of experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice
action and can only be proved by their testimony …, unless the conduct required
by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.’”
(Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 410.) 
 
A defendant
moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must “present
evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it
was more likely than not that their treatment fell below the standard of care.”
(Johnson v. Super. Ct. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.) “When a
defendant moves for summary judgment and supports [the] motion with expert
declarations that [their] conduct fell within the community standard of care, [the
defendant] is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward
with conflicting expert evidence.”¿¿(Munro v. Regents of University of
California¿(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.)¿ An expert declaration, if
uncontradicted, is conclusive proof as to the prevailing standard of care and
the propriety of the particular conduct of the health care provider.¿¿(Starr
v.¿Mooslin¿(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.)¿
 
Here, Defendant
presents the declaration of Kevin P. Becker, M.D., who is board certified in
anesthesiology.  (Becker Decl., ¶ 1.) Dr.
Becker is familiar with the standard of care in the medical profession for physicians
and medical facilities practicing anesthesiology and pain management as well as
post-procedure care.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Dr.
Becker testifies that the materials he has reviewed include the complaint and
the medical records of Defendant’s treatment and care of Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 6.)
Dr. Becker recounts in detail the events occurring on the date of the procedure
and thereafter.  (Id., ¶¶ 8-23.)

Dr.
Becker opines that Defendant’s care and treatment of Plaintiff complied with
the standard of care at all times. (Id., ¶¶ 24-28.) 
 
Dr. Becker’s opinion testimony
is “evidence which, if uncontradicted, would constitute a preponderance of
evidence that an essential element of the plaintiff’s case cannot be
established.” (Kids’ Universe v. In2Labs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 870,
879.) The expert opinion testimony of Dr. Becker is evidence that Defendant complied
with its duties under California law and the standard of care for a reasonably
careful medical facilities under similar circumstances.
 
With this
evidence, Defendant has satisfied the initial burden of showing that one or
more elements of the professional negligence cause of action in the complaint cannot
be established. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This shifts the burden to Plaintiff to show
that there is a triable issue of one or more material facts as to the causes of
action.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and
therefore has not done so.  
 
Accordingly, for this additional and
independent reason, Defendant has shown that it is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.  The motion is granted on
this independent basis as well.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
