This tentative ruling is the result of a hearing on a motion by Bank of America N.A. (Plaintiff) to set aside and/or vacate a default judgment entered on February 17, 2023. The Plaintiff claims that it recently learned that the Defendant, Christie N. Alkana, was not a resident of California and was not properly served with a summons. The Plaintiff argues that the default judgment is void due to improper service and seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The court concludes that the default judgment is void and grants the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the default.
