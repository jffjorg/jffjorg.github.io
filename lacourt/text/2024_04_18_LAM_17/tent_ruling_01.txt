  Case Number:  22STCV33389    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior  Court of California County  of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 17   TENTATIVE RULING      JAKE    GOLDBERGER                                       vs.   BACK    TO BALTIMORE, et al.                                                 Case No.:     22STCV33389        Hearing    Date:  April 18, 2024      Defendants’  motion for summary judgment, or summary adjudication in the alternative is MOOT.     On  10/12/2022, Plaintiff Goldberger (Plaintiff) filed suit against Back to  Baltimore, Inc., Alex Ginzburg, and Dongkwan “Tony” Lee, alleging: (1) breach  of contract; (2) fraud and concealment; (3) conversion in violation of Penal  Code section 496; and (4) money had and received.                On  3/27/2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging the same  causes of action.                Now,  Defendants move for summary judgment of Plaintiff’s Complaint.    Discussion    Defendants’  motion for summary judgment was directed the original Complaint. However, the  Court granted Plaintiff’s Leave to File a FAC on 3/21/24 and the FAC was filed on  3/27/2024. As such, the Complaint at issue in Defendants’ MSJ is no longer  operative, and necessarily does not address the new allegations embraced by the  FAC.   Accordingly,  the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff cannot establish his claims as a  matter of law.    Defendants’  motion heavily relies on a contention that a loan from the National Bank for  $580,000 (Bank Loan) defeats all of Plaintiff’s claims. However, the purpose of  the FAC was to add allegations that, if the Bank Loan does indeed exist,  Defendants intentionally concealed the existence of the Bank Loan. Defendants  necessarily did not submit evidence to show there are no triable issues of fact  as to this issue in their motion.     Based on the  foregoing, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, or summary adjudication in  the alternative is moot.        It is so ordered.    Dated:  April     , 2024                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
