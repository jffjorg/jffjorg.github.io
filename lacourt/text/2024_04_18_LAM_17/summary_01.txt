And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JAKE GOLDBERGER vs. BACK TO BALTIMORE, et al. (Case No. 22STCV33389). The Defendants moved for summary judgment, but the Judge has concluded that the motion is moot. The Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on 3/27/2024, which alleges the same causes of action as the original Complaint. The Judge has granted Plaintiff's leave to file the FAC and cannot conclude that the Plaintiff cannot establish his claims as a matter of law. The Defendants' motion relies on a contention that a loan from the National Bank for $580,000 (Bank Loan) defeats all of the Plaintiff's claims. However, the Plaintiff's FAC adds allegations that, if the Bank Loan does indeed exist, the Defendants intentionally concealed its existence. The Judge has not received evidence to show that there are no triable issues of fact on this issue.
