Defendants had insisted upon the new subpoena as a condition to Hight’s
appearance, Plaintiff could simply have served the new subpoena. Despite
Plaintiff’s repeated references to prejudice and delay in his motion and email correspondence
(Motion at p. 5), Plaintiff identifies no specific prejudice to be suffered by
issuing a new subpoena, let alone delay resulting from an amended notice
confirming a date that he had already agreed to. Certainly a new subpoena would
require less of the parties than the motion practice that Plaintiff has
elected.
