Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment or adjudication is granted as to all causes of action except the fourth and eighth causes of action (age discrimination and wrongful termination) and the prayer for punitive damages. The judge finds that the evidence presented by the defendants is sufficient to establish that the plaintiff's termination was not based on age discrimination, but rather on the investigation into his ETS records. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's claims for disability discrimination and retaliation are not supported by the evidence. The judge denies the plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in an interactive process, as well as his claims for harassment and hostile work environment. The judge grants the motion as to the remaining causes of action, including the claims for failure to pay final wages and unfair competition law.
