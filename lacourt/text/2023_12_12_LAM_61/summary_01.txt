And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Gergis R. Ghobrial, M.D.'s motion to compel the deposition of non-party Rachel Hight, M.D. The judge found that Plaintiff unilaterally set the date of deposition for September 20, 2023, without prior consultation with the other participants, and refused to reschedule the deposition to another date because he did not want to serve an amended notice reflecting new information. The judge also found that Plaintiff's claims are limited to employment actions directed to him, and that the underlying wrongdoing alleged in his workplace complaints is not at issue in this litigation.

The judge ordered sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,082.00 and limited the scope of the deposition to six specific areas: establishing Hight's background, job title, and position with Defendants during late 2019 and early 2020; the extent to which Hight was expected to receive and/or handle complaints raised by employees of SAMG, ACS, and/or LBMMC; any policies regarding Hight's handling of such complaints; Hight's knowledge of complaints raised by Ghobrial regarding patient care, discrimination towards Ghobrial or others who shared his background, or harassment of Ghobrial; Hight's handling and/or communication of any such complaints; and Hight's knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Ghobrial's termination or separation from Defendants during late 2019 and early 2020.
