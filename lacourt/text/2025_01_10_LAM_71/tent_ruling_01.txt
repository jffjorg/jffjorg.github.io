Plaintiff Theodore Faye (“Faye”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves for an order to enforce the judgment interest in the unpaid amount of $27,033.07,
with interest continuing to accrue at $5.18 per day until paid and attorney
fees in the amount of $11,780.00 against Defendant Los Angeles Unified School

(Notice of Motion, pg. i; C.C.P. §§187, 680.00, 1033.5(a)(10)(B),
685.090, 685.020.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Defendant’s 12/20/24 request for judicial
notice of (1) this Court’s 3/28/23 Minute Order;[1] and (2) this Court’s 7/9/24 Minute Order is
denied because the Court does not need to take judicial notice of filings on
the instant docket.
 
Background
On February 20, 2024, a jury awarded Plaintiff
$915,281.00 in damages.  On March 20,
2024, this Court entered judgment.  
Plaintiff then moved for statutory attorney
fees and costs.  On July 9, 2024, this
Court issued its final order on the attorney fees and costs.  On July 10, 2024, Notice of Entry of Order
was served and filed.  This Court
recognized that Plaintiff was the prevailing party and granted attorney fees
and costs pursuant to Government Code §12965(c)(6) in the amount of
$1,269,893.26, consisting of $1,196.687.50 attorney fees and $73,205.76 costs.
On August 22,2024, Defendant paid $1,280,609.07
for payment of the attorney fees and costs. 
Defendant calculated the interest from the order on July 9, 2024.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on September
30, 2024.  Defendant filed its opposition
on December 20, 2024.  Plaintiff filed
his reply on January 3, 2025.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §187 provides:
When jurisdiction is, by
the Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or
judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also
given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be
not specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process
or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this Code.
 
(C.C.P. §187.)
          C.C.P. §680.300 provides: “‘Principal
amount of the judgment’ means the total amount of the judgment as entered or as
last renewed, together with the costs thereafter added to the judgment pursuant
to Section 685.090, reduced by any partial satisfactions of such amount and
costs and by any amounts no longer enforceable.”  (C.C.P. §680.300.)
C.C.P.
§1033.5(a)(10)(B) establishes that attorney fees are costs:
(a)  The following items are allowable as costs
under Section 1032:
(10)
Attorney’s fees, when authorized by any of the following:
(B) Statute.
 
(C.C.P.
§1033.5(a)(10)(B).)
C.C.P. §685.090
provides that costs are part of the judgment:
(a)  Costs are added to and become a part of the
judgment:
. . .
(b)  The costs added to the judgment pursuant to
this section are included in the principal amount of the judgment remaining
unsatisfied.
 
(C.C.P.
§§685.090(a), (b).)
C.C.P.
§685.020(a) provides, “[e]xcept as provided in subdivision (b), interest
commences to accrue on a money judgment on the date of entry of the judgment.”  (C.C.P. §685.020(a).)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s motion is granted.
          In Felczer v. Apple, Inc., the
Court of Appeal stated that interest begins to accrue from the original judgment
when the entitlement to fees and costs is established: “We ultimately conclude
that interest begins to run on the date their right to those items is
determined, even if the exact amount is ascertained at a later time.”  (Felczer v. Apple, Inc. (2021) 63
Cal.App.5th 406, 411.)  The Felczer Court
explained: “Accordingly, interest begins accruing as soon as a money judgment
establishing a party’s entitlement to recover funds is entered. Waiting until
the amount is certain would only create incentives for the judgment debtor to
delay the final accounting.”  (Id.
at pg. 418.)
          However, the attorneys’ fees granted in
Felczer were granted under PAGA. 
Here, the attorneys’ fees were granted under FEHA (Govt. Code
§12965(c)(6)).  Unlike under PAGA, FEHA does
not impose a requirement for additional findings of “necessity” or public interest
impact; the entitlement to attorney fees in FEHA cases is automatic upon the
plaintiff becoming the prevailing party. 
(Horsford v. Board of Trustees (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394
[prevailing plaintiff “should ordinarily receive attorney fees unless special
circumstances would render such an award unjust”].)  The Court of Appeal has consistently held that
denial of FEHA fees is appropriate only in “unusual circumstances.”  (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire
District (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 115.) 
This presumption reflects FEHA’s core purpose of ensuring effective
representation for discrimination victims.  (Stephens v. Coldwell Banker (1988) 199
Cal.App.3d 1394, 1406.)  FEHA’s fee
provision must be “liberally construed” to achieve its remedial purpose.  (Robinson v. Fair Employment & Housing
Commission (1992) 2 Cal.4th 226, 243.)
          Here, this Court determined that
because Plaintiff prevailed on his FEHA causes of action he is entitled to
attorneys’ fees under Government Code §12965(c)(6). The original judgment, to
which the Defendant did not object,
provides for the recovery of attorney fees and costs.  Under CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(4), the Court Clerk
enters the amount of the attorney fees and costs once ascertained and it
becomes part of the original judgment. 
Defendant
did not object to the language of the Judgment. Therefore, the entitlement to
the fees and costs was established on March 20, 2024.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is granted.
 
Attorneys’
Fees
C.C.P.
§685.040 provides:
The judgment creditor is
entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.
Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible
under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing
a judgment are included as costs collectible under this title if the underlying
judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.
 
(C.C.P.
§685.040.)
The
Court in Cardinale v. Miller explained that under C.C.P. §685.040, if
the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney fees, then attorney fees
can be recovered for post-judgment enforcement proceedings as long as it meets
two requirements: “(1) the fees must have been incurred to ‘enforce’ a
judgment; and (2) the underlying judgment had to include an award for attorney
fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A)
. . ..”  (Cardinale v. Miller (2014)
222 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1025; see also Guo v. Moorpark Recovery
Service,
LLC (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th
745, 747 [“We conclude that because the underlying judgment awarded reasonable
attorney fees, the court'’ failure to include a specific amount of fees in the
judgment does not defeat section 685.040.”].)
          Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorneys’ fees incurred on this motion in the total reduced amount of
$8,550.00.  Plaintiff cannot recover
attorneys’ fees for time spent meeting and conferring on the instant motion.
          The Court calculates Plaintiff’s
attorneys’ fees as follows:
($950/hour x 5 hours on the initial motion) +
($950/hour x 3 hours to review the opposition and prepare a reply) + ($950/hour
x 1 hour to appear at the hearing) = $8,550.00
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees
incurred on the instant motion is granted in the total reduced amount of $8,550.00, payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for an order to enforce the
judgment interest in the unpaid amount of $27,033.07, with interest continuing
to accrue at $5.18 per day until paid against Defendant is granted.
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees incurred
on the instant motion is granted in the total reduced amount of $8,550.00, payable within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
