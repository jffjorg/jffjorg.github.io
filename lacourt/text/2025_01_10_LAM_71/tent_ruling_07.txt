Moving Defendants
State
of California by and through the Department of Highway Patrol’s and Edward
McElroy’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiff William Gonzalez’s entire complaint
is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
Defendants State of California by and through the Department of
Highway Patrol (“CHP”) and Edward McElroy (“McElroy”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
demur unopposed to Plaintiff William Gonzalez’s (“Gonzalez”) (“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Defendants’ 9/6/24 request for judicial notice of (1) notice of
ruling on CHP’s demurrer on October 7, 2022, in Gonzalez et al. v. County of
Los Angeles et al., LASC Case No. 21STCV16790, sustaining the demurrer
without leave to amend in part and sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend
in part (Decl. of Emmons ¶2, Exh. A); (2) judgment in Gonzalez v. County of
Los Angeles, et al., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV 23-7810 PA (MRWx) granting in
part the Motions for Summary Judgment filed by McElroy, City of Los Angeles
(the “City”) and Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore (“Chief Moore”), which
granted summary judgment to the defendants on the federal claims asserted by
plaintiffs William Gonzalez and Michael Gonzalez  and declined to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims (Decl. of Emmons ¶2, Exh. B); (3)
the joint stipulation filed in Gonzalez v. County of Los Angeles, et al.,
C.D. Cal. Case No. CV 23-7810 PA (MRWx) dismissing the First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and
Fourteenth causes of action against McElroy (Decl. of Emmons ¶2, Exh. C); and
(4) official records of the Department of General Services that no government
claim has been filed in this case (Decl. of Emmons ¶2, Exh. D) is granted.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his operative Complaint on March 8, 2024, alleging
five causes of action: (1) violation of the Bane Act; (2) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; (3) negligence; (4) assault; and (5) battery.
This action arises out of Plaintiff’s alleged loss of his eye from
an LAPD projectile and CHP’s failure to render aid on October 11, 2020, which
occurred while Plaintiff was celebrating the Los Angeles Lakers’ 2020 National
Basketball Association (“NBA”) Finals championship game.  (See Complaint
¶¶19-34.)  
On September 6, 2024, Defendants filed their initial
demurrer.  On November 8, 2024,
Defendants filed an amended demurrer.  As
of the date of this hearing no opposition was filed.
On December 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal with
prejudice “[a]s to Defendants State of California by and through the California
Department of Highway Patrol AND Edward McElroy ONLY,” which was rejected by
the clerk on December 30, 2024, because, “[t]he name of the defendant does not
match what is on file.”  (12/26/24
Request for Dismissal.)
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ 1st cause of action, violation of
the Bane Act, because the claim has already been adjudicated by the Federal
Court or State Court.  (Amended Demurrer,
pg. 2.)  Defendants demur on the basis
that all of Plaintiffs’ causes of action except for negligence have been
disposed of by a stipulation between parties. 
(Amended Demurrer, pg. 2.) 
Defendants demur to the entire of the complaint on the ground that
Plaintiff has not filed a government claim and more than twelve months have
elapsed since the incident so no claim can be filed.  (Amended Demurrer, pg. 2.)  Defendants demur on the basis all causes of
action are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. (Amended Demurrer,
pg. 2.)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that on August 22, 2024, he called
Plaintiff’s counsel the parties were not able to resolve the issues in the
Complaint.  (Decl. of Emmons ¶3.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Accordingly,
the Court will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
          Failure to State
a Cause of Action
          Entire Complaint
Under California law, before a plaintiff can file in Superior
Court against a State employee or entity they must first file a claim with the
defendant agency. (Gov. Code §911.2.)  A
plaintiff who fails to comply with the claims statute, cannot bring suit
against the public agency or employee.  (See
Klein v. City of Laguna Beach (9th Cir. 2013) 533 Fed.Appx. 772, 774 [confirming
summary judgment where Plaintiff had not complied with applicable claims statutes.])
Here, no government claim filed in this case. (D-RJN, Decl. of
Emmons ¶2, Exh. D.)  Plaintiff does not
allege in his complaint that he filed a claim.  The alleged incident took place on October 11,
2020; however, Plaintiff filed his Complaint on March 8, 2024, three and a half
years later.  (See Complaint ¶19.)
The Government Code requires that a claim must be presented “not
later than one year after the accrual of the cause of action.”  (Gov. Code §911.2.)  Plaintiff is too late to file a claim. The
proper remedy for failure to file a claim is for the court to sustain the
demurrer without leave to amend.  (Connolly
v. State of California (1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 744, 748-749.)
Accordingly, Moving Defendants’ demurrer to the entire Complaint is
sustained without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendants CHP’s and McElroy’s unopposed demurrer to
Plaintiff’s entire Complaint is sustained without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
