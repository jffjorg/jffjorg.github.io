[1] Defendant incorrectly
asserts that “[t]he case cited by J.D. is a 2011 case.”  (Reply at p. 10.)  Defendant also states, “LAUSD did locate a 5th
District Court of Appeal decision online entitled GM Roe v. Doe (2023) that
was decided on December 20, 2023, two months after LAUSD filed the present demurrer.  Counsel for LAUSD was unable to locate an official
report for the case, however.”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff correctly cited this case, which is
published, officially reported, and binding.
