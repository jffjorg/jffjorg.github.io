[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 22, 2024



 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff
J.D. filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District arising from childhood sexual abuse.  The FAC alleges (1) negligence (Defendant); (2)
negligence (Does 2-25); (3) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision (Defendant);
and (4) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision (Does 2-25).
On
October 19, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer.
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant’s
request for judicial notice of California 2008 Legislative Search, 2008 Potion of
2007-2008 Regular Session, Chapter 383, S.B. No. 640 (Exhibit A) is granted.
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of trial court orders in other cases (Exhibits 1-14)
is denied.  These orders are unpublished and
nonprecedential.  (See Santa Ana Hospital
Medical Center v. Belshe (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 831 [“a written trial court
ruling has no precedential value”].)
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of Assembly floor analysis AB 218 dated August 30, 2019
(Exhibit 15) is granted.
DISCUSSION
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
A.        This Action Was Timely Filed.
Defendant
argues that this action was filed late, “long after January 1, 2023, revival Period
deadline.”  (Demurrer at p. 18.)  “Emergency rule 9, which tolled statutes of limitations
for civil causes of action that exceed 180 days, tolled section 340.1, subdivision
(q)’s three-year lookback window for 178 days. 
Plaintiff’s claims thus did not expire until June 27, 2023.”  (Roe v. Doe (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 965 [317
Cal.Rptr.3d 47, 53].)[1]
Plaintiff
filed this action on June 22, 2023, within the revival period as extended by Emergency
Rule 9.  The demurrer is overruled on this
ground.
B.        AB 218 Is Not Unconstitutional as Applied
to Defendant.
Defendant
argues that the retroactive application of AB 218 violates Article XVI, Section
6 of the California Constitution.  (Demurrer
at pp. 8-18.)
Under
the Government Claims Act, no person may sue a public entity or public employee
for money or damages unless a timely written claim has been presented to and denied
by the public entity.  (County of Los Angeles
v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267.)  Absent an applicable exception, failure to timely
present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing
suit against that entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.  (State of California v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.)
Currently,
claims brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 for damages resulting
from childhood sexual abuse are exempt from the claims presentation requirement.  (See Gov. Code, § 905, subd. (m).)  Before the passage of AB 218, Government Code
section 905, subdivision (m) limited the exception to the claim presentation requirement
to childhood sexual abuse claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after January
1, 2009.  When AB 218 became law in October
2019, it amended section 340.1 to revive expired claims and enlarged the time to
file suit.  AB 218 also (1) amended Government
Code section 905, subdivision (m) by deleting the language limiting the claim presentation
exception to claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after January 1, 2009,
and (2) added Government Code section 905, subdivision (p), which made this change
retroactive. 
Defendant
challenges AB 218 as unconstitutional in that it violates California Constitution,
Article XVI, section 6, which prohibits gifts of public funds (also referred to
by the parties as the “Gift Clause”).  The
Gift Clause states, in relevant part, that the Legislature shall have no “power
to make any gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing
of value to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever.”  (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 7.)  “[T[he term ‘gift’ includes ‘all appropriations
of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim, even if there
is a moral or equitable obligation.’”  (Jordan
v. California Dept. of Motor Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450 [citing
Conlin v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17, 21-22 (Conlin)].)

Defendant
argues that AB 218 is a gift of public funds that violates the Gift Clause by excusing
compliance with the Government Claims Act. 
(Demurrer at pp. 5-6, 8-11.)  Importantly,
Defendant does not dispute that the Legislature’s authority to enlarge or amend
a statute of limitations to revive claims; instead, it argues that timely claim
presentation is a substantive element of any cause of action against a public entity
and is not merely a procedural requirement. 
(Demurrer at p. 8.)  Therefore, Defendant
contends, AB 218 is unconstitutional because it creates liability for past acts
where no right to recovery previously existed. 
Defendant relies on California Supreme Court cases which it admits are old,
but insists are still on point and therefore, controlling.  (Demurrer at p. 13.)  In one of these cases, Chapman v. State (1894)
104 Cal. 690, 693, the Supreme Court stated that “the legislature has no power to
create a liability against the state for any . . . past act of negligence.”  Subsequently, in Heron v. Riley (1930)
209 Cal. 507, 517, the Supreme Court stated that the imposition of liability for
a past act of negligence “would, in effect, be the making of a gift.” 
Defendant
argues that its demurrer should be sustained because Plaintiff was allegedly abused
and assaulted in 1972-1977, but did not submit a claim within a year of the abuse.  (Demurrer at p. 5.)  Defendant argues that after Plaintiff failed to
submit a claim, Defendant became immune from liability, and AB 218, which retroactively
strips this immunity away, should be invalidated.  (Demurrer at p. 6.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff largely argues that the Legislature is permitted to waive
an established immunity and create liability as long as there is a “public purpose.”  (Opposition at p. 4.)  Plaintiff cites County of Alameda v. Carleson
(1971) 5 Cal.2d 730, 745-746 (Carleson), in which the California Supreme
Court stated: “It is generally held that in determining whether an appropriation
of public funds is to be considered a gift, the primary question is whether the
funds are to be used for a ‘public’ or ‘private’ purpose; the benefit to the state
from an expenditure for a public purpose is in the nature of consideration and the
funds expended are therefore not a gift even though private persons are benefited
therefrom.”  (Opposition at p. 4.)  The court further stated that “[t]he determination
of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature to
determine and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that
determination has a reasonable basis.”  (Carleson,
supra, 5 Cal.2d at p. 746.)  Plaintiff
then extensively cites to the legislative history of AB 218 to describe its clear
and established public purpose provide tort relief to victims of child sexual abuse
and hold perpetrators and institutions accountable.  (Opposition at pp. 5-8.)  Plaintiff argues that the public purpose serves
as the consideration for the expenditure of public funds and is therefore consistent
with the Gift Clause.  (Opposition at pp.
9-10.)
In
reply, Defendant cites Conlin and argues that retroactively imposing liability
on public entities for unenforceable claims, as a matter of law, serves no public
purpose.  (Reply at pp. 8-9.)  Defendant also cites Orange County Foundation
v. Irvine Co. (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 195, 200 (Orange County Foundation)
for the proposition that the appropriation of public funds for the payment of unenforceable
claims serves no public purpose.  (Reply at
pp. 8-9.)  That case held that the settlement
of a good faith dispute between the state and a private party is an appropriate
use of public funds and is not a gift “because the relinquishment of a colorable
legal claim in return for settlement funds paid by the State is good consideration
and accomplishes a valid public purpose.” 
(Orange County Foundation, supra, 139 Cal.App.3d 195 at p. 200.)  However, if the claim is invalid or unfounded,
a promise to compromise “is not valuable consideration.”  (Id. at p. 201.) 
Here,
the Court is unpersuaded that the Legislature lacks the power to revive lapsed claims
and exempt said claims from the claim presentation requirement of the Government
Tort Claims Act.  This case is distinguishable
from those cited by Defendant, in which the legislature appropriated funds to pay
specific individuals (see Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321; Conlin v.
Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17) or passed legislation that a specific
class of persons would be paid a specified amount out of the counties’ general funds
(see Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271).  AB 218 does neither of these things, but rather
revives previously time-barred claims that still must be proven in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the manner provided by law, consistent with due process requirements.

The
cases Defendant relies on also predate the Government Claims Act, enacted in 1963.  Before the Government Claims Act was enacted,
“tort liability for public entity defendants was barred by a common law rule of
governmental immunity.  Over time, however,
the common law rule became ‘riddled with exceptions,’ both legislative and judge
made, and in 1961 this court abolished the rule altogether [in Muskopf v. Corning
Hospital Dist. (1961) 55 Cal.2d 211].” 
(Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798,
803.)
 More than a decade after the Government Claims
Act was passed, the California Supreme Court pronounced that “Government Code section
815 restores sovereign immunity in California except as provided in the Tort Claims
Act or other statute.”  (Williams v. Horvath
(1976) 16 Cal.3d 834.)  Even if the Legislature
confined potential governmental liability to “rigidly delineated circumstances,”
the Court is not persuaded that the Legislature is barred from changing those circumstances;
it is also not persuaded that the Legislature necessarily “creates” liability” when
it eliminates a statutory immunity (in the form of the prefiling claims requirement)
that previously applied to a negligent act that occurred in the past. 
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
CONCLUSION
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
