(County of Alameda v. Carleson)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, is overruled. The plaintiff, J.D., filed a first amended complaint alleging negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against the defendant. The defendant filed a demurrer arguing that the lawsuit is barred because it was filed late and that the retroactive application of AB 218, which revived lapsed claims, is unconstitutional.

The judge found that the lawsuit was filed within the revival period as extended by Emergency Rule 9, and that the defendant's demurrer on this ground is overruled. The judge also found that the retroactive application of AB 218 is constitutional and that the Legislature has the power to revive lapsed claims and exempt them from the claim presentation requirement.

The judge concluded that the demurrer is overruled and that the defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
