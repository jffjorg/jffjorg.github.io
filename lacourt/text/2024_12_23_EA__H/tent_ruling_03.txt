 Case Number:  24PSCV03718    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  H Blue
Sky Utility 2021 XIII LLC, et al. v. Bright Power, Inc., Case No. 24PSCV03718


ORDER RE: EXPUNGEMENT OF LIEN
I.        Background
Plaintiffs
Blue Sky Utility 2021 XIII LLC (“Blue Sky XIII”) and Blue Sky Utility LLC
(“Blue Sky”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
          ROIC
Diamond Hills Plaza, LLC (the “Landlord”) is the owner or reputed owner or
lessee of the real property commonly known as Diamond Hills Plaza and located
at 2711-2899 S. Diamond Bar Blvd. in Diamond Bar (the “Subject Property”).
Plaintiffs and Landlord entered into a Site Lease Agreement (the “Lease”) dated
May 6, 2021, wherein Plaintiffs leased certain premises as set forth in said
Lease to own and operate a solar system at Diamond Hills Plaza.
          On March 10, 2022, Blue Sky XIII
entered into a written engineering, procurement, and construction contract with
Bright Power, Inc. (“BPI”), in
which BPI promised to engineer, design, construct, and install a solar voltaic
facility at Diamond Hills Plaza, Project ID 21-54 (the “Contract”). The scope
of the work was subsequently modified and reduced by 55.6%. Plaintiffs paid BPI
for the work. On September 23, 2024, BPI recorded a verified claim of lien in
the amount of $1,862,616.25 (the “Claim of Lien”) on the subject property. BPI
refuses to release the Claim of Lien, which places Plaintiffs at risk of an
Event of Default under the Lease.
On October
31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint, asserting causes of action
against BPI and Does 1-150 for (1) mandatory and permanent injunction and (2)
declaratory relief to expunge mechanic’s lien.
An Order to
Show Cause Re: Expungement of Lien is set for December 23, 2024.
A Case
Management Conference is set for April 16, 2025.
 
II.      Discussion
The
Court has ordered BPI to show cause (1) why the Court should not declare
invalid and unenforceable the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien recorded by BPI on
November 15, 2024 and thereby ordered released and expunged from the subject
property and (2) why the Court should not permanently enjoin BPI from recording
a Claim of Mechanic’s Lien on the subject property.
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
As
to Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) filed November 25, 2024, the
Court rules as follows: Granted as to Exhibit 1 (i.e., “Claim of Mechanic’s
Lien” recorded September 23, 2024); Granted as to Exhibit 2 (i.e., “Mechanic’s
Lien Release” recorded November 14, 2024); Granted as to Exhibit 3 (i.e.,

Merits
Plaintiff
seeks relief pursuant to the Court’s equitable powers and Connolly
Development, Inc. v. Superior Court (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 803, 823 [“Even after
the lien has been recorded,. . . the owner in many instances could seek a
mandatory injunction ordering the claimant to release the lien. . . the owner
need not wait until the claimant dues to enforce the lien; the imposition of
that lien, and the owner’s denial of its validity, comprise a controversy
sufficient to permit an immediate suit for declaratory relief. . . by filing an
action for injunctive or declaratory relief, the owner or lender can obtain a
hearing either before imposition of the lien or within a reasonable period
thereafter”], Lambert v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 383, 387
[“If a
claimant has not yet imposed a lien or, having imposed it, has not yet sued to
foreclose it, an owner's speediest remedy is through proceedings for injunctive
or declaratory relief”], and RGC Gaslamp LLC v. Ehmcke Sheet
Metal Co., Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 413, 423 [“after recordation but
before foreclosure proceedings commence, the owner may seek declaratory or injunctive
relief challenging the validity of the lien”].
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 526, “an injunction may be granted in the
following cases:
(1)
When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief
demanded, and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the
commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period
or perpetually.
(2)
When it appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or
continuance of some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or
irreparable injury, to a party to the action.
(3)
When it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the action is doing, or
threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act
in violation of the rights of another party to the action respecting the
subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.
(4)
When pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief.
(5)
Where it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation
which would afford adequate relief.
(6)
Where the restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial
proceedings. . .”
BPI
agrees that the issues “relating to the manner in which [a mechanic’s] lien was
perfected” is an equitable issue to be decided by the court (Selby
Constructors v. McCarthy (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 517, 527) and that “the issue
presently before the court
is properly determined by the court pursuant to the court’s equitable powers”
(Resp., 5:21-22).
Plaintiffs have proffered the
following evidence in their Application and Verified Complaint:
          The
Landlord is the owner or reputed owner or lessee of the real property commonly
known as Diamond Hills Plaza and located at the Subject Property. (Verified
Complaint, ¶ 3; Raveh Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs, as Lessees, and Landlord entered
into a Site Lease Agreement (“Lease”) dated May 6, 2021, wherein Plaintiffs
leased certain premises as set forth in said Lease to own and operate a solar
system at Diamond Hills Plaza (“Plaza”). (Verified Complaint, ¶ 4; Raveh Decl.,
¶ 2).
          On March 10, 2022, Blue Sky XIII and
BPI entered into the Contract, in
which BPI promised to engineer, design, construct, and install a solar voltaic
facility at Diamond Hills Plaza. (Verified Complaint, ¶ 5, Exh. A; Raveh Decl.,
¶ 3.) BPI was paid by Plaintiffs for the work at the Subject Property.
(Verified Complaint, ¶ 5; Medina Decl., ¶ 2.)
          The
last date that BPI performed work on the solar system at the Subject Property
was April 24, 2024. (Verified Complaint, ¶ 6.) The solar system at the Subject Property
was occupied and used by putting it into revenue service on April 24, 2024. (Id., ¶ 7; Medina Decl., ¶ 3.)
          On
May 22, 2024, BPI executed a “Form of Final Completion Certificate;” this was
executed by Blue Sky XIII on June 7 and 21, 2024. (Verified Complaint, ¶ 8,
Exh. B; Raveh Decl., ¶ 4.) On August 22, 2024, BPI sent correspondence
addressed to Blue Sky XIII with an enclosed BPI accounting spreadsheet and
invoices which reflected that the “Final Completion Milestone” for the solar
system at the subject property was achieved on May 21, 2024. (Verified
Complaint, ¶ 9; Medina Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. E.)
          On
September 23, 2024, BPI recorded a verified claim of lien in the amount of
$1,862,616.25 (the “September 23, 2024 Claim of Lien”) on the subject property.
(Verified Complaint, ¶ 10, Exh. C; Nov. 25, 2024 RJN, Exh. 1.)
          In an October 21, 2024 letter to
Plaintiffs, the Landlord stated that the September 23, 2024 Claim of Lien was a
breach of the Lease and that failure to remove same   within 30 days would constitute an Event of
Default by Plaintiffs under the Lease. (Verified Complaint, ¶ 12; Raveh Decl.,
¶ 5, Exh. D.) Landlord sent another letter, dated November 8, 2024, to
Plaintiffs, reiterating this position. (Wilson Decl., ¶3; Exh. 2.)
          On November 14, 2024, BPI recorded a
“Mechanic’s Lien Release” in connection with the September 23, 2024 Claim of
Lien. (Nov. 25, 2024 RJN, Exh. 2); however, the next day, BPI recorded another lien
(the “November 15, 2024 Claim of Lien”), which asserts a claim identical to
that stated in the September 23, 2024 Claim of Lien. (Id., Exh. 3.) 
Plaintiff
contends that the November 15, 2024 Claim of Lien is untimely and invalid and
that BPI’s “inchoate right” to a mechanic’s lien on the subject property was
extinguished by the “Mechanic’s Lien Release” recorded by BPI on November 14,
2024. (App., 1:10-12.)
As
to the first ground, the Court agrees that the November 15, 2024 Claim of Lien
is untimely and invalid. Civil Code section 8412 provides that “[a] direct
contractor may not enforce a lien unless the contractor records a claim of lien
after the contractor completes the direct contract, and before the earlier of
the following times: (a) Ninety days after completion of the work of
improvement[,] (b) Sixty days after the owner records a notice of completion or
cessation.”
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 8180, “completion of a work of improvement” happens “upon
the occurrence” of any one of four enumerated events, including “[a]ctual
completion of the work of improvement,” “[o]ccupation of use by the owner
accompanied by cessation of labor,” “[c]essation of labor for a continuous
period of 60 days,” or “[r]ecordation of a notice of cessation after cessation
of labor for a continuous period of 30 days.” 
Again, on May 22, 2024, BPI executed a
“Form of Final Completion Certificate;” this was executed by Blue Sky XIII on
June 7 and 21, 2024. (Verified Complaint, ¶ 8, Exh. B; Raveh Decl., ¶ 4.)
Further, on August 22, 2024, BPI sent correspondence addressed to Blue Sky XIII
with an enclosed BPI accounting spreadsheet and invoices reflecting that the
“Final Completion Milestone” for the solar system at the subject property was
achieved on May 21, 2024. (Verified Complaint, ¶ 9; Medina Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. E.)
May 21, 2024 is 178 days before November 15, 2024. 
BPI also included a handwritten
“Completion Date: 6/21/2024” on its September 23, 2024 Claim of Lien. (Nov. 25,
2024 RJN, Exh. 1.) 
BPI
now asserts that “[t]he last day of work on the project was July 2, 2024 and no
work has been done since.” (Opp., 8:11.) BPI’s statement, however, is supported
entirely by Peterson’s declaration, which is devoid of any facts regarding the
work performed by BPI on July 2, 2024.
BPI
further contends that the November 15, 2024 Claim of Lien is not untimely
because the contract was terminated on October 10, 2024, when Blue Sky Utility
filed a lawsuit against BPI in case styled Blue Sky Utility LLC, et al. v.
Bright Power, Inc., Case No. 24CV001768. (Opp., 3:14-18 and 7:23-24.) BPI
improperly conflates the filing of a lawsuit for breach of contract with the
termination of a contract. At any rate, under BPI’s logic that the filing of a
lawsuit is a termination of the contract and equal to “completion” of the
contract under the mechanic’s lien statutes, Plaintiffs point out that
“completion” would have occurred even earlier on April 5, 2024, when BPI sued
Plaintiffs in case styled Bright Power Inc. v. Blue Sky Utilities LLC, et
al., Case No. 24CV000547.
With
respect to the second ground, “when a release states that the claim of lien has
been fully satisfied. . . the claimant’s inchoate right to a lien, upon which
any claim of lien is based, is extinguished, because then the underlying
obligation has been paid according to the express terms of the release. (Solit
v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1444.) The
“Mechanic’s Lien Release” recorded on November 14, 2024 provides as follows:
          “The Mechanic’s Lien claimed by Bright
Power, Inc. against ROIC Diamond Hills Plaza, LLC, upon the following described
real property in the City of Diamond Bar, County of Los Angeles, State of
California, as described as 2711 S Diamond Bar Blvd., Diamond Bar, CA 91765 is
hereby fully released, the claim thereunder having been fully paid and
satisfied, and that certain Notice of Mechanic’s Lien for $1,862,616.25 for
engineering, designing, constructing, furnishing, and installing renewable
energy system facilities recorded as Instrument No. 20240647578 on 9/23/202, of
Official Records of Los Angeles County, California is hereby satisfied and
released.” (Nov. 25, 2024 RJN, Exh. 2.)
BPI
argues that language contained in the “Mechanic’s Lien Release” recorded
November 14, 2024 that BPI’s lien claim was “fully paid and satisfied” and is
hereby “satisfied and released” was made in error and has since been corrected
by the recording of an Amended Release. (Peterson Decl., ¶ 15, Exh. A; Dec. 13,
2024 Supp. Glickfeld Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) BPI, however, has not provided the
Court with authority that it may undo the effect of the November 14, 2024
release by simply recording an amended release that purports to “supersede and
replace” the November 14, 2024 release.
The
Court finds that Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer
irreparable harm and are under imminent risk of default on the Lease as a
direct result of BPI’s recording of the September 23, 2024 and November 15,
2024 Claims of Liens and that, as such, Plaintiffs are entitled to immediate
relief in the form of an order expunging the November 15, 2024 Claim of Lien.
Further,
the Court is inclined to impose a permanent injunction restraining BPI from
recording a claim of mechanic’s lien on the subject property, based on BPI’s
action in recording the November 15, 2024 Claim of Lien (the day after
representing to the Court that the September 23, 2024 Claim of Lien was being
released). The Court will hear further from the parties in this regard at the
hearing, including as to whether a permanent injunction (as opposed to a preliminary
injunction) is appropriate at this juncture, but it appears to the Court that
there is no further evidence to present or develop such that a permanent
injunction is appropriate.
