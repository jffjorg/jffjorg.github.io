BACKGROUND
 
On April 25, 2022, Plaintiff Dunn Investment Properties, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Carles M. Johnson; Sheila S. Johnson; and Does 1 to 25, for unlawful
detainer at 24773 Avenue Rockefeller, Santa Clarita, CA 91355 (the “Premises”).
 
On January 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”), which serves as the operative pleading. Subsequently, 
 
On May 30, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for
summary adjudication on possession only. (5/30/23 Minute Order). Subsequently,
on June 2, 2023, on June 2, 2023, Plaintiff applied for a Writ of Possession.
 
On June 30, 2023, Defendants filed their Notice of Appeal.
 
On August 18, 2023, the Court denied Defendants’ Ex-Parte
Application to Stay Pending Appeal. (8/18/23 Minute Order).
 
On October 5, 2023, the Writ of Possession was fully
satisfied for Plaintiff’s possession. (10/5/23 Return on Execution).
 
On January 17, 2024, the Second Appellate District issued
an Appellate Order dismissing Defendants’ appeal filed on June 30, 2022. 
 
 The instant motion
was filed on August 17, 2023. No opposing papers or replying papers were filed.

 
Trial for monetary damages is set for April 29, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1176, subdivision (a) states, in part:
“An appeal taken by the defendant
shall not automatically stay proceedings upon the judgment. Petition for stay
of the judgment pending appeal shall first be directed to the judge before whom
it was rendered. Stay of judgment shall be granted when the court finds that
the moving party will suffer extreme hardship in the absence of a stay and that
the nonmoving party will not be irreparably injured by its issuance....”
 
Here, Defendants have requested
that the Court stay the execution pending Defendants’ appeal of its
summary adjudication, dated May 30, 2023, which
awarded Plaintiff possession only of the Premises. (Mot. at 2.)
 
However, the
Court of Appeal issued its Appellate Order, dismissing Defendants’ appeal, on
January 17, 2024. Consequently, there is no longer any pending appeal, which
serves as a fundamental basis for the instant motion. Moreover, Plaintiff’s
possession of the Premises was satisfied on October 5, 2023, subsequent to
Defendants’ filing of the instant motion. The Court also noted a defect in
Defendant’s proof of service of the motion. 
 
Accordingly, the
Court deems Defendants’ Motion for Stay of Execution Pending Appeal is TAKEN
OFF CALENDAR as MOOT.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’ Motion to Stay Execution Pending Appeal is TAKEN
OFF CALENDAR as MOOT.
 
Moving party to provide notice.
