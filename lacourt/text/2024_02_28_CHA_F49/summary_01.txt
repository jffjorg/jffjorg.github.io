```

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion for stay of execution pending appeal is taken off calendar as moot. The defendants had requested a stay of the execution of the order issued on May 30, 2023, which granted the plaintiff possession of the premises. However, the Court of Appeal issued its appellate order dismissing the defendants' appeal on January 17, 2024, and the plaintiff's possession of the premises was satisfied on October 5, 2023. Additionally, the defendants' proof of service of the motion lacks the name and signature of the declarant, making it defective under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013b. As a result, the motion is deemed moot and is taken off calendar.
