And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge denies Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the Sixth Cause of Action for Harassment and the Seventh Cause of Action for Failure to Prevent Harassment. The judge finds that the evidence presented by Plaintiff creates a triable issue of fact on the harassment cause of action. The judge also denies Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the Third and Fourth Causes of Action for Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Provide Reasonable Accommodations, as Plaintiff has abandoned these claims.

The judge grants Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the First Cause of Action for Discrimination, the Second Cause of Action for Failure to Prevent Discrimination, and the Fifth Cause of Action for Retaliation, as Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact on these causes of action.

The judge also grants Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the Third and Fourth Causes of Action for Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Provide Reasonable Accommodations, as Plaintiff has abandoned these claims.
