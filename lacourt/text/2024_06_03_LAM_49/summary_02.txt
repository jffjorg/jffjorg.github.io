And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Michael Foods, Inc., demurred to the third and fourth causes of action, alleging that the plaintiff, Eggs Unlimited LLC, failed to plead an "independently wrongful act" in its claims for intentional and negligent interference with economic advantage. The judge agreed with the demurrer, holding that the plaintiff's allegations of the defendant's wrongs were insufficient to state a cause of action. The judge gave the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint, requiring the plaintiff to provide more detailed facts about the defendant's concealment of its arrangement with Hen Haven, LLC, and the plaintiff's breach of its contract with Eggs Unlimited. The judge ordered the defendant to file an answer within 21 days.
