And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a slander of title action brought by 9450 Topanga Properties, LLC (Topanga) against NYGARD FOUNDATION, et al. Topanga claims that a deed of trust recorded against the property has slandered Topanga's title. The Judge has sustained the defendants' demurrer (a legal challenge to the complaint) with 20 days' leave to amend. The Judge found that Topanga's first cause of action for disparagement of title fails because Topanga executed and delivered the deed of trust with authority. The Judge also found that Topanga's second cause of action for quiet title fails because Topanga did not allege facts showing why the deed of trust is invalid. The Judge notes that Topanga has conceded that it has not alleged any facts showing that the defendants knew that the manager who executed the deed of trust was acting without authority.
