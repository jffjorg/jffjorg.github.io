 **English Summary:**

The judge tentatively ruled in favor of the Nygard Foundation, dismissing the lawsuit filed by 9450 Topanga Properties, LLC.  

The lawsuit alleged that Nygard Foundation illegally recorded a Deed of Trust against the property owned by Topanga.  Topanga claimed they never authorized the loan secured by the Deed of Trust and that the Deed of Trust was therefore invalid.

The judge found that Topanga failed to provide enough evidence to support their claims.  Topanga admitted that the Deed of Trust was signed by their manager, and there was no evidence that the signature was forged.  Because Topanga did not allege that Nygard Foundation knew the manager was acting without authority, the judge ruled that the Deed of Trust was valid and dismissed the lawsuit.

**English Text Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Moreton has issued a tentative ruling on the Nygard Foundation's demurrer in the case of 9450 Topanga Properties, LLC v. Nygard Foundation. The lawsuit concerns a dispute over a Deed of Trust (DOT) recorded against Topanga's property, which Topanga claims slanders its title.

The Judge is inclined to sustain the demurrer, meaning he agrees with Nygard Foundation that Topanga's complaint is currently legally insufficient. For the slander of title claim, the Judge notes that Topanga admits its manager, Angela Dyborn, executed the DOT, and there are no allegations of forgery. While Topanga argues Dyborn lacked authority, it hasn't alleged that Nygard Foundation knew about this lack of authority. Since Topanga is a limited liability company, the act of a manager binds the company unless the other party had actual knowledge of the manager's lack of authority.

Similarly, the Judge finds the quiet title claim deficient. Topanga hasn't sufficiently shown that the DOT is invalid, especially since it was signed by Topanga's manager and there's no evidence Nygard Foundation knew of any lack of authority.

Therefore, the Judge tentatively rules to sustain the demurrer, but grants Topanga 20 days leave to amend its complaint to address these deficiencies, specifically to allege facts showing Nygard Foundation knew Dyborn lacked the authority to execute the DOT.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant, Nygard Foundation, in this slander of title and quiet title case. The Plaintiff, 9450 Topanga Properties, LLC, claims that a Deed of Trust recorded against their property by Nygard is invalid. The Judge found that Topanga's claims are insufficient. The Deed of Trust was signed by Angela Dyborn, a manager of Topanga, and under California law, a manager's actions generally bind the LLC. Topanga argued Dyborn lacked authority, but crucially, did *not* allege that Nygard *knew* she lacked authority. Because of this missing element, and because Topanga admitted the Deed of Trust was signed by its manager, the Judge sustained Nygard's demurrer (a legal challenge to the sufficiency of the claims). However, the Judge granted Topanga 20 days to amend their complaint, meaning they have an opportunity to add facts and arguments to address the deficiencies identified by the Court. If they can't sufficiently amend the complaint, the claims will likely be dismissed.
