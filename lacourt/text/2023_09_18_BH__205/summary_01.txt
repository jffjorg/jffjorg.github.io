 **English Summary:**

The judge tentatively ruled in favor of the Nygard Foundation, dismissing the lawsuit filed by 9450 Topanga Properties, LLC.  

The lawsuit alleged that Nygard Foundation illegally recorded a Deed of Trust against the property owned by Topanga.  Topanga claimed they never authorized the loan secured by the Deed of Trust and that the Deed of Trust was therefore invalid.

The judge found that Topanga failed to provide enough evidence to support their claims.  Topanga admitted that the Deed of Trust was signed by their manager, and there was no evidence that the signature was forged.  Because Topanga did not allege that Nygard Foundation knew the manager was acting without authority, the judge ruled that the Deed of Trust was valid and dismissed the lawsuit.
