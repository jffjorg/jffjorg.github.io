```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Marcia Kirschbaum's motion to set aside judgment and any default and to quash any writ of possession or execution. The motion was filed on August 21, 2023, before a judgment had been entered, making it premature. Additionally, the 22-page memorandum filed by Defendant exceeds the 15-page limit for opening memoranda and lacks a table of contents and a table of authorities, and the Court will refuse to consider it. The Court had previously found in favor of Plaintiff Tamara Bitner in an unlawful detainer action, awarding her $40,000 for past due rent and $32,000 for holdover fees and attorney costs.
