**English Text Summary:**

Judge Moreton issued a tentative ruling denying Marcia Kirschbaum's motion to set aside a judgment and quash a writ of possession in an unlawful detainer case brought by Tamara Bitner. The Judge treated Kirschbaum's motion as one for a new trial but found it premature because it was filed before a judgment was formally entered. Furthermore, the Judge refused to consider Kirschbaum's supporting memorandum because it exceeded the page limit without prior authorization and lacked a table of contents and authorities.  The original case involved Bitner suing Kirschbaum for back rent and possession of property after Kirschbaum failed to appear at trial.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. has tentatively DENIED Defendant Marcia Kirschbaum's motion to set aside the judgment, default, and any writ of possession in the unlawful detainer case brought against her by Plaintiff Tamara Bitner.  The judge's reasoning is twofold: First, Kirschbaum's motion was filed *before* a formal judgment was even entered, making it premature and void. Second, Kirschbaum's supporting legal memorandum was excessively long (22 pages when the limit is 15 without prior court approval) and failed to include a required table of contents and table of authorities. Because of these procedural defects, the Court refused to consider the substance of Kirschbaum's arguments. The original judgment, which awarded Bitner $40,000 in back rent, $32,000 in holdover fees, and attorney costs (yet to be determined), stands. Kirschbaum's claims of tort conversion, trespass, lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, and an invalid judgment were not substantively addressed due to the procedural errors.
