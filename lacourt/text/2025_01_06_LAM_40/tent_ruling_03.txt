[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING OFF CALENDAR
DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO AND MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF THE COMPLAINT
 
        This action arises from Defendant’s
alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  On October 21, 2024, Defendant filed this
demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint filed on September 18,
2024. On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint. 
        Plaintiff
can amend the complaint once as a matter of course "if the amended
pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to
the demurrer or motion to strike." (Code
Civ. Proc., § 472.) Plaintiff’s opposition to the
demurrer and motion to strike were due on December 20, 2024, nine court days
before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 subd. (b).) Plaintiff filed the
first amended complaint on that date. 
        Accordingly,
the court takes off calendar the demurrer to and motion to strike as the
original complaint is no longer operative. (Fireman's
Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks Construction, Inc.
(2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1144. [“It is well
established that an amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which
ceases to perform any function as a pleading.”].)
