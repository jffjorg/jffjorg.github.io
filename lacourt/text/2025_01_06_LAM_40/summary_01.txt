And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion for an order to show cause re contempt. The motion was made because Plaintiff failed to comply with Judge Richardson's order to file a redacted version of the complaint and first amended complaint (FAC) within five court days. Defendant argued that Plaintiff's conduct was contemptuous because the pleadings included misleading and defamatory allegations against Defendant, and that Plaintiff refused to take appropriate corrective action.

Plaintiff argued that she was unable to comply with the order due to an emergent medical condition that required her to undergo surgeries and hospitalization. Despite her attempts to lodge the redacted pleadings, she was unable to do so until after her convalescence.

The judge found that Defendant had not shown that Plaintiff's conduct was willful disobedience of Judge Richardson's order. Given the seriousness of Plaintiff's medical condition, it was not possible for her to render compliance with the order. The judge also noted that the confluence of events over the holiday period did not constitute "willful disobedience" sufficient to give the court jurisdiction over a contempt proceeding.
