And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant State of California, acting by and through the State of California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, in a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Megan Werner. The plaintiff alleges that she was attacked by a mountain lion while walking her dog and seeks damages for negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and a dangerous condition of public property.

The court finds that the plaintiff's claims for negligence per se for violations of California Fish & Game Code §§ 1801, 4801, and 4803 fail as a matter of law because the statutes do not impose a specific duty on the state to control wild animals. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress fail because the state does not own or control wild animals.

The court does find that the plaintiff's fourth cause of action, alleging a dangerous condition of public property, is not necessarily barred by the statute of limitations and will be considered further at the hearing.
