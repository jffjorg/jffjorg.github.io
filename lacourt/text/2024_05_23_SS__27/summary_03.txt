Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the City of Los Angeles for indemnity and declaratory relief. The defendants discovered that the City was responsible for the maintenance and repair of the sidewalk and driveway where the incident occurred. As the cross-complaint is mandatory, the court must grant leave to file the cross-complaint absent bad faith. The court has attached a copy of the proposed cross-complaint to the motion. No opposition was filed, and the court grants the motion.
