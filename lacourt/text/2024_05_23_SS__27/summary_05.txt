The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. The motion seeks to protect confidential information from discovery by the plaintiff, John Merriett. The judge noted that Uber's motion is overly broad and does not provide sufficient justification for the blanket protective order sought. The judge also found that Uber failed to meet and confer with opposing counsel on specific discovery requests that might disclose trade secrets. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, ordering Uber to give notice. The judge also noted that trial court orders are not binding authority, and that absent applicable statutory or appellate authority, the motion was denied.
