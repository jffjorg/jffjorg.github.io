And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted summary judgment for the claims against Samantha Wagner, as she was not involved in the accident and had no relation to the vehicle involved. The judge has denied summary adjudication of the claims against Jason Wagner, as there are triable issues of fact. The judge found that Jason Wagner's sudden loss of consciousness was not reasonably foreseeable, and that he failed to meet his initial burden to show that the accident was unavoidable. The judge also noted that reasonable minds could differ on whether Jason Wagner acted reasonably under the circumstances.
