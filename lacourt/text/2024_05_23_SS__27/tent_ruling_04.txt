MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
Hearing Date: 5/23/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV23141 MEGAN WERNER, AN
INDIVIDUAL vs STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Moving Party: Defendant State of
California acting by and through the State of California Department of Fish and
Wildlife and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy; Joined by City of Los Angeles, Department of Recreation and
Parks, and Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
IS GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART
 
Background
On 9/25/23, Plaintiff
filed the present case, alleging that she was attacked by a mountain lion
approximately 1.2 miles from Griffith Park while walking her dog on a sidewalk in
a residential area. Plaintiff asserts four causes of action: 1) Negligence per
se for violations of California Fish & Game Code §§ 1801, 4801, and 4803; 2)
Negligence; 3) Negligent infliction of emotional distress; and 4) Dangerous
condition of public property against multiple public entities. Defendant State
of California, acting by and through the State of California Department of Fish
and Wildlife and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, now moves the court
for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that they did not violate any provisions
of California Fish & Game Code as the statue does not mandate the state to
"take" the mountain lion upon reports of depredation. Defendants
further contend that Plaintiff’s negligence and negligent infliction of
emotional distress claims fail because the state has no duty to control wild
animals, and the dangerous condition claim also fails because a mountain lion
does not constitute a physical condition of a public property. City of Los
Angeles, Department of Recreation and Parks, and Mountains Recreation and
Conservation Authority joined The State of California in its Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings.
Legal Standard 
 
A defendant’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings may be made after the time to demur has expired and an answer has
been filed. (CCP § 438(f).) A motion by a defendant may be made on the grounds
that (1) the court “lacks jurisdiction of the subject of one or more of the
causes of action alleged” or (2) the complaint or cross-complaint “does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”
(CCP § 438(c).) 
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings has
the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects
disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially
noticed.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995,
999.) “A motion for judgment on the pleadings is akin to a general demurrer; it
tests the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action.” (Wise v.
Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 725, 738.) 
 
Like a general demurrer, “ordinarily, a
[motion for judgment on the pleadings] does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action, and if any part of a cause of action is properly pleaded, the
[motion] will be overruled.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) In considering a motion for judgment on the
pleadings, courts consider whether properly pled factual allegations—assumed to
be true and liberally construed—are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
(Stone Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State Lottery Com’n (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 109, 116.)
 
Discussion
1.  Negligence
Per Se for Alleged Violations of California Fish & Game Code §§ 1801, 4801,
And 4803
          Plaintiff’s claim of negligence per se for alleged violations of California Fish & Game Code §§ 1801, 4801, and 4803 fails as a matter of law.            California Fish & Game Code § 1801 articulates the state's policy to encourage the preservation, conservation, and maintenance of wildlife resources, outlining numerous objectives for this policy.           California Fish & Game Code § 4801 provides “The department may remove or take any mountain lion, or authorize an appropriate local agency with public safety responsibility to remove or take any mountain lion, that is perceived to be an imminent threat to public health or safety or that is perceived by the department to be an imminent threat to the survival of any threatened, endangered, candidate, or fully protected sheep species.” 
          California Fish & Game Code § 4802 provides “Any person, or the employee or agent of
a person, whose livestock or other property is being or has been injured,
damaged, or destroyed by a mountain lion may report that fact to the department
and request a permit to take the mountain lion.”
 
          California Fish & Game Code § 4803 provides “Upon receipt of a report pursuant to
Section 4802, the department, or any animal damage control officer specifically
authorized by the department to carry out this responsibility, shall immediately
take the action necessary to confirm that there has been depredation by a
mountain lion as reported. The confirmation process shall be completed as
quickly as possible, but in no event more than 48 hours after receiving the
report. If satisfied that there has been depredation by a mountain lion as
reported, the department shall promptly issue a permit to take the depredating
mountain lion.”
 
          California Fish & Game Code § 4806 provides “Any person issued a permit pursuant to Section 4803 or 4805 shall report, by telephone within 24 hours, the capturing, injuring, or killing of any mountain lion to an office of the department or, if telephoning is not practicable, in writing within five days after the capturing, injuring, or killing of the mountain lion. At the time
of making the report of the capturing, injuring, or
killing, the
holder of the permit shall make arrangements to turn
over the
mountain lion or the entire carcass of the mountain
lion which has been recovered to a representative of the department and shall
do so in a timely manner.”
 
California Fish &
Game Code §§ 1801 and 4801 do not establish grounds for a negligence per se
claim as they fail to impose a specific statutory duty enforceable under such a
claim. Section 1801 primarily sets forth broad objectives for the preservation,
conservation, and maintenance of wildlife resources, serving as a policy
guideline rather than a directive imposing legal obligations. Meanwhile,
Section 4801 uses discretionary language ("may"), allowing but not
requiring the department to act in the removal or taking of a mountain lion
deemed an imminent threat to public health or safety or to endangered wildlife
species. 
In contrast, Section
4803 does delineate a specific duty: upon receiving a report under Section
4802, the department is required to verify reports of depredation by a mountain
lion within a strict timeframe and, if confirmed, to issue a permit to take the
mountain lion. However, this duty is directed towards ensuring a response to
private parties' reports of depredation, not towards mandating state action in
controlling or taking the mountain lion itself. The statute assigns the
responsibility for dealing with the mountain lion to the permit holder, not to
the state. As detailed in Section 4806, once a permit is issued, the holder
must report any action taken against a mountain lion and arrange for the
turnover of the carcass to the department, demonstrating that it is the role of
the private party rather than the state in addressing the specific threat.
The statutory duties
outlined in these sections do not support a claim of negligence per se against
the state as alleged in the complaint, where the state allegedly failed to take
the mountain lion despite a prior report of the same mountain lion attacking a
pedestrian's dog. The statutory framework is intended to facilitate the
management of wildlife through engagement with private parties and local
agencies, not to impose direct action requirements on the State itself.
Consequently, Defendant’s negligence per se claim for violations of California
Fish & Game Code §§ 1801, 4801, and 4803 fails as a matter of law. Thus,
Plaintiff’s first cause of action is dismissed without leave to amend. 
2.  Negligence
and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
Butler v. City of Palos
Verdes Estates (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 174 is on
point procedurally and substantively in relation to Plaintiff’s claims for
negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In Butler, plaintiffs
brought several causes of action including negligence and intentional
infliction of emotional distress due to the City's allowance of a feral peafowl
population to proliferate on city-owned lots. The court in Butler affirmed
the decision to sustain the demurrer for the negligence and emotional distress
claims, emphasizing that the state does not own wild animals nor does it
control them. This principle was similarly underscored in Moerman v. State
of California (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th at 452, 455-458, in which despite the
state’s active management of relocated tule elk, including capturing,
releasing, monitoring movements via ear tags and radio collars, attempting to
move them off private property upon complaints, and preparing management plans
involving monitoring, habitat improvement, sport hunting, and necessary
relocation, the court found that the tule elk "are not instrumentalities
of the state nor controlled by the state." Thus, Plaintiff’s second and
third causes of action for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress
are dismissed without leave to amend. 
3.  Dangerous
Condition of Public Property 
Plaintiff asserts two
theories regarding how the mountain lion constitutes a dangerous condition of
public property. First, Plaintiff argues that the mountain lion itself is
public property, and due to its history of prior attacks on humans and dogs, it
is dangerous. Second, Plaintiff contends that the sidewalk in the residential
area where Defendant was attacked is the public property, and the presence of
the mountain lion created a dangerous condition on that property.
A “dangerous condition”
is defined as “a condition of property that creates a substantial (as
distinguished from a minor, trivial, or insignificant) risk of injury when such
property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably
foreseeable that it will be used.” (Gov. Code, § 830, subd. (a)). The Court has
determined that a mountain lion does not qualify as public property under this
legal framework, since it is not a property intended for public use. Although
there have been varying judicial interpretations in cases such as Arroyo v.
State of California (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 755, Butler, supra, and Moerman
v. State of California, supra, regarding whether wild animals are property
of the state, these discussions do not address the Gov. Code § 830 analysis.
This statute is specifically concerned with tangible public property like
sidewalks that are designated for public use. Consequently, a mountain lion,
which is neither intended for public use nor being used by the public, cannot
be considered a public property under this statute.
However, a dangerous
condition can exist not only when public property is physically damaged,
deteriorated, or defective in such a way as to foreseeably endanger those using
the property, but also when the location or property’s relationship to its
surroundings endangers users. (Hernandez v. City of Stockton (2023) 90
Cal.App.5th 1222, 1230). Garcia v. American Golf Corp. (2017) 11
Cal.App.5th 532 underscores this point. 
In that case, the court denied summary judgment in a scenario where a
plaintiff was injured by an errant golf ball while walking on a public pathway
adjacent to a golf course, illustrating how the relationship of the property to
its surroundings can create a dangerous condition. 
Moreover, immunity
under Gov Code Section 831.2 is inapplicable to the present case. Section 831.2
states that neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an
injury caused by a natural condition of any unimproved public property,
including but not limited to any natural condition of any lake, stream, bay,
river, or beach. Given that the incident occurred on a sidewalk in a
residential area, and not in a park, beach, or unimproved public property, the
immunity provided under Section 831.2 does not apply.  Thus, at this early stage in the proceedings,
Plaintiff's fourth cause of action is not dismissed.
Conclusion
For the foregoing
reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted without leave to amend as to
the first, second and third causes of action and denied as to the fourth cause
of action.
