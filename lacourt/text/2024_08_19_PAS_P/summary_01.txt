And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion filed by plaintiff Anthony Adefuye to set aside or vacate the judgment entered against him on February 27, 2024. The motion was filed on July 25, 2024, which is outside of the deadline for electronic service. Additionally, the motion was not properly served on the other defendants, as parties are not allowed to serve documents directly on other parties. The judge also finds that the motion is factually baseless, as the reporter's transcript reflects that plaintiff acted as his own attorney throughout the trial and did not have counsel appointed to him.
