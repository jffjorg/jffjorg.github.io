  Order RE:
 
petition for approval of compromise of claim
  for minor claimant 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner Shakiesha Cleveland
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Claimant 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Petitioner Shakiesha Cleveland (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval of
the settlement made on behalf of minor claimant Rayshaun Young (“Minor
Claimant”) in this action.
The compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only
after it has been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.¿
(Prob. Code, § 3500.)¿ The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise, and must be prepared on Judicial Council form
MC-350.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿
            Defendant Alexis Nolan has agreed to
settle this action for a total amount of $15,000.  (MC-350, ¶¶ 10, 16.)  Of the $15,000 allocated to Minor Claimant, $3,736.75
will be used to pay Minor Claimant’s medical expenses, $3,750 will be paid to
counsel for attorney’s fees, and $720.72 will be paid to counsel for
costs.  (MC-350, ¶¶ 12, subd. (a)(4), 13,
16.)  The remaining $6,792.43 will be
deposited in an insured account, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of
the court.  (MC-350, ¶¶ 15-16, 18, subd.
(b)(2).) 
            The court has reviewed the petition
and finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable, and in the best interest of
Minor Claimant.  The court further finds
that the declaration of Bob B. Khakshooy is sufficient to support the request
for $3,750 in attorney’s fees, which represents 25 percent of the $15,000
settlement.  (Khakshooy Decl., ¶¶ 1,
5-10, 13.)  The court therefore grants
Petitioner’s petition.
ORDER
            The court grants petitioner
Shakiesha Cleveland’s petition for approval of the compromise of claim for
plaintiff and minor claimant Rayshaun Young. 
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re filing of Receipt and Acknowledgement of Order for the Deposit of
Money into Blocked Account (form MC-356) for hearing on February 10, 2025, at
8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders petitioner
Shakiesha Cleveland to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
