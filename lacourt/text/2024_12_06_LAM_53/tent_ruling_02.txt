  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for interlocutory
  judgment of partition by default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Janet Dein     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Interlocutory Judgment of Partition by Default
Plaintiff Janet Dein (“Plaintiff”) filed the Verified Complaint for
Partition by Sale of Real Property on April 10, 2024 against defendant Peggy
Trujillo (“Defendant”),[1]
seeking partition by sale of the real property located at 21322 Millpoint
Avenue, Carson, California, 90745 (the “Property”).
The clerk entered Defendant’s default on July 10, 2024. 
Plaintiff now requests that the court enter interlocutory judgment of
partition of sale by default. 
Plaintiff has alleged, and therefore Defendant has confessed, that (1)
Plaintiff and Defendant each hold a one-half interest in the Property (Compl.,
¶ 10), such that Plaintiff has the absolute right to partition, and (2) the
sale and division of the proceeds would be more equitable than division of the Property
since the Property is a single-family home, making a division in kind
unfeasible (Compl., ¶ 32).  (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 281 [judgment by
default confesses material facts alleged by the plaintiff]; Code Civ. Proc., §§
872.710, subd. (b) [“partition as to concurrent interests in the property shall
be as of right unless barred by a valid waiver”], 872.820 [the court shall
order the property be sold if the court determines that, under the
circumstances, sale and division of the proceeds would be more equitable than
division].)  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has alleged facts establishing
that (1) Plaintiff has the right to partition the Property, and (2) under the
circumstances, it is more equitable to partition the Property by sale.  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
request for interlocutory judgment of partition by default.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.720, subd. (a) [“If
the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to partition, it shall make an
interlocutory judgment that determines the interests of the parties in the
property and orders the partition of the property and, unless it is to be later
determined, the manner of partition”].)  The
court also grants Plaintiff’s request to appoint as partition referee Matthew
Taylor. 
            The court will sign and file the “[Proposed]
Interlocutory Judgment for Partition by Sale” lodged by Plaintiff on October
11, 2024.
The court sets (1) an Order to Show Cause re entry of judgment of
partition of real property, and (2) a Status Conference re partition of
property by sale on April 8, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 6, 2024
