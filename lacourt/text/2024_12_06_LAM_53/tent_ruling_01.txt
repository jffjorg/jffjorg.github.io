Objections Nos. 1-6 are overruled. 
The court rules on plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s evidentiary
objections, filed on August 30, 2024, as follows: 
Objections Nos. 1-4 are overruled. 
MOTION TO COMPEL ADDITIONAL TIME TO
EXAMINE DEFENDANT YANG LU
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order compelling defendant Yang Lu
(“Defendant”) to sit for further deposition “for at least seven (7) hours and
if the deposition is not completed after seven (7) hours, the taking of the
deposition shall be continued from day to day thereafter . . . until completed
. . . .”  (Mot., p. 6:4-7.) 
“[A] deposition examination of
the witness by all counsel, other than the witness’ counsel of record, shall be
limited to seven hours of total testimony. 
The court shall allow additional time, beyond any limits imposed by this
section, if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another
person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.290, subd. (a).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion in part as follows. 
First, the court (1) finds
that Plaintiff has shown that it needs additional time beyond the seven-hour
limit to fairly depose Defendant since Defendant’s use of a Mandarin
interpreter required additional time to carry out the deposition, and therefore
(2) grants Plaintiff’s request for an order permitting Plaintiff to depose
Defendant for additional time.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.290, subd. (a).)  The
court finds that an additional five hours is a reasonable amount of time to
require Defendant to sit for deposition. 

Second, the court denies
Plaintiff’s request that the court permit Plaintiff to depose Defendant for an
unspecified time “until [the deposition] is completed[.]”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.290, subd. (a).) 
The court denies Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
AND SUPPLEMENTAL DEOPSITION TESTIMONY
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to produce documents and supplemental
deposition testimony in connection with Plaintiff’s Second and Third Amended
Notices of Taking Deposition and Demand for Production of Documents, numbers
3-8, 13-15, 18-21, 23-24, 28-29, 33-36, 49-50, 56-59, 66-68, 70-80, 82-105,
107-115, 117-122, 124-125, 143-144, 150-156, 158-162, 168-176, 183, 186, 188,
191, 193-195, 197-203, and 222, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $16,303.75.
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant to produce documents responsive to Requests for
Production of Documents, numbers 3-8, 13-15, 18-21, 23-24, 28-29, 33-36, 49-50,
56-59, 66-68, 70-80, 82-105, 107-115, 117-122, 124-125, 143-144, 150-156, 158-162,
168-176, 183, 186, 188, 191, 193-195, 197-203, and 222 because the court finds
that Defendant’s objections based on undue burden have merit and that this
method of discovery (document requests included in a notice of deposition) is
unduly burdensome taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in
controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, since
(1) although Plaintiff has not moved to compel the production of documents to
all of the requests set forth in the notice, Plaintiff served a total of 222
requests for production of documents in connection with the Third Amended
Notice of Deposition, and (2) many of those demands are overbroad and include
contention document requests, which do not specify with reasonable
particularity the category of materials to be produced.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2019.030, subd. (a)(2)
[“The court shall restrict the frequency or extent of use of a discovery method
provided in Section 2019.010 if it determines” that “[t]he selected method of
discovery is unduly burdensome . . . , taking into account the needs of the
case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in
the litigation”], 2025.220, subd. (a)(4); Chan Decl., Ex. D, Pl. Third Amended
Notice of Taking Deposition of Yang Lu.)  The court denies Plaintiff’s motion without
prejudice to Plaintiff’s serving demands for inspection on Defendant pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.010 et seq. that are reasonable in
number and scope. 
            The
court denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (j).) 
            The
court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(j).)  The court finds that $1,800 (4
hours x $450 per hour) is a reasonable amount of monetary sanctions to impose
against Plaintiff in connection with this motion.  (Chenette Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Production of Documents, Set 13, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $3,031.65.
If a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve
a timely response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)¿¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendant with its Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 13, on November 22, 2023, by email.  (Chan Decl., Ex. A.)  Defendant did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Mot., p. 4:13 [“At the filing of the instant
motion, Defendant’s counsel has not issued responses”].)  Defendant did not file an opposition or other
evidence establishing that responses have since been served.  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  The court finds that $699.15 ((1.5 hours x
$425 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fees) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to
impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Chan Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.)
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of an additional $250 in sanctions unjust and therefore denies that
request.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050,
subds. (a), (c); Chan Decl., ¶ 14.) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel additional time to fairly examine
defendant Yang Lu as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.290, subdivision (a), the court orders that plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D. may depose defendant Yang Lu for an additional five hours.
            The court denies plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel production of documents and supplemental
deposition testimony and for monetary sanctions. 
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc. to pay monetary sanctions to defendant Yang Lu in the amount of
$1,800 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court grants plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel responses to production of documents and for
monetary sanctions as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, the court orders defendant Yang Lu (1) to serve on plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. full and complete verified responses, without
objections, to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 13, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. all
documents and things in defendant Yang Lu’s possession,
custody, or control which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of
the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. in the amount of
$699.15 within 30 days of the date of service of this order.
            
 
 
The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
