Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession to recover two tractor trucks from the defendants, ASE Construction, Inc. and Sergio Moreno Morales. The trucks are currently in the possession of the defendants and are located at Morales' residence.

The court finds that the plaintiff has established probable validity of its claim to possession of the property, which is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendants on that claim. The plaintiff has also established that the defendants have breached the terms of two equipment lease and finance agreements and have failed to make payments.

The court notes that the defendants have filed bankruptcy cases within the past year, but both cases were subsequently dismissed. The court also notes that the defendants have failed to provide insurance information on the trucks and have failed to return the trucks to the plaintiff.

The court orders that the defendants must return the trucks to the plaintiff and that no bond is required as part of the undertaking. The court determines that the defendants have no interest in the property and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the trucks.
