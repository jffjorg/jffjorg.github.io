Background
This is an unlawful detainer action involving the
commercial premises located at 140 N. Orange Avenue in the City of Industry
(“subject property”).
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff 140 North Orange
Investors, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer against
Baldwin Sun, Inc. and Does 1-10.
On May 13, 2024, “Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation
for Judgment for Possession of Real Property” was entered.
Pending before the Court is David Fu’s motion to be
relieved as counsel of record to Defendant Baldwin Sun, Inc. (the “Client”).
For the reasons stated herein, the motion is granted, effective upon the filing
of proof service showing service of the signed order upon the Client.
 
Discussion
The Court
has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.)
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion directed
to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The Court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules Court,
rule 3.1362(e).)
David Fu attests that “[t]he attorney-client
relationship has deteriorated to the point where the attorney can no longer
ethically continue representation.”
Fu states that he served the Client by mail at the Client’s
last known address with copies of the motion papers served with his declaration
and that he has confirmed within the past 30 days that the address is current,
by mail, return receipt requested. 
The motion is not opposed. The Court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated
above have been sufficiently met.
Accordingly,
the motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof of service
showing service of the signed order upon the Client at the Client’s last known
address.  The Court sets an Order to Show
Cause Re: Representation of Corporation for March 3, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
