 Case Number:  24PSCV02775    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  H Crossroads  Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC v. ASE Construction, Inc., et al.,  Case No. 24PSCV02775   ORDER ON APPLICATIONS FOR WRIT OF POSSESSION           1.        Plaintiff Crossroads Equipment Lease  and Finance, LLC’s Application for Writ of Possession After Hearing [i.e., as  to Defendant ASE Construction, Inc.] is GRANTED, with  no bond.             2.        Plaintiff Crossroads Equipment Lease  and Finance, LLC’s Application for Writ of Possession After Hearing [i.e., as  to Defendant Sergio Moreno Morales] is GRANTED,  with no bond. I.        Background  Plaintiff Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC  (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:            On February  12, 2021, Plaintiff and ASE Construction, Inc. (“ASE Construction”) entered  into a Master Equipment Finance Agreement (“Agreement No. 1”), wherein  Plaintiff agreed to finance the purchase of one 2021 Freightliner Model 114SD  tractor truck, VIN No. 3ALHG3FE8MDML9466, with Superior SSTl00SD-21 Dump Body  Serial number 9329 with Super Tag High Lift Gate (“9466 Freightliner”). Sergio  Moreno Morales (“Morales”) executed a written guaranty on that date (“Guaranty  No. 1”). On November 12, 2023 and thereafter, ASE Construction breached the  terms of Agreement No. 1 by failing to make payments due. On April 8, 2021,  Plaintiff and ASE Construction entered into another Master Equipment Finance  Agreement (“Agreement No. 2), wherein Plaintiff agreed to finance the purchase  of one 2021 Freightliner Model 114SD tractor truck, VIN No. 3ALHG3FE9MDMM2330, with  Superior SST100 Supertag Tapered Truck Body Serial number 9339 (“2330  Freightliner”). Morales executed a written guaranty on that date (“Guaranty No.  2). On October 7, 2023 and thereafter, ASE Construction breached the terms of  Agreement No. 2 by failing to make payments due.  On August 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting  causes of action against ASE Construction, Morales and Does 1-100 for:           1.       Breach of Written Agreements (2 Counts),           2.       Breach of Guaranty (2 Counts),           3.       Account Stated,           4.       Unjust Enrichment,           5.       Open Book Account,            6.       Claim and Delivery, and           7.       Conversion.  On November 25, 2024, the Clerk entered default against ASE  Construction and Morales.  A Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re:  Failure to File Proof of Service are set for January 29, 2025. Pending  before the Court are Plaintiff’s applications for writs of possession, whereby  Plaintiff seeks to recover two tractor  trucks now in the possession of ASE Construction and Morales. For the reasons  stated herein, the applications are granted.   II.      Discussion  Plaintiff applies for writs of possession after  hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 512.010 et seq. Plaintiff seeks  to recover the 9466 Freightliner and the 2330  Freightliner, both in the possession of ASE Construction and Morales. “Claim and delivery is a remedy by which a party with a  superior right to a specific item of personal property (created, most commonly,  by a contractual lien) may recover possession of that specific property before  judgment.” (Waffer Internat. Corp. v.  Khorsandi (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1271.) Procedural  Considerations: No writ of possession may issue, except after a hearing on a noticed motion (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.020,  subd. (a)) or by ex parte application satisfying the conditions of section 512.020,  subdivision (b). Prior to the section 512.020 hearing, the defendant must be  served with all of the following: “(a) A copy of the summons and complaint; (b)  A Notice of Application and Hearing; (c) A copy of the application and any  affidavit in support thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030, subd. (a).) “If the  defendant has not appeared in the action, and a writ, notice, order, or other paper is required  to be personally served on the defendant under this title, service shall be  made in the same manner as a summons is served under Chapter 4 (commencing with  Section 413.10) of Title 5.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030, subd.  (b).)   The “Notice of Application and Hearing” must inform the  defendant of all of the following: (a) A hearing will be held at a place and at  a time, to be specified in the notice, on plaintiff’s application for a writ of  possession; (b) The writ will be issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's  claim is probably (not actually) valid and the other requirements for issuing  the writ are established; (c) If the defendant desires to oppose the issuance  of the writ, he must file with the court either an affidavit providing evidence  sufficient to defeat the plaintiff's right to issuance of the writ or an  undertaking to stay the delivery of the property in accordance with section  515.020; (d) The notice must contain the following statement: “If you believe  the plaintiff may not be entitled to possession of the property claimed, you  may wish to seek the advice of an attorney. Such attorney should be consulted  promptly so that he may assist you before the time set for the hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040.) The  Court determines that adequate notice was provided to ASE Construction and  Morales.[FN]  MERITS: As  for the merits of the application, the Court must make its determinations “upon  the basis of the pleadings and other papers in the record; but, upon good cause  shown, the court may receive and consider additional evidence and authority  produced at the hearing or may continue the hearing for the production of such  additional evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or  points and authorities.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.050.) The Court must issue  writ of possession if the plaintiff establishes the “probable validity” of his/her/its  claim to possession of the property and the undertaking requirements of section  515.010 are satisfied. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.060; RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.)  “Probable validity” exists “where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff  will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 511.090; RCA Service Co., supra,  137 Cal.App.3d at 3.)Probable  validity, in this case, has been established pursuant to the declaration of Plaintiff’s  general counsel Rebecca Elli (“Elli”) and the exhibits attached thereto. Elli attests,  and/or the relevant documents reflect, as follows:            On or about February 12, 2021, ASE  Construction entered into Agreement No. 1, wherein Plaintiff agreed to finance  the purchase of the 9466 Freightliner. (Elli Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1.) Morales  executed Guaranty No. 1 on that same date. (Id., ¶ 11, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiff perfected its interest in the 9466 Freightliner by obtaining a  Certificate of Title from the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles  (“DMV”). (Id., ¶ 5, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff performed all of the terms and  conditions of the Agreement No. 1 required to be performed by it. (Id.,  ¶ 6.) On or about November 12, 2023 and thereafter, ASE Construction breached  the terms of Agreement No. 1 by failing to make payments due. (Id., ¶ 7.)  Per the terms of Agreement No. 1, upon ASE Construction’s default, Plaintiff elected  to accelerate the balance due thereunder, the principal balance of which is $139,042.21  as of August 9, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.) No part of this sum has been paid, despite  demand therefore, and there is now due, owing, and unpaid from ASE Construction  a total of $140,741.21 as of August 9, 2024, in addition to interest thereon at  18% per annum thereafter. (Id., ¶ 9.)           On or about April 8, 2022, ASE  Construction entered into Agreement No. 2, wherein Plaintiff agreed to finance  the purchase of the 2330 Freightliner. (Id., ¶ 14, Exh. 4.) Morales  executed Guaranty No. 2 on that same date. (Id., ¶ 21, Exh. 6.)  Plaintiff perfected its interest in the 2330 Freightliner by obtaining a  Certificate of Title from the State of California DMV. (Id., ¶ 15, Exh.  5.) Plaintiff performed all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement No. 2  required to be performed by it. (Id., ¶ 16.) On or about October 7, 2023  and thereafter, ASE Construction breached the terms of Agreement No. 2 by  failing to make payments due. (Id., ¶ 17.) Per the terms of Agreement  No. 2, upon ASE Construction’s default, Plaintiff elected to accelerate the  balance due thereunder, the principal balance of which is $135,350.54 as of  August 9, 2024. (Id., ¶ 18.) No part of this sum has been paid, despite  demand therefore, and there is now due, owing and unpaid from ASE Construction  a total of $135,425.21 as of August 9, 2024, in addition to interest thereon at 18% per annum thereafter. (Id., ¶ 19).  Both Agreements Nos. 1 and 2 and Guaranties Nos. 1 and 2 provide for attorneys’ fees  should legal action be instituted to enforce the terms of the agreements. (Id., ¶¶  10, 13, 20 and 23.)            Plaintiff is informed and believes  that the 9466 Freightliner and the 2330 Freightliner are in the possession or  under the control of ASE Construction and Morales and are currently located behind  a locked gate at 15909 Fellowship Court in La Puente, based on GPS data from  the 2330 Freightliner. (Id., ¶¶ 25, 26 and 41.) The last GPS “ping” from  the 9466 Freightliner was also from the same location. (Id., ¶ 41.) This  is Morales’s residence. (Id.) Plaintiff has made demand upon ASE Construction  and Morales for the return of the 9466 Freightliner and the 2330 Freightliner,  without success. (Id., ¶ 28.) ASE Construction and Morales have also failed  to provide evidence of insurance on the 9466 Freightliner and the 2330 Freightliner,  despite Plaintiff’s demand for this information. (Id., ¶ 40.)            Elli is required as part of her duties  with Plaintiff to know the market price for used trucks and to keep in constant  contact with truck re-marketers. (Id., ¶ 36.) Based on her experience  and on a review of industry-standard J.D. Power values and in consultation with  Plaintiff’s in-house remarketing team, Elli estimates the retail value of the  9466 Freightliner is $145,000.00 to $155,000.00 and the retail value of the 2330  Freightliner is $145,000.00 to $155,000.00, assuming they are in good condition.  (Id.)           Elli reports that “Defendants” have  filed two bankruptcy cases within the past year, but that both cases were  subsequently dismissed. (Id., ¶ 39.) The 9466 Freightliner and the 2330  Freightliner have not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to  statute, and have not been seized under an execution against Plaintiff’s property.  (App., ¶ 8; see also, Elli Decl., ¶ 29.)    Based  on the aforementioned showing, the Applications are granted. Undertaking: A bond must be posted as part of the  undertaking unless the Court finds that the defendant has no interest in the  property.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010,  subd. (b).) The undertaking must be at least in an amount equal to twice the  value of the defendant’s interest in the property (market value less all liens,  etc.).  (Id.) The defendant’s  interest is based on the market value of the property less (1) any amount due  and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement, (2) all  liens and encumbrances on the property, and (3) any other factors to determine  the defendant’s interest in the property.   (Id.) Again,  Elli has advised that $140,741.21 is owed on Agreement No. 1 and that $135,425.21  is owed on Agreement No. 2, as of August 9, 2024 and that the value of both  the 9466 Freightliner and the 2330 Freightliner is between $145,000.00 and $155,000.00.  The Court considers the fact that the above valuation assumes the 9466  Freightliner and the 2330 Freightliner are both in good condition, which, as Elli  attests, “is unlikely since Defendants are not paying for them.” (Elli Decl., ¶  36.) The  Court also considers the fact that interest continues to accrue on the balances  owed and that Agreements Nos. 1 and 2 and Guaranties Nos. 1 and 2 all make provision  for attorneys’ fees.  Under  these circumstances, the Court will not order the imposition of a bond.
