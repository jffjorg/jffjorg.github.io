BACKGROUND
On
4/29/2021, plaintiff Ranchos Palos Verdes Estates LLC filed this action against
defendants Robert R. Maxwell and McNair C. Maxwell, trustees of the Maxwell
Trust Dated February 23, 1994, and Does 1 to 100, asserting causes of action
for (1) trespass, (2) nuisance, (3) negligence, (4) indemnification, and (5)
apportionment of rental income. 
 
The
Complaint alleged the following.  The
properties at issue in this case consist of a parcel of land owned by Plaintiff
known as APN 7572-007-021 (the “Rancho Parcel”) and a parcel of land owned by defendants
Robert R. Maxwell and McNair Maxwell, Trustees of the Maxwell Trust Dated
February 23, 1994, with street address 7 Pomegranate Road, Rancho Palos Verdes,
CA 90275 (the “Maxwell Parcel”).  Compl.,
¶¶ 8-10.  The Rancho Parcel and Maxwell
Parcel are neighboring parcels.  Compl.,
¶ 11.  Plaintiff purchased the Rancho
Parcel on or about October 23, 2020, and anticipates developing that land.  Compl., ¶¶ 12-13.  Approximately one month after Plaintiff
purchased the Rancho Parcel, an attorney representing the defendants contacted
Plaintiff and stated that the defendants’ home was partially on Plaintiff’s
Rancho Parcel.  Compl., ¶ 14.  The attorney told Plaintiff that it should
sell the Rancho Parcel to defendants or face a lawsuit seeking to establish a
prescriptive easement across the Rancho Parcel. 
Compl., ¶ 15.  Thereafter,
Plaintiff communicated with the defendants’ attorneys, proposed that the land
issue be resolved by insurance, and offered a license agreement, but the
attorneys declined those options, threatening litigation.  Compl., ¶¶ 16-34.  Plaintiff brought this lawsuit because it is
facing the following, among other issues, concerning the properties.  The defendants’ house is encroaching upon
Plaintiff’s property making the entire Ranch Parcel significantly harder to
develop, if at all possible.  Compl., ¶
37(b).  In addition, since the defendants
apparently plan to rent their house out, there is a significant risk that doing
so will create a landlord/tenant relationship between Plaintiff and the tenants
as the majority of the house the tenants will be renting is on the Rancho
Parcel.  Compl., ¶ 37(d).  
 
On
11/3/2022, the Court held a hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike filed
by Defendants Robert R. Maxwell and McNair Maxwell, as trustees of the Maxwell
Trust Dated February 23, 1994.  The Court
sustained the defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint’s first cause of action for
trespass and fourth cause of action for indemnification after finding that
Plaintiff failed to allege facts showing (1) the defendants’ intentional,
reckless, or negligent entry onto Plaintiff’s property, (2) the defendants’
fault, and (3) “facts to support damages suffered by Plaintiff.”  Minute Order dated November 3, 2022, p.
3.  The Court also granted the motion to
strike punitive damages allegations after finding that Plaintiff only “set
forth conclusory allegations that Defendants acted willfully, maliciously,
intentionally, and/or recklessly in an attempt to support [its] allegations and
prayer for punitive damages.”  Id.
at p. 4. 
 
On
2/7/2023, Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against the
following.
 
1.     Defendants Robert R. Maxwell and
McNair Maxwell, Trustees of the Maxwell Trust Dated February 23, 1994
2.     Reynolds M. Maxwell, as trustee of
the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994 Resulting Family
3.     Reynolds M. Maxwell, as trustee of
the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994
4.     Robert R. Maxwell, as beneficiary
of the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994 Resulting Family
5.     Robert R. Maxwell, as beneficiary
of the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994
6.     Michael D. Tousey
7.     Sharon Pomales
8.     Does 7-100
 
The
FAC asserted causes of action for (1) trespass, (2) nuisance, (3) negligence,
(4) tort of another, and (5) apportionment of rental income.  
 
            On 4/27/2023, the Court held a
hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike Robert R. Maxwell and Reynolds M.
Maxwell, trustees and beneficiaries of The Maxwell Trust Dated February 23,
1994 (the “Maxwell Defendants”).  The Court,
among other things, sustained the demurrer to the FAC’s first cause of action
for trespass after finding that Plaintiff had still failed to allege facts
showing the defendants’ intentional or reckless entry of its property.  (Minute Order dated April 27, 2023, p. 4, the
third paragraph.)  The Court sustained
the demurrer to the second and third causes of action for nuisance and
negligence because they were duplicative. 
(Id. at p. 5, the third paragraph.)  Finally, the Court sustained the demurrer to
the fourth cause of action for tort of another and fifth cause of action for
apportionment of rental income, without leave to amend, because (among other
things) those were only theories and/or claims for recovery, not causes of
action.  (Id. at pp. 5-6.)  The Court ruled that the defendants’ motion
to strike the punitive damages allegations was moot given its ruling on the
demurrer.  (Id. at p. 6, the
second to the last paragraph.)
 
            On 5/30/2023, Plaintiff filed the
SAC against the same defendants that were listed in the FAC, asserting causes
of action for (1) trespass, (2) nuisance, and (3) negligence. 
 
            On 11/15/2023, the court issued the
following ruling on the Maxwell Defendants’ demurrer to the SAC and motion to
strike portions of the SAC. 
 
            The court sustained the demurrer to
the SAC’s first cause of action for trespass after making the following
findings:
 
Plaintiff argues that the
intentional allowance of having tenants on the property constitutes the
intentional entry. Plaintiff contends that trespass can be established by
having another enter the property and also by failing to leave the property.  Plaintiff states that Defendant caused the
tenants to trespass and did not force them to leave.  However, the mere renting of the property is
not the conduct which can meet the element of intentional entry because this is
not the act that caused the land encroachment. 
The encroachment occurred because of the well-known natural land
movement in Portuguese Bend through no fault of Defendants.  In this manner, Plaintiff also argues,
although somewhat less vociferously, that not only the tenants, but the house
should have been removed as well. 
Plaintiff remarkably contends that this is “routine.”  (Opposition, page 3, lines 4-5).  Thus, by Plaintiff’s logic, the element of
trespass would also be met by Defendants’ failure to remove the house.  However, this act (or failure to act), in the
context of the factual allegations of this case, cannot be seen as an
intentional entry to meet the element of trespass when the cause of the house
being on Plaintiff’s property line was a longstanding naturally occurring
natural phenomenon.
 
Minute
Order dated November 15, 2023 (“November 2023 Order”), pp. 3-4.
 
            The court also sustained the demurrer
to the SAC’s second and third causes of action for nuisance and negligence, respectively,
explaining as follows. 
 
As to the Nuisance cause of action,
Plaintiff fails to state facts to meet the element of unreasonableness.  While generally this element would be an
issue of fact, as noted above, under the factual circumstances of this action
as specifically delineated in the SAC and upon matters to which both parties
have requested judicial notice, the alleged interference with Plaintiff’s land
was caused by a natural phenomenon which Defendants could not have prevented.  Thus, the element of ‘unreasonable’
interference cannot be met.  In addition,
for the same reasons, the breach of duty element and causation element of the
Negligence cause of action cannot be stated. 
Defendants could not have breached a duty or caused damage to Plaintiff
when the cause of the interference was a natural phenomenon.
 
(November
15 Order, p. 5, the first paragraph.)  The
court ruled that the motion to strike portions of the SAC was moot because the
court had sustained the demurrer.  (Id.
at p. 5, the last paragraph.)
 
            On 12/15/2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) against the same defendants listed in
the FAC and SAC, asserting the following causes of action: (1) trespass, (2)
nuisance, and (3) negligence.  Like its
predecessors, the TAC also seeks punitive damages.  
 
            On 1/9/2024, Robert R. Maxwell and McNair
Maxwell, as trustees of the Maxwell Trust filed a motion to dismiss this
action, arguing that Plaintiff failed to, among other things, serve the
defendants with the TAC by the court-ordered deadline of December 15, 2023. On 3/13/2024,
Plaintiff filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss. On 3/27/2024, Robert
R. Maxwell and McNair Maxwell, as trustees of the Maxwell Trust filed a notice
to withdraw their motion to dismiss. 
 
            On 5/14/2024, the court sustained
the demurrer to the TAC without leave to amend.
 
            On 5/22/2024, Defendants filed their
memorandum of costs.
 
            On 6/6/2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to tax/strike memorandum of costs and request for attorney’s fees. On 7/10/2024,
Defendants filed an opposition and filed an amended memorandum of costs. To
date, no reply has been filed.
 
            On 6/12/2024, Defendants filed a
motion for award of cost of proof sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.420(a). On 7/25/2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On 7/31/2024,
Defendants filed a reply.
 
            A jury trial is set for 10/15/2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
            Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.420 states:
 
(a) If a party fails to admit the genuineness
of any document or the truth of any matter when requested to do so under this
chapter, and if the party requesting that admission thereafter proves the
genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter, the party requesting
the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to whom the
request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that
proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.
 
(b) The court shall make this order unless it
finds any of the following:
(1) An objection to the request was sustained
or a response to it was waived under Section 2033.290.
(2) The admission sought was of no substantial
importance.
(3) The party failing to make the admission
had reasonable ground to believe that that party would prevail on the matter.
(4) There was other good reason for the
failure to admit
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendants argue that
the case relates to a boundary dispute between two adjacent properties in the
Portuguese Bend area of Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  Defendants first purchased their parcel,
known as the “Maxwell Parcel,” located at 7 E. Pomegranate Road, in 1971.  The second parcel at issue, which does not
have an address but is referenced as APN: 7572-007-021, is referred to as the
“Rancho Parcel.”  Plaintiff purchased the
Rancho Parcel on or about October 23, 2020, and plans to develop it despite
longstanding building moratoriums due to significant landslides in the area
since the 1950s.  Defendants state that
on May 18, 2023, they served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission to admit
certain truths about the case.  Plaintiff’s
responses were non-committal or denied the requests, failing to admit that
Defendants did not intentionally move the land, could not legally modify the
land due to building moratoriums, and could not legally move the land.  Plaintiff’s responses included objections and
assertions about ongoing litigation challenging the validity of the building moratoriums.  
 
The requests for admission included the
following:
1.) Request for Admission No. 15 (erroneously
numbered at 152): Admit that Defendants did not intentionally move the
land.  (Agoncillo Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit E.)
2.) Request for Admission No. 17: Admit that
Defendants cannot legally modify the land as a result of the building
moratorium in place.  (Agoncillo Decl. ¶
6, Exhibit E.)
3.) Request for Admission No. 18: Admit that
Defendants cannot legally move the land. 
(Agoncillo Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit E.)
 
Plaintiff served its responses on June 16,
2023.  (Agoncillo Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit F.)
 
In response to Request for Admission No. 15
(erroneously numbered 152), Plaintiff responded as follows:
 
“…Without waiving these objections and subject
to them, Responding Party states as follows: Responding Party can neither admit
nor deny. Presumably during the building of the improvements on the Property,
Defendants did “move the land” via grading, excavating, etc. As well, if
Defendants have engaged in any improvements including planting vegetation
during or after the construction of the improvements on the Property, this
would necessarily involve “moving the land.” However, as Responding Party
purchased its property after the improvements on the Property were built,
Responding Party does not have personal knowledge of Defendants’ motivations or
personal thoughts during construction or planting.”  (Agoncillo Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8; Exhibit F.) 
 
In response to Request for Admission No. 17,
Plaintiff responded as follows:
 
“…Without waiving these objections and subject
to them, Responding Party states as follows: Deny to the extent that question
is phrased so broadly as to encompass any modification. Defendants can modify
“the land” by planting vegetation, etc. without any legal restriction to
Responding Party’s knowledge. As for larger modifications such as excavation,
etc., Responding Party can neither admit nor deny as the validity of the
building moratoriums is currently under legal challenge by third parties.
Responding Party cannot opine on the validity of said building moratoriums nor
whether they apply to the parcels in this case as Responding Party is informed
and believes, and thereon alleges, that there is currently litigation between
the City of Rancho Palos Verdes and the State of California affecting the
validity of the purported building moratoriums as well as other litigation
between the City and private property owners affecting the validity of the
purported building moratoriums. As well, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes allows
property owners to be excluded from the moratorium, which would also allow
modifications of the land. Finally, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes allows
property owners to be exempted from the moratoriums for maintenance.”  (Agoncillo Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9; Exhibit F.) 
 
In response to Request for Admission No. 18,
Plaintiff responded as follows:
 
“…Without waiving these objections and subject
to them, Responding Party states as follows: Deny to the extent that question
is phrased so broadly as to encompass any modification. Defendants can modify
“the land” by planting vegetation, etc. without any legal restriction to
Responding Party’s knowledge. As for larger modifications such as excavation,
etc., Responding Party can neither admit nor deny as the validity of the
building moratoriums is currently under legal challenge by third parties.
Responding Party cannot opine on the validity of said building moratoriums nor
whether they apply to the parcels in this case as Responding Party is informed
and believes, and thereon alleges, that there is currently litigation between
the City of Rancho Palos Verdes and the State of California affecting the
validity of the purported building moratoriums as well as other litigation
between the City and private property owners affecting the validity of the
purported building moratoriums. As well, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes allows
property owners to be excluded from the moratorium, which would also allow
modifications of the land. Finally, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes allows
property owners to be exempted from the moratoriums for maintenance.”  (Agoncillo Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10; Exhibit F.)
 
A.    Substantial
Importance
 
Defendants argue that the core issue is
whether they could have prevented or remedied the land movement, making the
relevant Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) critical to this matter.  According to Brooks v. American
Broadcasting Co. (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 500, 559, an admission is of
substantial importance if it is central to the case’s disposition.  When Plaintiff responded to Defendants’ RFAs,
the Court had already issued minute orders on November 3, 2022, and April 27,
2023, sustaining Defendants’ demurrers.
 
For RFA No. 15 (erroneously numbered as 152),
Plaintiff claimed it could neither admit nor deny that Defendants did not
intentionally move the land.  The
elements of trespass include intentional, reckless, or negligent entry onto the
property.  The Court’s April 27, 2023,
minute order stated that Plaintiff alleged no facts of intentional acts and
acknowledged the boundary intrusion was caused by natural circumstances.  Plaintiff also conceded in its opposition that
the landslide, not Defendants, caused the earth movement.  Despite this, Plaintiff continued to claim in
its Third Amended Complaint that Defendants allowed their house to move onto
the Rancho Parcel.  Defendants argue that
this insufficient information response constitutes a failure to admit a matter
that should have been admitted, justifying cost-of-proof expenses pursuant to Association
for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. Macias (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 1007, 1029.
 
For RFA Nos. 17 and 18, Plaintiff was asked to
admit that Defendants could not legally move or modify the land due to the
moratorium.  Defendants filed a Request
for Judicial Notice with their demurrer and motion to strike, which the Court
granted.  The Court took judicial notice
of the City of Rancho Palos Verdes’ Ordinance No. 427U and Monks v. City of
Rancho Palos Verdes, acknowledging a moratorium on new construction due to
landslides since 1978.  Defendants argue
that this issue is crucial because it pertains to whether they breached their
duty to act or failed to act after notice of the encroachment.  These issues are also linked to the fact that
Defendants did not intentionally move the land, a point Plaintiff conceded but
continued to plead in subsequent complaints.
 
            In opposition,
Plaintiff contends that RFA nos. 15, 17, and 18 were not determinative of the
Court’s ruling given that the wording of the RFA was so broad that it
encompassed any point in time and any movement of the undefined “land.”  The Court’s demurrer ruling was based on the
landslide, not any other movement of the undefined “land,” making the RFA
immaterial.  
 
            In reply, Defendants
contend that the issues raised in the RFAs were determinative, as reflected in
the Court’s final ruling on May 14, 2024, which took judicial notice of
relevant documents and reports supporting Defendants' position.  The Court’s final ruling emphasized that the
factual issues raised in the RFAs were central to the case's disposition.
 
            The Court finds that
the admissions were of substantial importance to this case.  These admissions directly pertain to the
central issues regarding whether Defendants could have taken actions to prevent
or remedy the land movement and whether their actions were intentional or
legally permissible under the existing moratorium.  Specifically, the admissions sought to
establish key facts about Defendants’ intent and the legal constraints on their
ability to modify or move the land.  The
Court notes that the admissions would have significantly streamlined the
litigation process by eliminating the need for Defendants to prove these
critical points.  Furthermore, the Court
recognizes that the RFAs addressed facts that were central to the claims of trespass,
negligence, and nuisance.
 
B.    Reasonable
Ground of Prevailing
 
Defendants argue that to justify denying a RFA
and avoid sanctions, a party must have reasonable grounds to believe it would
prevail on the issue.  This standard is
more than mere hope, as established in Grace v. Mansourian (2015) 240
Cal.4th 523, 532.  At the time Defendants
served their RFAs, the Court had already sustained Defendants’ demurrer twice,
ruling that Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state causes of
action for trespass, negligence, and nuisance.  Given these rulings, Defendants argue that Plaintiff
had no reasonable ground to believe it would prevail on whether Defendants
intentionally moved the land or could legally move or modify the land.  Despite being given three opportunities to
amend its complaint, Plaintiff repeatedly failed to state valid causes of
action.  The Court had rejected
Plaintiff's arguments three times by the time Plaintiff filed its Third Amended
Complaint, yet Plaintiff continued to assert these contentions.  In the Court’s final ruling and statement of
decision, it noted that the Rancho Palos Verdes landslide is widely known and
indisputable within the court’s jurisdiction.  Plaintiff itself conceded that Defendants did
not intentionally move the land.  Benjamin
Eilenberg, Plaintiff’s person most knowledgeable, testified at his deposition
that Defendants did not intentionally cause their house to encroach on the
Rancho Parcel.  This deposition occurred
on October 23, 2023, after Plaintiff served responses to Defendants’ RFAs.
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff also cannot
reasonably argue that Defendants can legally move the land despite the
moratorium in place in the Portuguese Bend area.  The most compelling evidence is that Plaintiff
has been unable to develop the Rancho Parcel due to the moratorium.  Plaintiff produced a Preliminary Change of
Ownership Report dated October 23, 2020, describing the Rancho Parcel as “Undevelopable
land zone open space hazard with building moratorium.”  The Court took judicial notice of materials proving
that land movement in the Portuguese Bend area has been continuous since 1956.  The Maxwell Parcel was built in 1949, and no
new construction requiring reassessment has occurred since.  The Los Angeles County Assessor’s Office
records, which the Court took judicial notice of, confirm this.  Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s denial
of Defendants’ inability to legally move the land is unsupported by evidence.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s motion for cost of proof sanctions fails for several reasons.  First, Plaintiff asserts that all three
responses to the RFAs were factually correct. 
Second, there was no factual determination finding that the responses
were incorrect.  Third, Plaintiff held a
reasonable good faith belief that its answers were correct.  Fourth, none of the RFAs were determinative
in the Court’s ruling on the matter. 
Lastly, Plaintiff served valid objections regarding the vagueness of the
RFAs.
 
Regarding RFA no. 15, which asked Plaintiff to
admit that Defendants did not intentionally move the land, Plaintiff responded
that it could neither admit nor deny due to lack of personal knowledge of
Defendants’ motivations.  Plaintiff
differentiated between moving the land for construction purposes and the
natural landslide movement.  Plaintiff
maintains that the response was factually correct and addressed the nuances of
the situation.  Additionally, it states
that there has been no factual determination on this issue, as the Court
sustained a demurrer, which tests the legal sufficiency of a pleading, not the
evidence.
 
For RFA no. 17, which asked Plaintiff to admit
that Defendants cannot legally modify the land due to the building moratorium,
Plaintiff pointed out that Defendants could modify the land by planting
vegetation without legal restriction and highlighted ongoing litigation that
could invalidate the moratorium. 
Plaintiff also mentioned exceptions and exclusions within the moratorium
that might allow modifications.  Again,
Plaintiff asserts that there has been no factual determination on this issue
and that the response was reasonable and thorough.
 
Regarding RFA no.18, which asked Plaintiff to
admit that Defendants cannot legally move the land, Plaintiff’s response was
similar to RFA no. 17, noting possible modifications and ongoing litigation
challenging the moratorium.  Plaintiff
argues that the response was factually correct and addressed the complexities
of the situation.
 
In reply, Defendants state that Plaintiffs’
arguments are without merit. 
Specifically, they argue that Plaintiff’s responses to the RFAs were not
factually correct, as the Court had previously found that the boundary
intrusion was caused by natural circumstances, not Defendants’ actions.  For example, the Court’s minute order dated
April 27, 2023, and Plaintiff’s concession that the landslide, not Defendants,
caused the earth movement contradict Plaintiff's responses.  Furthermore, regarding RFAs 17 and 18, the
Court had taken judicial notice of a governmental moratorium preventing land
modification, further disproving Plaintiff’s responses.  Defendants assert that substantial evidence
shows Plaintiff had no reasonable belief it would prevail, given the Court’s
prior rulings against Plaintiff’s claims and the deposition testimony of
Plaintiff’s person most knowledgeable, who affirmed that Defendants did not
intentionally cause the encroachment.  
 
            The Court finds that
given the history of sustaining the demurrers and rejecting Plaintiff’s
arguments regarding the issues of whether Defendants intentionally moved the
land, or whether Defendants could legally move or modify the land, Plaintiff
did not have a reasonable ground to believe that it would prevail on the
matter.  The Court had repeatedly
determined that Plaintiff’s claims were legally insufficient, as evidenced by
the multiple rulings on the demurrers. 
Despite these clear judicial findings, Plaintiff persisted in its
assertions, thereby lacking a reasonable basis for believing in the validity of
its claims.  Furthermore, the Plaintiff’s
continued refusal to admit these critical facts, despite substantial evidence
and judicial notice taken by the Court of relevant ordinances and legal
constraints, demonstrates an unreasonable stance.  The moratorium on construction in the
Portuguese Bend area, the historical context of the landslide, and the
uncontested facts about the Defendants’ property pointed to a conclusion that
Plaintiff chose to ignore.  
 
Plaintiff also provides no authority that a
Court judgment must be entered on a specific factually matter for Defendants to
prove the truth of matters specified in the requests for admission. Rather,
Defendants have sufficiently shown that they are entitled to recover costs
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420(a).  A party may recover the cost of proving
Requests for Admission that were denied, even if the Requests were used to
establish opinions relating to fact or required an application of law to fact.  (Garcia v. Hyster Co. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 724, 735.)  Further, the
proof requested in a Request for Admission need not be made at trial; rather,
costs can be recovered when proof is made during pretrial proceedings.  (Vargas v. Gallizzi (2023) 96
Cal.App.5th 362, 371.)
 
In light of these circumstances, the Court
concludes that Plaintiff’s denial of the RFAs was not grounded in a reasonable
expectation of success.
 
C.    Reasonable
Attorney’s Fees 
 
Defendants argue that under Code of Civil
Procedure § 2033.420(a), if a party fails to admit the truth of any matter
requested, and the requesting party subsequently proves it, the requesting
party is entitled to reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof,
including attorney’s fees.  Defendants
had to file two additional demurrers and motions to strike to prove matters
Plaintiff failed to admit.  Despite the
Court’s instructions from the first two demurrers highlighting insufficient
pleadings, Plaintiff continued to make conclusory statements, forcing
Defendants to incur further attorney’s fees addressing the same issues.
 
Defendants claim they incurred 181.4 hours of
work at reasonable hourly rates of $210.00 per hour for Frances Agoncillo and
$225.00 per hour for Michael D’Andrea, totaling $38,428.50 in attorney’s
fees.  Defendants state that these fees
were necessary for filing demurrers to Plaintiff’s Second and Third Amended
Complaints, taking depositions of Plaintiff’s person most knowledgeable, and
conducting legal research to prove that Defendants did not intentionally move
the land and could not legally move the land due to the moratorium.  Thus, Defendants request that cost-of-proof
sanctions be assessed against Plaintiff in the amount of $38,428.50.
 
            In opposition,
Plaintiff claims that Defendant waived its rights to sanctions by not
compelling further responses to the objections, and that the Discovery Act
prohibits cost of proof sanctions if objections are sustained or responses are
waived, which Plaintiff argues applies in this case.  Plaintiff requests that the court award its
attorney’s fees for successfully opposing the motion, having spent and
anticipating spending $6,655 in the process.
 
            In reply, Defendants
argue that they are entitled to cost-of-proof sanctions against Plaintiff in
this land subsidence matter due to excessive fees incurred defending against
Plaintiff’s meritless claims.  Despite the
Court’s multiple rulings (on November 3, 2022, April 27, 2023, November 15,
2023, and May 14, 2024) that Plaintiff’s claims could not sustain valid causes
of action, Plaintiff persisted in seeking leave to amend, significantly
increasing Defendants’ legal expenses.  Defendants also argue that Plaintiff’s
objections to the RFAs were never ruled valid by the Court and that Plaintiff’s
responses contained denials despite objections, making the objections
irrelevant to the issue of cost of proof sanctions.             The Court finds that
Defendants are entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees.  While the Court finds the requested rates to
be reasonable, the Court finds the hours claimed to be excessive.  The Court reduces the hours to 100 hours at a
reasonable rate of $215, for a total of $21,500. Accordingly, Defendants’Motion for Award of
Cost of Proof Sanctions is GRANTED.

BACKGROUND
On
4/29/2021, plaintiff Ranchos Palos Verdes Estates LLC filed this action against
defendants Robert R. Maxwell and McNair C. Maxwell, trustees of the Maxwell
Trust Dated February 23, 1994, and Does 1 to 100, asserting causes of action
for (1) trespass, (2) nuisance, (3) negligence, (4) indemnification, and (5)
apportionment of rental income. 
 
The
Complaint alleged the following.  The
properties at issue in this case consist of a parcel of land owned by Plaintiff
known as APN 7572-007-021 (the “Rancho Parcel”) and a parcel of land owned by defendants
Robert R. Maxwell and McNair Maxwell, Trustees of the Maxwell Trust Dated
February 23, 1994, with street address 7 Pomegranate Road, Rancho Palos Verdes,
CA 90275 (the “Maxwell Parcel”).  Compl.,
¶¶ 8-10.  The Rancho Parcel and Maxwell
Parcel are neighboring parcels.  Compl., ¶
11.  Plaintiff purchased the Rancho
Parcel on or about October 23, 2020, and anticipates developing that land.  Compl., ¶¶ 12-13.  Approximately one month after Plaintiff
purchased the Rancho Parcel, an attorney representing the defendants contacted
Plaintiff and stated that the defendants’ home was partially on Plaintiff’s
Rancho Parcel.  Compl., ¶ 14.  The attorney told Plaintiff that it should
sell the Rancho Parcel to defendants or face a lawsuit seeking to establish a
prescriptive easement across the Rancho Parcel. 
Compl., ¶ 15.  Thereafter,
Plaintiff communicated with the defendants’ attorneys, proposed that the land
issue be resolved by insurance, and offered a license agreement, but the
attorneys declined those options, threatening litigation.  Compl., ¶¶ 16-34.  Plaintiff brought this lawsuit because it is
facing the following, among other issues, concerning the properties.  The defendants’ house is encroaching upon
Plaintiff’s property making the entire Ranch Parcel significantly harder to
develop, if at all possible.  Compl., ¶
37(b).  In addition, since the defendants
apparently plan to rent their house out, there is a significant risk that doing
so will create a landlord/tenant relationship between Plaintiff and the tenants
as the majority of the house the tenants will be renting is on the Rancho
Parcel.  Compl., ¶ 37(d).  
 
On
11/3/2022, the Court held a hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike filed
by Defendants Robert R. Maxwell and McNair Maxwell, as trustees of the Maxwell
Trust Dated February 23, 1994.  The Court
sustained the defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint’s first cause of action for
trespass and fourth cause of action for indemnification after finding that
Plaintiff failed to allege facts showing (1) the defendants’ intentional,
reckless, or negligent entry onto Plaintiff’s property, (2) the defendants’
fault, and (3) “facts to support damages suffered by Plaintiff.”  Minute Order dated November 3, 2022, p.
3.  The Court also granted the motion to
strike punitive damages allegations after finding that Plaintiff only “set
forth conclusory allegations that Defendants acted willfully, maliciously,
intentionally, and/or recklessly in an attempt to support [its] allegations and
prayer for punitive damages.”  Id.
at p. 4. 
 
On
2/7/2023, Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against the
following.
 
1.     Defendants Robert R. Maxwell and
McNair Maxwell, Trustees of the Maxwell Trust Dated February 23, 1994
2.     Reynolds M. Maxwell, as trustee of
the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994 Resulting Family
3.     Reynolds M. Maxwell, as trustee of
the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994
4.     Robert R. Maxwell, as beneficiary
of the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994 Resulting Family
5.     Robert R. Maxwell, as beneficiary
of the Maxwell Living Trust 2-23-1994
6.     Michael D. Tousey
7.     Sharon Pomales
8.     Does 7-100
 
The
FAC asserted causes of action for (1) trespass, (2) nuisance, (3) negligence,
(4) tort of another, and (5) apportionment of rental income.  
 
            On 4/27/2023, the Court held a
hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike Robert R. Maxwell and Reynolds M.
Maxwell, trustees and beneficiaries of The Maxwell Trust Dated February 23,
1994 (the “Maxwell Defendants”).  The Court,
among other things, sustained the demurrer to the FAC’s first cause of action
for trespass after finding that Plaintiff had still failed to allege facts
showing the defendants’ intentional or reckless entry of its property.  (Minute Order dated April 27, 2023, p. 4, the
third paragraph.)  The Court sustained
the demurrer to the second and third causes of action for nuisance and
negligence because they were duplicative. 
(Id. at p. 5, the third paragraph.)  Finally, the Court sustained the demurrer to
the fourth cause of action for tort of another and fifth cause of action for
apportionment of rental income, without leave to amend, because (among other
things) those were only theories and/or claims for recovery, not causes of
action.  (Id. at pp. 5-6.)  The Court ruled that the defendants’ motion
to strike the punitive damages allegations was moot given its ruling on the
demurrer.  (Id. at p. 6, the
second to the last paragraph.)
 
            On 5/30/2023, Plaintiff filed the
SAC against the same defendants that were listed in the FAC, asserting causes
of action for (1) trespass, (2) nuisance, and (3) negligence. 
 
            On 11/15/2023, the court issued the
following ruling on the Maxwell Defendants’ demurrer to the SAC and motion to
strike portions of the SAC. 
 
            The court sustained the demurrer to
the SAC’s first cause of action for trespass after making the following
findings:
 
Plaintiff argues that the
intentional allowance of having tenants on the property constitutes the
intentional entry. Plaintiff contends that trespass can be established by
having another enter the property and also by failing to leave the property.  Plaintiff states that Defendant caused the
tenants to trespass and did not force them to leave.  However, the mere renting of the property is
not the conduct which can meet the element of intentional entry because this is
not the act that caused the land encroachment.  The encroachment occurred because of the
well-known natural land movement in Portuguese Bend through no fault of
Defendants.  In this manner, Plaintiff
also argues, although somewhat less vociferously, that not only the tenants,
but the house should have been removed as well.  Plaintiff remarkably contends that this is
“routine.”  (Opposition, page 3, lines
4-5).  Thus, by Plaintiff’s logic, the
element of trespass would also be met by Defendants’ failure to remove the
house.  However, this act (or failure to
act), in the context of the factual allegations of this case, cannot be seen as
an intentional entry to meet the element of trespass when the cause of the
house being on Plaintiff’s property line was a longstanding naturally occurring
natural phenomenon.
 
Minute
Order dated November 15, 2023 (“November 2023 Order”), pp. 3-4.
 
            The court also sustained the demurrer
to the SAC’s second and third causes of action for nuisance and negligence, respectively,
explaining as follows. 
 
As to the Nuisance cause of action,
Plaintiff fails to state facts to meet the element of unreasonableness.  While generally this element would be an issue
of fact, as noted above, under the factual circumstances of this action as
specifically delineated in the SAC and upon matters to which both parties have
requested judicial notice, the alleged interference with Plaintiff’s land was
caused by a natural phenomenon which Defendants could not have prevented.  Thus, the element of ‘unreasonable’
interference cannot be met.  In addition,
for the same reasons, the breach of duty element and causation element of the
Negligence cause of action cannot be stated.  Defendants could not have breached a duty or
caused damage to Plaintiff when the cause of the interference was a natural
phenomenon.
 
(November
15 Order, p. 5, the first paragraph.)  The
court ruled that the motion to strike portions of the SAC was moot because the
court had sustained the demurrer.  (Id.
at p. 5, the last paragraph.)
 
            On 12/15/2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) against the same defendants listed in
the FAC and SAC, asserting the following causes of action: (1) trespass, (2)
nuisance, and (3) negligence.  Like its
predecessors, the TAC also seeks punitive damages.  
 
            On 1/9/2024, Robert R. Maxwell and McNair
Maxwell, as trustees of the Maxwell Trust filed a motion to dismiss this
action, arguing that Plaintiff failed to, among other things, serve the
defendants with the TAC by the court-ordered deadline of December 15, 2023. On 3/13/2024,
Plaintiff filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss. On 3/27/2024, Robert
R. Maxwell and McNair Maxwell, as trustees of the Maxwell Trust filed a notice
to withdraw their motion to dismiss. 
 
            On 5/14/2024, the court sustained
the demurrer to the TAC without leave to amend.
 
            On 5/22/2024, Defendants filed their
memorandum of costs.
 
            On 6/6/2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to tax/strike memorandum of costs and request for attorney’s fees. On 7/10/2024,
Defendants filed an opposition and filed an amended memorandum of costs. To
date, no reply has been filed.
 
            On 6/12/2024, Defendants filed a
motion for award of cost of proof sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.420(a). On 7/25/2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On 7/31/2024,
Defendants filed a reply.
 
            A jury trial is set for 10/15/2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Under the law, a verified memorandum of costs
is correct.  However, a party may contest
the costs that a prevailing party seeks.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1034 subd. (a).)  The challenging party has the burden of
demonstrating that those costs are unreasonable or unnecessary.  (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486; 612 South LLC v. Laconic Limited Partnership
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1285.)  If
the challenging party properly objects to the costs, “they are put in issue and
the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.”  (Ladas v. California State Automobile
Association (193) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)  To be recoverable, the costs must be
“reasonably necessary” to the conduct of litigation.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1033.5 subd. (c).)  
 
“Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary
to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its
decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.”  (Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at
p. 744; see also Code Civ. Proc., §1033.5 subd. (c).)  However, items not mentioned in the code of
civil procedure and “asserted upon application may be allowed or denied in the
court’s discretion.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§1033.5, subd (c)(4) [“Section 1033.5”].)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff argues that
the memorandum of costs was filed on May 22, 2024, and this motion to tax is
timely as it was filed within 20 days after the memorandum of costs by mail.  (CRC 3.1700(b)(1); Code Civ. Proc., § 1013.)  Plaintiff claims the amount of $5,649.98 as
costs is unsupported by declarations, receipts, or proof that these costs were
incurred or reasonable.  Plaintiff argues
that Defendants’ memorandum of costs seeks amounts beyond what they are entitled
to, particularly the request for attorney fees.  Plaintiff claims the requested motions fees of
$1,935.08 lack proof, exceed the filing fee, and are not believable without a
specific breakdown.  Similarly, the
$2,404.15 in deposition costs is unsubstantiated as it represents costs, not
attorney’s fees, and the $1,107.60 in interpreter fees is unfounded because no
interpretation was necessary or part of the litigation.  Plaintiff objects to the entire memorandum and
each item specifically, emphasizing that the burden is on Defendants to
establish the actual costs incurred.  Plaintiff
argues that the memorandum of costs is premature, invalid, and must be
stricken.  
 
Plaintiff contends that recoverable costs must
be reasonable in amount and necessary to the litigation, and that costs that
are merely convenient or beneficial to preparation are disallowed.  Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ claimed
costs do not meet these criteria and are irregular, lacking proof that they
were reasonably necessary.  Additionally,
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ memorandum of costs and worksheet do not
properly or specifically identify the costs, leaving the court and Plaintiff to
guess at the details.  Finally, Plaintiff
argues that contractually based attorney’s fees may only be sought by noticed
motion and not in a memorandum of costs.  Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s inclusion
of attorney’s fees in the memorandum of costs is improper and should be
stricken or taxed to zero.
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that their
Amended/Updated Memorandum of Costs, which identifies $5,649.98 in recoverable
costs, should not be taxed or struck as requested by Plaintiff.  They assert that Plaintiff’s motion to tax or
strike the memorandum of costs is unfounded and should be denied in its
entirety.  Defendants claim that they are
entitled to these costs as the “prevailing party” on the Demurrer to
Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, as outlined under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1033.5 and 1032(b).  Defendants
argue that they have met their burden for recovering these costs, while
Plaintiff has not provided substantiated evidence to rebut the presumption of
reasonableness of these costs, instead relying on conclusory assumptions.  
 
Defendants maintain that a verified cost
memorandum serves as prima facie evidence that the itemized costs were
necessarily incurred, as supported by Rappenecker v. Sea Land Service, Inc. (1979)
93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.  They state that
the burden of proof shifts to the Plaintiff to show that the costs were not
reasonable or necessary.  Defendants
provided an appropriate Memorandum of Costs listing necessary, reasonable
costs, and have submitted verifiable documentation, as attached within the
Declaration of Frances Agoncillo, Esq.  Defendants
contend that Plaintiff has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness,
offering unsupported assumptions instead.  They argue that Defendants are not required to
“substantiate” their costs with detailed invoices or proof of payment, as a
verified memorandum of costs is sufficient.  Defendants also emphasize that Plaintiff’s
generalized dissatisfaction does not provide a sufficient basis to challenge
the costs.  Specifically, Defendants
argue they are entitled to recover the entirety of their costs for filing and
motion fees, deposition costs, service of process costs, models, enlargements,
photocopies of exhibits, and fees for electronic filing or service.  They provide specific invoicing and legal
citations to support each category of costs claimed.  For example, they claim $1,846.43 for filing
and motion fees, supported by invoices from First Legal and receipts from the
Los Angeles Superior Court’s hearing reservation system.  They also claim $2,404.15 for deposition
costs, supported by invoices from Veritext, and $274.00 for service of process
costs, supported by invoices from First Legal.
 
            First, the Court
notes that Defendants’ amended memorandum of costs reflects a total amount of
$5,749.98, which differs from the amount claimed in the opposition.  The originally filed cost memorandum reflects
the amount mentioned in Defendants’ brief, which is $5,649.98.  Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the Court
finds that Defendants are entitled to the costs they seek.  As Defendants explain, the burden lays on
Plaintiff to challenge the cost items.  “A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of
the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs
to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Adams v. Ford
Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487 [italics and brackets
omitted].)  ¿Costs otherwise allowable as
a matter of right may be disallowed if the court determines they were not
reasonably necessary, and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost
item to an amount that is reasonable.  (See
Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245
[finding that¿“the intent and effect of section 1033.5, subdivision¿(c)(2) is
to authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing
fees, when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily”].)¿
 
Here, Defendants seek the following items of
costs: (1) filing and motion fees; (2) deposition costs; (3) service of
process; (4) models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits; and (5)
interpreter fees.  These fees are
recoverable by statute.  
 
For filing and motion fees, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 subdivision
(a)(1) provides generally that filing fees are recoverable.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(1).)  
 
For
deposition costs, Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 subdivision (a)(2)(3)(A) provides
that “[t]aking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions,
including an original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy
of depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed.”  Further, “[t]he recovery of deposition costs
does not depend on whether the deponent ultimately testifies at trial. (See Culbertson
v. R.D. Werner Co., Inc., supra, 190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 711-712, 235
Cal.Rptr. 510 [nature of plaintiff's case determines necessity of discovery].)  The standard is whether the cost is ‘reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation.’ (§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)”  (Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 49, 57.)  
 
For
service of process, Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 subdivision (a)(4) allows for costs
incurred involving service of process.
 
For
models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 subdivision
(a)(13) provides that “[m]odels, the enlargements of exhibits and
photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic presentation of exhibits, including
costs of rental equipment and electronic formatting, may be allowed if they
were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact” are allowable costs. 
 
For interpreter fees, Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 subdivision
(a)(2)(3)(B) allows “[f]ees of a certified or registered interpreter for
the deposition of a party or witness who does not proficiently speak or
understand the English language” as an allowable cost.
 
The Court finds that the verified memorandum
of costs establishes the prima facie showing that the costs are correct.  Plaintiff’s objection to the costs are that
Defendants fail to prove the costs actually incurred.  However, the burden lays on Plaintiff as the
challenging party to demonstrate that the costs are not necessary or reasonable,
which Plaintiff has not done, therefore, it fails to shift the burden to
Defendants to demonstrate the reasonableness of the costs.  The Court also notes that while Plaintiff
claims that Defendants improperly claimed attorney’s fees in their memorandum
of costs, Plaintiff fails to further explain or show this.  Defendants also attached exhibits
substantiating their costs in their opposition, but Plaintiff has not provided
any arguments in reply. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs is DENIED.
