```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the demurrer filed by the defendants, Jean Yang and Mark Yang, and has dismissed the action. The court finds that the plaintiff, Deuk Lee, failed to assert the claims in this action in a cross-complaint in the quiet title action filed by Defendant Jean in LASC Case No. 21TRCV00693. The court notes that because the first and second promissory notes were used as evidence to obtain judgment against Defendant Mark in LASC Case No. 19STCV21302, "there was nothing left to recover from the property." The court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff at the time the judgment in the underlying action was entered, and therefore, the court finds that the plaintiff's present action is barred by CCP § 426.30.
