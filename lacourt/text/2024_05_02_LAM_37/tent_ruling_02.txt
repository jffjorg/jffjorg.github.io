Defendants have failed to file a declaration
showing compliance with CCP § 430.41. “Any
determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient
shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).)
As the failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to overrule a
demurrer, the court continues on the merits.
