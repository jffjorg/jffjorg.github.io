Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary of Allegations in Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges
that Defendants Jean and Mark were married in October 1989. (Compl. ¶ 11.) In
December 2009, Mark borrowed $150,000.00 from Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ 12, Ex. A.)
The note was secured by a promissory note secured by a deed of trust as to 2409
Ives Lane, Redondo Beach, CA 90278 (the “Property”), dated March 15, 2012.
(Compl. Ex. A.) The Complaint alleges that both Jean and Mark failed to pay the
loan. (Compl. ¶ 17.) 
 
On May 5, 2017, Jean
and Mark filed for divorce. (Compl. ¶ 18.) On November 10, 2017, Mark and Jean entered
a court stipulation for settlement of their divorce (the “Settlement”). (Compl.
¶ 21, Ex. C.) Unknown to Plaintiff, the Settlement made the Property the sole
and separate property of Jean. (Compl. ¶¶ 22-24.) On May 4, 2018, the court
entered judgment on the dissolution and Settlement. 
 
On or about June 17,
2019, Plaintiff filed an action against Defendant Mark for breach of contract
as to the Loan (LASC Case No. 19STCV21302). (Compl. ¶ 27.) Defendant
Mark failed to appear, and judgment was granted in favor of Plaintiff in the
sum of $240,162.21 on June 17, 2019. (Compl. ¶ 28.) Plaintiff asserts that it
was not until July 27, 2022, that he became aware of Mark and Jean’s divorce
and settlement, and that they now maintained that the Property was the sole
property of the Trust. (Compl. ¶¶ 29, 31.)
 
The Complaint alleges that
Plaintiff believes that Jean and Mark continue to reside in the Property
together and that the divorce was solely done to defraud Plaintiff and prevent
Plaintiff from collecting from Defendants any judgment Plaintiff had obtained.
(Compl. ¶¶ 32, 34.) 
 
The Complaint alleges that
Defendant Mark is legally insolvent and that “the only asset available to
Plaintiff to satisfy the Judgment was the transfer of the [Property] he made to
Defendants.” (Compl. ¶¶ 35, 36.) Accordingly, by Defendants signing the
Settlement, Defendants deprived Plaintiff of the ability to get paid. (Compl. ¶
37.) 
 
B.        Plaintiff’s Election of Remedies Barred
Foreclosure
 
Defendants assert that because
Plaintiff elected to file an action against Defendant Mark rather than
foreclose on the Property, Plaintiff waived the right to foreclose on the
property to secure the loan. CCP § 726 “is both a ‘security-first’ and ‘one-action’ rule:
It compels the secured creditor, in a single action, to exhaust his security
judicially before he may obtain a monetary ‘deficiency’ judgment against
the debtor.’ [Citations.]  In other words, ‘[a] secured creditor can bring only one
lawsuit to enforce its security interest and collect its debt.’ [Citation.]” (National Enterprises, Inc. v. Woods (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 1217, 1232.) 
 
By filing LASC Case No. 19STCV21302
against Defendant Mark individually, Plaintiff elected a remedy that waived the
right to foreclose on the property and recover from the pledged asset.  He instead sought to enforce the debt against
Mark individually. “[W]hen the creditor recovers a personal money judgment
against the debtor without first foreclosing all of the security, the sanctions
of the ‘one action’ rule are applied, and the creditor loses the liens on all
property not foreclosed in that action.” Kirkpatrick v. Westamerica Bank
(1998) 65 Cal. App. 4th 982, 988 [citation omitted].) “An election of remedies
. . . occurs at the point the judgment attains finality when the claim is
merged in the judgment.” (Id. at p. 990.)
 
Accordingly, Defendants
assert that any alleged transfer of the Property from Mark to Jean did not
affect Plaintiff’s right under the deed of trust to foreclose on the subject
Property and it was Plaintiff’s actions that resulted in the waiver to foreclose.

 
C.        Plaintiff’s Failure to File a Compulsory Cross-Complaint in
the Quiet Title Action 
 
 CCP
§ 426.30 states:  
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided by
statute, if a party against whom a complaint has been filed and served fails to
allege in a cross-complaint any related cause of action which (at the time of
serving his answer to the complaint) he has against the plaintiff, such party
may not thereafter in any other action assert against the plaintiff the related
cause of action not pleaded. 
 
(b) This section does not apply if either
of the following are established: 
 
(1) The court in which the action is
pending does not have jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against the
person who failed to plead the related cause of action. 
 
(2) The person who failed to plead the
related cause of action did not file an answer to the complaint against
him. 
 
“The compulsory
cross-complaint statute is designed to prevent ‘piecemeal litigation.’” (Wittenberg
v. Bornstein (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 556, 564.) “Thus, a party cannot by
negligence or design withhold issues and litigate them in successive actions;
he may not split his demands or defenses; he may not submit his case in
piecemeal fashion.” (Id. at p. 564.) “The statute is to be liberally
construed to advance its purpose.” (Heshejin v. Rostami (2020) 54
Cal.App.5th 984, 993.)  
 
Defendants note that on
September 23, 2021, Defendant Jean as Trustee of the Trust filed an action for
Quiet Title against Defendant Lee in LASC Case No. 21TRCV00693.
 
On its own motion, the
court judicially notices the records of LASC Case No. 21TRCV00693 and the fact
that the Plaintiff in this action on December 3, 2021, filed a verified Answer
and a Cross-Complaint against Defendant Mark. Defendant Jean specifically
sought to expunge the deed of trust dated March 15, 2012, because it clouded
the title to the Property. 
 
On January 27, 2023, the court
awarded summary judgment in favor of Defendant Jean. (Min. Order, 1/23/23, LASC
Case No. 21TRCV00693.) The court noted that
because the first and second promissory notes were used as evidence to obtain
Judgment against Defendant Mark in LASC Case No. 19STCV21302, “there was nothing
left to recover from the property. Defendant therefore finds himself in
precisely the situation described in Kirkpatrick; with a judgment but without
the benefit of the lien.” (Id. at p. 6.) “All the evidence suggests the
Deed of Trust was recorded to provide collateral only as to the December 31,
2009 loan and both the First Note and the Second Note documented that debt.
Once judgment was entered on defendant’s behalf for that debt, the election of
remedies had been made and foreclosure on the Deed of Trust was no longer
available.” (Ibid.) 
 
Consequently, the deed of trust
dated April 11, 2012, was canceled, and deemed to no longer have further
effect. (4/12/24 Judgment, LASC Case No. 21TRCV00693.) Title
to the Property was quieted in favor to the Trust and as to any claim by
Plaintiff Deuk Lee. (Ibid.) Moreover, because Plaintiff failed to appear
for the prove-up hearing for the Cross-Complaint filed against Defendant Mark,
the Cross-Complaint was dismissed due to failure to prosecute. (Ibid.) 
 
Based on the above,
Defendants assert that this action is barred because Plaintiff failed to assert
the claims in this action in a cross-complaint in LASC Case No. 21TRCV00693. The
court agrees that CCP § 426.30 bars Plaintiff’s present action because the
claims asserted arise out of the same operative facts as the LASC Case No.
21TRCV00693.  The court had jurisdiction
over Plaintiff at the time the judgment in the underlying action was entered. (See Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 970 [ “‘Only related
causes of action that exist at the time of service of the answer to the
complaint on the particular plaintiff are affected by Section 426.30’ ”]; see
also AL Holding Co. v. O'Brien & Hicks, Inc. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 1310, 1313–1314 [accord].) 
 
Therefore, the
demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The action is dismissed.
