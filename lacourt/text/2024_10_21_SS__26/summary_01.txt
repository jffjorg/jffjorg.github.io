And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a case between Wasserman Media Group, LLC (Petitioner) and Duca, et al. (Respondent). The case involves an arbitration award issued in favor of Wasserman Media Group, LLC and a subsequent petition to confirm the arbitration award. The Petitioner has filed a motion for attorney's fees, which the court has granted in the amount of $15,484.50. The court has also ordered the Petitioner to file and serve a proposed amended judgment within 20 days of this order. The motion for attorney's fees was filed 89 days after the entry of judgment, which is timely. The court has reviewed the fees incurred by Wasserman Media Group, LLC's counsel and found them to be reasonable. The court has also reduced the award by $1,557.50 due to unnecessary and counterproductive work performed by the counsel.
