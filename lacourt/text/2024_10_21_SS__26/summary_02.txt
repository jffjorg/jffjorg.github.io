And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Nixon Gerardo Gomez's motion for an order to show cause regarding contempt against Defendant Maria Gabriela Rodriguez. The Plaintiff filed the motion on August 7, 2024, alleging that the Defendant failed to comply with a court order issued on April 4, 2024, which required the Defendant to respond to the Plaintiff's form interrogatories and pay sanctions of $120. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to provide the necessary affidavit to commence a contempt proceeding, and instead provided unsworn arguments and statements. The Court rules that the absence of a sufficient affidavit renders the entire proceeding void ab initio.
