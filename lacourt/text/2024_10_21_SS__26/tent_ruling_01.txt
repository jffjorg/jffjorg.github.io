Wasserman Media Group, LLC v. Duca, et al.
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
(Civ.
Code § 1717; Code Civ. Proc., § 1032)

 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner
Wasserman Media Group, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE
AMOUNT OF $15,484.50. PETITIONER
IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On July 6, 2021, an arbitrator issued an
Arbitration Award in favor of Wasserman Media Group, LLC (“Petitioner”) and
against Paul Lo Duca (“Respondent”). On August 3, 2021, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”). The Court set
the Petition for hearing on December 7, 2021 and ordered Petitioner to give
notice. (Notice of Hearing, 08/03/21.) On November 2, 2021, the Court continued
the hearing to March 17, 2022. (Notice of Continuance, 11/02/21.) On March 4,
2022, Petitioner filed an Application for Publication, based on multiple failed
attempts to serve Respondent. (See Fieldsted Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.) On March 8, 2022,
the court rejected Petitioner’s Application for Publication because Petitioner
had not demonstrated diligence in its service attempts. (See Notice of
Rejection, 3/8/22.) 
 
The Petition came for hearing on March 17,
2022 and was continued again to September 13, 2022. Only Petitioner appeared
and the minute order reflects that the Petition was granted. (Minute Order,
09/13/22.) However, as demonstrated by Petitioner’s Motion to Correct Order and
Place Petition Back on Calendar filed on November 28, 2023, the minute order
dated September 13, 2022 was incorrect. At that hearing, Petitioner represented
that the wrong person may have been served and sought a continuance of the hearing
date, which was granted. (Minute Order, 02/08/24.) In granting Petitioner’s
Motion to Correct Order and Place Petition Back on Calendar, the Court reset
the hearing on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award for May 9, 2024. (Ibid.)

 
At the hearing on May 9, 2024, the Court
granted the Petition and judgment was entered in Petitioner’s favor in accordance
with the ruling on May 17, 2024. (Judgment, 05/17/24.) The judgment was served
on Respondent on the same date. (Judgment, 05/17/24, p. 3.) 
 
Petitioner filed
the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees on August 14, 2024. No opposition has
been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Timing of
Motion
 
Plaintiff brings the instant Motion pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032, 1033.5 and Civil Code section 1717. A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4); § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) A motion for attorney’s fees must be filed
and served with the time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court
Rule 8.822 states that an attorneys’ fees motion must be filed within the
earlier of (1) 30 days after the trial court clerk serves the moving party with
notice of entry of judgment; (2) 30 days after the moving party serves or is
served by a party with a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a
file-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; 
or (3) 90 days after entry of judgment. (Cal.
Rules of Court 8.822(1).) Here, the Motion was timely filed 89 days after entry
of judgment. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Petitioner contends it is the prevailing
party in this action pursuant to Civil Code section 1717 as the party
who recovered greater relief in the action on the contract. (Civ. Code, § 1717,
subd. (b)(1).) This is undisputed based on Petitioner prevailing on the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and the entry of judgment in its favor. Therefore,
the Court finds that Petitioner is entitled to an award of its attorney’s fees.

 
Amount of Attorney’s Fees
 
 The
moving party bears the burden of proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking
fees has the burden of showing the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)
 
The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
The lodestar method is based on the
factors, as relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
Petitioner moves for an award of $17,567.00
in attorney’s fees based on 41.9 hours
of attorney time. (Motion, Fieldsted Decl., ¶17.) The time was billed at
$375.00 to $525.00 per hour, which is reasonable for attorney time in a limited
case in Southern California. (Id. at ¶14.) As set forth in the history
above, however, Petitioner’s counsel spent time with respect to service of the
papers on the wrong person and a subsequent application for service by
publication that was rejected by the Court as insufficient. From August 2021 to
August 2022, Petitioner’s counsel spent 3.9 hours on these matters, which were
not reasonably necessary the litigation and in fact were counterproductive, for
which they billed $1,557.50. (Id. at Exh. 7, p. 2.) Also, Petitioner
anticipates spending one hour on the reply but no opposition has been filed.
Therefore, an additional $525.00 should be reduced from the award. Based on the
foregoing, Petitioner is awarded fees of $15,484.50.

Petitioner
Wasserman Media Group, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE
AMOUNT OF $15,484.50. PETITIONER
