And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants, who had filed a demurrer that the plaintiff argued was frivolous and filed for an improper purpose. The judge found that the plaintiff had not met its burden to show that the demurrer was filed primarily for an improper purpose. The judge noted that unsuccessful demurrers are regularly filed in matters before the court, and that successful motions for sanctions are rare. Therefore, the motion for sanctions is denied.
