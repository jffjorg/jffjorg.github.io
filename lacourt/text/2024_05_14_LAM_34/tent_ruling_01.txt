BACKGROUND:
 
On April 28, 2022,
Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc. (“Big Bus”) filed its Complaint against
Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (“Starline”) on causes of action for unfair
competition (statutory and common law), intentional interference with
prospective economic advantage, and false advertising. 
 
On June 8, 2022, the
Court found related cases 19STCV36480 and 22STCV14150, and designated
19STCV36480 as the lead case. 
 
On October 31, 2022,
the Court sustained Starline’s Demurrer to the Complaint’s third cause of
action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. 
 
On December 7, 2022,
Starline filed: (1) Answer to the Complaint; and (2) Cross-Complaint against Big
Bus, Vector Media South, LLC, Vector Media Holding Corp., Big Bus Tours, Ltd.,
Julia Conway, Patrick Waterman, Marc Borzykowski, Justin Steinfelder, Robert
Gutierrez, Open Top Sightseeing USA, and Sprint. 
 
On April 20, 2023,
Starline filed its First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC). 
 
        On
July 7, 2023, the Court denied as untimely Starline’s motion to compel further
responses to Starline’s requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) Nos.
25–36 and 45.
 
On July 13, 2023, the
Court dismissed with prejudice Big Bus Tours, Ltd., Julia Conway, Patrick
Waterman, Open Top Sightseeing USA, Vector Media South, LLC, Vector Media
Holding Corp., Marc Borzykowski, Justin Steinfelder, and Robert Gutierrez from
the FACC. The Court also sustained Big Bus’ Demurrer to the FACC’s sixth cause
of action for fraud and conspiracy, abating that cause of action because there
was another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action. 
 
On April 2, 2024, Big
Bus filed its Answer to the FACC.
 
On April 19, 2024,
Starline filed its Motion to Compel Production of Documents as Set Forth in
Statement of Compliance in Response to Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One [and] Request for Sanctions (“Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance”).
In support of Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Starline concurrently
filed: (1) Separate Statement; and (2) Notice of Lodgment of Filing
Confidential Documents Under Seal. 
 
On May 1, 2024, Big
Bus filed its Opposition to Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance. In support
of its Opposition, Big Bus concurrently filed: (1) Declaration of Joseph B.
Weiner; (2) Separate Statement; and (3) Proof of Service. 
 
On May 7, 2024,
Starline filed its Reply in support of Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance. 
 
On May 7, 2024, the
Court granted Big Bus’ Motion to Compel Compliance with Agreement to Produce
Responsive Documents and Request for Sanctions (“Big Bus’ Motion to Compel
Compliance”). The Court made specific orders in connection with the grant of
that motion. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“The party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall
respond separately to each item or category of item by any of the following:
 
“(1) A statement that the party will comply with
the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the date
set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to paragraph (2)
of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related activities.
 
“(2) A representation that the party lacks
the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling of a particular item or category of item.
 
“(3) An objection to the particular demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
“If a party filing a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails
to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that
party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
“Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (b).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The Parties’ Arguments
 
Starline moves the Court to: (1) compel Big Bus to produce various
documents in response to various RPDs; and (2) issue monetary sanctions in
favor of Starline and against Big Bus and Big Bus’ Counsel. (Starline’s Motion
to Compel Compliance, p. 10:2–8.)
 
Big Bus opposes Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, arguing: (1) that
Big Bus has complied; (2) that Starline misstates Big Bus’ written responses
and objections to the RPDs; (3) that the instant motion is actually a motion
for reconsideration that does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (b); and (4) that Starline’s request for sanctions
should be denied and that sanctions should be granted in favor of Big Bus
instead. (Opposition, pp. 7:13–16, 8:8, 11:1–2, 11:17–21.)
 
In its Reply, Starline argues: (1) that Starline has not misstated Big Bus’
responses; (2) that Big Bus has not complied with its responses; (3) that this
is not a motion for reconsideration; and (4) that there is no service issue
here. (Reply, pp. 2:14, 2:24, 6:14, 7:1.)
 
B. 
    Motions for Reconsideration (and Renewed
Motions)
 
1. 
    Legal Standard
 
“A party who originally made an
application for an order which was refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally
or on terms, may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by
affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown. For a failure to comply with this subdivision, any
order made on a subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on ex parte
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b).)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
        On
July 7, 2023, the Court denied as untimely Starline’s motion to compel further
responses to Starline’s requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) Nos.
25–36 and 45.
 
        Here, Starline seeks compliance as to
RPDs Nos. 22, 25–38, and 43–45. (Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, p.
10:2–8.) 
 
In this instance, an order to compel compliance would necessarily require
that the Court order Big Bus produce certain documents, just as the Court
recently ordered Starline to do in response to Big Bus’ Motion to Compel
Compliance. This is, for all intents and purposes, the same order that was
refused in whole or part on July 7, 2023 on the basis of timeliness. 
 
        Thus, the Court agrees with Big Bus that
most (although not all) of the RPDs at issue must meet the standard for a
renewed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision
(b). (This is distinguished from the standard for a motion for reconsideration
pursuant to Code of Civil section 1008, subdivision (a), which has a strict
timing requirement that has long passed.)
 
        Based on new and different
circumstances, the Court finds that the standard for a renewed motion has been
met. 
 
The new and different circumstances are that Big Bus itself has continued
to seek discovery based on discovery requests that are nearly two years old and
an order that was issued last May. 
 
If Big Bus solely sought new discovery at this late juncture, the Court might
have agreed with Big Bus that Starline had not shown new or different
circumstances from last year. But it would be unfair to allow one party to use
a discovery rule (e.g., a motion to compel compliance) while disallowing
another party from using that same rule when both parties seek material that
should have been produced years ago. “Where the reason is the same, the rule
should be the same.” (Civ. Code, § 3511.) These are the current circumstances
under which the instant motion must be considered.
 
The Court allowed Big Bus to move for an order compelling compliance with
a statement of compliance. “He who takes the benefit must bear the burden.”
(Civ. Code, § 3521.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court allows Starline to move for an order compelling
compliance with a statement of compliance. Starline must still meet its burden
to show that it is entitled to the relief it seeks. 
 
C. 
    The Discovery Requests
 
On October 5, 2022, Starline served Big Bus with Starline’s “Requests for
Production of Documents to Plaintiff Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc., Set One”
(“RPDs”). (Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. A.)
 
On November 8, 2022, Big Bus served Starline with Big Bus’ initial
responses to Starline’s RPDs. (Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. B.)
 
On April 14, 2023, Big Bus served Starline with Big Bus’ supplemental
responses to Starline’s RPDs. (Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. F.)
These appear to be Big Bus’ most recent responses to Starline’s RPDs. 
 
Now, Starline seeks an order that would compel Big Bus to comply with its
statements of compliance. Thus, the fundamental issue before the Court is
determining whether Big Bus has complied with its statements of compliance.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
Starline seeks compliance as to specific RPDs: Nos. 22, 25–38, and 43–45.
(Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, p. 10:2–8.)
 
Notably, Big Bus’ supplemental responses to each of the RPDs at issue
were that Big Bus “will produce . . . non-privileged documents in its
possession, custody, or control” — sometimes with even more specific statements
about what documents would be produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, Exh. F.) These were all statements that Big Bus would comply, not
that Big Bus lacked the ability to comply or objected to compliance. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
The Court considers the production that has occurred to each of these
RPDs.
 
1.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 22: 
 
“All DOCUMENTS RELATED to the cost
incurred by BIG BUS January 1, 2017 to the present to comply with the
REGULATION.”
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 2:23.)
 
Big Bus points to multiple documents it produced, including: (1)
materials reflecting acquisition of certain engine vehicles; (2) invoices and
work orders for filter cleanings and exhaust repairs; (3) invoices for smoke
opacity tests; and (4) a list of diesel particulate filter maintenance
performed on Big Bus’ vehicles, which includes the date of service on those
vehicles and the cost of that service. (Opposition, p. 8:11–23; Starline’s
Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. G, pp. BB_000106–196; BB_000223–288;
BB_000290–299; BB_000301–302; BB_000304–309.)

“DOCUMENTS sufficient to
demonstrate the price of all tickets YOU sold for YOUR bus tours from January
1, 2019 to the present.”
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 3:4.)
 
Big Bus points to documents it
produced, including scans of brochures with prices for its bus tours.
(Opposition, pp. 8:24–9:1; Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. G, pp.
BB_000059–065.)
 
The Court has been presented with evidence of compliance regarding this
RPD. 
 
3.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 26 
 
“All DOCUMENTS RELATED to YOUR
surveillance of STARLINE as alleged in Paragraph 32 of YOUR COMPLAINT.”
 
(Paragraph 32 of Big Bus’ Complaint alleged: “In addition, Big Bus has
been monitoring Starline’s vehicles for over 6 months, and keeping detailed
records. Big Bus’ surveillance efforts — which includes dozens of photographs —
show that nearly every single one of Starline’s vehicles is operating with Utah
registrations, or are running with expired California registration, or without
any DMV registrations at all.” [Bold and italics omitted.])
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 3:9.)
 
Big Bus points to its production of: (1) various photographs Big Bus took
of Starline’s buses; and (2) a report that Big Bus prepared based on those
photographs. (Opposition, p. 9:2–9; Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh.
G, pp. BB_000303; BB_000310–370.)

RPD. 
 
4.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 27: 
 
“All DOCUMENTS RELATED to YOUR
allegations that STARLINE circumvents State regulations, including regular
maintenance and safety inspections.”
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 3:15.)
 
Big Bus again points to the photographs that it took and the report that
it made. (Opposition, p. 9:10–15; Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh.
G, pp. BB_000303; BB_000310–370.) 
 
Big Bus further points to certain evidence that Starline produced,
although the Court notes that this is not relevant to the analysis of whether Big
Bus complied with its statement of compliance. (Opposition, p. 9:15–17.)
 
The Court has been presented with evidence of compliance regarding this
RPD. 
 
5.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 28: 
 
“DOCUMENTS that demonstrate BIG
BUS's monthly market share in the bus tour industry in Los Angeles from January
1, 2019 to the present.”
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 3:19.)
 
Big Bus vaguely points to the “many documents described above” but does
not identify any specific document production that addresses this RPD.
(Opposition, p. 9:18–21.) Big Bus also claims that there may be production of
further documents at some later point “through expert discovery, which has not
yet occurred in this case”. (Id. at p. 9:21–24.)
 
The Court has not been presented with any evidence that Big Bus produced
documents in response to this RPD or otherwise complied with its statement of
compliance to this RPD. 
 
6.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 29: 
 
“DOCUMENTS that demonstrate BIG
BUS's calculations that STARLINE's activities will erode BIG BUS's market share
in 2022 by 15% as alleged in Paragraph 42 of YOUR COMPLAINT.”
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 3:24.)
 
Big Bus vaguely points to the “many documents described above” but does
not identify any specific document production that addresses this RPD.
(Opposition, p. 9:18–21.) Big Bus also claims that there may be production of
further documents at some later point “through expert discovery, which has not
yet occurred in this case”. (Id. at p. 9:21–24.)
 
The Court has not been presented with any evidence that Big Bus produced
documents in response to this RPD or otherwise complied with its statement of
compliance to this RPD. 
 
7.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 30: 
 
“All DOCUMENTS that demonstrate
STARLINE has ‘poached’ BIG BUS's customers as alleged in Paragraph 43 of YOUR
COMPLAINT.”
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 4:1.)
 
Big Bus vaguely points to the “many documents described above” but does
not identify any specific document production that addresses this RPD.
(Opposition, p. 9:18–21.) Big Bus also claims that there may be production of
further documents at some later point “through expert discovery, which has not
yet occurred in this case”. (Id. at p. 9:21–24.)
 
The Court has not been presented with any evidence that Big Bus produced
documents in response to this RPD or otherwise complied with its statement of
compliance to this RPD. 
 
8.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 31: 
 
“All DOCUMENTS that demonstrate
STARLINE has ‘much lower prices’ than BIG BUS as alleged in Paragraph 44 of
YOUR COMPLAINT.”
 
(Paragraph 44 of Big Bus’ Complaint alleged: “Further, Big Bus fears that
the stark contrast between the prices it offers and the much lower prices
Starline offers (based on non-CARB compliance) will damages Big Bus’
reputation, as customers will come to view it as an inflated, overpriced
offering.”)
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 4:5.)
 
Big Bus points to documents it
produced, including: (1) the aforementioned scans of brochures with prices for Big
Bus’ bus tours; and (2) scans of Starline’s brochures and screenshots of
Starline’s websites, which list prices for Starline’s bus tours. (Opposition,
pp. 9:28–10–5; Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. G, pp.
BB_000059–065; BB–000087–104.)

RPD. 
 
9.      REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 32:

Action of YOUR COMPLAINT.”
 
(The first cause of action in Big Bus’
Complaint is for unfair competition pursuant to Business and Professions Code
section 17200.)
 
Starline argues no documents were produced. (Starline’s Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 4:11.)
 
Big Bus points to documents it produced that purportedly support: (1)
claims that Big Bus complied with the CARB regulation (e.g., the documents
showing acquisition of certain engines, various costs of compliance, etc.); and
(2) claims that Starline did not comply with the CARB regulation (e.g., the
photographs Big Bus took and the report it created). (Opposition, p. 10:6–16;
Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, Exh. G, pp. pp. BB_000106–196;

by the Parties, it appears to the Court that Big Bus has complied with some,
but not all, of its statements of compliance. The Court shall order Big Bus to
comply with the statements of compliance with which it has not yet complied.
 
D. 
    Timing of Further Discovery
 
Even though this case started more than two years ago (and the related
case started nearly five years ago), Big Bus does not provide any explanation
for why broad swaths of discovery have yet to be produced to Starline — much
less why expert discovery has yet to begin at all. 
 
        The Court expects compliance with
Chapter 8 of the Civil Discovery Act and timely completion of discovery before
trial. 
 
 
E. 
    Monetary Sanctions
 
Starline requests monetary sanctions against Big Bus and Big Bus’ Counsel
in the amount of $4,810.00. (Starline’s Motion to Compel Compliance, p. 10:2–8;
Reply, p. 7:10–16.)
 
Big Bus requests that the Court deny Starline’s request and instead award
monetary sanctions against Starline in the amount of $2,500.00. (Opposition, p.
11:22–28.)
 
        The Court disagrees with both Parties.
Because Big Bus failed to comply with roughly half of the statements of
compliance at issue (and appears to have complied with roughly the other half),
monetary sanctions are not appropriate for either Big Bus or Starline. 
 
III.
