The court also found that the arbitrator correctly entered a default judgment against Clare | Matrix due to its failure to pay arbitration costs. The court ruled that the arbitrator did not exceed her powers in entering the default judgment. Finally, the court denied Clare | Matrix's motion for a new trial and confirmed the arbitration award.
