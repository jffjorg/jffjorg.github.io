And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants defendant Jerry Davidson's motion for discovery sanctions in part. Plaintiff David Abbasi is ordered to permit defendant Jerry Davidson (and all other parties) to inspect Sean Abbasi's cell phone and copy its contents within 10 days. If plaintiff fails to comply with this order, the court may impose evidence sanctions prohibiting him from presenting evidence of any writings (including audio recordings) found on Sean Abbasi's cell phone. The court finds that plaintiff withheld key evidence, but did not alter or destroy it. The court also finds that plaintiff failed to provide a separate statement and failed to meet and confer with defendants. The court grants defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, but does not impose monetary sanctions. The court exercises its discretion not to impose monetary sanctions against plaintiff. The court notes that defendant's failure to achieve the objects of discovery and to informally resolve this dispute may have contributed to the delay in resolving this matter.
