  order RE:
gilbarco’s motion for determination of
  good faith settlement 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This action was initiated in January
2017 by Plaintiff Speedy Fuel, Inc., and it arises from losses Plaintiff
suffered due to unpaid fuel. Defendant Gilbarco, Inc. allegedly distributed faulty
merchant software that caused payments to be rejected, resulting in no payment
from customers. In August 2018, trial was separated in the following order: (1)
the individual customers were to be tried first; (2) then Gilbarco; (3) then the
payment processors (BAMS defendants); and (4) lastly, the customers’ banks. Plaintiff’s
claims against the individual customers were tried in March 2019. Plaintiff’s
claims against Gilbarco were tried in March 2022. 
            The March 2022 trial resulted in a
verdict in favor of Speedy, Cross-Defendant FH International Service Station
Maintenance, Inc. (FHI), and Cross-Defendant L&S Maintenance (L&S). On
July 25, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Speedy against Gilbarco in
the amount of $1.3 million. Additionally, FHI was awarded $42,875 against
Gilbarco, and L&S was awarded $52,030.55 against Gilbarco. 
            Gilbarco appealed the judgment. The
BAMS Defendants and Bank of America settled with Plaintiff in December 2022. On
June 26, 2023, Plaintiff, Gilbarco, FHI, and L&S entered into a settlement
agreement whereby Gilbarco agreed to pay $1 million to Speedy, $42,875 to FHI,
and $52,030.55 to L&S in exchange for dismissing its appeal. (Hedrick
Decl., Ex. A.) In order to avoid double recovery, the agreement contains a claw-back
provision under which Speedy shall refund Gilbarco certain sums recovered from
customers of the Speedy 1 station and 35% of sums collected from the remaining
defendants. (Ibid.) 
            On October 10, 2023, Gilbarco filed
the instant motion for determination of good faith settlement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6. The motion is unopposed, but Wells Fargo Bank,
NA (Wells Fargo) and JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA (Chase) filed a response on
October 30, 2023, requesting a judicial declaration that the claims against
them are reduced by the full $1 million notwithstanding the claw-back
provision. Speedy and Gilbarco filed their reply responses on November 3, 2023.

LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6
governs the procedure for determining whether a settlement was made in good
faith. The statute provides that a settling party may file an application for
determination of good faith settlement by indicating the settling parties and
the basis, terms, and amount of the settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6,
subd. (a)(2).) The issue of good faith may be determined by the Court based on
affidavits filed with the application and other evidence presented at the
hearing. (Id., § 877.6, subd. (b).) A determination of good faith by the
Court bars any other joint tortfeasor from any further claims against the
settling tortfeasor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. (Id., §
877.6, subd. (c).) 
In Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde
& Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499, the California Supreme Court concluded
that a number of factors must be taken into account in assessing a settlement’s
good faith under Section 877.6, including: (1) a rough approximation of
plaintiffs’ total recovery and the settlor’s proportionate liability, (2) the
amount paid in settlement, (3) the allocation of settlement proceeds among
plaintiffs, (4) a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than
he would if he were found liable after a trial, (5) the financial conditions
and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and (6) the existence of
collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling
defendants. These factors are not exhaustive and may not apply in all cases. (Dole
Food Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 894, 909.) Further,
“[p]ractical considerations require that [their] evaluation be made on the
basis of information available at the time of settlement.” (Ibid.)
Where a settlement’s good faith is contested,
the moving party must make a showing that the Tech-Bilt factors are
satisfied. (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192
Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.) But “when no one objects, the barebones motion which
sets forth the ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets
forth a brief background of the case is sufficient.” (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
            Because the jury verdict resulted in
a judgment of $1.3 million, the settlement amount of $1 million is within the
ballpark of Gilbarco’s potential liability. The Court finds no evidence of
collusion or intent to prejudice the non-settling defendants. “The party
asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6(d).) No party has asserted a lack of good faith, much
less offered any evidence of such. Gilbarco has made a sufficient showing of
good faith considering the lack of opposition. (See City of Grand Terrace,
supra, 192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1261.) 
            Wells Fargo and Chase, and Speedy,
have filed opposing briefs contesting Wells Fargo and Chase’s entitlement to an
offset. This is Gilbarco’s motion for determination of good faith, and the
issue of offset need not be addressed currently. A motion for offset may be
brought as a posttrial motion. (See Garcia v. Duro Dyne Corp. (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 92, 96 [trial court ruled on a motion to determine offset after
jury verdict].) A trial court may retain continuing jurisdiction to determine
offsets from settlement payments. (Id. at pp. 100-101.) “[T]he inquiry
at the good faith settlement stage is not the same as the inquiry at trial,
where complete precision of allocation could presumably be achieved.” (Regan
Roofing Co. v. Superior Court (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1685, 1704.) Therefore,
the Court does not reach the issue of offset. Wells Fargo and Chase may file a posttrial
motion if they are held liable and wish to offset the verdict amount.  
CONCLUSION
            Gilbarco’s motion for determination
of good faith settlement is GRANTED.
