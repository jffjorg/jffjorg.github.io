Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Gilbarco's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The court finds that the settlement amount of $1 million is within the ballpark of Gilbarco's potential liability, and there is no evidence of collusion or intent to prejudice the non-settling defendants. The court notes that Gilbarco has made a sufficient showing of good faith considering the lack of opposition. The court does not reach the issue of offset, as it is not relevant to the determination of good faith.
