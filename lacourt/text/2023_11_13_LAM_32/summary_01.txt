And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrers filed by the defendants without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Elise Fahey, had alleged that she was entitled to 25% of Decedent Harold Budd's royalties and intellectual property rights, which were not subject to distribution by will. Instead, she alleged that Decedent had executed a first codicil adding her as a beneficiary and assigning the royalties to her and Decedent's three sons. However, the court had previously determined that these allegations involved determinations in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Probate Court. In the second amended complaint, the plaintiff reiterates the same allegations but omits any mention of a will or codicil, attempting to avoid the effect of the prior pleading. The court holds that the allegations in the second amended complaint still invoke the exclusive jurisdiction of the Probate Court and that the plaintiff cannot avoid the jurisdiction by omitting relevant facts. The court also notes that even if the claim is based on contract, it still concerns the allocation of property in Decedent's estate, which is subject to exclusive probate jurisdiction.
