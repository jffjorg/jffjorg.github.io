And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Kendall Blevens, signed an arbitration agreement on December 19, 2022, and does not dispute the existence of the agreement. The court finds that the agreement is enforceable by all moving defendants. The plaintiff's argument that Labor Code section 432.6 bars enforcement of the agreement is rejected, as the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the agreement and preempts Labor Code section 432.6. The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the case pending the outcome of arbitration.
