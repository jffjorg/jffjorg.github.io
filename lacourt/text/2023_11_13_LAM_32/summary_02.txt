Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Plaintiffs, granting their motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for admission. The Plaintiffs had requested that the Defendant provide further responses to the requests, which the Defendant had refused to do. The Judge found that the requests were narrowly tailored to ascertain the Defendant's contentions regarding particular issues and that the Defendant did not have a substantial justification for failing to provide further responses. The Judge also awarded sanctions to the Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,720, to be paid by the Defendant and his counsel. The Judge ordered the Defendant to provide further responses to the requests within 15 days.
