     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motions to compel further
  responses to form interrogatories and requests for admission  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 29, 2022, Plaintiff Peter
J. Zomber and Law Offices of Peter J. Zomber, PC initiated this action against
Defendant John Patrick Johnson. Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on January 23, 2023, asserting (1) breach of contract and (2) quantum
meruit. 
            The FAC alleges that the parties
entered into a written fee agreement in 2004, which encompassed representation
in several matters. (FAC ¶ 7.) Plaintiff was retained to represent Defendant in
business matters related to Defendant’s divorce. (Id., ¶ 8.) Around July
2011, Plaintiff left the law firm he was working for and formed his own firm,
and Defendant decided to have Plaintiff continue representing him. (Id.,
¶ 9.) At this time, the parties entered into an oral agreement relating to the
representation and fees. (Ibid.) 
            Around 2014, Plaintiff represented
Defendant in family law matters after Defendant’s attorney substituted out.
(FAC ¶ 10.) Defendant retained another family law attorney at the end of 2014.
(Ibid.) In 2015, Plaintiff’s first law firm dissolved, and he formed Peter
J. Zomber PC. (Id., ¶ 11.) Defendant again followed Plaintiff to the new
firm and continued to be represented by Plaintiff. (Ibid.) Plaintiff continued
to work on Defendant’s divorce case and other matters. (Ibid.) As in
previous years, Defendant continued to pay periodic lump sums toward open invoices
and ongoing work. (Ibid.) In January 2017, Defendant’s second family law
attorney abruptly dissociated from the case and left Plaintiff to try the divorce
case. (Id., ¶ 12.)
            Around April 2020, Defendant’s other
wife filed for divorce, and Defendant attempted to represent himself in the
matter for a while before retaining Plaintiff to represent him. (FAC ¶¶ 13-15.)
The first divorce case concluded in May 2021, and Defendant continued to pay
periodic sums for open invoices on both divorce cases. (Id., ¶ 17.)
Defendant stopped making payments in December 2021 and has since refused to
arbitrate the fee dispute. (Id., ¶¶ 18-22.) This lawsuit followed. 
            Defendant filed an answer to the
complaint on May 24, 2023, and an amended answer on June 16, 2023. The amended
answer alleges that Plaintiff Zomber was inexperienced in family law matters
and inadequately represented Defendant in the dissolution proceedings. 
            On October 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
the instant motions to compel further responses to Requests for Admission and
the associated Form Interrogatory No. 17.1. Defendant filed his oppositions on
October 30 and 31, 2023. Plaintiffs filed their reply on November 3, 2023.   
LEGAL STANDARD
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate; (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  
On receipt of a response to requests for
admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a
further response if that party deems that an answer to a particular request is
evasive or incomplete or an objection to a particular request is without merit
or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)  
MEET AND CONFER
Motions to compel further responses must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to resolve
the issue informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b)(1).)
The Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
(See Turk Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            The subject RFAs mostly ask
Defendant to admit: that Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiffs certain hourly
rates; that Defendant does not dispute Plaintiff’s hourly rates; the time of
Defendant’s last payment to Plaintiffs; that Defendant owes certain amounts; that
Defendant did not make payments towards outstanding amounts; and that Defendant
made intermittent payments towards certain outstanding amounts.
            Other RFAs ask Defendant to admit:
that Defendant requested Plaintiff Zomber’s wife to continue working on a
certain legal matter; that Defendant claimed financial hardship as the reason
for not paying; that Defendant failed to execute a substitution of attorney
form despite multiple requests; and that Defendant was aware Plaintiff Zomber
supervised his wife’s work. 
            Defendant incorporated the same
objection to each RFA. Specifically, Defendant objected that the RFAs call for legal
conclusions and are burdensome and overreaching given the known disputes over
issues such as whether the parties entered into any agreements and whether Defendant
owes certain amounts. Defendant contends that Plaintiffs are intentionally
harassing Defendant by propounding extensive RFAs that Plaintiffs know
Defendant will deny, so that Plaintiffs can force Defendant to respond to the
corresponding FROG No. 17.1. Based on this objection, Defendant refused to
admit or deny the RFAs.    
However, the RFAs are narrowly tailored to
ascertain Defendant’s contentions regarding particular issues. “Requests for
admission are not restricted to facts or documents, but apply to conclusions,
opinions, and even legal questions.” (City of Glendale v. Marcus Cable
Associates, LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 344, 353.) “[T]he fact that the
request is for the admission of a controversial matter, or one involving
complex facts, or calls for an opinion, is of no moment.” (Bloxham v.
Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729, 752.) Plaintiffs are entitled to
propound RFAs in an attempt to narrow the disputed issues for trial. The fact
that Defendant clearly disputes liability does not preclude Plaintiffs from
propounding RFAs to ascertain Defendant’s position on specific issues relating
to liability. 
If Defendant contests the matters raised
in the RFAs, he should simply deny the RFAs. The corresponding information
required under FROG No. 17.1 is part of routine discovery and is not an undue
burden. The time and effort that Defendant utilized drafting this opposition could
have been used to respond to the discovery instead. Defendant’s arguments do
not constitute substantial justification for failing to properly respond to the
discovery. Hence, sanctions are warranted. 
For the two motions, Plaintiffs request a
total of $15,520 for 19.4 hours at $800 per hour. (Turk Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.) This
amount is exaggerated given the simplicity of the motions. The Court finds $1,720
to be reasonable, representing 4 hours at a rate of $400 per hour, plus $120 in
filing fees. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motions to compel
further responses are GRANTED. Defendant shall provide further responses to the
subject RFAs and corresponding FROG No. 17.1 within 15 days. The Court
sanctions Defendant and his counsel in the total amount of $1,720, to be paid
within 30 days.
