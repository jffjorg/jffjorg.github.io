LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP
§1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Interrogatories
CCP §2030.300 states:  “(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:   (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. . . . (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories. . . .”
Request for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to an
inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply:  (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  CCP
§2031.310(a).  A statement of compliance
shall state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will
be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.  CCP §2031.220.  “A representation of inability to comply with
[a] particular demand for inspection . . . shall affirm that a diligent search
and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand.  This statement shall also specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the
responding party.  This statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”  CCP §2031.230. 
A motion to compel further response
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”  CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).  “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on
the moving party to show both:  [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g.,
how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue
in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial).  The fact that there
is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted).  “Declarations are generally used to show the
requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection.  The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’
rather than mere conclusions.”  Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted).  “The declarations may be on information and
belief, if necessary.  However, in such
cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources
of the information) must also be alleged.” 
Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation
omitted).  “Most declarations are made by
the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the
relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.”  Id.
at 8:1495.9.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
Brittany Harman requests an order compelling defendant Kaleo Marketing to
respond further to plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories – Employment, Nos. 209.2,
211.1, 214.1, 214.2, and 216.1, Special Interrogatories 18, 30, 36, 42, and 48,
and Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 22-27 and 29-34.
            As
background, on November 14, 2022, plaintiff served defendant with discovery
requests.  On December 16, 2022,
defendant served responses that contained only objections or did not respond at
all (Request for Production, Nos. 36-50). 
On March 27, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s motions to compel
further responses, including as to the above interrogatories and requests for
production of documents.  
Plaintiff
asserts that on April 26, 2023, defendant served further responses but that
they were deficient and included objections. 
On May 1, 2023, plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer email to
defense counsel, who did not respond. 
Plaintiff’s counsel followed up on May 15 and May 22 but did not get a
response.  On June 27, plaintiff followed
up again, stating that plaintiff would have to move to compel further
responses.  Plaintiff contends that defendant
provided plaintiff with an extension to July 18, 2023 but has not otherwise
responded or met and conferred.
In an
omnibus opposition, defendant contends that the motions and request for
sanctions are improper and unnecessary because defense counsel is working with
defendants to produce further substantive responses.  Defendant also asserts that plaintiff failed
to meet and confer.
            The
court finds that plaintiff sufficiently made attempts to meet and confer.  The court notes that defendant did not file a
responsive separate statement.
            Form
Interrogatories
                        No.
209.2 – in the past 10 years, has any employee filed a civil action against
employer.
                        No.
211.1 – identify every benefit to which the employee was entitled.
                        No.
214.1-2 – requests insurance information
            As
to the above, defendant responded “[t]here was no adverse employment
action.  Plaintiff was not
terminated.  Plaintiff was allowed to
return to work, but she refused to return and she abandoned the position.”  The court finds that the “response” is
non-responsive.
                        No.
216.1 – identify each denial of a material allegation and each affirmative
defense in detail.  Defendant provided a
narrative but did not identify each material allegation and affirmative
defense.
                        The motion is GRANTED as to each of
the above form interrogatories.
 
            Special
Interrogatories
                        No.
18 – describe in detail, every instance that plaintiff was disciplined,
reprimanded, or counseled by employer. 
Defendant made objections of which none have merit.  Defendant did not give a substantive
response.
                        Nos.
30 (identify Christian Dickson), 36 (identify Daniel Livingston), 42
(identify Annette Brown), 48 (identify Nicholas Holden) – plaintiff
defined “identify” as providing information including name, home address,
business address, phone numbers, and job title).  Defendant made objections of which none have
merit.
            The
court finds that defendant’s responses are deficient.
            The
motion is GRANTED as to each of the above special interrogatories.
 
            Request
for Production of Documents  
                        No.
22 – documents re plaintiff’s job performance was lacking, poor,
inadequate, incompetent
                        No.
23 – documents re performance review which plaintiff received while
employed 
                        No.
24 – all performance evaluations, reviews, assessments, and other documents
re plaintiff’s performance
                        No.
25 – documents relating to critiques or criticisms of plaintiff’s
performance, including counselings, warnings, notices, suspensions, and/or
other disciplinary actions
                        No.
26 – all grievances, charges, complaints, requests, and/or suggestions
whether made to, by, or on behalf of plaintiff relating to her job
                        No.
27 – all witness statements employer has obtained regarding claims alleged
in complaint
            As
to the above, defendant responded that it “will comply with the request in
whole and all documents in the demanded category that are in the possession of
defendant will be included in the production. 
No such documents have been found.”
            The
court finds that defendant did not comply with CCP §2031.230, which states:
“A representation of inability to comply with the
particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the
inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.”
 
No. 29 – all
documents re every instance of employment separation of plaintiff 
No. 30 – all
separation agreements, severance agreements, releases of claims pertaining to
terms of employment separation re plaintiff
No. 31 – all
documents relating to termination of employment or independent contractor
relationship between employer and plaintiff
No. 32 – all
documents relied upon by employer in making employer’s decision to terminate
plaintiff’s employment
No. 33 – all
documents re the reasons for plaintiff’s termination
No. 34 – all
documents supporting reasons for plaintiff’s termination
 
As to the
above, defendant responded that it “will comply with the request in whole and
all documents in the demanded category that are in the possession of defendant
will be included in the production.  No
such documents have been found.”  As to a
couple of them, defendant also added that “No such documents have been found
because Plaintiff was not terminated. 
She abandoned her position.”
The court
finds that the defendant’s response does not comply with CCP §2031.230.
The
motion is GRANTED as to the above requests.
 
            Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP § §2030.300(d),
2031.310(h).
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states:  “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the
amount of $2668.91 (interrogatories)
and $2468.91 (documents) against defendant and Mohajerian PC and counsel Al
Mohajerian.  The court finds that sanctions
are warranted and that $2538 ($400/hr. x 6 hrs. plus $138 in filing fees and
costs) is a reasonable amount to be imposed against defendant and defendant’s
attorney in total for both motions.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the ruling.
