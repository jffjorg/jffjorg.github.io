Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the first amended answer filed by defendant Stadco LA, LLC is overruled. The court found that the affirmative defenses set forth in the answer are sufficient as they plead ultimate facts in support. The court also noted that California's liberal pleading standard requires only that the plaintiff be put on notice of the nature of the defenses, and that modern discovery procedures can clarify any ambiguities. The judge ordered defendant Stadco LA, LLC to give notice of the ruling. The case involves a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Diana Hayden against Sofi Stadium, Stadco LA, LLC, and Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. for negligence and premises liability, alleging that the defendants failed to take adequate crowd control measures and security personnel during a Rolling Stones concert, resulting in plaintiff being violently thrown into adjacent bushes.
