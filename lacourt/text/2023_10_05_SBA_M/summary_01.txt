And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants plaintiff Brittany Harman's motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents from defendant Kaleo Marketing, LLC and its attorney Al Mohajerian. The court finds that defendant's responses to the discovery requests were deficient and non-responsive. The court also imposes sanctions on defendant and defendant's attorney in the amount of $2538 for their misuse of the discovery process.

The court orders defendant to serve further responses to plaintiff's Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories within 15 days, and to produce responsive documents, if any, to plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents within 15 days. The court also orders defendant and defendant's attorney to pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The court's ruling is based on the parties' conduct in the case, including defendant's failure to respond to plaintiff's discovery requests and plaintiff's attempts to meet and confer with defendant. The court finds that defendant's responses were not in good faith and were intended to delay or hinder the discovery process.
