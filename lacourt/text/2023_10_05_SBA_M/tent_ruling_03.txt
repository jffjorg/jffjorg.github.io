BACKGROUND
On January 13, 2023, plaintiff
Daphne Mercado filed a complaint for partition by real property against
Porfirio Jimenez and Wells Fargo Financial California, Inc. (“Wells Fargo”) for
partition of the two-unit duplex at 3527 W. 132nd Street, Hawthorne,
CA 90250, held as joint tenants by plaintiff, who is agreeable to sell, and
defendant, who has refused to sell and also refused to buy out the interest of
plaintiff.  Plaintiff and defendant are formerly
boyfriend and girlfriend.  Defendant
Wells Fargo is named pursuant to CCP §872.510 as an entity “having or claiming
interests of record . . . in the estate as to which partition is sought.”  No affirmative relief is sought as to Wells
Fargo.
            On March 2, 2023, defendant Porfifio
Jimenez filed a cross-complaint for indemnification, apportionment of fault,
and breach of contract.  The
cross-complaint alleges that on September 6, 2002, the parties jointly purchased
the real property located at 3527 West 132nd Street, Hawthorne.  At the time of purchase, the parties entered
into an oral agreement to equally contribute towards the upkeep of the subject
property and equally divide any profits when the subject property was eventually
sold.  The parties also agreed that
cross-defendant would manage, maintain, keep an accounting of the rents for the
property.  Cross-complainant agreed to
improve the property by splitting units and creating more living space so that
space could be rented.  Cross-defendant
breached the oral agreement by keeping rents and not sharing them with
cross-complaint, by failing to keep an accounting, by failing to maintain the
property and allowing it to go into disrepair and waste, by collecting Covid
funds and not sharing them with cross-complainant, and by intentionally
damaging the subject property.  As a
result, cross-complainant has sustained damages in the sum of at least
$150,000.
            On March 29, 2023, the court denied
plaintiff’s motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and appointment of
referee without prejudice.
            On May 11, 2023, the court denied
plaintiff’s motion for interlocutory judgment and noted that the statutory
scheme envisions an interlocutory judgment of partition, which must come as a
result of a trial or dispositive motion to determine the parties’ interests and
rights.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  “A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met his
or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that
party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to
judgment on the cause of action.  Once
the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to
the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.  The defendant or cross-defendant shall not
rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable
issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.”  CCP § 437c(p)(1).
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff Daphne Mercado requests summary
judgment on the grounds that there is no triable issue as to any material fact,
and plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the sole cause of
action for partition by sale in the verified complaint.
Property may be partitioned by
physical division, sale of the property and division of the proceeds, or court
approved and supervised partition by appraisal. 
CCP §§873.210-290, 873.510-850, 873.910-980.  Civil Code §872.210 states:  “(a) A partition action may be commenced and
maintained by any of the following persons: 
(1) A co-owner of personal property. (2) An owner of an estate of
inheritance, an estate for life, or an estate for years in real property where
such property or estate therein is owned by several persons concurrently or in
successive estates.”  “’The primary
purpose of a partition suit is, as the terminology implies, to partition the
property, that is, to sever the unity of possession.’”  LEG Investments v. Boxler (2010) 183
Cal. App. 4th 484, 493 (citation omitted). 
“A co-owner of property has an absolute right to partition unless barred
by a valid waiver.  ‘The right of
partition may be waived by contract, either express or implied.’”  Id. (citations omitted).  
CCP §872.120 states, “In the
conduct of the action, the court may hear and determine all motions, reports,
and accounts and may make any decrees and orders necessary or incidental to
carrying out the purposes of this title and to effectuating its decrees and
orders.”  CCP §872.120 does not give the
court authority to order the sale of the property prior to holding a trial,
determining whether plaintiffs have a right to partition, and making an
interlocutory judgment.  “The interests
of the parties, plaintiff as well as defendant, may be put in issue, tried, and
determined in the action.”  CCP
§872.610.  “(a) At the trial, the court
shall determine whether the plaintiff has the right to partition.”  CCP §872.710. 
“(a) If the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to partition, it
shall make an interlocutory judgment that determines the interests of the
parties in the property and orders the partition of the property and, unless it
is to be later determined, the manner of partition.”  CCP §872.720.  “Notwithstanding Section 872.201, the court
shall order that the property be sold and the proceeds be divided among the
parties in accordance with their interests in the property as determined in the
interlocutory judgment . . . .”  CCP
§872.820.   CCP §873.010(a) states, “The
court shall appoint a referee to divide or sell the property as ordered by the
court.”  
The statutory scheme envisions that
the interlocutory judgment of partition will be issued after trial or after
summary judgment.  See LEG Investments
v. Boxler (2010) 183 Cal. App. 4th 484 (reversing denial of, and
ordering trial court to grant, plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication on
partition cause of action).  See also Williams
v. Williams (1967) 255 Cal. App. 2d 648, 652 (affirming summary judgment in
partition action for plaintiff).
Plaintiff presents evidence that on
September 6, 2002, a grant deed was recorded transferring the property [two-unit
duplex at 3527 W. 132nd St., Hawthorne, CA 90250] from a
third-party, a non-party to this action to “Porfirio Jimenez and Daphne
Mercado” as “joint tenants” in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as
Instrument No. 02-2092562.  Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (PUMF) 1.  On September 6, 2002, a deed of trust secured
by the property was recorded in favor of Washington Mutual Bank, FA, in the
Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument No. 2022-093805.  PUMF 2. 
On October 13, 2004, a full reconveyance of the 2002 Trust Deed was
recorded in the Official Records of LA County as Instrument No.
04-2630677.  PUMF 3.  On March 30, 2005, a deed of trust secured by
the property was recorded in favor of Wells Fargo in the Official Records of LA
County as Instrument No. 05-0730275. 
PUMF 4.  On September 23, 2022, a
loan modification agreement secured by the property was recorded in favor of
dismissed Wells Fargo in the Official Records of LA County as Instrument No.
2022-0932805.  PUMF 5.  On all the encumbrances, past and present,
the names of both plaintiff and defendant appear as the “Borrowers.”  PUMF 6. 
On January 13, 2023, plaintiff’s verified complaint was filed.  PUMF 7. 
On February 24, 2023, a notice of pendency of action was recorded in
relation to this case.  PUMF 8.  On March 2, 2023, defendant filed his answer,
without a verification and with an improper general denial.  PUMF 9. 
On March 6, 2023, defendant filed his verified FAA, with an improper
general denial.  PUMF 10.
Plaintiff also presents evidence
that plaintiff has never waived the right to partition the property.  PUMF 14. 
The property is a duplex on a suburban lot.  PUMF 15. 
Plaintiff does not agree to the voluntary method of partition by
appraisal.  PUMF 16.  See plaintiff decl., and exhibits; Scott
Talkov decl.
In referencing the elements of an
interlocutory judgment of partition by sale under CCP §872.720, plaintiff asserts
that the title history shows that plaintiff and defendant each hold a ½
interest in the property.  See also
verified complaint and 2002 Deed.  She
has never waived this statutory right to partition.  Plaintiff also asserts that the property
cannot be divided in kind as it is a two-unit duplex under one APN with no
surplus land.  Moreover, plaintiff
argues, defendant’s answer contained an improper general denial.  “If the complaint is verified . . . the
denial of the allegations shall be made positively or according to the
information and belief of the defendant.” 
CCP §431.30(d).
The court finds that plaintiff has
met her burden of establishing that there is no defense to the sole cause of
action for partition as she has proved each element of the cause of action.  She is thus entitled to an interlocutory
judgment directing that the subject property be sold.  The court finds that each party’s interest in
the subject property is 50%.  The court
also finds that plaintiff has not waived her right to partition.  The court further determines that it is most
equitable to partition the property by sale. 
A referee shall be appointed to sell the property pursuant to CCP §873.010.  After consideration of Matthew Taylor’s
declaration, the court appoints Matthew Taylor as referee in accordance with
the Interlocutory Judgment.
The motion is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
