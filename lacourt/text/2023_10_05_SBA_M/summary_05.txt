And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted defendant's motion to strike portions of the FAC that relate to punitive damages, but has denied the motion as to the allegations of attorney's fees and costs. The judge found that the allegations in the FAC are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as they do not demonstrate that the defendant acted with "malice, fraud, or oppression." The judge ruled that the allegations must be sufficient to show that the defendant's conduct was "despicable" and that the defendant acted with a "willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others."
