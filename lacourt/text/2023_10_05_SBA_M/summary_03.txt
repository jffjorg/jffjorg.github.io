And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, ordering the partition of the two-unit duplex at 3527 W. 132nd Street, Hawthorne, CA 90250, by sale. The property was purchased by the plaintiff and defendant as joint tenants in 2002, but the defendant has refused to sell his interest in the property. The plaintiff has agreed to sell her interest in the property, and the court finds that each party's interest in the subject property is 50%. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not waived her right to partition and that it is most equitable to partition the property by sale. A referee shall be appointed to sell the property, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
