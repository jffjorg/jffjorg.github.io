And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.'s motion to compel binding arbitration. The motion was based on an arbitration provision in the sales contract for a 2022 Toyota Tunder, which was purchased by Plaintiff Julia Hernandez Balderas. The Court found that Defendant TMS lacks standing to enforce the arbitration clause as a third-party beneficiary, as the contract only benefits the signatory parties (Plaintiff and DWWCT LLC) and not the nonsignatory party (Defendant TMS). The Court also found that Defendant TMS does not meet the requirements for equitable estoppel, as the claims do not arise from the sales contract and the breach of warranty is not "intimately founded in and intertwined" with the contract. The Court denied the motion to compel binding arbitration, finding that Defendant TMS lacks standing to enforce the arbitration clause.
