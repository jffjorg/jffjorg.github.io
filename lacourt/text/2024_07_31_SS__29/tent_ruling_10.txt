 Case Number:  23STCV07677    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel
Lillian Sedaghat.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On April 7, 2023, Marco Antonio Torres
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against MV Transportation, Inc. for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence causes of action arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on September 14, 2021.
On May 12, 2023, MV Transportation, Inc.
(“Defendant”) filed an answer.
On May 9, 2024, Lillian
Sedaghat (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No
opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted
at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by
either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts
between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. However, the proof of service is unclear as to whether the
Declaration and Order were properly served on Plaintiff and Defendant. Further,
the hearing information is incorrect on the filed Order, stating the hearing
was set for May 9, 2024.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
