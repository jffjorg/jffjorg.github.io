And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff's counsel, Lillian Sedaghat, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. However, the motion is denied without prejudice due to incomplete proof of service of the necessary documents on the client and defendant. The court notes that the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case, and that the proof of service is unclear. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that counsel can refile the motion with the necessary corrections.
