And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue trial filed by Defendants Brian Wear and Dora Albanez in part. The motion was filed on June 28, 2024, and the trial was originally scheduled for October 7, 2024. The Judge finds that good cause has been shown for a continuance, as the Defendants need more time to prepare for their motion for summary judgment, which is scheduled for January 17, 2025. The continuance is granted to mid-March 2025, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
