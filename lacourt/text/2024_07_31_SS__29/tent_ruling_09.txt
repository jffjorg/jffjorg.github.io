Armin Abazari, Esq. and Law Offices of Sharona Eslamboly Hakim.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is continued.
 
Background
On April 3, 2024, Marvin Sanders
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) for general negligence and motor vehicle
negligence causes of action arising out of an incident where Plaintiff’s
wheelchair was flipped when exiting a bus.
On December 12, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer.
On June 6, 2024, Armin
Abazari, Esq. and Law Offices of Sharona Eslamboly Hakim (“Counsel”)
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. However, the notice of motion is for Dept. 31 at 8:30 a.m. This
motion was filed on June 6, 2024, however, this matter was transferred to Dept.
29 on June 24. Counsel filed an updated notice of motion for the new department
and time, Dept. 29 at 1:30 p.m. on July 29, 2024. This notice of motion being
served on Plaintiff by mail two days before the hearing likely would not
provide sufficient notice of the hearing.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is CONTINUED so that counsel can provide proper notice of the department
in which the motion will be heard.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is CONTINUED for approximately 21 days.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
