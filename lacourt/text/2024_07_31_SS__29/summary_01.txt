And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by August Roofing, Inc. The motion was filed on June 6, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The Judge analyzed the settlement under the Tech-Bilt factors and found that it was made in good faith. The settlement was for a payment of $5,000 by August Roofing, Inc. to Plaintiff Omar Garcia Aviles, who fell through an unfinished roof while working on a construction site on October 24, 2020. The Judge considered factors such as the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The Judge found that the settlement was fair, particularly in light of the unlikelihood that August would be held liable for Plaintiff's injuries.
