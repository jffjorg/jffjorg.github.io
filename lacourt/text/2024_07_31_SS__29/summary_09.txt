And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Armin Abazari, Esq. and Law Offices of Sharona Eslamboly Hakim on behalf of Plaintiff Marvin Sanders. The motion is continued due to insufficient notice of the hearing. The court finds that the notice of motion was served on the Plaintiff by mail two days before the hearing, which may not provide sufficient notice of the department in which the motion will be heard. The judge orders the motion to be continued for approximately 21 days to allow counsel to provide proper notice of the department.
