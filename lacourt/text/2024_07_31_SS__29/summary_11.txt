English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to oppose the entry of judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Judge finds that the motion is premature and procedurally improper, as it does not identify a specific order being requested. Additionally, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's conclusory assertion of duress is not sufficient to prove duress, and more evidence is required to establish the existence of duress. The ruling does not express any views on the enforceability of the settlement agreement.
