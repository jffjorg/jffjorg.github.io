 Case Number:  22STCV34488    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Sanctions filed by Plaintiff Eric Jason Austin.
 
Tentative
The request for terminating, issue, and
evidence sanctions is denied.
The request for monetary sanctions is granted
in part.
Background
On
October 27, 2022, Eric Jason Austin (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”), Amadu Tejan Bah (“Bah”), and Does 1 to 100, asserting
causes of action for general negligence; negligent hiring, training, retention,
and supervision; and motor vehicle negligence arising out of an automobile
accident that occurred on October 14, 2021, at or near the intersection of
Vermont Avenue and 43rd Street in Los Angeles. Lyft and Bah filed their answers
on January 27 and May 1, 2023.
 
As is
relevant to the matter before the Court and set for hearing on July 31, the
Court made an order on June 3, 2024 (“the June 3 Order”), granting Lyft’s
motion and compelling Plaintiff to appear for a physical examination.  The June 3 Order stated that the examination
was to include (among other things) “interrogation of the spinal cord simulator
system” and that the examination was to be “administered only by Dr. [Joshua]
Prager.”  
 
On June
14, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for terminating, issue, evidence, and
monetary sanctions against Lyft, arguing that Lyft violated the Court order by
having the examination performed, in part, by someone other than Dr. Prager.
 
Lyft filed an
opposition on July 18.  Plaintiff filed a
reply on July 24.
 
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Plaintiff
seeks terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions arising Lyft for the
violation of a court order.  The court’s
order provided that the physical examination at issue was to be administered
only by Dr. Prager, but, according to the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel
submitted with the moving papers, an undisclosed person with the name of
“Tiffany” performed part of the examination as it related to the spinal cord
stimulator.  (Domingo Decl., ¶ 4.)  
The
declarations submitted by Lyft with its opposition fills in some additional
details regarding the examination.
According
to Dr. Prager, prior to the examination, he did not know the manufacturer of
the spinal cord stimulator at issue (Prager Decl., ¶ 5.)  During the examination, he learned that the
manufacturer was Nevro, whose data reader Dr. Prager did not have.  (Id., ¶ 6.) 
Dr. Prager reached out to Nevro, who sent a representative (Tiffany) to
Dr. Prager’s office.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)  Tiffany was in the examination room for
approximately five minutes, placed a data reader close to Plaintiff’s spinal
cord stimulator, and retrieved the data. 
(Id., ¶¶ 9-11.)
Notably,
Plaintiff was accompanied at the examination by counsel.  (Id., ¶ 3.) 
Neither Plaintiff nor his counsel objected to Tiffany’s presence or her
retrieving of the data from the spinal cord stimulator.  (Id., ¶ 12.) 
It was only later in the day, after the examination, that Plaintiff
stated any objection to Tiffany and her retrieval of the data.  (Blackburn Decl., ¶ 8; see also Domingo
Decl., ¶ 6 & Exh. B.)
In
connection with its reply, Plaintiff filed a declaration stating that the
manufacturer of the spinal cord stimulator months before the examination.  (Domingo Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, 7 & Exhs.
A, C.)
The
Court has considered all of the evidence in the record, and the arguments of
both sides, and rules as follows:
First,
the Court finds that Lyft violated the Court’s June 3 Order.  The June 3 Order stated that the
“interrogation of the spinal cord [stimulator] system” was part of the
“examination” and that the examination was to be “administered only by Dr.
Prager.”  
If Lyft
was unable to comply with the order because Dr. Prager did not have an
appropriate data reading device to conduct the examination, then Lyft should
have sought an agreement from Plaintiff’s counsel (who was present at the
examination) that an additional person would take part in the examination; if
Plaintiff’s counsel would not agree, then Lyft should have returned to Court to
seek a modification of the June 3 Order. 
But Lyft did neither of these things: instead, Dr. Prager unilaterally
decided to violate the order and have someone else take part in the
examination.
Second,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for nonmonetary sanctions.
For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Plaintiff has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, for nonmonetary discovery sanction
should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better
position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with
its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge,
supra, 238 Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.) 
Here, at this time, an issue or evidence sanction would create such a
windfall for Plaintiff.  Lyft was and is
entitled to obtain the data from Plaintiff’s spinal cord stimulator; barring
Lyft from using that evidence (or imposing some other nonmonetary sanction)
would place Plaintiff in a better position that he would have been in if Lyft
had acted in compliance with the June 3 Order.
Third, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions for Lyft’s violation of the June 3 Order.  The Court sets sanctions in the amount of
$1,925, calculated based on 5.5 hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $350 per hour.  (See
Domingo Decl., ¶ 7.)
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions is GRANTED
in part and DENIED in part. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions,
and evidence sanctions.
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
The
Court ORDERS Defendant Lyft, Inc. and counsel of record Hawkins Parnell &
Young LLP, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,925 within 30 days of notice.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
