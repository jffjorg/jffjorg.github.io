Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The motion was filed because the Plaintiff failed to serve verified responses to interrogatories and document requests, and failed to pay monetary sanctions ordered by the Court. The Judge found that the Defendant did not provide sufficient evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, and that less severe sanctions would not have led to compliance with the discovery rules. The Judge also noted that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the Defendant, and that the Plaintiff's failure to serve verified responses was the result of an error by counsel. The Judge concluded that the motion for terminating sanctions is denied.
