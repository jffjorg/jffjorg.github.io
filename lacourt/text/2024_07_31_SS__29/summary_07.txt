Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Eric Jason Austin, against Lyft, Inc. and Amadu Tejan Bah. The motion was filed in response to the defendants' alleged violation of a court order regarding a physical examination of the plaintiff.

The judge found that the defendants did violate the court order, as they allowed someone other than Dr. Prager to perform part of the examination related to the spinal cord stimulator. However, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for terminating, issue, and evidence sanctions, finding that there was no evidence of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that could not be cured by lesser sanctions.

The judge did grant the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, awarding $1,925 to the plaintiff. The judge also ordered the defendants to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice.

The judge's ruling was based on the court's consideration of all the evidence in the record, as well as the arguments of both sides. The judge emphasized the importance of complying with court orders and the Civil Discovery Act, and noted that the court's goal is to obtain compliance with these rules, not to punish parties.
