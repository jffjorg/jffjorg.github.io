On

On May

admission served on Plaintiff, to be heard on June 7, 2024.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for December 4, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Uber
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission
served on Plaintiff and to impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION  
On
March 12, 2024, Uber served requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses by the time Uber filed this motion on May 9, 2024. 
The
Court grants the motion and deems admitted the matters specified in the
requests for admission. 
Sanctions
are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).  Uber requests $1,800.00 in sanctions based on
5.25 hours spent by one of its attorneys at a rate of $300.00 per
hour and .5 hours spent by another attorney at a rate of $575.00
per hour.  Counsel spent four hours to
prepare the moving papers, .5 hours to review the motion, and .25 hours in meet
and confer efforts.  Counsel anticipated spending 1.0 hour to attend the hearing. 
The
Court grants sanctions of $500.00 based on two hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS Defendant Uber
Technologies, Inc.’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission, set one.  The Court deems the
matters admitted. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s request for sanctions and
orders Plaintiff George Leong to pay Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. $500.00
within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.
