And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The Plaintiff, Andrez Lizarraga, filed an action against Walmart, Inc., Manager Katherine Chou, and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises liability. The case was previously dismissed on April 5, 2024. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal to be heard on June 7, 2024.

The Court finds that the dismissal was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, specifically a calendaring error by the Plaintiff's counsel. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The Court vacates the April 5, 2024 dismissal and sets an OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint on July 7, 2024. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
