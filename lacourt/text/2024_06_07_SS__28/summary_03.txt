And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court rules on the motion by SSA Containers, Inc. to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission. SSA served requests for admission on March 14, 2024, and Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses. SSA filed a motion to deem admitted matters on May 1, 2024, and Plaintiff served responses on May 24, 2024. The Court finds that SSA is entitled to sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c) and grants sanctions of $500.00. The Court denies SSA's motion as moot since Plaintiff has now served responses. The Court concludes that SSA's failure to grant Plaintiff's request for additional time to serve responses was reasonable and that SSA's counsel should have responded promptly to Plaintiff's request.
