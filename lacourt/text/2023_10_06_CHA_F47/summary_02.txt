And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Re-Max All Pro, Charla Gonzalez, and Virginia Rios, to the entire complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Delia M. Gonzalez, Monica M. Gonzalez, and Jessica Acosta. The complaint alleges various causes of action, including breach of contract, fraud, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and premises liability, arising from the purchase of real property.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. Specifically, the judge found that the complaint does not specify which defendants are alleged to have committed which acts, and that many of the causes of action are not properly pled.

The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint to cure the defects in their pleading. The motion to strike the complaint's requests for punitive and exemplary damages and emotional distress damages is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law, including Careau & Co. (1990) 222 CA3d 1371 and Otworth (1985) 166 CA3d 452.
