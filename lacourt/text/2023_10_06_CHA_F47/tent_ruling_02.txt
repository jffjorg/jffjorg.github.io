SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Delia M. Gonzalez,
Monica M. Gonzalez and Jessica Acosta’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of real property
commonly known as 9043 Greenbush Avenue in Pacoima California from Defendants
Maria Ramos and Gilardo Ramos (the Sellers). 
Defendants Re-Max All Pro, Charla Gonzalez, an alleged real estate
agent, and Virginia Rios, an alleged licensed real estate broker, were
seemingly involved in the sales transaction. 

 
Plaintiffs allege that the Sellers “along with broker and
agent, made representations to Plaintiff about subject property described in
this complaint that were wholly false, Seller, broker, and agent for seller
conveyed property that had been repaired, patched, and painted to conceal that
the roof needed to be replaced; that mold had to be removed by an expert mold
removing company; and that there was significant rotted wood in the walls and
ceilings.”  (Complaint ¶16).  Plaintiffs further allege that “[b]oth
realtors and brokers knew that sellers had painted over observable water
damaged [sic]” and that “[t]his damage was not observable to Plaintiffs.”  (See  Complaint ¶17).   
 
As a result of the foregoing, on 4/5/23, Plaintiffs,
representing themselves, filed this action against Remax All Pro, Charla
Gonzalez and Virginia Rios (collectively, Defendants) and others alleging
various causes of action.  The caption of
the complaint lists the causes of action as: (1) Breach, (2) Violation of Civil
Code 1102, (3) Fraud by Concealment, (4) Negligence, (5) Conversion and (6)
Battery.  The body of the complaint
includes causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud; (3) Negligence;
(4) Civil Battery; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional  Distress and (6) Premises Liability.  The complaint does not specify against which
defendants each cause of action is alleged. 
Since Plaintiffs did not provide a telephone number or email address on
their complaint, Defendants’ counsel sent Plaintiffs a letter in an attempt to
meet and confer regarding issues with the complaint; however, Plaintiffs never
responded.  (See Hawatmeh Decl.).
 
Therefore, on 6/15/23, Defendants filed and served the
instant demurrer to the entire complaint and motion to strike which seeks to
strike Plaintiffs’ request for punitive and exemplary damages (Complaint ¶50a,
p.12:7-8, Complaint ¶50b, p.12:11) and Plaintiff’s request for emotional
distress damages (Complaint ¶46, p.11:8-14). 
Plaintiffs have not opposed or otherwise responded to the demurrer or
motion to strike.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants demur to the entire complaint on the grounds
that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and it
is uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  
 
The complaint is uncertain in that the causes of action
in the caption do not match those in the complaint.  Additionally, it is not clear what is being
alleged against Defendants as none of the causes of action contain specific
allegations regarding Defendants.  
 
Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) a contract between the parties, (2) plaintiffs’ performance or excuse for
nonperformance of their obligations under the contract, (3) the defendants’
breach of their contractual obligations, and (4) resulting damages to the
plaintiffs.  Careau & Co.
(1990) 222 CA3d 1371, 1388.
 
Plaintiffs’ 1st cause of action appears to be
based on a written contract between the Plaintiffs and the Sellers.  (Complaint ¶24).  A claim for breach of a written contract must
set forth the terms of the contract verbatim in the body of the complaint or
attach a copy of the contract and incorporate it by reference.  Otworth (1985) 166 CA3d 452, 458-459; Twaite
(1989) 216 CA3d 239, 252. 
 
Although Plaintiffs allege that a copy of the agreement
is attached to the complaint, it is not. 
(See Complaint, generally). 
Additionally, based on the allegations in the complaint, it appears that
the underlying contract was between Plaintiffs and the Sellers, not Plaintiffs
and Defendants.  (Complaint ¶24).  As such, Plaintiffs have failed to allege the
essential element of a contract between Plaintiffs and Defendants.  See Careau & Co., supra.      
 
Violation of Civil Code 1102/Negligence
 
Both a claim for violation of Civil Code 1102 and a claim
for negligence require that Defendants owed Plaintiffs a duty that was
breached, causation and damages.  See
Pultz (1986) 184 CA3d 1110, 1117; Hegyes (1991) 234 CA3d 1103,
1134.  This cause of action is based on
the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-22 of the complaint.  (Complaint ¶43).  It cannot be determined from paragraphs 1-22
of the complaint what duty or duties Plaintiffs contend Defendants owed them
which were breached and thereby caused them damages.  
 
Fraud
 
The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity; (c) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce reliance); (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage. 
Engalla (1997) 15 C4th 951, 974. 
Fraud claims must be specifically pled with facts showing how, when,
where, to whom and by what means the representations were made.  Lazar (1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  
 
Again, Plaintiffs rely on the allegations in paragraphs
1-22 to support their fraud claim. 
(Complaint ¶41).  However, neither
those paragraphs nor the remainder of the allegations in the complaint include
the necessary specific facts to state a claim for fraud against
Defendants.  
 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
 
The elements of a cause of action of intentional
infliction of emotional distress are: (1) outrageous conduct by defendants; (2)
intention to cause or reckless disregard of the probability of causing
emotional distress; (3) severe emotional suffering, and (4) actual and
proximate causation of the emotional distress. 
Hughes (2009) 46 C4th 1035, 1050. 
This cause of action is also based on paragraphs 1-22 in the
Complaint.  (Complaint ¶47).  The allegations in these paragraphs do not
include sufficient facts to state a claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress against Defendants. 
Plaintiffs have not pled facts showing the type of extreme and
outrageous conduct by Defendants necessary to state such a claim.  
 
Premises Liability
 
Premises liability is a specialized form of negligence
which relates to care in managing real property, to prevent risk of
unreasonable harm to others.  McIntyre
v. Colonies-Pacific LLC (2014) 228 CA4th 664, 671.  This cause of action is also based on the
allegations in paragraphs 1-22 of the complaint.  (Complaint ¶49).  As with the negligence cause of action,
Plaintiffs have failed allege a duty on the part of Defendants owed to
Plaintiffs and how such duty was breached causing damages to Plaintiffs.  
 
Battery
 
Plaintiffs merely list the elements of a civil battery
claim ((1) defendant touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with
the intent to harm  or offend plaintiff;
(2) plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3) plaintiff was harmed or
offended by defendant’s conduct; and (4) a reasonable person in plaintiff’s
position would have been offended by the touching) and relies on the
allegations in paragraphs 1-22 to support the cause of action.  (Complaint ¶44).  Once again, 
Plaintiff has failed to allege facts to support a finding of liability
on the part of these Defendants for a claim of battery.  
 
Conversion  
 
While the caption of the Complaint includes conversion as
the purported 5th cause of action, no such claim appears in the body
of the complaint.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to
state any of the claims asserted against Defendants in the complaint.  Additionally, the complaint is so uncertain
as to the bases of the claims against Defendants that they cannot reasonably
respond.  Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained.
 
Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend and
because this is only the original complaint, Plaintiffs are given the
opportunity to try to cure the defects in their pleading.  Plaintiffs are given 30 days to file their
amended complaint.  
 
Based on the sustaining of the demurrer as to the
entirety of the complaint, the motion to strike is placed off calendar as
moot.
