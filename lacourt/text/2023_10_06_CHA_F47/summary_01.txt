And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Petitioner, United Financial Casualty Company, filed a petition to open a Superior Court file and secure a case number on June 13, 2023. The petition is related to an underinsured motorist arbitration proceeding under the insurance policy of Plumbing Solutions Inc. The Petitioner served the petition on attorney Niko Paris, who claims to represent the Respondent, Colin Boatman. However, there is no evidence that attorney Paris actually represents the Respondent, and the Respondent has not appeared in the action.

The Court will hold a hearing on October 6, 2023, to determine whether the petition should be granted. If the Respondent and/or attorney Paris appear at the hearing, acknowledge attorney Paris' representation of the Respondent, and concede receipt of the petition, the petition will be granted. The Court will also require attorney Paris to provide the Court with his contact information to be entered as the address of record for the Respondent.

If the Respondent and/or attorney Paris do not appear at the hearing, the Court will continue the hearing to allow the Petitioner to either personally serve the Respondent with the petition or explain why such personal service is not required.
