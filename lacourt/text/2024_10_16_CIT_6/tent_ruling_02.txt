   [1] The Court notes that the scope of the subpoenas is much broader than just  employment records, as they also seek “compensation records, payroll records…  benefit records.” (Zurita-Cruz Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 29, 36, 43.) But, given  Defendant’s statements in its opposition that it is not seeking private  financial records, and is only seeking certain employment and training records,  the Court construes those statements as a concession to limit the scope of Defendant’s  subpoenas to employment and training records. (Opp., 3:20-23, 5:2-3.)
