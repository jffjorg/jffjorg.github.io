And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint. The motion is denied in part, and granted in part. The court finds that the restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco are not preempted by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, and therefore denies the motion to strike paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 57, and 58. The court grants the motion to strike paragraphs 3 and 4 of the complaint, which concern statistics on premature death from smoking-related illness and the use of flavored tobacco products by minors and young adults. The court finds that these paragraphs are not essential to support the plaintiff's claims. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement, and are required to give notice of the ruling.
