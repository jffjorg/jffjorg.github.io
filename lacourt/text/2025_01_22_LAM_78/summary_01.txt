And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's motion for attorney fees. The case involves a FEHA action brought by Plaintiff Thomas Weeks against Defendant California Institute of Technology and others. The Defendant moved for summary adjudication and judgment of nonsuit, and the jury ultimately found in favor of Defendant. The Defendant argues that Plaintiff's action was frivolous because the jury found that Plaintiff was not disabled and because Defendant's treating medical providers testified that Plaintiff was never diagnosed with a disability. However, the Judge finds that Plaintiff's action was not frivolous because it survived both a motion for summary adjudication and a motion for nonsuit. The Judge also notes that the Defendant must show that no reasonable attorney would have brought the case at its inception, or that there was some decisive point between the filing of the complaint and jury trial where the case became obviously baseless. Since the Judge does not find that the lawsuit was frivolous, egregious, or vexatious, the Defendant is not entitled to attorney fees as a prevailing defendant. The motion for attorney fees is denied.
