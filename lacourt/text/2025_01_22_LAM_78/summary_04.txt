And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion by the attorney for Plato By Markas Jon LLC to be relieved as counsel. The attorney, Zachary Levine, had moved to be relieved because the defendant has dissolved its corporate status and no longer wants to engage his services. The motion was unopposed, and the judge has ordered counsel to file proof of service of the final order within 10 days. The judge has also set an order to show cause regarding the status of legal representation of the defendant, as a corporation cannot represent itself. The hearing is scheduled for January 22, 2025, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
