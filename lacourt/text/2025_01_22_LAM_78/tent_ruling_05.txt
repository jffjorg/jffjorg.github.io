 Case Number:  24STCV11322    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2025    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, Plaintiff(s), vs. JOHN CARPENTIERI, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 24STCV11322 Hearing Date: January 22, 2025   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff The People of the State of California (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action for injunctive relief against defendants John N. Carpentieri, Weird Willie’s II, JNC E-Commerce Inc., and Does 1 to 25 alleging that defendants John N. Carpentieri, Weird Willie’s II, JNC E-Commerce Inc. (collectively “Defendants”) are the largest exclusive tobacco retailer in the City of Los Angeles (“the City”). (Compl. ¶¶ 1-2.) Plaintiff alleges state and local laws adopted since 2022 prohibit the sale of flavored tobacco, and that Defendants continued to sell flavored tobacco to adults and minors despite written notice of the City’s ban on flavored tobacco and the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office’s cease and desist letters to each of Defendants’ ten brick-and-mortar stores. (Compl. ¶ 2.) The Complaint sets forth a single cause of action for violation of Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) pursuant to Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq. On August 20, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to strike (1) the entirety of paragraphs 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45 on the grounds that the state and local laws are preempted by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (“TCA”), (2) in part paragraphs 1, 2, 36, 37, 46, 47, 49, 57 and 58 on the grounds of preemption under the TCA, (3) the entirety of paragraphs 3, 4, 38, 48 on the grounds that the allegations are prejudicial, and (4) in part paragraph 6 on the grounds that the allegation is prejudicial. On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On December 13, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.  II. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT Before filing a motion to strike, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion to strike and file a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5(a).) Defendants’ counsel declares the parties met and conferred by telephone on July 25, 2024 and August 19, 2024 regarding the motion, and the parties were unable to resolve their differences. (Casero Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) The Court finds Defendants have met the meet and confer requirement prior to filing the motion.   III. LEGAL STANDARD The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿ The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with California law, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is one that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subd. (b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)  IV. DISCUSSION Federal Preemption Defendants argue allegations related to the prohibition on the sale of flavored tobacco predicated upon the LAMC and the California Health & Safety Code should be stricken because they are expressly preempted by the TCA. In opposition, Plaintiff cites R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Cnty. of Los Angeles (2022) 29 F.4th 542 (R.J. Reynolds), arguing that the Ninth Circuit found that a local ban on the sale of flavored tobacco is not preempted by the TCA, and that the issue presented in R.J. Reynolds closely mirrors the City and California bans at issue here. In R.J. Reynolds, Los Angeles County adopted an ordinance that banned the sale of flavored tobacco products. As a result, multiple tobacco companies challenged the ban, arguing that the TCA’s preemption clause expressly and impliedly preempts the ban. The Reynolds court found that the text of the TCA reflects its “unique preemption structure gives the federal government exclusive power to set “tobacco product standards,” while preserving state, local, and tribal authority to regulate or ban sales of those products altogether. Consistent with this structure, it would be a mistake to read “tobacco product standards” in the TCA's preemption clause so broadly as to encompass the type of sales ban challenged in this case—particularly since the TCA both expressly preserves and exempts from preemption local authority over that exact type of regulation. The preemption clause therefore does not cover the County's sales ban. But even if it did, the savings clause “saves” it from preemption because a sales ban qualifies as a “requirement[ ] relating to the sale” of tobacco products.” (Id. at 552.) The R. J. Reynolds case is persuasive authority, and the arguments and issues raised therein are on point with the instant matter. Further, the Court is not persuaded that R.J. Reynolds must be disregarded because it was analyzing a County of L.A., rather than a City of L.A., ordinance. The salient point is that the Ninth Circuit concluded that a local flavored tobacco sales ban, very similar to the one at issue in the instant matter, was not preempted by the TCA. As such, the Court finds it unnecessary to reiterate the entirety of R.J. Reynolds’ holding. Absent binding authority on the issue concerning the TCA’s preemption, preservation, and saving clauses as applied to a state or locality’s prohibition of the sale of flavored tobacco products, the Court agrees with and is thus inclined to follow the reasoning espoused in R.J. Reynolds. Since the TCA explicitly preserves local authority to enact “more stringent” regulations than the TCA, the Court finds that the restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco is neither expressly nor impliedly preempted. (R.J. Reynolds, supra, 29 F.4th at 548.) Accordingly, the motion to (1) strike the entirety of paragraphs 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45 on the grounds that the state and local laws are preempted by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (“TCA”) and (2) strike in part paragraphs 1, 2, 36, 37, 46, 47, 49, 57 and 58 is DENIED. Superfluous Allegations Defendants argue paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 38, and 48 include allegations that are irrelevant, immaterial, and unfairly prejudicial because they are not critical to any claim or defense to the action. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the proximity of Defendants’ retail locations to school is relevant to explain why the City Attorney is pursuing this prosecution and is not prejudicial. The Court has reviewed the allegations and finds that paragraphs 6, 38 and 48 are sufficiently relevant to the allegations of the Complaint and prayer for relief. The motion seeking to strike these paragraphs are DENIED. However, paragraphs 3 and 4 concerning the statistics of premature death of children from smoking-related illness and the use of flavored tobacco products by minors and young adults are not essential to support Plaintiff’s claims. The motion to strike paragraphs 3 and 4 are GRANTED.  V. CONCLUSION Defendants’ motion to strike paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 57 and 58 of the Complaint is DENIED. Defendants’ motion to strike paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Complaint is GRANTED without leave to amend.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: January 21, 2025 __________________________ Hon.
