Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Rebecca
Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo is a visually
impaired and legally blind individual. Defendant My Lil Town Franchise (My Lil
Town) is a California corporation that operates a commercial website available
to the public.
As
early as February 2024, Castillo visited My Lil Town’s website multiple times
and alleges the following barriers to access existed: (1) graphics, links, and
buttons on the website were mislabeled or lacked alternative text (alt-text)
for screen-reading software to read out; (2) multiple pages contained insufficient
navigational headings; (3) the website contained an inaccessible video; and (4)
the functions for creating an account and booking a birthday party reservation
were inaccessible.
On April
2, 2024, Castillo filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against My
Lil Town and Does 1-10, alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act
(UCRA). On April 13, 2024,
Castillo’s process server personally served My Lil Town in Granada Hills.
On May 16, 2024, My Lil Town filed an answer
to the Complaint. On October 22, 2024, the court struck the answer after My Lil
Town failed to obtain legal representation and entered default against My Lil
Town.
On November
27, 2024, Castillo submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for January 10, 2025.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Castillo
seeks default judgment against My Lil Town in the total amount of $9,089.00,
including $4,000.00 in statutory damages, $4,000.00 is deterrence damages, $570.00
in attorney fees, and $519.00 in costs. Because the court finds Castillo has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Castillo’s application
for default judgment, but declines to award $4,000.00 in deterrence damages.
Here,
Castillo alleges Castillo faced barriers when Castillo visited Defendant’s website on
February 27, 2024 and March 18, 2024, but was unable to book a birthday party
at Defendant’s brick and mortar location. Further, Castillo makes the general
and conclusory allegation that Castillo has been deterred from Defendant’s
physical storefront because she could not book the birthday party, but failed
to allege a specific instances of deterrence, or any specificity as to web
pages which were inaccessible. (Complaint, ¶¶ 39 and 40.) Thus, the Court
declines to award $4,000 in deterrence damages, but instead reduces the
requested amount to $2,000.
Accordingly,
default judgment is entered in the total amount of $7,089.00.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Castillo’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
