for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs TNJ Logistics Inc. and Bomao, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a sales agreement. In April 2023,
Plaintiffs TNJ Logistics Inc. (TNJ) and Bomao, Inc. (Bomao) entered into a
sales and purchase agreement with Defendants TJPF Trucking, Inc. (TJPF) and
Shiqiang Zhang in which TNJ and Bomao agreed to sell three tractors to TJPF and
Zhang. After TNJ and Bomao allegedly transferred the tractors, they allege TJPF
and Zhang failed to make the required installment payments. Following their
repossession and sale of the tractors, TNJ and Bomao allege TJPF and Zhang owe
an outstanding balance of $75,000.00. They also allege TJPF and Zhang owe
$11,451.00 in inspection and parking fees that were incurred when Zhang brought
one of the tractors in for an inspection and refused to pick it up.
On October
19, 2023, TNJ and Bomao filed a complaint against TJPF, Zhang, and Does 1-10, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) common counts, (3)
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (4) violation of
Civil Code section 8800, and (5) false promise. On October 27, 2023, TNJ and
Bomao’s process server personally served TJPF and Zhang in Hacienda Heights.
On December
5, 2023, the court entered default against TJPF and Zhang after they failed to
file a timely answer. On December 5, 2024, TNJ and Bomao submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for January 10, 2025.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
TNJ
and Bomao seek default judgment against TJPF and Zhang in the total amount of $90,417.31,
including $89,703.09 in damages and $714.22 in costs. ¿For the following
reasons, the court DENIES TNJ and Bomao’s application without prejudice.
In
their Complaint and supporting declarations, TNJ and Bomao request $86,551.00
in damages for $75,000.00 in unpaid installment payments, $451.00 in inspection
fees and fines, and $11,100.00 in parking fees. (Complaint, ¶ 58-61; Wang
Decl., ¶ 9-12; Yang Decl., ¶ 9-12.)
While
Plaintiffs requested $2,587.87 at an undefined interest rate of 2.99%, they failed
to provide the statutory or contractual authority for imposing this rate and
failed to include the interest computations as required. Furthermore, the total
sum of the requested interest and damages is only $89,138.87 which does not
equal the amount requested on their CIV-100 form.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, TNJ and Bomao’s application for
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
