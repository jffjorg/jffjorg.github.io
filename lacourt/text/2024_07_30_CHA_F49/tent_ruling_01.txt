Elizabeth Iniguez Marquez (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant FCA USA LLC
(“FCA”)
NOTICE: OK.

BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs filed this Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”) lawsuit over alleged defects in their 2020 Jeep
Gladiator with VIN: 1C6JJTEG1LL208648 (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was
manufactured by Defendant FCA. Plaintiffs allege that they purchased the
Subject Vehicle on March 12, 2022, entering into a warranty contract with FCA.
(Compl. ¶ 15.)
 
On May 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their
Complaint against Defendants FCA, San Fernando Motor Company (“SFMC”), and Does
1 through 10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Violation of SBA – Breach
of Express Warranty (against FCA), and (2) Negligent Repair (against SFMC).
Subsequently, FCA and SFMC filed their respective Answers to the Complaint on
June 21, 2023.
 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant Motion to Compel Further Responses from FCA to their Special
Interrogatories (“SROG”), Set One, Nos. 45-48 (the “Motion”).
 
On July 10, 2024, FCA filed its
Opposition. Subsequently, Plaintiffs replied on July 16, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within
45 days following the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); but see Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136
[suggesting that the 45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin
to run with service of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses
that are required to be verified].)
 
The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
“Any period of notice, or any right or duty to do
any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the
service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or
rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court
days[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
            
Here, FCA served unverified responses
to Plaintiffs' first set of RFP on January 8, 2024, with FCA’s electronic
verifications following on January 19, 2024. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 4.) The service of
verification establishes the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel
further as March 6, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day period with an extension
of two court days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision
(a)(3), accounting for the method of electronic service.
 
Therefore, the Court finds the Motion is
filed timely as it was filed prior to the established deadline.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall
state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (Lopez Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, and 9, Ex. “C.”)
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories.” “A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs have fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to SROG Nos. 45-48
 
“As a general matter, the statutory
scheme imposes no obligation on a party propounding interrogatories to
establish good cause or prove up the merits of any underlying claims.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550.) Indeed, a litigant “is
entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a matter of right, and
without a prior showing, unless the party on whom those interrogatories are
served objects and shows cause why the questions are not within the purview of
the code section.” (Id. at p. 541, citing West Pico Furniture Co. v.
Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422.)
 
Accordingly, the Court will proceed to
examine whether FCA’s objections have satisfied its burden to show cause when
considered in light of the arguments presented by Plaintiffs.
 
1)     
The Interrogatories at Issue – SROG Nos. 45-48
 
Plaintiffs move to compel FCA to provide
supplemental responses to SROG, Nos. 45-48.
 
SROG No. 45 seeks, “At the time of
release for the 2020 Jeep GLADIATOR vehicles, state your anticipated range for
repairs per thousand vehicles sold (R/1000).”
 
SROG No. 46 requests, “State the repairs
per thousand vehicles sold (R/1000) for 2020 Jeep GLADIATOR vehicles.”
 
SROG No. 47 asks, “Identify in order the
five symptoms with the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2020 Jeep
GLADIATOR vehicles, and the corresponding repairs per thousand.”
 
SORG No. 48 requests, “Identify in order
the five components with the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2020
Jeep GLADIATOR vehicles, and the corresponding repairs per thousand.”
 
2)     
FCA’s Objections to SROG Nos. 45 - 48
 
FCA objects to SROG Nos. 45 - 48 on the
basis of irrelevance, stating that “this interrogatory seeks information that
is not relevant to the subject matter of this litigation and is therefore not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (See
generally Lopez Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. “B.”) FCA further objects on the grounds of
overbreadth, arguing that the interrogatories at issue are “not limited to any
claim of defect or nonconformity in this case.” (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs argue that the
interrogatories at issue are relevant because they would “show how many repairs
FCA anticipated with the 2020 Jeep GLADIATOR vehicles and to what degree the
repairs exceeded those expectations. When combined with information showing the
top five components and symptoms at issue – and assuming that they are the
same as the problems experienced by Plaintiffs – Plaintiffs could show that
FCA had knowledge about a widespread defect or nonconformity and failed to
act despite this knowledge.” (Mot. at p. 5.) (Italics in original,
underlines added.)    
 
Plaintiffs maintain that these
interrogatories are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. (Mot. at p. 5.) To support their argument, Plaintiffs
assert that “the use of ‘other vehicle’ evidence at trial ‘certainly was
probative and not prejudicial,’” citing Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154 (Donlen).
 
Established case law supports that the
relevance of a manufacturer’s knowledge and inaction should be directly
connected to the defects as specifically alleged in the case. In Jensen v.
BMW of North America, LLC (S.D. Cal. 2019) 328 F.R.D. 557 (Jensen),
the federal district judge in San Diego ordered a defendant to search specific
databases for other customers’ complaints, but limited the scope to “vehicles
of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiff's subject vehicle and limited
to only those records reporting problems with the same defect codes listed in
any repair records pertaining to Plaintiff's vehicle and part numbers under
warranty in Plaintiff's vehicle, and to produce those documents.” (Jensen,
supra, at p. 564.) (Underlines added.) The Jensen court reasoned
that “information regarding whether the same defects were reported to
BMW in other cars of the same make, model, and year as Plaintiff’s subject
vehicle could conceivably be relevant to whether BMW acted reasonably in
denying Plaintiff’s warranty claim. A fact finder may find BMW’s knowledge or
lack of knowledge about the same defects to be a consideration in deciding
whether BMW acted in good faith as to Plaintiff’s specific case.” (Id.
at pp. 562-563.) (Underlines added.)
 
Additionally, upon careful review of the
Donlen ruling, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ SROG Nos. 45 - 48 exceed
the scope of the evidence upheld by the Donlen court. Donlen held
that the trial court had not erred in denying Ford’s motion in limine to
exclude evidence of other customers’ complaints about the same transmission
model Ford installed in plaintiff's truck and other vehicles. (Donlen,
supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at p. 154.) (Underlines added.) However, this is
not what SROG Nos. 45-48 actually seek. These interrogatories ask to “identify
in order the five symptoms,” and “identify in order the five components,” “with
the highest repairs per thousand for 2020 Jeep GLADIATOR vehicles” (SROG Nos.
46 - 48). These interrogatories broadly seek data without narrowing the scope
to the same or similar nature of reported defects by Plaintiffs.
 
Furthermore, SROG No. 45 requests
information on “[FCA’s] anticipated range for repairs per thousand vehicles
sold,” which involves the constellation of any possible repairs. Those repairs
are also not limited to California but include other states as well. 
 
As the Motion acknowledges, the
relevance of requested information hinges on the assumption that “they [the top
five repairs or repaired components] are the same problems experienced by
Plaintiffs.” (Mot. at p. 5.) This extended scope is not supported by the
established precedent, including those set in the Donlen case which
Plaintiffs rely upon. 
 
Accordingly, in alignment with
established precedent, the Court concludes that information sought by
Plaintiffs’ SROG, Nos. 45-48, is irrelevant and overbroad, thereby sustaining
FCA’s objections on these grounds.
 
3)     
FCA’s Supplemental Responses to SROG Nos. 45-48
 
Moreover, FCA’s counsel attests that on
July 10, 2024, FCA served Plaintiffs with verifications for its supplemental
responses to the interrogatories addressed in the Motion. (Grimsrud Decl. ¶ 5.)
These supplemental responses state, “FCA states that it does not track R/1000
data. To the extent Plaintiffs seeks failure rate data, FCA US will conduct a
diligent search and reasonably inquiry and produce, subject to protective
order, all responsive documents found related to warranty claims and failure
rates data (c/1000 and MOP/MIS), for the same make, year, and model of the
Subject Vehicle.” (Ibid, Ex. “2.”)
 
Given the Court has previously sustained
FCA’s objections on the grounds of relevance and overbreadth – as the
interrogatories at issue are not limited to any claim of defect or
nonconformity in this case – the Court determines that FCA’s supplemental
responses are sufficient.
 
Based on the above, the Court DENIES the
Motion.
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
As the Court has denied the Motion, the request for
monetary sanctions, reserved for a prevailing party under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), is also DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 45-48, is DENIED.
 
Plaintiffs’ Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
