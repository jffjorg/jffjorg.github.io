Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the plaintiffs. The motion sought to compel FCA to produce supplemental responses to special interrogatories Nos. 45-48, which seek information on FCA's anticipated range for repairs per thousand vehicles sold, as well as the top five symptoms and components with the highest repairs per thousand for 2020 Jeep Gladiator vehicles.

The judge found that the interrogatories were irrelevant and overbroad, and that FCA's objections were sustained on these grounds. The judge also found that FCA's supplemental responses were sufficient, as they stated that FCA does not track R/1000 data and will conduct a diligent search and reasonably inquiry to produce any responsive documents found related to warranty claims and failure rates data.

The judge denied the motion to compel further responses and the request for monetary sanctions, as the moving party did not establish good cause for the relief sought.
