I.              
BACKGROUND 
This personal
injury case arises out of a pedestrian/motor vehicle accident that allegedly
took place between Plaintiff Diane Williams (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants Salma
Halloumi (“Salma”) and Mohamed Halloumi (collectively, “Defendants”) on April
6, 2023. 
Salma now
seeks to compel Plaintiff’s responses to her request for production of documents (“RFPs”), her
form and special interrogatories (“FROGS” and “SROGS”, respectively), and also
requests an order deeming the truth of the matters admitted in her requests for
admissions (“RFAs”).
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On December
8, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint, alleging negligence. 
On April 8,
2024, Defendants filed their Answer. 
On May 17,
2024, Plaintiff substituted her attorney to represent herself. 
On July 18,
2024, Salma filed her Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to her RFPs
(“Motion RFPs”). 
On July 18,
2024, Salma filed her Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to her FROGS
(“Motion FROGS”). 
On July 18,
2024, Salma filed her Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to her SROGS
(“Motion SROGS”). 
On July 18,
2024, Salma filed her Motion to have the Truth of the Matters Specified in her
RFAs Be Deemed Admitted (“Motion RFAs”). 
On September
30, 2024, Salma filed her Notices of Plaintiff’s Non-Opposition. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Requests for Production
 A party upon whom a demand for the production
of documents has been made has 30 days after service of the demand to respond.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)[1] The
propounding and responding parties may agree to extend the time for response. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.270(a).) When a party fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a motion to compel
response. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) A responding party that
does not provide responses waives the right to object to the demand, including
objections based on privilege or work product. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(a).) 
B.            
Interrogatories 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to
compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)    
C.            
Requests for Admission
“Any party may obtain discovery . . .
by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.010.) “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the
party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared…” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The
requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as
well as for monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The
court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made
serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)    
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Four motions
are presently before the Court. The ruling will address Salma’s Motion RFPs,
then her Motion FROGS, then her Motion SROGS, and, finally, her Motion RFAs. 
A.            
Salma’s Motion RFPs is Granted.
Salma’s
counsel declares Salma served written discovery on Plaintiff on April 10, 2024,
and granted Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff—after Plaintiff had substituted
her attorney for herself—multiple extensions to serve responses by July 12,
2024. (See Declaration of Elnoz Faiazi filed July 18, 2024 (“Faiazi
Decl.”), ¶¶ 5-15, Exs. A-H.) Despite the extensions, Salma’s counsel further
declares Plaintiff has not served any responses to date. (See Faiazi
Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Plaintiff did
not oppose. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Salma’s Motion RFPs and finds Salma is entitled to an order compelling
Plaintiff’s responses to her RFPs. Plaintiff is ordered to provide code-compliant
responses without objection on or before October 31, 2024.
B.            
Salma’s Motion FROGS is Granted.
Salma’s
counsel declares Salma served written discovery on Plaintiff on April 10, 2024,
and granted Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff—after Plaintiff had substituted
her attorney for herself—multiple extensions to serve responses by July 12,
2024. (See Faiazi Decl., ¶¶ 5-15, Exs. A-H.) Despite the extensions,
Salma’s counsel further declares Plaintiff has not served any responses to
date. (See Faiazi Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Plaintiff did
not oppose. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Salma’s Motion FROGS and finds Salma is entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiff’s responses to her FROGS. Plaintiff is ordered to provide
code-compliant responses without objection on or before October 31, 2024.
C.            
Salma’s Motion SROGS is Granted.
Salma’s
counsel declares Salma served written discovery on Plaintiff on April 10, 2024,
and granted Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff—after Plaintiff had substituted
her attorney for herself—multiple extensions to serve responses by July 12,
2024. (See Faiazi Decl., ¶¶ 5-15, Exs. A-H.) Despite the extensions,
Salma’s counsel further declares Plaintiff has not served any responses to
date. (See Faiazi Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Plaintiff did
not oppose. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Salma’s Motion SROGS and finds Salma is entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiff’s responses to her SROGS. Plaintiff is ordered to provide
code-compliant responses without objection on or before October 31, 2024.
D.           
Salma’s Motion RFAs is Granted.
Salma’s
counsel declares Salma served written discovery on Plaintiff on April 10, 2024,
and granted Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff—after Plaintiff had substituted
her attorney for herself—multiple extensions to serve responses by July 12,
2024. (See Faiazi Decl., ¶¶ 5-15, Exs. A-H.) Despite the extensions,
Salma’s counsel further declares Plaintiff has not served any responses to
date. (See Faiazi Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Plaintiff did
not oppose. 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Salma’s Motion RFAs and finds Salma is entitled to an order deeming
admitted the truth of the matters specified in her RFAs.  
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Salma’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to
her RFPs, her Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to her FROGS, her Motion
to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to her SROGS, and her Motion to have the Truth
of the Matters Specified in her RFAs Be Deemed Admitted.
Plaintiff is
ordered to serve Salma with code-compliant responses without objections to Salma’s
RFPs, FROGs, and SROGs on or before October 31, 2024.  
In addition,
the Court orders that the truth of the matters specified in Salma’s RFAs be
deemed admitted.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
