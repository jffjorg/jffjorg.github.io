III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
          A.       Demurrer
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code of Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007
(citation omitted); see also Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed
to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally
construed. (See Code of Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See
Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App. 3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (See Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d
868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
          B.      Motion to Strike
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (See id. at § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are
that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been
drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (See id. at § 436.) The grounds
for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of
judicial notice. (See id. at § 437.)
Punitive damages may be recovered upon a proper showing of malice,
fraud, or oppression. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(a).) “Malice” is
defined as conduct intended to cause injury to a person or despicable conduct
carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of
others. (See Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. Cal., Inc. (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) “Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person
to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights. (See
id.) “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of
a material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a person of
property, rights or otherwise cause injury. (See id.) Conclusory
allegations, devoid of any factual assertions, are insufficient to support a
conclusion that parties acted with oppression, fraud or malice. (See Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.) 
To succeed on a motion to strike
punitive damages allegations, it must be said as a matter of law that
the alleged behavior was not so vile, base, or contemptible that it would not
be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people. (See Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228-1229.) The mere allegation
an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive
damages. (See Grieves v.
Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166.) 
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).) 
          Prior to filing the instant demurrer
and motion to strike, Moving Defendants’ counsel initiated meet and confer efforts
with Plaintiff’s counsel via a four page letter dated August 9, 2024. (See Declaration
of Kym Kanenaka (“Kanenaka Decl.”), ¶ 4, Ex. B.) On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel responded via telephone call and refused to dismiss the third cause of
action or strike the claims for punitive damages. (See id., ¶ 5.) The
Court therefore finds the parties have fulfilled their meet and confer
requirements.
V.       ANALYSIS  
Moving Defendants
demurrer to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for gross negligence or reckless
misconduct. Moving Defendants also move to strike punitive damages from
Plaintiff’s complaint. 
Ultimately,
the Court will sustain the Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action
with leave to amend. The motion to strike will be denied as moot.
A.            
Summary of Allegations in the Complaint
Plaintiff
alleges that on or about April 2, 2023, while operating his 2018 Mercedes Benz
E-Class vehicle on Topanga Canyon Blvd. in Los Angeles, the Manzanero’s vehicle
collided with Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing multiple bodily injuries and
property damage. (Complaint ¶¶8-15).
Plaintiff
alleges that at the time of the incident, Defendants were operating Manzanero’s
vehicle as a commercial hire, transporting a passenger. Furthermore, Plaintiff
alleges that Manzanero operated his vehicle “at an unsafe speed far in excess
of posted speed limits…” and “acting in a knowingly unsafe, reckless and
dangerous manner.” (Id. at ¶23). 
In
addition to seeking general and special damages, Plaintiff is also seeking
punitive damages in connection to his third cause of action for gross
negligence or reckless misconduct. (See id. at p.7). 
B.            
Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action For Gross Negligence
Is Improperly Pled.
Defendants
Uber and Rasier contend the Court should sustain their demurrer as to
Plaintiff’s third cause of action for gross negligence or reckless misconduct because
“there is no separate cause of action for gross negligence that is separate and
apart from ordinary negligence ‘independent of statutory basis’.” (Demurrer, p.
4). Furthermore, they claim Plaintiff’s third cause of action is “a conclusory
allegation” lacking factual support for the contention that Defendants acted
with gross negligence. (Id.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff first contends California law permits maintaining a separate
cause of action for gross negligence, citing Weber v. Pinyan (1937) 9
Cal.2d 226, 231. Furthermore, Plaintiff contends it has adequately pleaded gross
negligence.
Generally,
in addition to alleging the traditional elements of negligence, gross
negligence also requires plaintiffs to allege “‘an extreme departure from the
ordinary standard of conduct’” or “‘want of even scant care’.” (Chavez v. 24
Hour Fitness USA, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 632, 640; see also
City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 747,
754.) As Moving Defendants explain in their Reply, California generally “does
not recognize a distinct cause of action for ‘gross negligence’ independent of
a statutory basis.” (Saenz v. Whitewater Voyages (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 758,
766.) 
Here,
Plaintiff alleges Defendants – ostensibly via Manzanero – acted in a “knowingly
unsafe, reckless and dangerous manner.” (Complaint, ¶ 23). However, Plaintiff
failed to provide either a statutory basis or a factual basis upon which a fact
finder could conclude Defendants’ conduct represented an extreme departure from
what a reasonably careful person would do in the same situation. 
As a
result of these shortcomings, the Court SUSTAINS the Moving Defendants’ Demurrer
as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for gross negligence WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND.
C.            
The Court Denies Moving Defendants’ Motion To
Strike As Moot.
Having
sustained Moving Defendants’ demurrer as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action
for gross negligence, their motion to strike is DENIED as moot because it focuses
on Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages arising out of that very same cause
of action. 
VI.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing analysis, the Court SUSTAINS the Court SUSTAINS the Moving
Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for gross
negligence WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
          Plaintiff
has until November 1, 2024, to amend his Complaint. 
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 9, 2024
