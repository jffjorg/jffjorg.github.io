BACKGROUND
On May 10, 2021, Plaintiff SP Investment
Fund I, LLC filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Fred
Levinson for (1) breach of contract, (2) conversion, and (3) deceit.
Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about June
7, 2013, SP and Levinson entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the
Agreement) pursuant to which Levinson agreed to sell to SP for the sum of
$55,000.00 and SP agreed to buy from Levinson for that sum a 12% limited
partnership interest (the Partnership Interest) in Colonial Oaks Limited
Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the Partnership). ...(a)
[D]efendants failed and refused to promptly deliver and communicate Documents
to SP at SP’s place of business in Los Angeles, California; (b) defendants
failed and refused to take actions and execute instruments reasonably requested
by SP to obtain or render unnecessary the Necessary Approvals or to effectuate
performance of Levinson's obligations under the Agreement to receive and
deliver to SP Distributions received in respect of the Partnership Irterest;
(c) defendants failed and refused to turn over to SP at SP’s place of business
in Los Angeles, California, any Distributions that defendants received in
respect of the Partnership Interest; (d) defendants failed to refrain, except
with the express written consent of SP and for SP’s benefit, from selling,
assigning, transferring, hypothecating, pledging or otherwise disposing of or
encumbering al or any part of the Partnership Interest and failed to refrain
from taking or suffering or permitting any action which otherwise conflicts
with or might impair Levinson’s ability to perform Levinson’s obligations or
impair SP’s ability to exercise SP’s rights under the Agreement.”
On August 10, 2021, the Court sustained a
demurrer, without leave to amend, as to Plaintiff’s claim for fraud/deceit. 
On June 29, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. 
On August 24, 2023, Defendant filed the
instant motion for attorney’s fees.
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
opposition.
On October 5, 2023, Defendant filed a
reply. 
DISCUSSION
            The parties do not dispute that
Defendant is the prevailing party for purposes of this motion. Defendant moves
for attorney’s fees in the amount of $282,040.50 and costs in the amount of
$13,378.54. Plaintiff argues that Defendants award should be reduced on the
grounds that (1) Defendant failed to file a memorandum of costs and therefore
waived its right to recover prejudgment costs; and (2) Defendant’s fees were
unnecessary, unreasonable, and duplicative, such that the requested attorney’s
fees should be reduced by at least $54,560.24. 
            Right to Recover Costs
            Civil Code section 1717, subdivision
(a), provides in relevant part as follows: “In any action on a contract, where
the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs. [¶] ... [¶] Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed
by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.” (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1090.) 
In
Kaufman v. Diskeeper Corp., the court held that “a party seeking fees
incurred before judgment under Civil Code section 1717 need not file a
memorandum of costs regarding the fees, in addition to filing a fee motion in
compliance with rule 3.1702.” (Kaufman v. Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 1, 11.) The court summarized the following rules regarding
prejudgment costs and attorney’s fees:
Rule 3.1700 is entitled “Prejudgment costs.”
Rule 3.1700(a)(1), which addresses “[t]rial costs,” states that “[a] prevailing
party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs” within 15
days after notice of entry of judgment, or within 180 days after entry of
judgment, whichever is first. Rule 3.1700(b) establishes a procedure for
contesting costs by means of a motion to tax costs. Absent special
circumstances, that motion must be served and filed 15 days after the service
of the memorandum of costs. (Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)
 
Rule 3.1702 is entitled “Claiming attorney’s fees.”
Rule 3.1702(a), entitled “Application,” states: “Except as otherwise provided
by statute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney’s
fees and claims for attorney’s fees provided for in a contract. Subdivisions
(b) and (c) apply when the court determines entitlement to the fees, the amount
of the fees, or both, whether the court makes that determination because the
statute or contract refers to ‘reasonable’ fees, because it requires a
determination of the prevailing party, or for other reasons.”
 
Subdivisions (b) and (c) of rule 3.1702 specify
deadlines for filing motions to claim attorney fees incurred in trial court
proceedings and on appeal. The former, entitled “Attorney’s fees before
trial court judgment,” is applicable here. It states: “A notice of motion
to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition of
judgment in the trial court ... must be served and filed within the time for
filing a notice of appeal....” In an unlimited civil action such as the case
before us, that deadline ordinarily falls 60 days after notice of entry of
judgment, or 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 8.104.)
 
Neither subdivision (b) nor subdivision (c) of rule
3.1702 mentions a memorandum of costs. The sole express reference to a
memorandum of costs in rule 3.1702 appears in subdivision (e), addressing “Attorney’s
fees fixed by formula”: “If a party is entitled to statutory or contractual
attorney's fees that are fixed without the necessity of a court determination,
the fees must be claimed in the memorandum of costs.”
 
(Kaufman, supra, 229 Cal.App.4th at
7-8.) The court analyzed as follows:
 
In our view, rule 3.1700 is inapplicable to Diskeeper’s
request for attorney fees under Civil Code 1717, and rule 3.1702 imposes no
requirement that a memorandum of costs be filed. By its plain language, rule
3.1702 constitutes the sole rule governing Diskeeper's request: “Except as
otherwise provided by statute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims
for ... attorney’s fees provided for in a contract.” (Rule 3.1702(a), italics
added.) As noted above (see pt. B, ante ), no statute governing fee
requests under Civil Code section 1717 mandates the filing of a memorandum of
costs. Under rule 3.1702, a memorandum of costs is required only when a fee
motion is not required, that is, when “contractual attorney's fees ...
are fixed without the necessity of a court determination....” (Rule 3.1702(e).)
To read rule 3.1700 as the governing rule, as respondents suggest, would be to
construe the directive of rule 3.1702(a) that “this rule applies,” to mean
“another rule (viz., 3.1700) applies.” We decline to ignore the unambiguous
directive of rule 3.1702.
 
Other considerations support our conclusion.
Generally, in construing a court rule, we seek “ ‘a reasonable and commonsense
interpretation consistent with its apparent purpose, practical rather than
technical in nature, which upon application will result in wise policy rather
than mischief or absurdity.’ ” (Crespin, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th
at p. 265, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 696, quoting Lammers v. Superior Court (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1321, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 455.) Here, rules 3.1700 and 3.1702
establish distinct procedures for asserting and contesting claims within their
scope: whereas the former rule imposes relatively brief periods for the filing
of a memorandum of costs and motion to tax costs, the latter rule affords a
much longer period for the filing of a motion for attorney fees in unlimited
civil actions. Thus, if a request for attorney fees under Civil Code section
1717 were subject to both rules, the party making the request would be obliged
to trigger two duplicative but temporally divergent procedures. Because that
interpretation invites “ ‘mischief or absurdity,’ ” we reject it. (Crespin,
supra, at p. 265, 22 Cal.Rptr.3d 696.)
 
Our conclusion finds additional support from the
optional forms the Judicial Council has approved for use in conjunction with
rule 3.1700, namely Judicial Council form MC-010 (entitled “Memorandum of Costs
(Summary)”) and Judicial Council form MC-011 (entitled “Memorandum of Costs
(Worksheet)”).5 Each provides a blank space for the amount of
attorney fees sought, and states: “[E]nter here if contractual or
statutory fees are fixed without necessity of a court determination; otherwise
a noticed motion is required.” (Italics omitted.) Thus, when a party seeks
attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717 that must be fixed by the trial
court, the forms effectively advise the party that (a) a figure is not to be
entered in the blank space, and (b) doing so will not secure the
requested fees, as a noticed motion is required. We decline to infer that the
Judicial Council would direct a party seeking contractual attorney fees to
engage in an act neither statutorily required nor procedurally sufficient to
secure such fees.
We recognize that rule 3.1702, as construed above, may
appear to be inconsistent with the general directive in rule 3.1700(a) that
“[a] prevailing party who claims costs must ... file a memorandum of costs...,”
in view of Civil Code section 1717, subdivision (a), which characterizes fees
awarded under that provision as “an element of the costs of suit.” However, in
such circumstances, the maxims of interpretation dictate that the particular or
specific rule takes precedence over the general rule. (Conservatorship of
Moore (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 718, 731, 229 Cal.Rptr. 875 [“[I]t is a
fundamental principle of statutory construction that in interpreting an
interrelated statutory scheme, a specific provision controls a more general
one.”]; Code. Civ. Proc., § 1859 [“[W]hen a general and [a] particular
provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former.”]; Civ.Code,
§ 3534 [“Particular expressions qualify those which are general.”].) As noted,
rule 3.1700 bears the generic title “Prejudgment costs,” while rule
3.1702 bears the specific title “Claiming attorney's fees.” Our Supreme
Court has explained that “[W]he[n] the same subject matter is covered by
inconsistent provisions, one of which is special and the other general, the
special one, whether or not enacted first, is an exception to the general
statute and controls unless an intent to the contrary clearly appears.” (Warne
v. Harkness (1963) 60 Cal.2d 579, 588, 35 Cal.Rptr. 601, 387 P.2d 377.) No
such contrary intent is manifested here.
Respondents' reliance on Hydratec, Inc. v. Sun
Valley 260 Orchard & Vineyard Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 924, 272
Cal.Rptr. 899, Russell v. Trans Pacific Group (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1717, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 274, Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422,
111 Cal.Rptr.2d 837, Bankes v. Lucas (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 365, 11
Cal.Rptr.2d 723, and Nazemi v. Tseng (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1633, 7
Cal.Rptr.2d 762 is misplaced. In each of those cases, the party seeking
attorney fees failed to file a timely fee motion. In contrast,
Diskeeper filed its fee motion within the time limits specified in rule 3.1702.
 
(Kaufman, supra, 229
Cal.App.4th at 8-10.)
            Under Kaufman, the
Court finds that Defendant is entitled to an award of costs pursuant to Civil
Code section 1717 which allows a party to recover contractually authorized
attorney’s fees and costs. Further, the Court finds that rule 3.1700 is
inapplicable and that Defendant properly complied with rule 3.1702 in
requesting costs in conjunction with its motion for attorney’s fees, and that
it did not file a separate memorandum of costs. 
            Attorney’s Fees and Costs
            The lodestar figure is premised on 562
attorney hours at hourly rates and hours billed as follows: (1) Gabriel G.
Green — $550 at 285 hours, (2) Gordon C. Stuart — $425 and $495 at 54 hours, (3)
Weiss Hamid —$400 at 150.2 hours, (4) Lauren Jacobs — $400 at 15.4 hours, (5) Michael
Fuoroli — $400 at 24.7 hours, Jonathan Umanzor — $185 at 15.6 hours, Shir
Davidovicz — $400 at 7.9 hours, Robert C. Little — $735 at 13 hours, Pokuaa M.
Enin — $400 at 16.8 hours. Defendant also claims 20.5 billable staff hours at hourly
rates of Flor Velazquez — $95 and Patrick Smith — $65. Finally, Defendant anticipates
17.3 hours in preparing the instant motion, claiming $19,410 in additional fees
and $75.85 in costs for the preparation of the instant motion with an additional
$4,750 in preparing a reply. (Green Decl. ¶ 16.) However, Defendant’s counsel
does not provide a further breakdown, specifically by failing to disclose the
hourly rates with respect to this motion. Defendant’s counsel also provides
another declaration which claims that the Levinson Estate incurred an
additional $7,685 in attorney fees in August 2023 and that the August 2023 bill
will not be issued until the end of the month. and have totaled the available
billing entries. (Enin Decl. ¶ 5.) Counsel states as follows: “Buchalter
attorneys anticipate we will spend an additional 10 number of hours reviewing
any opposition, preparing a reply to this motion, and handling the hearing.
Buchalter will submit a supplemental declaration updating the additional fees
incurred in connection with this motion.” (Id. ¶ 6.) However, no
supplemental declaration has been provided. 

            As for the work billed, Defendant
summarizes the invoices as follows:
·      Reviewing,
analyzing and responding to the initial complaint, drafting and responding to
initial rounds of discovery (including the review of responsive documents),
drafting discovery related motions appearing at the initial scheduling related hearings,
and engaging in meet and confer efforts prior to filing the demurrer; which
collectively took approximately 99 hours;
·      Preparing
and defending the first demurrer, which collectively took approximately 36
hours;
·      Reviewing,
analyzing, and responding to the First Amended Complaint, which included
meeting and conferring and then preparing and defending the second demurrer;
which collectively took approximately 39 hours;
·      Drafting
and responding to additional discovery, including drafting discovery related
motions, which collectively took approximately 109 hours;
·      Answering
the First Amended Complaint as to the remaining cause of action, which collectively
took approximately 4.4 hours; and
·      Drafting
the Motion for Summary Judgment, reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition papers,
preparing a reply in support of the motion, and preparing for and appearing at
the hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, which took approximately 122.1
hours.
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s requested fees are unreasonable because there was a
substantial amount of duplicative work done in this case as Defendant’s motion shows
eight separate attorneys worked on this matter. Specifically, Plaintiff cites
to Defendant’s motion (or motions) for summary judgment where Defendant claims
to have spent 122.1 hours — or over three full weeks — in connection with this
motion. Plaintiff argues that Defendants actually drafted two Motions for Summary
Judgment in this case, one in 2021 and another in 2023. Plaintiff points to
billing events on August 10 and September 24, 2021, where Defendant’s counsel
billed at least 36.7 hours and incurred at least $18,850.50 in fees to draft a
summary judgment motion. Most of this work was performed by attorney Weiss
Hamid. Then, in 2023, Defendant’s counsel billed more in fees to prepare a
second Motion for Summary Judgment. This work was done largely by attorneys
Gabriel Green, Gordon Stuart, and Michael Fuoroli. Plaintiff states that Defendant
offers no explanation for this duplication of work nor should it be permitted
to do so for the first time on reply. Plaintiff proposes that the Court should
allow for the fees billed in connection one of these summary judgment motions,
but not both. Given that the motion filed in 2023 was successful, Plaintiff
states that the Court should decline to award the additional $18,850.50 in fees
billed in 2021 in connection with the first motion. After excluding the
above-referenced duplicative fees, Plaintiff requests the Court reduce all amounts
billed by counsel by ten percent, or by $27,087.50, to account for the frequent
turnover and resulting duplicative work in this case. In total, Plaintiff
requests the Court reduce Defendant’s fee award by $45,930 due to repeated
changes in counsel and duplicative work. Plaintiff also requests the Court
disallow approximately $8,630.24 in fees incurred between December 2021 and
July 2022 on the grounds that the billing contains extensive redactions, which
indicate that certain work was not done in connection with this case. Plaintiff
surmises that Mr. Green was communicating with and doing research for Mr. Levinson’s
trusts and estates attorney Heidi Clerc during this time, and that these fees
were not incurred in connection with this litigation. 
In
reply, Defendant argues that there is no basis to support Plaintiff’s request
that the Court only allow for the fees billed in connection 2023 drafting of a
motion for summary judgment. Defendant points out that Plaintiff cites to no
authority for this argument, and that the time spent for the drafting of
multiple versions of the motion for summary judgment was not duplicative nor
wasted time. Rather, Defendant states that the drafting of the motion for
summary judgment continued over a period of time as more facts evolved through
discovery, which refined and required revisions to the motion, which ultimately
led to a successful motion that resolved the entire case in the Levinson
Estate’s favor.
Defendant
also argues that Plaintiff’s complaints about the redactions to the
invoices should be disregarded since it is the billing practice of Buchalter
attorneys to provide significant detail and descriptions in each billing entry
to provide their client, the Levinson Estate, with a clear understanding of all
of the work that was being done. Defendant claims that much of that additional
narrative included in the billing entries for the client’s benefit reflects
confidential attorney work product in addition to being protected
communications under the attorney-client privilege. Defendant explains that the
redactions that were made were limited to only the portions of the narratives
that were protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the attorney work
product doctrine.
The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s argument regarding a reduction for the time spent
in drafting the motion for summary judgment to be meritless. Defendant was
ultimately successful in that motion. Furthermore, he explains that the time
spent reflects drafting multiple versions as more facts evolved through
discovery. The Court finds that to be a sufficient explanation for why there
were two periods of working on the motion, even though the motion in 2021 was
not held. 
As
for the redactions, the Court is not persuaded by Plaintiff’s arguments.
Although they are redacted, they still contain descriptions for the hours
billed and allow the Court and Plaintiff to sufficiently evaluate the
reasonableness of the items billed. The Court finds that the redactions are
likely appropriate so as to not implicate attorney-client privilege. 
The
Court has reviewed the billing records and will make the following deductions:
(a) Gabriel G. Green’s hourly rate is reduced from $550 to $500; (b) Gordon C.
Stuart’s hourly rate is reduced from $425 and $495 to $400; (c) Robert C.
Little’s hourly rate is reduced from $735 to $500; and (d) the total lodestar
is reduced by 20% for excessive, duplicative and unreasonable hours. The Court
also combines the hourly rate of Flor Velazquez and Patrick Smith to $80 for
purposes of fee calculation since Defendant did not provide a breakdown of
these individuals’ hours, but rather claimed a total of 20.5 billable staff
hours. Further, the Court declines to award attorney fees in connection with
this motion as Defendant fails to provide sufficient evidence to support them. The
final lodestar number of hours is calculated to be 482.48 hours. The total fee
is reduced to $211,344. The Court provides the following as a breakdown
adjusting for the reductions:

With
respect to costs, the Court makes the following deductions:
·      4/30/23
Invoice: $252.45 for messenger services reduced to $45.00
·      6/30/23
Invoice: $78.00 for travel expenses. Since Defendant fails to provide a further
breakdown of these expenses, the Court in its discretion declines to award them
in full.
·      7/31/23
Invoice: $80.00 for travel expenses (all day parking validations). Since
Defendant fails to provide a further breakdown of these expenses, the Court in
its discretion declines to award them in full.
Thus,
the Court will deduct $365.45 in costs. Apart from arguing that Defendant is
not entitled to any costs, Plaintiff has not provided any further objections to
Defendant’s costs/expenses. 
Request for Judicial Notice
            The Court denies Defendant’s request
for judicial notice in full.
CONCLUSION
            In sum, the Court awards $208,900.80
in attorney’s fees and $13,013.09 in costs. The motion is GRANTED IN PART.
