BACKGROUND
On August 28, 2019, Plaintiffs John
Middleton and The John Powers Middleton Companies, LLC (together “Middleton”)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Roy Lee and RL Films2, Inc. (together “Lee”).
On May 1l, 2020, Middleton filed a Second
Amended Complaint asserting causes of action for fraud by intentional
misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, breach of contract, unfair competition,
unjust enrichment, and accounting.
On January 17, 2023, the Court granted Lee’s
motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint due to delay of prosecution
under Code of Civil Procedure 583.410. The Court granted the motion after
Middleton filed no opposition.
On March 9, 2023, the Court granted
Middleton’s motion to set aside/vacate dismissal of the second complaint
subject to the condition that Plaintiff compensate Defendant for the fees
associated with Plaintiff’s prior failure to prosecute. Lee was ordered to
provide specific, detailed billing records for the fees requested.
On September 19, 2023, Lee filed the
instant motion for attorney’s fees.
On September 29, 2023, Middleton filed an
opposition.
On October 5, 2023, Lee filed a reply and
revised reply. The revised reply is substantively the same save for the
correction of signature and typographical defects. 
DISCUSSION
            Middleton argues that Lee is only
entitled to an award of fees incurred for bringing the motion to dismiss for
failure to prosecute and opposing Plaintiff’s motion to vacate. In reply, Lee
argues that the March 9 Order awarded Defendants all fees associated with
Plaintiff’s prior failure to prosecute. 
            In the March 9, 2023, the Court
found that Lee was entitled to some amount of attorney’s fees in connection
with filing the motion to dismiss for Middleton’s failure to prosecute. The
Court ordered Lee’s counsel to provide proof of the requested fees specifically
pertaining to the motion to dismiss Middleton for failure to prosecute. As
such, the Court finds that Middleton is correct in concluding that Lee is only
entitled to those fees associated with the motion to dismiss and opposition for
motion to vacate. 
            The lodestar figure here is premised
on 66.5 hours of work at hourly rates of $715 (Ekwan E. Rhow), $500 (Ashley D.
Bowman), and $425 (Christopher J. Lee). Lee claims 18.5 hours of work in
connection with the motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution for a total of
$8,320 in fees, and 16.5 hours of work in connection with the opposition to
motion to set aside dismissal for a total of $8,100.50 in fees. 
            Middleton failed to raise any
further objections as to the amounts requested except that the appropriate
number is $10,000.00. Middleton did not challenge any specific items nor claim
that the total lodestar amount was excessive with an alternative proposal. Accordingly,
the Court in its discretion will award $16,420.50 in attorney fees in favor of
Lee. 
CONCLUSION
            In sum, the Court awards $16,420.50 in
attorney’s fees.
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART. 
Moving Party to give notice.
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
