The case involves a dispute over attorney fees incurred by Lee in connection with a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute and an opposition to Middleton's motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal. The Court has granted Lee's motion for attorney fees in part, awarding $16,420.50 in fees. The Court found that Lee is only entitled to fees associated with the motion to dismiss and opposition for motion to vacate, and rejected Middleton's objections to the amount of fees claimed by Lee.
