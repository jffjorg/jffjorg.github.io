And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The motion to compel arbitration is continued. The parties dispute the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, specifically whether it is valid under California law and whether it is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The Court finds that the FAA governs the parties' agreement and that the arbitration agreement does not require the plaintiff to waive any right, forum, or procedure for the alleged Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and Labor Code violations. The Court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not substantively unconscionable. However, the Court continues the motion to compel arbitration to determine whether the agreement is enforceable, specifically on whether there was an existence to arbitrate.
