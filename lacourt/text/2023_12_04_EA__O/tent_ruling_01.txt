  Case Number:  22PSCV02903    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Defendants U.S. Bank, N.A., As Trustee for Structured
Asset Investment Loan Trust Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2006-2,
PHH Mortgage Corporation (sued in its own right and as a successor to Ocwen
Loan Servicing, LLC), NewRez, LLC, and Western Progressive LLC (together, the
“Defendants”) DEMURRER to Plaintiff’s SAC is SUSTAINED in part (i.e., as to the
2nd-4th COAs) and OVERRULED in part (i.e., as to 1st
and 5th COAs). Leave to amend is DENIED as Plaintiff has
had ample opportunity to amend the complaint(s). 
 
Background
 
This case pertains to a foreclosure. Plaintiff Jerome Kern
alleges that Defendants “repeatedly mishandled Plaintiff’s mortgage. For
approximately two and a half years, Defendant Ocwen attempted to collect
thousands of dollars in unlawful fees that supposedly accrued when Plaintiff
did not even own or occupy the property.” (SAC p. 2.) And when Plaintiff was
approved for a trial modification plan, Defendant PHH later deemed Plaintiff
ineligible for mortgage modification. (Ibid.) 
On December 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit against
Defendants asserting causes of action for: 1.    
Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.17 2.    
Negligent Misrepresentation 3.    
Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.7 4.    
Violation of Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act 5.    
Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.
 
On June 12, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
with leave to amend.
 
On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
(FAC).
 
On August 10, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
to the FAC with leave to amend.
 
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed its SAC against
Defendants Ocwen, PHH, and Newrez for the same 5 COAs. 
 
On October 11, 2023, Defendants filed the instant demurrer
to the SAC.
 
On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition. 
 
On November 22, 2023, Defendants filed their Reply.
 
Discussion
 
Defendants again demur to each cause of action. 
 
1.    
Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.17 of the
Homeowner’s Bill of Rights (HBOR)
 
Pursuant to California Civil Code §2924.17 (a), “a
declaration or affidavit filed in any court relative to a foreclosure
proceeding shall be accurate and complete and supported by competent and
reliable evidence.” Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.17(a). Pursuant to subdivision (b):
“Before recording or filing any of the documents described in subdivision (a),
a mortgage servicer shall ensure that it has reviewed competent and reliable
evidence to substantiate the borrower's default and the right to foreclose,
including the borrower's loan status and loan information.” Cal. Civ. Code §
2924.17(b).
 
Defendants demur on the grounds that the violation of this
statute must be “material” to be actionable. (Demurrer p. 12, citing Civ. Code
§ 2924.12; see also Travis v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (9th Cir. 2018)
733 Fed. Appx. 371, 374.) A violation is material when the alleged violation
affected a plaintiff’s loan obligations or the modification process. (Demurrer
p. 12, citing Johnson v. Nationstar Mortgage (N.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2019)
LLC, 2019 WL 3718592.)[1] 
 
Here, however, Plaintiff has articulated a material violation
(i.e., an injury): the purportedly falsely inflated amount deprived Plaintiff
of the opportunity to reinstate or pay off the loan. (SAC ¶52.) In fact,
Defendants’ citation to Johnson v. PNC Mortgage (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21,
2014) 2014 WL 6629585, at *9 for the proposition that a sham assignment of a
loan from one lender to another is not a “material” violation of § 2924.17
because such an assignment does not affect the borrower’s payment obligations under
the loan supports Plaintiff’s position as he alleges that it did affect
his payment obligations. 
 
To the extent Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not
allege what he actually believes is owed on the Loan or allege facts suggesting
that Plaintiff had the financial wherewithal to pay off the Loan (Demurrer p.
12), Defendants have not provided authority that more specificity is
required. Thus, Plaintiff’s allegation that the fees included in the
$1,007,932.61 amount expressly violated the terms of the Settlement Agreement
(by including attorney’s fees, litigation costs), interest and fees accrued
during the time that Plaintiff did not have title to the Property, and failed
to account for at least ten payments that Plaintiff made is sufficient for
purposes of a demurrer. 
 
Therefore,
the court OVERRULES the demurrer as to the 1st COA for the HBOR
violation.
 
2.    
Negligent Misrepresentation (v. Newrez and
PHH)
 
The elements for negligent misrepresentation are: (1) a
misrepresentation; (2) made negligently; (3) intent to induce reliance; (4)
actual and justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.
 
The negligent misrepresentation COA is predicated upon two
allegations. (SAC P56.) The first being related to the modification application
and the second relating to terms of the modification agreement. The court will
not discuss whether the allegation that NewRez and PHH misrepresented what
actions Plaintiff’s needed to take to complete his early 2020 Modification
application via the February 25, 2020 letter is sufficient for this COA because
the opposition does not squarely address Defendants’ arguments. 
 
The second allegation comprising this COA pertains to
several conversations Plaintiff had with NewRez and PHH employees relating to
the loan modification but that the terms were “negligently misstated” because
they were not the “actual modification offer.” (SAC ¶¶ 64-68.)[2] 
 
Defendants demur on various grounds, but the strongest
argument is that the claim is unenforceable under the statute of frauds. A
mortgage or deed of trust is subject to the statute of frauds. (Demurrer p. 13,
See Civil Code §2922 (a mortgage can be created, renewed, or extended, only by
writing, executed with the formalities required in the case of a grant of real
property); see also Civil Code §1624(a)(3).) As such, any claim by Plaintiffs
that PHH and NewRez orally promised a permanent modification is unenforceable
as there is no writing signed by Defendants that evidences such an agreement.
To the extent that Plaintiff attemps to recast the breach of oral contract
claim into a claim for fraud, that too fails as Plaintiff all but concedes no
“fraudulent intent” as the purported misrepresentation was negligent, not
intentional. (Demurrer p. 14.)
 
The opposition is silent as to the statute of frauds. 
 
Therefore,
as the court has granted numerous opportunities for leave to amend, the court
SUSTAINS the demurrer as to the 2nd COA WITHOUT leave to amend.

 
3.    
Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.7
 
Under Civil Code § 2923.7(a), “[w]hen a borrower requests a
foreclosure prevention alternative, the mortgage servicer shall promptly
establish a single point of contact [SPOC] and provide to the borrower one or
more direct means of communication with the single point of contact.” A “single
point of contact means an individual or team of personnel.” (Civ. Code § 2923.7
(a).) 
 
Defendant demurs on the grounds that a SPOC was provided. 
 
Here, the court agrees as a Geesun Rodrigues of NewRez was
assigned as the SPOC. (SAC, ¶¶ 29, 35, 37, 39. To the extent that Plaintiff
concedes an SPOC was given but that Plaintiff’s assigned single of contact
failed to fulfill all of its statutory duties (Opp pp. 11-12), Plaintiff does
not provide any authority for the proposition that the seeming failure for the
SPOC to provide “accurate and adequate information about the foreclosure
prevention alternative” (Opp. p. 12:11-12) amounts to a violation of the claim.

 
Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer as to the 3rd
COA without leave to amend because an SPOC was assigned.
 
4.    
Violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act (“RFDCPA”)
 
Section 1788.17 of the RFDCPA mandates that every debt
collector collecting or attempting to collect a consumer debt shall comply with
the provisions of 15 U.S.C. § 1692(b)-(j) and shall be subject to the remedies
dictated by 15 U.S.C. §1692k and §1692d(5). In turn, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act (“FDCPA”) is codified in 15 U.S.C. §1692. The FDCPA provides that
a debt collector may not use false, deceptive, or misleading representations or
means in connection with collection of a debt (15 U.S.C. § 1692e). The false
representation of the character, amount, or legal status of any debt is a
violation of this section. See 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(2).
 
Plaintiff alleges that “Defendants have violated each of
these provisions by attempting to collect an amount of debt that was not owed
and that could not legally be demanded.” (SAC ¶102.) 
 
Defendants demur on 3 grounds: (i) The Claim is Time Barred;
(ii) Plaintiff Fails to Plead a Claim; and (iii) The FDCPA Does Not Apply. 
 
a.    
Whether the Claim is Time Barred
 
A claim under the FDCPA and Rosenthal Act must be brought
“within one year from the date on which the violation occurs.” (15 U.S.C. §
1692k(d); see also Civil Code 1788.30(f).) 
 
Here, the violations alleged are as follows:
 
Defendant PHH and Newrez repeatedly and currently
attempt to collect amounts not owed, including thousands and thousands of
dollars in maintenances fees and other “REO” charges from the two and half year
period when Plaintiff was wrongfully dispossessed of his home,
attorney’s fees and litigation costs precluded by the Settlement Agreement, and
failed to account for at least ten monthly payments that Plaintiff had already
made when they were due to the prior loan servicer. (¶103, emphasis added.)
 
But, and as noted by Defendants in demurrer, Plaintiff was
allegedly dispossessed of his home between November 2012 and March 2015. (SAC
¶¶15-16.) Thus, with a lawsuit filing date of 12/2022, the claim as to the
maintenance fees and other “REO” charges is time barred. As for the attorney
fees and litigation costs, such fees date back to at least November of 2016.
(SAC ¶19.) Lastly, as to the allegation regarding the ten monthly payments,
those too are time barred because such payments were made before the servicing
of Plaintiff’s loan was allegedly transferred back to Ocwen in April of 2012,”
which is ten years before Plaintiff filed his current action. (¶¶ 14-16.)
 
To the extent that in opposition Plaintiff relies upon the
continuing violation doctrine, Plaintiff does not provide instructive
authority. Rather, Plaintiff cites to Jumaane v. City of L.A. (2015) 241
Cal. App. 4th 1390, 1402, 194, but that is an employment law case which bears
no similarity to a mortgage foreclosure. In employment cases, there is
generally an ongoing process harassment; here, harassment is not
at issue. 
 
Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer WITHOUT leave to
amend. 
 
5.    
Unfair Competition – Violation of Business and
Professions Code §§17200 
 
The UCL prohibits: (1) unlawful, (2) fraudulent, and (3)
unfair business practices. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. A “violation of
another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the UCL’s
unlawful prong.” (Demurrer p. 20, quoting Berryman v. Merit Prop. Mgmt., Inc.
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) 
 
A plaintiff can plead a UCL violation under the unlawfulness
prong by pleading that a business practice violated a predicate federal, state,
or local law. (See Opp. p. 14, citing Cel–Tech Commc'ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles
Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 180 [“Its coverage is ‘sweeping, embracing ‘ “anything that can
properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden
by law.’”].) (The Reply does not address this case.) 
 
Here, as Plaintiff’s California Business and Professions
Code § 17200 allegations are “tethered to” all the other claims. (See SAC
¶108.) including Defendants’ alleged violations of Civ. Code § 2924.17. (¶109),
then a UCL violation has been pled. 
 
Therefore,
the court OVERRULES the demurrer as to the 5th COA for UCL. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is SUSTAINED in part
and OVERRULED in part (i.e., 1st and 5th COAs are
overruled; COAs Nos. 2-4 are SUSTAINED). As for leave to amend, the court
denies leave to amend as Plaintiff would be afforded a third opportunity at
leave to amend, but such defects (as raised during meet and confer efforts)
should have been cured prior to Defendants filing a demurrer.
