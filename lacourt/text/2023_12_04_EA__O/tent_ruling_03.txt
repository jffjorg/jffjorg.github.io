Background
 
This is a contracts case. Plaintiff PASADENA FEDERAL CREDIT
UNION, a federally chartered credit union (“Plaintiff” or “PFCU”), alleges the
following against PALOMARES ESCROW, INC. (“Palomares”) and PRIMARY PARTNERS
FINANCIAL (“PPF”): PFCU has had a contract with PPF to originate, process, and
underwrite residential mortgages for PFCU’s members. On August 30, 2022, PPF
represented to PFCU that Palomares would act as the escrow holder for two of
PFCU’s members. That same day, Incoming Domestic Wire Instructions were
provided to PPF from homebrokerp@gmail.com by “a hacker…impersonating
[Palomares escrow officer] through the unverified homebrokerp@gmail.com
account,” an email “different from the typical email correspondence PPF had
received from Palomares.” The false instructions called for the wiring of funds
to a Truist Bank account in Alabama. After suspecting wire fraud and contacting
Truist Bank Truist Bank transferred a certain sum to Plaintiff, but not the
entire amount.
