Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th at 830, 837 [“A
material violation is one that affected the borrower’s loan obligations,
disrupted the borrower’s loan modification process, or otherwise harmed the
borrower.”]; id. at p. 846 [“the HBOR creates no liability for a
technical violation that does not thwart its purposes”].)

Defendant demurs that the claim lacks the requisite specificity. (Demurrer p.
14, citing Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184 [The
elements of negligent misrepresentation, like that of fraud, “must also be pled
with specificity.”].) 
The opposition merely conclusively states that it has pled
specific facts. (Opp. p. 10.) But the 2nd COA does not state what
terms were provided versus what were the actual terms. Therefore, specific
facts have not been provided.
