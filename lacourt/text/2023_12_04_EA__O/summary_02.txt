And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, which challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claim. The defendant argues that the claim lacks the requisite specificity, citing a previous case (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc.) that requires the elements of negligent misrepresentation to be pled with specificity. The plaintiff has responded, stating that they have pled specific facts, but the Judge finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient details to support their claim. The Judge points to a previous case (Billesbach v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC) that distinguishes between material and technical violations of the Homeowners' Bill of Rights, and notes that the HBOR only creates liability for violations that thwart its purposes. The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's claim may be subject to dismissal due to lack of specificity.
