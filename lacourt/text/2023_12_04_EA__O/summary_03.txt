And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Palomares Escrow, Inc. The ruling states that these motions are moot due to the filing of a first amended complaint (FAC) by the plaintiff, Pasadena Federal Credit Union. The FAC serves as the operative pleading and renders the original demurrer and motion to strike ineffective. In other words, the court will not consider the original complaint anymore, and the case will move forward with the FAC as the basis for the lawsuit.
