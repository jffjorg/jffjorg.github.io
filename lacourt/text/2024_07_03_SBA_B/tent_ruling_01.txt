BACKGROUND
            On October 25, 2021, plaintiff
Armando Santiago filed a complaint against Command Security Systems, Inc.,
Arjun Singh Gill, Balbir Singh Gill, and Gautam Kumar for Labor Code
violations, violation of Bus. and Prof. Code, and PAGA.  Plaintiff alleges that he worked for
defendants from June 10, 2010 through March 31, 2021, as a Trailer Guard and
sometimes as an Armed Guard.
            On November 12, 2021, plaintiff
filed amendments to the complaint designating Deterrence Security System,
Amarjeet Singh Gill, and Parminder K. Gill as Does 1, 2, and 3.
            On March 7, 2023, plaintiff filed
amendments adding Steven Inouye, United Building Company, and David Rivera as
defendants.
            On July 26, 2023, defendants United
Building Company and David Rivera filed a cross-complaint against LA’s Best
Security, Inc, Deterrence Security System, and Arjun Singh Gill.
            On November 14, 2023, the court
granted United Building Company’s motion to compel further responses to request
for production of documents against plaintiff.
            On December 18, 2023, plaintiff
filed a request for dismissal as to defendant David Rivera.
            On March 8, 2024, the court granted
plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to request for production of
documents against defendant UBC as to Nos. 4-8 and denied it as to Nos. 1-3 and
9.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP §
1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Request for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to an
inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply:  (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  CCP §
2031.310(a).
A statement of compliance shall
state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will be
allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.  CCP § 2031.220.  
“A representation of inability to
comply with [a] particular demand for inspection . . . shall affirm that a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply
with that demand.  This statement shall
also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or
category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control
of the responding party.  This statement
shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.”  CCP §
2031.230. 
A motion to compel further response
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”  CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).  “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on
the moving party to show both:  [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g.,
how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue
in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial).  The fact that there
is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted).  “Declarations are generally used to show the
requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection.  The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’
rather than mere conclusions.”  Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted).  “The declarations may be on information and
belief, if necessary.  However, in such
cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources
of the information) must also be alleged.” 
Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation
omitted).  “Most declarations are made by
the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the
relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.”  Id.
at 8:1495.9.
“If ‘good cause’ is shown by the moving
party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure (the same as on motions to compel answers to
interrogatories or deposition questions. . . ).”  Id.
at 8:1496 (citation omitted).
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff Armando Santiago requests
that the Court order defendant LA Best Security Inc (“LA Best”) to provide
further responses and documents to plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-12.
            Plaintiff explains that plaintiff
served Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on LA Best on February 9,
2024.  Responses were due by March 12,
2024.  When no responses were received,
plaintiff’s counsel left a voicemail message with defense counsel requesting
responses.  On March 13, 2024,
plaintiff’s counsel sent an email to defense counsel. On March 14, 2024,
counsel attempted to meet and confer, and plaintiff’s counsel provided an
extension to March 20, and then to March 28, upon defense counsel’s
request.  Plaintiff asserts that no
responses were received.  On April 2,
2024, defense counsel requested an extension to April 12.  No responses were received on April 12.  On April 16, 2024, defendant served responses
but no documents.  On April 18, 2024,
plaintiff’s counsel sent an email regarding the “inadequacy of its response”
and provided a final extension to April 25, 2024.  On April 19, 22, and 29, plaintiff’s counsel
sent further meet and confer letters.
            Plaintiff argues that defendant
waived objections by failing to serve timely responses.  Further, plaintiff contends, the responses
are not code-compliant statements of compliance or representations of inability
to comply.  See CCP §2031.230.  Further, plaintiff argues, good cause
justifies the discovery sought because the documents “are reasonably likely to
be probative as to Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant LA Best was one of his
joint employers and is liable for alleged wage and hour theft and other labor
violations.”
            In response to plaintiff’s requests,
LA Best responded:  “Documents responsive
to this request are believed to have been produced previously by United Building
Company. A diligent search and good faith and reasonable inquiry has been made
in an effort to comply with this Request. Responding party will produce
documents found during said search. Responding party will be delayed in
producing said documents as Responding Party had its facility burglarized; is
in the process of moving; and the documents will be produced once Counsel for
cross-defendant receives and assembles them.”
            Although no opposition was filed,
defense counsel filed a declaration stating that he has had serious ongoing health
issues since he substituted into the case in December 2023, has recently
discussed the discovery issues with plaintiff’s counsel, and has committed to
an in person meeting with plaintiff’s counsel and “to competently represent
[his] clients from this point forward.”  
            The Court finds that defendant’s
response does not comply with CCP §2031.220 and CCP §2031.230.  Plaintiff has shown good cause for the
documents.
            The motion is GRANTED.
Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP § §2030.300(d),
2031.310(h).
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states:  “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” 
            Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions against defendant LA Best and its attorney of
record in the amount of $4021.65 (at $195/hr. paralegal rate, $450/hr. attorney
rate) and “an additional $1900 for the abuse and misuse of the discovery
process” for a total of $5921.65.  Plaintiff
also requests that the Court order that if defendant fails to comply by the
deadline, then certain sanctions “automatically go into effect.”  The Court declines to make such an order.  Defense counsel acknowledges that “some
monetary compensation” is warranted.  The
Court finds that $1,546.65 ($195 x 3 hrs., $450/hr. x 2 hrs., $61.65 filing
fee) is a reasonable amount to be imposed against defendant and its attorney of
record, Michael L. Sloan, Esq.
ORDER
            The motion is GRANTED.  Defendant LA’s Best Security is ordered to respond
further in compliance with CCP §2031.220 and CCP §2031.230 and to produce responsive
documents in response to plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, Nos. 1-12, within twenty days.
            The Court orders sanctions against
defendant LA’s Best Security Inc. and its attorney of record, Michael L. Sloan,
Esq. SBN 130733 in the amount of $1,546.65
in favor of plaintiff, to be paid within thirty days. 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
