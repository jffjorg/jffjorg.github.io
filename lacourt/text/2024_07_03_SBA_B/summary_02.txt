Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Gloria Caldwell, had failed to respond fully to the defendant's discovery requests, including interrogatories and requests for admissions. The defendant, Driftwood Healthcare Center, LLC, had served discovery requests on the plaintiff in December 2023, but the plaintiff did not respond until April 2024. The defendant had also sent a meet and confer letter to the plaintiff's counsel in May 2024, asking for supplemental responses, but the plaintiff did not provide them.

The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and evasive, and that the plaintiff had failed to respond to certain discovery requests altogether. As a result, the judge ordered the plaintiff to serve further responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 20 days. The judge also ordered the plaintiff to pay a monetary sanction to the defendant in the amount of $766.50.

The judge's order is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §2030.220, which requires that a party's responses to discovery requests be "full and complete." The judge also cited CCP §2031.310, which requires that a party make a "reasonable and good faith effort" to respond to discovery requests.
