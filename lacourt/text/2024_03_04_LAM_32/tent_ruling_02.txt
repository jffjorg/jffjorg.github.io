SALVADOR SUAREZ,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRUCK BODIES AND
  SALES, INC., et al., 
                        
                       Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  23STCV01136
  Hearing Date:  March 4, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to establish
  admissions 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff Salvador
Suarez filed this action against Defendants Southern California Truck Bodies
and Sales, Inc. and Miguel Sanchez. The complaint asserts ten causes of action
arising from wage violations, unfair business practices, retaliation, and wrongful
termination.  
            On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to establish the truth of admissions in its Requests for
Admissions, Set One sent to Defendant Southern California Truck Bodies and
Sales, Inc. Defendant has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Responses to requests for admission are
due thirty days after service of the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250(a).) If a party fails to timely respond to RFAs, the propounding party
may move to deem the matters admitted. (Id., § 2033.280(b).) The motion
must be granted unless the responding party serves substantially compliant
responses before the hearing on the motion. (Id., subd. (c).) Monetary
sanctions are mandatory regardless of whether the matters are deemed admitted
and regardless of substantial justification. (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the subject RFAs on
August 30, 2023. (LaCour Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant did not respond by the statutory
deadline of September 29, 2023. (Id., ¶ 4.) On October 3, 2023,
Defendant requested an extension. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff requested the
information be provided by November 22, 2023. (Id., ¶ 7.) Defendant did
not provide the information by that date. (Id., ¶ 8.) Mediation took
place on November 29, 2023, but failed because Defendant did not provide
sufficient information. (Id., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff followed up on the
discovery in December 2023 and January 2024. (Id., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
granted three more extensions, with the last one being January 23, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 13.) To date, Defendant has not provided any responses to discovery. (Id.,
¶ 14.) 
            Defendant has not filed an
opposition to the motion, thereby conceding these facts and the merits of the
motion. By operation of statute, the RFAs must be deemed admitted, and
sanctions are mandatory. 
            Plaintiff’s counsel requests $2,000
in sanctions without substantiation. (See LaCour Decl. ¶ 16.) No information is
provided as to counsel’s hourly rate or the hours spent on the motion. Based on
the simplicity of the motion and lack of opposition, the Court awards $900 as the
reasonable amount. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to deem RFAs
admitted is GRANTED. The Court sanctions Defendant Southern California Truck
Bodies and Sales, Inc. and its counsel in the total amount of $900.
