And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Songhee Kim, to compel the deposition of Jeehyun Yum, a nonparty. The motion was personally served on Yum at the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in Los Angeles. Yum failed to appear for his deposition on two separate occasions, and the plaintiff's counsel attempted to confer with Yum to reschedule the deposition, but was unsuccessful. The judge finds that Yum has failed to appear for his duly noticed deposition and that no substantial justification has been provided for his failure to appear. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition and sanctions Yum in the amount of $1,701, to be paid within 30 days.
