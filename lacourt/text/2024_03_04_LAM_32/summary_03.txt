And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff, Lee Newson, alleges that he was discriminated against by the City of Los Angeles in his employment as a police officer. He claims that he was prevented from being promoted to detective due to his disabilities and was falsely accused of driving under the influence and arrested. The plaintiff has requested additional information from the defendant, but the defendant has failed to provide a proper response.

The court has found that the plaintiff has established good cause for the requested information and that the defendant has failed to articulate any arguments or authorities to the contrary. The court has also found that the defendant's objections are without merit and that the defendant has failed to provide a proper response to the discovery requests.

As a result, the court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and has ordered the defendant to serve supplemental responses to the discovery requests within 15 days. The court has also awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $1,110, to be paid within 30 days.
