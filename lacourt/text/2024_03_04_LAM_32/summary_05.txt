And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Juan Longfellow, purchased a 2013 Volkswagen Jetta from Carvana, LLC, and signed an Arbitration Agreement that covers any claims arising from or related to the sales contract, the vehicle, or the provision of services. The defendants have met their burden of proving the existence of this arbitration agreement, and the plaintiff has not filed an opposition. Therefore, the judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stays the case in its entirety pending the outcome of arbitration.
