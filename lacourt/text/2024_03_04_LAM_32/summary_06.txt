And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Neal Blinde. The case involves a negligence claim brought by Plaintiff Mary Hale against "Manager does 1-10", with allegations that the Defendant refused to accept a mail-in deposit, violating the Plaintiff's due process and 14th amendment rights. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to properly serve them and that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. The judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate sufficient minimum contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction over the Defendant, and therefore grants the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
