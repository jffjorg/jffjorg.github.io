            v.

                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV30163
  Hearing Date:  March 4, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to quash service of
  summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff Mary
Hale filed this action against “Manager does 1-10.” The complaint asserts a
cause of action for negligence based on the following facts: “Defendant refused
to accept plaintiff’s mail-in deposit, violating plaintiff’s due process
rights, and 14th amendment rights, causing plaintiff to suffer severe financial
and emotional hardship.”
            On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff
filed an amendment to fictitious name, naming Neal Blinde as Doe 1. 
            On January 30, 2024, Defendant
Blinde filed the instant motion to quash service of summons. Plaintiff filed
her opposition on February 15, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as provided
by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, § 410.50(a).)
“[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of process or
by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O. (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a substitute for
proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1199,
1206.) Additionally, when the defendant is a nonresident, the following legal
principles apply. 
“Due process permits the exercise of personal
jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in the following four situations: (1)
where the defendant is domiciled in the forum state when the lawsuit is
commenced; (2) where the defendant is personally served with process while he
or she is physically present in the forum state; (3) where the defendant
consents to jurisdiction; and (4) where the defendant has sufficient ‘minimum
contacts’ with the forum state, such that the exercise of jurisdiction would
not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” (Muckle
v. Superior Court (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 218, 226.) 
A defendant may establish sufficient
minimum contacts with the forum state in one of two ways. For a court to
exercise general jurisdiction, the defendant must have contact with the forum
state that is substantial, continuous, and systematic. (Vons Companies, Inc.
v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 445.) In such a case, the
cause of action need not be related to the defendant’s contact with the forum
state. (Id. at p. 446.) For a court to exercise specific jurisdiction,
the following elements must be met: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed
themselves of forum benefits; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out
of the defendant’s contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of personal
jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice. (Snowney
v. Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1062.)
When personal jurisdiction is challenged
by a nonresident defendant, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to
demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction. (Mihlon v. Sup. Ct. (1985) 169 Cal. App. 3d 703, 710.)
Once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established, it
becomes the defendant’s burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction
would be unreasonable. (Vons, supra, 14 Cal. 4th at p. 447.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Proper Service
            “A summons may be served on a person
outside this state in any manner provided by this article or by sending a copy
of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, requiring a return receipt. Service of a summons by this
form of mail is deemed complete on the 10th day after such mailing.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.40.) 
            Defendant resides in North Carolina
and was served in Virginia. Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not effectuate
service by any means except mailing and that the mailing did not comply with
the Code because Plaintiff failed to require a return receipt. Plaintiff’s
opposition attaches a proof of service executed by nonparty Ramon Ortiz on
February 13, 2024, wherein Mr. Ortiz avers that he sent the summons and
complaint through first-class mail addressed to Neal Blinde at 1680 Capital One
Dr., McLean, VA 22102. Plaintiff also attaches a certified mail receipt with
the box checked for “Return Receipt (hardcopy).” This satisfies the
requirements of Section 415.40.
II.
Minimum Contacts
            Nonetheless, proper service alone
does not confer jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. Here, it is
undisputed that Defendant was not domiciled in California when the lawsuit
commenced, Defendant was not personally served in California, and Defendant
does not consent to jurisdiction. (See Muckle, supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at
p. 226.) Therefore, the issue is whether Defendant has sufficient minimum
contacts with California to justify personal jurisdiction. (Ibid.)
            As stated above, when jurisdiction
is challenged, it is the plaintiff’s burden to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that minimum contacts exist. (Mihlon, supra, 169 Cal.App.3d at
p. 710.) “The plaintiff must do more than merely allege jurisdictional facts.
It must present evidence sufficient to justify a finding that California may
properly exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. The plaintiff must provide
affidavits and other authenticated documents in order to demonstrate competent
evidence of jurisdictional facts.” (In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I &
II (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 100, 110.) 
            Plaintiff’s opposition makes no
attempt to satisfy this burden. Instead, Plaintiff argues that “[a] defendant
may not use this type of motion to dispute the truth of the allegations
contained in a civil complaint.” (Opp. 1:22-23.) Plaintiff argues that “[a]
motion to quash under section 418.10 is a limited procedural tool to contest
personal jurisdiction over the defendant where the statutory requirements for
service of process are not fulfilled.” (Opp. 2:3-5.) 
However, a motion to quash based on lack
of jurisdiction is not limited to defects in service. A court may lack
jurisdiction for a number of reasons, only one of which is improper service. As
outlined above, a court also lacks personal jurisdiction over a nonresident
defendant who has insufficient minimum contacts with the forum state.
Defendant’s motion does not challenge the truth of the allegations in the
complaint; it challenges the Court’s jurisdiction over Defendant. Even assuming
all of the allegations in the complaint are true, Plaintiff has failed to
demonstrate that Defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with California.
Therefore, the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Neal Blinde’s motion to
quash service of summons is GRANTED.
