And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference, which is a request for a trial date to be set earlier in the case. The plaintiffs are minors under 14 who have been injured by the defendants' actions and are seeking damages. The defendants have not opposed the motion. The judge is required by law to grant the motion if the plaintiffs meet certain conditions, which they have done. The plaintiffs have verified their ages and have a substantial interest in the case. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference is granted.
