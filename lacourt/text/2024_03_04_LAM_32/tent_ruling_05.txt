  Case No.:  23STCV25608
  Hearing Date:  March 4, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 19, 2023, Plaintiff Juan
Longfellow filed this action against Defendants Carvana, LLC, Bridgecrest
Credit Company, LLC, and Developers Surety and Indemnity Company. The complaint
asserts causes of action for (1) violation of CLRA, (2) violation of the
Song-Beverly Act, and (3) claim against dealer bond. The action stems from
Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2013 Volkswagen Jetta, which Plaintiff alleges was
sold to him with undisclosed defects.     On
December 12, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion to compel arbitration.
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  
LEGAL STANDARD
The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) states
that “[a] written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction
involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising
out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and
enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the
revocation of any contract.” (9 U.S.C. § 2.) The term “involving commerce” is
interpreted to mean simply “affecting commerce” to give the FAA the broadest
reach possible, and does not require a transaction that is actually “within the
flow of interstate commerce.” (See Allied-Bruce Terminix Co. v. Dobson (1995)
513 U.S. 265, 273-74; Citizens Bank v. Alafabco, Inc. (2003) 539 U.S.
52, 56.) Moreover, parties may agree to apply the FAA notwithstanding any
effect on interstate commerce. (Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020)
46 Cal.App.5th 337, 355.) 
“On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists….” (Code Civ. Proc, § 1281.2.) “The party seeking
arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any
defense, such as unconscionability.” (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v.
Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236.)
DISCUSSION
“The moving party ‘can meet its initial
burden by attaching to the motion or petition a copy of the arbitration
agreement purporting to bear the opposing party's signature.’” (Gamboa v.
Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 165, quoting Bannister
v. Marinidence Opco, LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 541, 543-44.) 
Upon purchasing the vehicle, Plaintiff
signed an Arbitration Agreement covering any claim arising from or related to:
the sales contract; the vehicle or its sale; or the provision of services such
as warranties and insurance related to the vehicle. (Piatak Decl., Ex. A.) The
agreement covers Carvana, “any purchaser, assignee or servicer of the Contract,”
or “any third party providing any product or service in connection with or
incidental to the Contract, the sale of the vehicle and/or other goods or
services covered by the Contract and/or related to the vehicle, if such third
party is named as a co-defendant.” (Ibid.) 
Therefore, Defendants have proven the
existence of an arbitration agreement covering the claims and defendants at
issue. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and thus provides no basis against
enforcement of the agreement. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration
is GRANTED. The case is stayed in its entirety pending the outcome of
arbitration.
