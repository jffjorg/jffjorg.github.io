Case Number: 22STCP03661
Hearing Date: April 9, 2024
Dept: 85 Citizens
Case Title: Preserving Venice v. California Coastal Commission

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

* Case Overview: The case involves a petition for writ of mandate filed by Citizens Preserving Venice (CPV) challenging the California Coastal Commission's (CCC) approval of a Coastal Development Permit (CDP) for a residential project in Venice, California.
* Facts:
	+ The project is a single-family home to replace an existing home on a street with 21 residential structures.
	+ The project had been modified to address concerns raised by the CCC, including increased setbacks and articulation of the façade.
	+ The project's size remains unchanged at 2795 square feet.
* Legal Issues:
	+ CPV argues that the CCC's approval of the project violates the Coastal Act and the Venice Local Coastal Program (LCP).
	+ The CCC argues that the project is consistent with the Venice LCP and the Coastal Act.
* Standard of Review:
	+ The court will review the CCC's decision under the substantial evidence standard.
	+ The court will not reweigh the evidence or disregard the CCC's findings simply because a contrary finding would be more reasonable.

Key Points:

* The CCC's decision to approve the project is based on its finding that the project is consistent with the Venice LCP and the Coastal Act.
* The project's size and massing are consistent with the surrounding area.
* The project's façade has been articulated to reduce its massing and improve its compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood.
* The CCC's staff report found that the project is consistent with the Venice LCP and the Coastal Act, and that the project's size and massing are consistent with the surrounding area.

Conclusion:
The court will review the CCC's decision under the substantial evidence standard. The project's size and massing are consistent with the surrounding area, and the project's façade has been articulated to reduce its massing and improve its compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood. The court is likely to affirm the CCC's decision to approve the project.
