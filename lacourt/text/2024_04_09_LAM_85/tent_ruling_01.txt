Citizens
Preserving Venice v. California Coastal Commission, 22STCP03661
Tentative decision on
petition for writ of mandate:   denied




 
            
 
            Petitioner
Citizens Preserving Venice (“Citizens”), a California non-profit corporation, seeks
administrative mandate directing Respondent California Coastal Commission
(“Commission”) to (1) set aside its Coastal Development Permit (“CDP”) issued
for the Project located at 822 Angelus Place in Venice, California. 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Citizens filed the verified Petition and Complaint (“Petition”) on October 7,
2022, alleging causes of action for administrative mandate and for declaratory
and injunctive relief.  The Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
            The
Project is located in a multi-family zoned, historical, residential
neighborhood located in the Venice coastal zone.  The neighborhood and the block of the Project
is characterized by family dwellings of varying architectural styles.  The Project proposes a single-family home
which is 3.4 times larger than the existing development on the lot and over two
times larger than average size of all homes on the 26-parcel block.  On August 14, 2020, the developer for the
Project applied to the City of Los Angeles (“City”) for a CDP. 
            By
October of 2021, the City’s Department of Planning had approved a CDP which was
appealed to the Commission.  The appeal
process is that the Commission initially determines whether the appeal raises a
“substantial issue” that the project conforms with Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act.  If the Commission finds a substantial issue,
the CDP is null and void.  The Commission
then determines in a de novo hearing whether the Project conforms to
Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act. 
            In
October of 2021, the Commission staff report stated that the Project raised
substantial issues regarding its non-conformance with Chapter 3 policies and
those of the certified Venice Land Use Permit (“LUP”), adverse cumulative
effect, prejudice to the City’s development of a Local Coastal Program (“LCP”),
and the misuse of past Commission actions.  The Commission subsequently voted in agreement
with the staff report. 
            In
July of 2022, the Commission staff issued a new report for the de novo
hearing indicating that the square footage for the Project was large unchanged from
the Commission’s finding of substantial issues in October 2021. The report
explained that the Commission was being put in a difficult position for making design
issue determinations while preserving Venice’s character.  The report explained that the appropriate
mechanism for regulating these types of design issues is through the process of
updating the Venice LUP, which the City was in the process of doing.  
            In
August of 2022, the Commission held a hearing during which the Commission staff
presented the de novo staff report that recommended approval of the
proposed Project, along with an oral presentation providing additional details.  The Commission’s District Director stated
that the staff had spent a considerable amount of time working with the
applicants who had made as many changes as they were willing to make.  The staff believed the Project had changed
enough that it was now consistent with the LUP. 

The scale, massing, and character of the Project remained
largely unchanged.  Petitioner objected,
both in writing and orally at the hearing, on the grounds that the Commission
had engaged in a staff meeting with the applicant for the purposes of providing
“advice on the manner in which a proposed development might be made consistent
with the policies specified in Chapter 3.” 
Petitioners contend that such advice was given in violation of Public
Resources Code section 30335.1. 
             On August 11, 2022, the Commission voted to deny
the appeal, adopt the staff report’s proposed findings and recommendation, and issue
a CDP for the Project.
Petitioner seeks (1) mandamus to set aside the CDP, (2) a permanent
injunction enjoining any construction on the Project until the Commission is in
full compliance with the Coastal Act, and (3) a declaration that the Commission
violated Public Resources Code section 30335.1.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
November 21, 2022, Citizens and Commission filed a stipulation that Petitioner had
served the Commission on October 28, 2022, that the due date of the Response
would be 30 days after receipt of the administrative record, and that a single
Response to the Petition and Complaint is appropriate. 
On October 11, 2023, the Commission filed an Answer to the
Petition and Complaint.
 
B.
Standard of Review
CCP section 1094.5 is
the administrative mandamus provision which structures the procedure for
judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by administrative
agencies.  Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic
Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974) 11 Cal.3d
506, 514-15.  
CCP section 1094.5
does not on its face specify which cases are subject to independent review,
leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda
v. City of Angels, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  Decisions of the Commission are governed by
the substantial evidence standard.  Ross
v. California Coastal Comm., (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 900, 921.  “Substantial evidence” is relevant evidence
that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California
Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board, (“California Youth Authority”)
(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 585) or evidence of ponderable legal significance,
which is reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 267, 305, n.28.  
The Commission's
decision may rely on any relevant evidence, regardless of its admissibility in
civil actions.  14 California Code of
Regulations (“CCR”) §13065.  The
substantial evidence on which the Commission may rely includes expert opinions,
photographs, and observations from Commissioners, Commission staff, and the
public.  La Costa Beach Homeowners'
Assn. v. California Coastal Commission, (“La Costa”) (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 804, 819; LT-WR, LLC v. California Coastal Com., (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 770, 793-94.  The court may
not reweigh the evidence, or disregard or overturn a finding simply because a
contrary finding would be more reasonable. 
Boreta Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control,
(1970) 2 Cal.3d 85, 94.  A court may only
overturn the agency’s decision if a reasonable person could not have reached
the decision based on the evidence that the agency had before it.  Bolsa Chica Land Trust v. Superior Court,
(1999) 71 Cal.App.4h 493, 503.
An agency is presumed
to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the
petitioner therefore has the burden of proof. 
Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Coastal Commission,
(1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137.  The
petitioner has the burden of demonstrating that the agency’s findings are not
supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.  Young v. Gannon, (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
209, 225.  The trial court considers all
evidence in the administrative record, including evidence that detracts from
evidence supporting the agency’s decision. 
California Youth Authority, supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at
585.  
The agency’s decision
must be based on the evidence presented at the hearing.  Board of Medical Quality Assurance v.
Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. 
Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at 514-15.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a
requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 515.
Legal issues are for
the court to decide.  However, California
law affords "great weight" to the Commission's interpretation of the
Coastal Act and its regulations, given its special familiarity with these legal
issues. Ross v. California Coastal Com., supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at
922-23.  The court's review is
"quite limited, and the Commission is "given substantial
deference."  Evans v. City of San
Jose, (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1145-46.

 
C. The Coastal Act
1. The LCP
The Coastal Act of 1976 (Public Resources Code[1]
§30000 et seq.) (“Coastal Act”) is the legislative continuation of the
coastal protection efforts commenced when the People passed Proposition 20, the
1972 initiative that created the Commission. 
See Ibarra v. California Coastal Comm., (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 687, 693.  One of the primary
purposes of the Coastal Act is the avoidance of deleterious consequences of
development on coastal resources.  Pacific
Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Comm., (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158,
163.  The California Supreme Court described
the Coastal Act as a comprehensive scheme to govern land use planning for the
entire coastal zone of California.  Yost
v. Thomas, (1984) 36 Cal.3d 561, 565. 
The Coastal Act must be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes
and objectives.  §30009.
The Coastal Act’s goals are binding on both the Commission
and local government and include: (1) maximizing, expanding and maintaining
public access (§§ 30210-14); (2) expanding and protecting public recreation
opportunities (§§ 30220-24); 3) protecting and enhancing marine resources
including biotic life (§§ 30230-37); and (4) protecting and enhancing land
resources (§§ 30240-44). The supremacy of these statewide policies over local,
parochial concerns is a primary purpose of the Coastal Act, and the Commission
is therefore given the ultimate authority under the Coastal Act and its
interpretation.  Pratt Construction
Co. v. California Coastal Comm., (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1075-76.
Because local areas within the coastal zone may have unique
issues not amenable to centralized administration, the Coastal Act
“encourage[s] state and local initiatives and cooperation in preparing
procedures to implement coordinated planning and development” in the coastal
zone.  §30001.5; Ibarra v. California Coastal Comm., supra, 182
Cal.App.3d at 694-96.  To that
end, the Coastal Act requires that “each local government lying, in whole or in
part, within the coastal zone” prepare a local coastal program (“LCP”).  §30500(a). 
The local government prepares the LCP in consultation with the
Commission and with full public participation. 
§§ 30500(a), (c), 30503; McAllister v. California Coastal Comm.,
(2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 912, 930, 953. 
The LCP provides a comprehensive plan for development within
the coastal zone with a focus on preserving and enhancing the overall quality
of the coastal zone environment as well as expanding and enhancing public
access.  Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
Board of Supervisors, (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 571.  The Coastal Act defines an “LCP” as:
 
“[A] local government’s
(a) land use plans, (b) zoning ordinances, (c) zoning district maps, and (d)
within sensitive coast resource areas, other implementing actions, which, when
taken together, meet the requirements of, and implement the provisions and
policies of this division [the Coastal Act] at the local level.”  §30l08.6. 



 
Thus, the LCP consists of a land use plan (“LUP”)[2]
and the implementing actions of zoning ordinances, district maps, and other
implementing actions (“LIP”).  Yost v.
Thomas, supra, 36 Cal.3d at 571-72. 
These may be prepared together or sequentially, and they may be prepared
separately for separate geographical areas or “segments” of a local coastal
zone.  §30511.  
Under normal circumstances, the local government drafts an
LCP in accordance with Commission guidelines (See §§ 30501, 30503), and
the local government’s governing body adopts the proposed LCP as conforming
with provisions of the Coastal Act. 
§30510.  The local government then
submits the LCP to the Commission for review and certification.  §30511(a).  
In making this determination, the Commission reviews the LUP for
conformity with the policies in the Coastal Act.  City of Chula Vista v. Superior Court,
(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 472, 481; §§ 30500-26. 
After the required public hearing(s), it may certify or not certify all
or a portion of the LUP.  §§ 30512,
30512.2.  If the Commission does not
certify the LUP, it must provide written reasons for not certifying and may
suggest changes to the local government, that if enacted, would result in
certification of the LUP. The Commission does not normally have the authority
to change the LUP through its own action or require the local government to do
so.  Ibid. 
Once the LUP is certified, the Commission reviews the LIP to
determine whether those items are sufficient to implement the policies of the
certified LUP.  §30513.  If the Commission determines the LIP
provisions are adequate, it certifies the LCP. As with the LUP, if the
Commission denies certification of the LIP, it may suggest modifications that,
if adopted, would result in certification of the LCP.  Ibid. 
The Commission has no authority to impose either an LUP or a LIP on
local governments.  Ibarra v. California Coastal Comm., supra, 182 CaI.App.3d at 696.
 
2. CDPs
The Coastal Act requires, with narrow exceptions, a CDP for
any development in the coastal zone in addition to any other permit
required.  §30600.  The authority to issue a CDP is initially
vested in the Commission. 
 
a. The City’s
Authority
A local government may obtain authority to issue a CDP in different
ways.  The authority to issue CDPs
automatically passes from the Commission to the local government once the LCP
is certified.  §30519(a).  Prior to certification of its LCP, a local
government may accept the authority and voluntarily adopt necessary procedural
ordinances for processing CDPs. 
§30600(b).  This option is
discretionary with the local government, and an applicant must obtain a CDP
from the Commission if the local government’s LCP has not been certified and it
has not chosen this option.  §30600(c). The
Coastal Act expressly recognizes the need to "rely heavily" on local
government "[t]o achieve maximum responsiveness to local conditions,
accountability, and public accessibility .... " §30004(a); Pacific
Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates, LLC v. City of Los Angeles (2012) 55 Cal.4th
783, 794.  
The City does not have a certified LCP, but it does have a Venice
LUP that was certified in 2001.  The
Venice LUP states that “Venicie’s unique social and architectural diversity
should be protected” and that the City should “[en]sure that the character and
scale of existing single-family neighborhoods is maintained.  
The City assumed primary authority from the Commission to
issue CDPs pursuant to section 30600(b) and (c).  All land west of Lincoln Boulevard in Venice,
California is located in the "coastal zone" established by the
Coastal Act.  §§ 30001.5; 30103(a).  The City has had sole authority to process
CDP applications in the Venice coastal zone single permit jurisdiction. 
 
b. Application for
a CDP
CDP applications for properties in the Venice coastal zone
are submitted to the City’s Planning Department or the City Engineer.  LAMC §12.20.2(D).  Once the Planning Department approves or
denies the permit, the decision may be appealed to the pertinent City Planning
Commission.  See LAMC §12.20.2(H).
 
c. Appeal to the
Commission  
Whether or not there is an appeal to the Planning
Commission, the City's CDP may be appealed to the Commission.  §3060(a). 
Because the City does not have a certified LCP, any person, including
the executive director or two members of the Commission, may appeal the City's
issuance of a CDP within 20 working days. 14 CCR §13332.  The grounds for appeal are limited to whether
the project conforms with the Chapter 3 policies of the Coastal Act.  §30604(a). 

The appeal is a two-step process.  First, the Commission decides whether the
appeal raises a "substantial issue" of compliance with Chapter 3
policies.  §30625(b); 14 CCR
§13115(b).  If the Commission decides
that the appeal raises a substantial issue, then the City's CDP is nullified,
and the Commission conducts a de novo
review of the CDP.  §§ 30621(a),
30625(b)(2); Kaczorowski v. Mendocino County Board of Supervisors, (“Kaczorowski”)
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 564, 569. 
On de novo
review, the Commission takes jurisdiction over the project and decides whether
to approve or deny the CDP.  14 CCR
§13115.  The Commission
hears the CDP application as if no local governmental unit was previously
involved, “deciding for itself whether the proposed project satisfies legal
standards and requirements."  Kaczorowski, supra, 88
Cal.App.4th at 569.  Once the Commission
has assumed jurisdiction, it retains jurisdiction to consider modifications to
the project.  See e.g., Security National
Guaranty, Inc. v. California Coastal Commission, (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 402, 408.
Section
30335.1, entitled “Employees to give procedural assistance”, provides as
follows: “The commission shall provide for appropriate employees on the staff
of the commission who will assist applicants (and other interested parties)
with matters which are before the commission for action.  The assistance rendered by those employees
shall be limited to matters of procedure and shall not extend to advice on
substantive issues arising out of the provisions of this division, such as advice
on the manner in which a proposed development might be made consistent with the
policies specified in Chapter 3 (commending with Section 30200).”
 
3. Pertinent
Coastal Act Policies
Permitted
development shall be designed in part to
be “visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas”. 
§30251.
New development shall, inter
alia, protect communities and neighborhoods that have been designated Special
Coastal Communities.  §30253.
“[T]he incremental effects
of an individual project shall be reviewed
in connection with the effects
of past projects, the effects of other current projects,
and the effects
of probable future projects.” §30604(a).
In approving a CDP, the Commission must make a finding
that the approval
of the permit will not prejudice the ability of the
City to prepare an LCP that is in conformity with Chapter 3. §30604(a).
 
4. Pertinent
Venice LUP Policies
            Special Coastal
Communities are “coastal resources” under the Coastal
Act.  Venice’s unique social and
architectural diversity should be protected as a Special Coastal Community.  Venice LUP Policy I.E.1 (AR 11).
            “New development within the Venice
Coastal Zone shall respect the scale
and character of the community development. 
Buildings which are of a scale compatible with the community (with
respect to bulk, eight, buffer and setback) shall be encouraged.  All new development and renovations should
respect the scale, massing, and landscape of existing residential
neighborhoods.”  Venice
LUP Policy I.E.2 (Scale) (AR 11).
            “[V]aried
styles are architecture are encouraged with building facades which incorporate
varied planes and textures while maintaining the neighborhood scale and
massing.”  Venice LUP Policy I.E.3 (Architecture)
(AR 11).
 
D. Statement of Facts[3]
Real Parties-in-Interest
Matthew Boyd and Alexandra Guglielmino (also referred to herein as
“Applicants”) are husband and wife and own the single-family residence located
at 822 Angelus Place, Los Angeles, California (the “Property”).  AR 204.  Angelus Street is 24 feet wide and is a
“small-scale and pedestrian-oriented street”. 
AR 870, 484.  The Property is a 4212
square foot lot which is similar to the size of the other lots in the
neighborhood.  AR 490-91. The
neighborhood and the block where the Property is located primarily has single-family
dwellings, characterized as “modest homes” and “bungalows.”  AR 473, 434. 
Of the 26 homes in the vicinity, 21 are one-story and five are
two-story.  AR 13.
Real Party-in-Interest
Robert Thibodeau (“Thibodeau”) serves as Applicants’ agent for the Project,
which is the demolition of a one-story 816 foot home, garage, and accessory
structure, and the construction of a new 2795 square foot residence with an
attached two-car garage, one additional on-site parking space, swimming pool
and roof deck on a 4212 square foot lot.  AR 1.  The Project would be more than double the size
of the average house (1277 square-feet) for the 26 homes in the vicinity.  AR 490, 491.
On or about July
9, 2020, Thibodeau submitted to the City a CDP application for the Project.  AR 53.
 After a public hearing, the City issued
a CDP for the Project on August 17, 2021. AR
254.  On September 8, 2021, the City
notified the Commission of its determination.  AR 254.
 
1. The Substantial Issue Appeal
On October 4,
2021, Stewart Oscars appealed the CDP to the Commission.  AR
522-44.  He argued in part that the Project
fails to meet Venice LUP Policies I.E.2 (Scale) and I.E.3 (Architecture)
because it is inconsistent with the scale, massing, and character of the
neighborhood.  AR 473. 
On November 17,
2021, the Commission held a hearing on whether the appeal raised a substantial
issue. AR 472.  The Commission staff report stated that staff
believed there was a substantial issue with respect to the Project’s
consistency with Chapter 3 policies.  AR
473.  Staff conducted an independent
survey of the area surrounding the Property, covering 26 lots along both sides
of Angelus Place between Grandview and Oakwood Avenues.  AR 473. 
Staff believed the Project to be inconsistent with Venice LUP Policies I.E.1
(General), I.E.2 (Scale) and I.E.3 (Architecture).  AR 473. 
The staff report noted that the City-approved Project fronting Angeus
Place is 32 feet wide and did “not offer a stepped back façade or other
articulated features to reduce its massing, which is uncommon in the area,
thereby creating a visual impact highly visible to pedestrians walking by the
lot.”  AR
473.  The size of the proposed home was inconsistent
with recent City action and the average size of homes in the survey area.  AR 473. 
The Project’s size and massing were not consistent with the existing
community character, which could prejudice the City in preparing an LCP in the
future.  AR 473.  The Commission staff concluded that the
appeal raises a substantial issue of the Project’s consistency with Chapter 3
policies.  AR 474.
The staff report noted
that Venice LUP Policies I.E.2 and I.E.3 encourage a variety of styles and
discourage focus on subjective judgments on preferred architectural style.  AR 484. 
Hence, the Commission has used height limits, setback requirements, and
bulk to analyze the mass and scale of proposed structures to determine neighborhood
compatibility.  AR 484.  The Project stated that all five of the
existing two-story homes have stepped back facades and a partial second level
addition towards the rear of the lots whereas the Project lacked articulation
and was not stepped back from Angeles Place. 
AR 484.  While the City provided
some analysis regarding character and scale of the Project, it was remiss in
not factoring in the home’s “visual impact on the small-scale and
pedestrian-oriented street.”  AR 484.
On November 17,
2021, the Commission voted to find that the Project raises a substantial issue.
 AR
666.  By doing so, the Commission
accepted Stewart Oscar’s appeal and took jurisdiction over the CDP application
for de novo review.  AR 2.  The
City-issued CDP then became void.  AR 9.
 
2.
The Project Revisions
After the
substantial issue appeal determination, the Applicants and Commission staff had meetings and emails regarding the
revisions to the Project.  AR 723, 724, 728, 729, 735, 748.  Staff advised
the Applicants what changes
would impact Staff’s
willingness to “recommend approval of the revised
project” to the
Commission.  AR 729.
The Applicants
modified the Project to address the issues raised.  The front yard setbacks were increased to 20
feet from the 18-foot setback prevailing on the block and permitted by the LAMC.  AR 2. 
The second story setback was increased a variable four to six feet,
making the total front setback 22 to 24 feet. 
AR 2.  The building height was
decreased from 30 feet to a variable of 28 ½ to 29 ½ feet.  AR 2.  The
rear setback increased from 15 feet by another eight inches to 15 feet, eight
inches, and one side yard setback decreased from five feet, eight inches to four
feet.  AR 2.  The Applicants’ modified Project added
articulation and variation to the façade to reduce the mass of the residence
fronting Angelus Place.  AR 2. 
 
            3. The Staff Report for the De
Novo Appeal
On July 28, 2022, the Commission staff report was issued for
the de novo appeal hearing scheduled to be heard
on August 11, 2022.  AR 1-20.  The staff report included plans for the
Project as modified.  AR 706-11.  
The staff report stated that the Commission has previously
found that Venice is a Special Coastal Community whose character, including its
unique social and architectural diversity protected by the Venice LUP, should
be protected under section 30253(e).  AR
12.  The Venice LUP was designed to
protect Venice’s unique character, primarily through the use of objective
building standards intended to limit project size and bulk.  AR 13. 
Nevertheless, the Venice LUP recognized that there would be some
development of “new modern homes” – i.e., larger homes – although they
would be limited by the small lot size in Venice.  AR 13. 
Given the specific conditions surrounding the Project site and the
diverse development patterns of Venice, it was appropriate to assess the
Project for conformity with Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act using the certified
Venice LUP as guidance.  AR 13.  
Venice LUP Policy I.A.6 restricts lots smaller than 5,000
square feet to a maximum density of two units per lot.  AR 11.  Venice
LUP Policy I.E.1 notes that Venice’s “architectural diversity” should be
protected.  AR 11.  Venice LUP Policy I.E.2 states new
development should respect the scale and character of the community and
encourages buildings “which are of a scale compatible with the community (with
respect to bulk, height, bugger and setback).” 
AR 11.  Additionally, Venice LUP
Policy I.E.3 encourages varied architecture “with building facades which
incorporate varied planes and textures while maintaining the neighborhood scale
and massing.”  AR 11.
The Project is a residential home to replace an existing
home on a street with 21 residential structures.  AR 9, 15, 22-23, 40.  The Project had been modified but its 2795
square foot size had not changed from the City-approved residence.   AR 10. 
Staff reviewed the revised Project plans and the 26 lots on both sides
of Angelus Place between Grandview and Oakwood Avenues.  AR 13. 
The Project would maintain the density of one single-family home on the
lot, which is consistent with the surrounding area.  AR 13. 

The Venice LUP does not provide setback standards but does
require yards to be consistent with neighborhood scale and character.  AR 13. 
The Project’s front yard setback is 18-20 feet, consistent with the
prevailing front yard setback of 18 feet in the area.  AR 13. 
The Project’s side yard setbacks are four feet, in compliance with the
City’s minimum of three feet for lots less than 50 feet wide (the Project lot
is 32 feet wide).  AR 13.  The Project’s rear yard setback is 15 feet
and in compliance with the City’s setback requirements.  AR 13. 
Likewise, the roof pitches reach up to 29.5 feet in height, which is
below the roof height limit of 30 feet and the roof access structure reaches a
maximum height of 33 feet, which is also consistent with the limits set in the
Venice LUP.  AR 14.
The 2795 square-foot residence would be consistent with the
26 residences in the area, which range from 768 to 2937 square foot, with one
duplex larger than the Project.  AR
14.  The Project would be the largest
single-family residence in the survey area and the next largest residence is 1917
square feet, 878 square feet smaller than the Project.  AR 14. 

The two-story Project would be consistent with the surrounding
21 one-story and five two-story structures. 
AR 14.  All five of the existing
two-story structures have stepped back facades and a partial second level of
second story addition toward the rear of the lot.  AR 14. 
The Project is designed with an articulated façade to break up the
massing.  AR 14.  This is true of the visible mass from the
side as well as the front.  AR 14.  The mix of architecture on the block
indicates that the Project façade and varied roof would be compatible with the
existing variety of planes and textures required by the LUP.  AR 14.
The Project plans have been revised since the City-approved
development and therefore the Commission would impose Special Condition 1
requiring the Applicants to comply with all City requirements.  AR 15.
            The
staff report weighed the cumulative impacts of the Project.  AR 15-17. 
In analyzing cumulative impacts, the Commission looks both at historical
data and potential future development in the area.  AR 15. 
The Commission staff reviewed over two dozen lots in the survey area and
noted: (1) the Commission has not entered a final decision on any CDP
applications for projects on Angelus Place since 2001; (2)  the City has approved size increases of four
residential structures “with total sizes ranging from 1,570 square feet to
2,323 square feet”; (3) the City approved two new residential structures at a
square footage of 2,795 square feet and 3,437 square feet, 21 residential
structures ranging in size from 768 square feet to a duplex of 2,937 square
feet, and one duplex larger than the Project; and (4) development in the area
is occurring at a slower pace than other areas of Venice.  AR 15. 

With regard to future development, there are two other
residential homes currently proposed on Angelus Place: a two-story 3,437 square
foot home and a two-story 2,660 square foot single-family home.  AR 16. 
Recent actions demonstrate that homes larger than the existing older
homes will continue to be proposed in the area. 
AR 16.  Even so, the Project would
not set a precedent for overall size of future development.  The variation and articulation to the Project
façade will prevent the size and massing from causing a significant adverse
cumulative effect on the surrounding development and Venice as a Special
Coastal Community.  AR 16.  
The Venice LUP recognizes there will be development of the
size of homes over time, and that development is cabined by building standards,
lot setbacks, lot size, and limits on rooftop decks, all designed to protect
Venice’s character.  AR 16.  The Project is consistent with these
standards and is unlikely to contribute to any adverse cumulative effects on
community character, mass, and scale, and visual resources of the area.  AR 16-17. 
Staff recommended that the Commission approve the CDP with conditions.  AR 1.

Comments and the Commission’s Decision
On August 4 and 5, 2022, Appellant
Stewart Oscars submitted written comments to the staff report.  AR
714-16.  On August 5, 2022, Petitioner Citizens
submitted written comments to the staff report. 
AR 717-18. 
As reflected by Ex Parte
Communication Disclosure Forms, Petitioner’s representatives met directly with
Commissioner Uranga on August 5, 2022 and Commissioner Brownsey on August 8,
2022 to orally express Petitioner’s concern over the Project. AR 831, 833.  
On August 9, 2022, the Commission staff
issued an Addendum containing responses to these comment letters. AR 813.  
On August 11, 2022, following a
public hearing on the de novo appeal, the Commission found that the modified
Project complies with Chapter 3 of the
Coastal Act and approved the CDP with conditions.  AR 890. 
 
            E.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Citizens contends that the Commission (1) made findings not supported by
substantial evidence, (2) failed to properly consider the Project’s cumulative
impacts, (3) violated section 30335.1 and therefore did not proceed in the
manner required by law, and (4) did not provide a fair public hearing.  
 
1. Section 30335.1
Section 30335.1, entitled “Employees to give
procedural assistance” provides as follows: “The commission shall provide for
appropriate employees on the staff of the commission who will assist applicants
(and other interested parties) with matters which are before the commission for
action.  The assistance rendered by those
employees shall be limited to matters of procedure and shall not extend to advice
on substantive issues arising out of the provisions of this division, such as
advice on the manner in which a proposed development might be made consistent
with the policies specified in Chapter 3 (commending with Section 30200).”
Petitioner argues that the meaning of section 30335.1
is plain.  Commission staff
shall not provide advice on substantive issues.  Yet, Commission staff did precisely that by giving the Applicants advice on how the
Project might be made consistent with Chapter 3 policies
and the Venice LUP.  AR 723, 728, 729,
735, 748, 877.  Pet. Op.Br. at 14-15.[4]
According to Petitioner, the Commission’s violation of section
30335.1 means that the staff's
compatibility analysis was missing the public's input, making
the public hearing on the de novo appeal an unfair fait accompli for the
developer.  The Coastal Act and constitutional requirements require that the public
be afforded adequate
notice and a fair hearing
on CDP appeals.  §30320(a)
(“principles of fundamental fairness
and due process of law require that the
commission conduct its affairs in an open,
objective, and impartial manner.”); see Horn v. County
of Ventura, (1979) 24
Cal. 3d 605, 618 (notice
must occur sufficiently prior to final decision to permit a meaningful hearing) (citations omitted).  Petitioner and the public
had no notice or opportunity to provide input on the
behind-the-scenes design changes made by
staff and the Applicants, and staff’s August
9, 2022 Addendum -- issued two days before the
de novo hearing -- dismissed the objector letters that argued the modified Project is still
too massive.  Petitioner
and the public were blind-sided
at the de novo hearing by Commission staff’s
presentation based these private meetings and emails designed to
get the Project approved.[5]  The
Commission’s violation of section 30335.1
prevented a fair hearing
for Petitioner and the
public, which is a failure to proceed in
the manner required by law.  See Sierra Club
v. State Bd. of Forestry, (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1236 (prejudice is presumed when agency violates mandatory procedures).  Pet. Op. Br. at 15-16.
The Commission’s opposition disagrees, contending that section 30335.1 only applies when a matter is
before the Commission for action at a public hearing.  During the CDP process leading up to a
Commission hearing, staff may work with applicants and local governments in
developing the staff recommendation.  The
Commission explains that a matter is before the Commission “for action” only when
the Commission considers it at a noticed public hearing.  See §30621
(requiring de novo public hearing on CDP appeal).  The Legislature’s stated intent in enacting section
30335.1 was for interested parties to receive “appropriate assistance to
facilitate their participation in the planning and [CDP] processes….”  Stats. 1979, c.
919, §19.  At the public hearing, section 30335.1 limits staff’s assistance to
matters of procedure; it does not allow staff to advise how to make a project
consistent with the Coastal Act.  This makes sense because Commission staff will
have prepared and issued a staff report before the hearing that analyzes
whether the matter is consistent with the Coastal
Act and includes a staff recommendation. 
14 CCR §§ 13057, 13059.  With a staff recommendation already made
public, any staff advice at the hearing should be limited to procedural issues.  Opp. at 17.
 
            a. Statutory Interpretation
The
parties’ dispute requires interpretation of section 30335.1.  In construing a statute, a court must
ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the
law.  Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co.,
(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724.  The court
first looks to the language of the statute, attempting to give effect to the
usual, ordinary import of the language and seeking to avoid making any language
mere surplusage.  Brown v. Kelly
Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal 3d 711, 724.  Significance, if possible, is attributed to
every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative
purpose.  Orange County Employees
Assn. v. County of Orange, (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 833, 841.  The statutory language must be harmonized
with provisions relating to the same subject matter to the extent
possible.  Id.  “’The
statute's words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative
intent; if they are clear and unambiguous, ‘[t]here is no need for judicial
construction and a court may not indulge in it. [Citation.]’” MCI
Communications Services, Inc. v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee
Administration, (“MCI”) (2018) 28 Cal. App. 5th 635, 643.
            If
a statute is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one reasonable
interpretation, the court may resort to extrinsic aids, including principles of
construction and legislative history.  MacIsaac v. Waste Management Collection
& Recycling, Inc., (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1082 (quoting Riverview Fire Protection Dist. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd.,
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1126).  
Where ambiguity still remains, the court
should consider “reason, practicality, and common sense.”  Id. at 1084.  This requires consideration of the statute’s
purpose, the evils to be remedied, public policy, and contemporaneous
administrative construction.  MCI,
supra, 28 Cal.App.5th at
643.  The enactment must be given a
reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose
and intent of the lawmakers, practical rather than technical in nature, and
which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or
absurdity.  Lungren v. Deukmejian,
(1988) 45 Cal. 3d 727, 735.  Finally,
statutes are not construed in isolation and every statute must be read and
harmonized with the statutory scheme.  People
v. Ledesma, (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90, 95.   
 
b. The Statute Is Ambiguous
The
portion of section 30335.1
at issue is in the first sentence, which permits appropriate staff employees to
assist applicants (and other interested parties) only on procedural issues for
“matters which are before the commission for action”.  The only time a matter is before the
Commission “for action” with both the applicant and other interested parties present
is at a public hearing.  As the
Commission argues, this fact suggests that the procedural limitation in section
30335.1 applies only at that time.  On
the other hand, Petitioner’s interpretation – that the procedural limitation
applies to any matter for which the Commission will make a decision – also is
reasonable.  The statute is
ambiguous. 
 
c.
Section 30335.1’s Purpose
The problem with Petitioner’s interpretation
is that section 30335.1’s language must be read in context, considering nature
and purpose of the statutory scheme.  Hunt
v. Superior Court, (1999) 21 Cal.4th 984, 1000.  
In most land use matters, the
applicant appears before the decision-maker -- sometimes at a public hearing --
for a determination of its right to an entitlement.  Interested parties may or may not be allowed
to appear at the hearing.  To properly
evaluate the applicant’s right to an entitlement, that person or entity necessarily
must be able to contact the decision-maker’s staff.  Without this back and forth of negotiation,
the required hearing for land use entitlements would be time consuming and be
continued repeatedly while new proposals are made.  That is not the way land use matters work.
Contrary to Petitioner’s
argument, the applicant has a due process right with respect to the entitlement
but other interested parties generally do not. 
Due process requires a protected life, liberty, or property interest to
be at stake.  Cook v. City of Buena Park,
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1, 6 (quoting Cleveland Board of
Education v. Loudermill, (1985) 470 U.S. 532, 538).  Interested neighbors usually do not have a property
interest at stake at another property owner’s entitlement hearing.  The hearing is not adversarial, and the
public’s right to appear and be heard, either through written comments or
orally at the hearing, is statutory in nature. 
Just as the applicant does, the public may communicate with the
decision-maker’s staff before the public hearing.
The Commission’s interpretation of
section 30335.1 is consistent with this general procedure for land use
entitlements, and specifically the Coastal Act scheme for CDPs.  Section 30335.1 is a procedural statute
concerning the Commission’s determination of CDP consistency with Chapter 3
policies.  The Commission has trained,
expert staff tasked with making recommendations for the Commission’s action.  In order to develop such recommendations,
staff must work with an applicant prior to the hearing to craft an acceptable
entitlement.  Petitioner’s interpretation
of section 30335.1 would unduly limit
staff’s ability to advise and work with applicants prior to the public hearing.
 The Commission staff could never work
with an applicant or local government[6]
regarding either a CDP or a LCP.  As the
Commission’s opposition argues, the implication of Petitioner’s argument is
that the Legislature created a complex regulatory program and yet mandated that
the Commission staff could not provide substantive assistance to applicants or
local governments as they navigate through that regulatory program.  There is no evidence that the Legislature
intended to create such an unresponsive agency.  Opp. at 18.
This purpose of section 30335.1 is
consistent with another Coastal Act provision, section 30319, which requires
applicants to provide the Commission with the names and addresses of all
persons, who for compensation, will be communicating with the Commission or
staff on the applicant’s behalf.  This
requirement is not limited to the public hearing and applies to all
communications after an application is made.  There would be little reason for this
requirement if staff communication with the applicant was limited to the public
hearing.  Thus, the Legislature
contemplated that the Commission, through staff, would communicate with
applicants regarding their applications throughout the application process.
Petitioner describes the impact of
its interpretation on the conduct of Commission business as “overblown” and an
affront to the principles of public participation and impartiality.  See §30325 (nothing in Coastal Act prevents
any interested person from testifying or submitting comments). Section 30335.1
limits staff’s substantive advice to CDP applicants; it does not limit an applicant’s
submittals to staff.  Reply at 3-4.  Petitioner is not asking for an order that the
Commission allow the public to participate in the application process in any
particular manner, but rather that the Commission follow the law prohibiting staff
from communicating substantive advice to applicants.  Reply at 3, n. 7.
Petitioner is incorrectly implying
that the Commission’s public hearing is adversarial.  It is not. 
The Commission must hear from the public in addressing a de novo
appeal, but the Commission can properly evaluate a CDP application only if
there has been back and forth between its expert staff and the applicant.  As such, the purpose of section 30335.1 and
the statutory scheme only can be effectuated by the Commission’s
interpretation.  See Brown v.
Kelly Broadcasting Co., supra, 48 Cal.3d at 724.[7]
Petitioners argue that, if the Commission’s position is
correct, section 30335.1 would only apply after staff makes its
recommendation in the staff report and presents its recommendation to the
Commission at the public hearing.  As
such, it would have virtually no purpose because section 30335.1 would apply
only to a small portion of the procedures (Commission hearings) involved in
processing CDPs.  California Teachers
Assn. v. Governing Bet. Of Rialto Unified School Dist., (1997) 14 Cal.4th
627, 634 (court will not adopt interpretation that is an idle act or
superfluous).  Reply at 5.
Petitioner add that the
Commission’s narrow reading of the phrase “matters which are before the
commission for action” clashes with section 30335.1’s mandate that the
Commission “provide for appropriate employees on the staff of the commission to
assist applicants and other interested parties in connection with matters which
are before the commission for action.”  See
§30009 (Coastal Act shall be interpreted to accomplish its purposes and
objectives); Dunn v. County of Santa Barbara, (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th
1281, 1294 (courts “are enjoined to construe [Coastal Act] liberally to
accomplish its purposes and objectives, giving the highest priority to
environmental considerations”).  This narrow
reading would lead to absurd results because Commission staff could not even
give procedural advice outside of Commission hearings, which makes no
sense.  See Harris v. Capital
Growth Investors XIV, (1991) 52 Cal. 3d 1142, 1165-66.  Reply at 4-5.
Both these arguments are
untenable.  The Commission’s
interpretation of section 30335.1 does not preclude procedural advice outside
of the Commission hearings.  To the
contrary, it permits both procedural and substantive advice outside hearings,
and proscribes only substantive advice at the hearing itself.  It is true that this interpretation reduces
the scope of section 30335.1 to less than Petitioner wants, but so what?  That does not make the interpretation wrong. The
Commission’s point is that the statute has the limited purpose of preventing
staff from providing substantive advice at the public hearing after the staff
report has been distributed.  See 14
CCR §§ 13057, 13059.  
Finally, Petitioner notes that many
CDP matters never get to a hearing before the Commission, such as de minimis
waivers and coastal exemptions where no permit is required.  See, e.g., §§ 30610, 30624.7.  Petitioner argues that the Commission’s interpretation
leaves out a significant amount of staff activity regarding these different
coastal development approvals.  Reply at
3, n. 4.  This argument does not affect
the analysis.  Pursuant to the
Commission’s interpretation, section 30335.1 does not restrict staff contact
with an applicant for these matters where no permit is required because there
is no public hearing for such matters.
 
d. Canons of Construction
Petitioner argues that the
Commission’s interpretation is too narrow and contravenes the canon of statutory
construction against rewriting a statute.  See CCP §1858 (in construction of a
statute, courts may not “omit what has been inserted” nor “insert what has been
omitted” and must strive to “give effect to all” parts of the statute).  Had the Legislature meant to limit section
30335.1’s prohibition to assistance at the public hearing, it would have so
stated.  The Commission strains to read
into section 30335.1 restrictions that do not exist in the language of the
statute.  The Commission may wish the Legislature
to amend the statute, but the court cannot do so.  Reply at 3.
The canon of construction
against rewriting a statute does not aid Petitioner.  The Commission’s interpretation does not add
words to section 30335.1.  It merely
interprets “matters which
are before the commission for action” to mean matters for decision at a public
hearing.  This is not adding words or
rewriting the statute.
 
            e. Legislative Intent
The Commission notes that section
30335.1 requires certain Commission staff to provide assistance to applicants
and other interested parties. The Legislature’s stated intent in enacting this provision
was for interested parties to receive “appropriate assistance to facilitate
their participation in the planning and coastal development permit processes….”  Stats. 1979, c. 919, §19.  Opp. at 17.
Petitioner argues that this
legislative history supports its argument by demonstrating that the legislative
intent is for assistance in “coastal development permit processes” and is not
limited to assistance at a public hearing. 
The term “permit processes” includes the application processing and
forms and information required to be submitted prior to the Commission hearing
on a CDP.  Nothing in the legislative
history of section 30335.1 indicates a legislative intent to limit the scope of
its prohibition in the manner the Commission suggests.  Reply at 6.
The converse is true.  The fact that the legislative intent for
section 30335.1 is to enable interested parties to receive staff assistance in
CDP processes does not undermine the Commission’s interpretation, which allows
staff to give advice during the entire CDP process except at the public hearing
where staff is limited to advising about procedure.  If Petitioner’s interpretation were adopted,
an applicant or other interested party could not receive any substantive staff
advice before the hearing.  This would be
inconsistent with the legislative history directing staff assistance in the CDP
“process”.
 
f. The Commission’s
Interpretation Is Entitled to Great Deference
At the de novo hearing, the
Commission’s General Counsel stated that section 30335.1 “only applies to the
Staff that is at Commission meetings for matters which are before the
Commission for action.  So[,] I wanted to
clarify that there’s nothing improper about Staff meeting with the applicant.”  AR 878. 
See 14 CCR §13034 (“The Chief Counsel of the California Coastal
Commission shall be the regulatory ombudsperson for the California Coastal
Commission.”).  The General Counsel’s
comment is consistent with the Commission’s interpretation in its opposition.
If a statute is unambiguous, an
agency's interpretation is entitled to no deference.  Bonnell v. Medical Board, (2003) 31
Cal. 4th 1255, 1265.  But for an
ambiguous statute, California law affords "great weight" to the
Commission's interpretation of the Coastal Act and its regulations, given its
special familiarity with these legal issues. Ross v. California Coastal Com.,
supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at 922-23. 
The court's review is "quite limited, and the Commission is
"given substantial deference." 
Evans v. City of San Jose, (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1145-46.
The court must give great weight
to the Commission’s interpretation of section 30335.1.  Petitioner argues that the Commission’s
interpretation of section 30335.1 is not entitled to deference because it is a
procedural statute, which is arguably less within the Commission’s particular
area of expertise.  See Yamaha
Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, (“Yamaha”) (1998) 19
Cal. 4th 1, 11, 12.  Reply at 2.  This argument is unsupported.  An agency may interpret its governing
statutes, procedural or substantive, and Yamaha does not suggest that
the Commission’s interpretation of a procedural statute is entitled to less
deference.
The Commission cites Coronado Yacht Club v. California
Coastal Com., (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 860, 871, in connection with another
issue -- the difference between a substantial issue and a de novo
appeal.  Opp. at 13.  In Coronado, the court agreed with the
Commission’s interpretation of section 30621 to require an appeal hearing
within 49 days to mean only the substantial issue hearing, not the de novo
appeal hearing.  Id. at 866-67,
872-73.
Petitioner argues that Coronado focuses on whether
the Coastal Act takes precedence over various housing density statutes and is
factually and legally distinguishable.  The
court upheld the Commission’s interpretation of section 30621 because it “advance[es]…an
interpretation more consistent with the cited legislative intent to avoid
bureaucratic delay and expedite the administrative process so as to obtain
finality.”  Id. at 871.  In contrast, the Commission’s reading of section
30335.1 would negate the legislative intent of preserving the public’s trust in
the Commission as an unbiased arbiter of quasi-judicial decisions affecting the
coastal zone.  See §30320
(Commission shall conduct its affairs in open, objective, and impartial manner).
 Reply at 5-6.
Plainly, Coronado is not on point.  Yet, it shows that the courts will uphold the
Commission’s statutory interpretation where appropriate to advance the
expedited review process to obtain finality. 
Expedited review would not be available under Petitioner’s
interpretation of section 30335.1.
 
g. Conclusion
While section 30335.1 does not have a plain meaning and is
ambiguous, the statutory scheme, the purpose of section 30335.1, the
legislative intent, and the great deference required for the Commission’s
interpretation all support the conclusion that the limitation on staff
communication with applicants only applies when the Commission considers the
matter at a public hearing.  The
Commission did not violate section 30335.1 when its staff communicated with the
Applicants to revise the Project before the de novo appeal hearing.[8]
 
2. Petitioner and the Public Received a Fair Hearing
In arguing that the public did not receive a fair hearing, Petitioner
relies on the due process requirement of “the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful
time and in a meaningful manner.'"  People v. Zuniga, (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th
81, 84.  Whether a process is fair is
determined in part by whether prehearing procedures are followed, not just the
process during the hearing.  See
§30320(b) (recognizing need for public participation either before or during the
public hearing before the Commission).  Petitioner
argues that, by the time it and the public received notice of the de novo
staff report, the decision regarding whether the Project conforms to Chapter 3
and the Venice LUP had already been deliberated behind closed doors.  At that point, no notice would cure the
procedural defect.  Reply at 7.
Petitioner argues that the Commission’s violation of section
30335.1 resulted in less protection for the coastal zone because staff telegraphed
to the developer how the Project might be changed in order to get a positive staff
recommendation for the de novo hearing.  Had the law been followed, the Applicants would
have had the incentive to bring its Project into compliance with the Commission’s
substantial issue determination.  Instead,
once staff felt it could not get any more than a token concession, it drafted a
staff report recommending Project approval based on the compromise design
change.  AR 877 (noting that Applicants made
as many changes as staff believed they were willing to make).  Prejudice can be demonstrated also by the
fact that the staff report’s proposed findings and recommendations were not
neutral and objective.  Reply at 7-8.
As stated ante, section 30335.1 was not violated.  Petitioner and the public also received a
fair hearing.  The Commission staff
reports must be distributed within a reasonable time to assure adequate
notification prior to the scheduled public hearing.  14 CCR §13059;
see Ross v. California Coastal Comm., supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at 936 (13 days'
notice was a “reasonable time for review and comment by other public agencies
and the general public” under the California
Environmental Quality Act).  The Commission usually distributes staff
reports at least ten days before the relevant meeting or hearing. California Coastal Commission, Meetings: Rules & Procedures,
(as of December 21, 2023) https://coastal.ca.gov/meetings/rules-procedures/.
 In this case, the Commission issued the
staff report 14 days prior to the de novo hearing.
The Coastal Act requires
that “all members of the public [be] given an adequate opportunity to present
their views and opinions to the Commission through written or oral
communications either before or during the public hearing on any matter before
the commission.”  §30320(b).  The July 28, 2022 staff report described the Applicants’
modified Project. Petitioner provided comments to the July 28, 2022 staff
report on August 5, 2022, expressing remaining concern over the Project’s size
but noting that the “proposed added articulation is a step in the right
direction.”  AR 718.   Commission staff addressed Petitioner’s comments
in the Addendum issued on August 9, 2022,
two days before the hearing. AR
813.
Petitioner’s representatives met with two Commissioners before
the hearing, on August 5 and August 8, 2022, respectively.  AR 831,
833.  At those meetings, Petitioner
expressed concerns over the Project, the size of the building, the character of
the community, and frustration that the LCP has not been completed by the City.
AR 833. Petitioner’s representatives and
members also testified at the de novo hearing.  AR 856,
869-74.  
These facts show that both the public and Petitioner had
ample opportunity to participate and provide “views and opinions” to the
Commission about the Project.  §30320(b). 
Petitioner received a fair hearing. 

 
3. The Commission Did Not Make Inconsistent Findings
Petitioner argues that the Commission’s finding on de
novo appeal that the modified Project complies with the Venice LUP and
Chapter 3 policies is logically inconsistent
with its finding on the substantial issue appeal that the Project did not comply.  See Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th
1 at pp. 7, 12-13; City of San
Diego v. D.R. Horton San Diego Holding Co., Inc., (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 668, 682 (factfinder is not permitted
to “make inconsistent determinations of fact based on the same evidence.”).  As no logical explanation was given to
reconcile the two disparate conclusions based on the evidence in the
record, “a reasonable person could
not reach the conclusion reached
by” the Commission.  Lindstrom
v. California Coastal
Com., (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 73, 93.  Therefore,
the Commission’s findings
were arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the evidence.  La
Costa, supra 101 Cal. App.
4th at 814.  Moreover, the Commission’s
compatibility findings do not comply with the
standards articulated in Topanga, supra,  11 Cal. 3d at 506, because Petitioner, the public,
and the court
cannot easily discern
the Commission’s analytic
route it traveled from evidence to approval of a 2,795
square foot Project that earlier had been found to be inconsistent with the
Coastal Act and Venice
LUP due to its 2,795 square foot size.  See West Chandler Blvd.
Neighborhood Ass’n v. City of Los Angeles, (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1521- 22.  Pet. Op. Br. at 16-17.
This argument is
spurious.  There is no requirement
for the Commission to deny an applicant a CDP merely because it entered a
substantial issue finding. A substantial issue finding is a threshold
jurisdictional hurdle to be crossed before the de novo appeal is heard.  See
§30625(b)(1).  At a
substantial issue hearing, the Commission is inquiring whether a substantial
question is raised, but it is not necessarily entering a finding as to the
answer to the substantial question.  See
AR 485 (“The City’s decision …does raise questions…”); AR 468 (“[T]he proposed residence raises a substantial question as to whether…”)
(emphasis added).  The substantial
issue appeal is an initial review that does not bind the Commission after a
deeper inquiry is made on the de novo appeal.  A conclusion otherwise would undermine the
entire point of a de novo hearing.  As Real Party points out (RPI Opp. at 6-7),
the Commission could find that an appeal raises a substantial issue and then permissibly
approve the project upon de novo review without any project change or
additional evidence.  That did not happen
in this case as the Project was modified. 

Petitioner’s
argument that, pursuant to the requirements of Topanga, one cannot
follow how the Commission approved a 2,795 square foot Project that earlier had
been found to be inconsistent with the Coastal
Act and Venice LUP due to its 2,795 square foot size is belied by the Project
modifications.  The Commission granted
the substantial issue appeal based on “[t]he lack of articulation, as well as the home’s mass, if
implemented on future projects has the potential to adversely impact community
character.”  AR 484 (emphasis
added).  The Project approved at
the de novo hearing “is designed with an articulated façade to break
up the massing.” AR 14 (emphasis
added).  The second floor of the Project
was stepped back from the first-floor setback to reduce its mass.  Id. The Applicants modified their Project
to incorporate articulation and step backs found in nearby similar homes,
resulting in a project that conforms to Chapter
3 of the Coastal Act.  Opp. at 14-15; RPI
Opp. at 5-6.
 
4. The Findings Are
Supported by Substantial Evidence
At the de novo hearing,
the Commission reviews the Project for conformity with Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, using the
certified Venice LUP as guidance.  §30604(a); AR
478.
The relevant Chapter 3 provisions are sections 30250, 30251, and 30253.  Section
30250(a) requires that new development be located within existing developed
areas.  The Project is a residential home
to replace an existing residential home on a street with nearly two dozen
residential structures.  AR 9, 15, 22-23, 40.  Accordingly, the Project conforms to the
location requirement of section 30250.
Section
30253, in relevant part, requires that new development protect special
communities that “because of their unique characteristics” are popular visitor
destinations.  §30253(e).  The Commission has found that Venice is a
Special Coastal Community whose character, including its unique social and
architectural diversity protected by the Venice LUP, should be protected under section 30253(e).  AR 12.
Section
30251 in relevant part requires that the Project design be “visually compatible
with the character of surrounding areas.”  §30251.  The Venice LUP offers insight into what might
be considered visually compatible with the area. AR 11.  Venice LUP Policy I.A.6 restricts lots smaller
than 5,000 square feet to a maximum density of two units per lot.  AR 11,
614.  The Project complies with that
limit as it is for one unit on a 4,212 square foot lot.
Venice LUP Policy I.E.1 notes
that Venice’s “architectural diversity” should be protected.  Venice LUP Policy I.E.2 states new
development should respect the scale and character of the community and
encourages buildings “which are of a scale compatible with the community (with
respect to bulk, height, bugger and setback)”.  Venice LUP Policy I.E.3 encourages varied
architecture “with building facades which incorporate varied planes and
textures while maintaining the neighborhood scale and massing.”  AR 615-16.
 
The Commission’s decision that
the modified Project conforms to Chapter 3 policies and the Venice LUP must be
based on substantial evidence, which is relevant evidence that a reasonable
mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California Youth
Authority, supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at 585) or evidence of ponderable
legal significance, which is reasonable in nature, credible and of solid
value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, supra,
51 Cal.App.4th at 305, n.28.  The
Commission's decision may rely on any relevant evidence, regardless of its
admissibility in civil actions.  14 CCR
§13065.  The substantial evidence on
which the Commission may rely includes expert opinions, photographs, and
observations from Commissioners, Commission staff, and the public.  La Costa, supra, 101
Cal.App.4th at 819.  The court may not
reweigh the evidence, or disregard or overturn a finding simply because a
contrary finding would be more reasonable. 
Boreta Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control,
supra, 2 Cal.3d at 94.  The court
may only overturn the agency’s decision if a reasonable person could not have
reached the decision based on the evidence that the agency had before it.  Bolsa Chica Land Trust v. Superior Court,
supra, 71 Cal.App.4h at 503.
Petitioner challenges the size
of the Project.  The Venice LUP “was
designed to protect Venice’s unique character primarily through the use of objective
building standards and restrictions.” 
AR 13 (emphasis added).  The
Venice LUP offers objective standards on the size of a residence such as roof
height limits and roof access height limits.  AR
615-16.  The Project complies with all
specified objective requirements of the Venice LUP designed to limit the
maximum size of homes in the area.  
According to the de novo
staff report, the Project also “observes all setbacks, open space, and height
requirements of both the City of Los Angeles uncertified Zoning Code and the
certified Venice LUP.”  AR 9.  The Venice LUP does not provide setback
standards and instead requires yards to be consistent with the existing scale
and character of the neighborhood.  AR
13.  The Venice LUP “implies a focus on
objective measurements, such as bulk, height, buffer and setback, while also
allowing for a subjective assessment based on the surrounding ‘community
development.’”   AR 13, n. 3.  The Project’s front yard setback is 18-20
feet, consistent with the prevailing front yard setback of 18 feet in the area.
AR 13.  The Project’s side yard setbacks are four
feet, in compliance with the City’s minimum of three feet for lots less than 50
feet wide, and the Project lot is 32 feet wide. (AR 13, 473.) The Project’s rear yard setback
is 15 feet and in compliance with the City’s setback requirements.  AR 13.  Likewise, the roof pitches reach up to 29.5
feet in height, which is below the roof height limit of 30 feet and the roof
access structure reaches a maximum height of 33 feet, which is also consistent
with the limits set in the Venice LUP.  AR 14, 615-16. The Commission found that the
Project’s setbacks comply with the City’s setback requirements. AR 13-14.  
The Commission reviewed a survey
of the 26 lots on both sides of Angelus Place between Oakwood and Grandview
Avenues.  AR
13, 40.  While the Project would be the
largest single-family residence in the survey area, it would not be the largest
residential structure in the area.  AR 14, 22-23, 619-621, 721.  Nor would it be the only home with roof
access, as there are two other homes with roof decks in the area.  AR 14.  Finally, the Project would be one of six two-story
single-family residences in the survey area.  AR 14,
619-21.  All the two-story homes in the
area have stepped back façades or some other articulation.  All five of the other two-story homes in the
survey area have stepped back façades and the Project is likewise designed with
an articulated façade to break up the massing and four to six-feet step backs
for the second floor.  AR 14,
648, 769, 837-38.
There is substantial evidence to
support the Commission’s finding that the modified Project is “compatible with
the mass, scale and character” of existing development and complies with Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act because the
Project (a) would not be the largest residential building the area, (b) would
not be the only two-story residential building in the area, (c) would not be
the only home with roof access, (d) contains a stepped back second story similar
to the other two-story homes in the area, and (e) complies with all Venice LUP
and City setback and height restrictions.  AR 16.  
Petitioner disagrees.  At the public hearing, the Commission’s District Director for the South Central Coast
and South Coast,
Los Angeles County, only stated that Commission staff believed the Project
to be consistent with the Venice LUP:
 
“[S]taff does believe that, you know, in this case,
a 2,795 square foot home is not out of character with the area… staff has spent a considerable amount
of time working
with the applicant and the homeowner
to try to reach the changes,
[] that have been proposed today. And while of
course they could go further, [] in this case, I do believe that the applicant has made as many
changes as they're willing, [] to propose, and we had, I believe,
four meetings <laugh> and about four different, [] versions of these plans to get to this point. So I would just note
that, in this case, our decision of
staff is based on whether or not this project,
which I, I believe [] has been changed as much as the
applicant is going to do, is consistent with the LUP.” AR877 (emphasis
added).  Pet. Op. Br. at 112-13.
 
Petitioner contends that the Project revisions focused on the façade
of the residence, but the size, mass and
scale did not change.  Compare AR 648 (substantial issue appeal image) and AR 855 (de
novo appeal image). Articulation
is just one factor of neighborhood compatibility and is not
dispositive on the issue of
scale.  The Commission relied on an insignificant
change in façade articulation of the Project
to support its conclusion that the Project
is compatible with the
scale of the neighborhood,
but no reasonable person could reach
the same conclusion.  See La Costa, supra, 101 Cal.
App. 4th 804, 814.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 11, 17.
            According to Petitioner,
the de novo staff report and staff presentation offered no relevant
evidence how the façade articulation affects the pedestrian viewscape.  AR
1-17; 834-39.  There is
only one picture in the
record, submitted by the
Applicants, that shows a side view
of the revised Project from across the street, and it looks exactly like the image from the
staff’s substantial issue presentation.  AR
855, 648.  The administrative record
includes pictures from pedestrian walkways of the significant (40 foot) setbacks of other
houses.  AR 539-42.  Therefore, the Commission’s finding
on consistency with the viewscape of the neighborhood is not supported by substantial evidence.   Pet. Op. Br at 17.
The Commission emphasizes that
the Project fits into the maximum building envelope allowed, thereby equating
“maximum” with “compatible”.  This is a
false equivalence and skirts the main issue: the size of the Project originally
was 2,795 square feet and remains 2,795 square feet.  Size must be factored into whether the
Project complies with LUP Policy I.E.2 that it is “of a scale compatible with
the community (with respect to bulk, height, buffer and setback).”  AR 615-16.  The Commission does not address why bulk as a
factor in size and scale compatibility should be excluded from the analysis.  See §30212; AR 484 (substantial issue findings
note that Commission uses height, setback, and bulk to analyze mass and
scale compatibility).  Reply at 10-11.
            Petitioner criticizes
the Commission’s failure to address one-story homes in the survey area.  The Commission found that the modified Project is compatible with the survey
area because it is “larger than the
average but not the largest
structure in the survey area”, and “would be compatible with the other five two-story homes in the survey
area” due to “an articulated façade
to break up the massing.”  AR14.  While the substantial issue staff report properly
made a direct comparison of the Project’s scale to the scale of all houses in the survey area (21
one-story and five two-story homes), the de novo staff report omitted a direct
comparison to one-story homes.  See AR13-15.
 The five two-story homes compared to the
modified Project were significantly smaller in scale, except for one multi-family
duplex.  AR22-23.  The Project
is 24% larger than the average
of the six largest developments in the neighborhood
(AR 14, n. 8; AR 22-23) and over 31% larger than the largest single-family house in the survey
area.  AR 14,
n. 7. 
Given these numbers,
no reasonable person could conclude
that the Project’s
mass and scale are compatible with the survey area regardless of the slight
façade articulation. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 17-18; Reply at 10-11.
            In straining to justify a finding
of compatibility, the de novo staff report cherry-picked the term “architectural diversity” as the
characteristic that makes “Venice a special coastal
community” and found
that the Project “contributes to this diversity.”  AR 16-17.
 The Commission’s finding is in stark
contrast with its prior correct interpretation of LUP Policy
I.E.3 in the substantial issue report that “varied
styles of architecture are encouraged...while maintaining the neighborhood scale
and massing”.  AR 473 (emphasis added).  The Commission did not explain how it could find
that the mass and scale of the Project violated
LUP I.E.2 on the one hand, and
then find the opposite based on
architectural diversity, which
is a wholly separate
matter.  AR 16-17.  See California Hotel & Motel
assn.v Industrial Welfare Comm.,
(1979) 25 Cal. 3d 200,
212 (agency must consider all relevant factors and demonstrate a
rational connection between them).  Pet.
Op. Br. at 18.
            Moreover, while the substantial
issue staff report relied on Venice LUP policies I.E2 and I.E3, which require a project to be consistent with the mass and scale of the existing structures in the
neighborhood, the de novo report inexplicably relied on the
City’s yard setback
ordinance for the
community character findings.  AR 13.  Chapter 3 and
the Venice LUP specifically require a project to be compatible with the existing
neighborhood, and this compatibility
is not per se achieved by compliance with the City’s yard
setback requirements.  AR 473, 483.  The City’s
yard setback requirements are not dispositive on compatibility
because (1) they are not yet certified as the standard for measuring impacts
under Chapter 3 and (2) the
Venice LUP Policy I.E.2 specifically
differentiates between
“scale” and “landscape.”  AR 473.  Neither the Commission’s findings nor
its opposition explain how the Commission could rely on an uncertified city
code as the standard of review.  Pet. Op. Br. at 19; Reply at 11.
As Real Parties argue (RPI Opp.
at 9-10), Petitioner does not contend that the Project violates any objective standard
in the Venice LUP.  Instead, Petitioner
contends that the Project violates the subjective standard in Venice LUP Policy
I.E.2 encouraging buildings “which are of a scale compatible with the community
(with respect to bulk, height, buffer, and setback)”.  But Petitioner ignores the following facts: (a)
the Venice LUP was designed to protect Venice’s unique character primarily
through objective building standards and restrictions (AR 13); (b) Venice
LUP Policy I.E.2 provides that “[b]uildings which are of a scale compatible
with the community (with respect to bulk, height, buffer and setback) shall be encouraged”
(AR 13), and the word “encouraged” does not mean “required”, and (c) the
Commission’s subjective decision on compatibility need only be based on
substantial evidence.  
These facts make all the
difference.  As Real Party contends, the
Commission had broad discretion to find that the Project complies with the
subjective standards of the Venice LUP and Chapter 3 policies.  RPI Opp. at 10.  That Petitioner may have subjective evidence
to the contrary does not bear on the issue. 
Both parties can have subjective evidence supporting their position and,
if so, the Commission’s decision must be upheld.  The court may not reweigh the evidence, or
disregard or overturn a finding simply because a contrary finding would be more
reasonable.  Boreta Enterprises, Inc.
v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, supra, 2 Cal.3d at 94.[9]
Real Parties point out that Petitioner
is essentially arguing that scale and character should be reduced to an average
square footage on a residential block, and therefore the Project is not
compatible with its residential neighborhood because it is larger than the average.  Real Parties underscore that the terms “scale
and character” are discretionary and Venice LUP Policy I.E.2 only requires that
buildings of a scale compatible with the community (with respect to bulk,
height, buffer and setback) shall be encouraged.”  The terms “scale and character” and “bulk,
height, buffer and setback” cannot be reduced to the average size standard
posited by Petitioner.  RPI Opp. at
10-11.[10]
Petitioner only weakly replies that Real Parties provides
no authority that LUP Policy I.E.2’s mandatory language is discretionary as it provides
that new development “shall respect the scale and character of community
development”, and the word “shall” is mandatory.  AR 615. 
Reply at 15.  The language of LUP
Policy I.E.2 quoted by Petitioner is qualified by the next sentence concerning the
“encouragement” of buildings compatible in bulk, height, buffer, and setback,
which most certainly is discretionary.
Real Parties correctly rely (RPI
Opp. at 11-12) on Pacific Palisades Residents Assn., Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles, (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th 1338, where a group of neighbors contested a
project’s architectural compatibility and views in the Pacific Palisades.  Id. at 1367.  The court upheld the Commission’s finding of
no substantial issue in connection with a proposed development of an
ocean-viewing lot that was 45 feet high (and one story higher than any nearby
structure).  Id. at 1368.  The petitioner claimed that the “size,
design, and mass of the building are completely divorced from the character of
the community’s buildings and uses.”  Ibid.
 The court stated: “This argument for
mandatory architectural uniformity misapplies the substantial evidence standard
of review….Elected officials have latitude to weigh competing and subjective
notions of beauty and blight. Our judicial role in this setting is to defer to
their judgment when, as here, substantial evidence supports it.”  Ibid. 
The same is true for the modified Project.[11]
Substantial evidence supports
the Commission’s decision that the modified Project is compatible with the character
of the surrounding areas and complies with Chapter 3 policies and the Venice
LUP.  AR 13-14.
 
5. Cumulative Impacts
The Coastal Act requires the Commission to consider a proposed project's cumulative effects in light of other present,
past, and probable future developments.  §30105.5; Greene v. California Coastal Com., (2019) 40 Cal. App. 5th 1227, 1234. 
The de novo staff report weighed the cumulative
impacts of the Project and explained its rationale.  AR 15-17. 
In analyzing cumulative impacts, the Commission looks both at historical
data and potential future development in the area.  AR 15. 
The Commission staff reviewed over two dozen lots in the survey area and
noted: (1) the Commission has not entered a final decision on any CDP
applications for projects on Angelus Place since 2001; (2)  the City has approved size increases of four
residential structures “with total sizes ranging from 1,570 square feet to
2,323 square feet”; (3) the City approved two new residential structures at a
square footage of 2,795 square feet and 3,437 square feet; 21 residential
structures ranged in size from 768 square feet to a duplex of 2,937 square feet,
and one duplex larger than the Project; and (4) development in the area is
occurring at a slower pace than other areas of Venice.  AR 15. 

With regard to future development, there are two other
residential homes currently proposed on Angelus Place: a two-story 3,437 square
foot home and a two-story 2,660 square foot single-family home.  AR 16. 
Recent actions demonstrate that homes larger than the existing older
homes will continue to be proposed in the area. 
AR 16.  Even so the Project would
not set a precedent for overall size of future development.  The variation and articulation to the Project
façade will prevent the size and massing from causing a significant adverse
cumulative effect on the surrounding development and Venice as a Special
Coastal Community.  AR 16.  
The Venice LUP recognizes there will be development of larger
homes over time, and that such development is cabined by building standards,
lot setbacks, lot size, and limits on rooftop decks, all designed to protect
Venice’s character.  AR 16.  The Project is consistent with these
standards and is unlikely to contribute to any adverse cumulative effects on
community character, mass, and scale, and visual resources of the area.  AR 16-17. 

Petitioner argues that the Commission’s cumulative impacts found
that the Project would be
larger than many homes in the survey
area, and that recent and future
projects would continue to be larger, and yet
inexplicably concluded: “Even so, the [Project] would not set a new precedent in terms of overall
size of existing
residential structures…and potential future
development.” AR 16.  This conclusory finding was not tethered to any
evidence or rationale as required by Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at 515.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 19.
Moreover,
the finding of no “significant adverse cumulative effect” concerning the modified Project’s
scale was based
on its articulation.  AR 16. This was an abuse of discretion.
When the Commission approves
an out-of-scale project
inconsistent with the Coastal Act, the approval
can have adverse
impacts because the City will base future permitting decisions on prior Commission decisions. §30625(c).  The total square
footage (not
articulation) will be used to justify others
similar in size.  AR 473 (project
size would prejudice the City’s ability to prepare an
LCP). The Commission’s reliance on minor
articulation changes is not substantial evidence, which must be either evidence
of “ponderable legal significance…reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid
value” or “relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
support a conclusion.”  County of San
Diego v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 2, (1983) 148 Cal. App. 3d 548, 558.  The Commission’s reliance on an irrelevant
aspect (articulation) of the Project to evaluate the precedential impact of
size on future Venice CDP decisions was an abuse of discretion.  Pet. Op. 
Br. at 19-20; Reply at 12.
The Commission properly considered
the Project’s cumulative impacts.  AR 15-17.  The Commission looked at historical data and considered
potential future development in the area.  AR 15.  The Commission reasonably concluded that the
Project would not be setting any new precedent in the survey area (AR 16) because “new modern homes” (larger
homes) are anticipated in the Venice LUP (AR
13), because there have already been increases to home sizes in the area (AR 15), and because the Project would not be
the largest structure in the survey area (AR
23).
Petitioner’s argument that scale (square footage), not
articulation, will be the sole issue for approval of future projects is
unsupported by legal authority.  In
contrast, the de novo staff report expressly noted that variation and
articulation to the Project façade will prevent the size and massing from
causing a significant adverse cumulative effect on the surrounding development
and Venice as a Special Coastal Community. 
AR 16.  The staff report also found
that the size and massing of the Project would not cause significant adverse
cumulative impacts because there are existing large structures in the area.  AR 16.   The report
further noted that the size of newer and larger homes in the area would be
limited due to the small lot sizes in typical Venice neighborhoods (AR 13) and the Venice LUP’s prohibition on
merging lots (AR 12).
In reply, Petitioner argues that the fact that there are
more modern homes (larger homes) only demonstrates the potential cumulative effects
of approving another out-of-scale development. Simply pointing to a regulatory
policy such as the LUP’s lot size and lot consolidation limitations is not
evidence that there will be no cumulative impacts.  The Commission’s findings do not point to any
evidence that smaller lot size is an adequate restriction preventing future
impacts due to out-of-scale developments.  In fact, this assertion is contradicted by the
Commission opposition’s assertion that larger homes are being approved.  City of San Diego v. D.R. Horton San Diego
Holding Co., Inc., (2005) 126 Cal. App. 4th 668, 681 (“findings must be
internally consistent and logical”).  Reply
at 12-13.
Not so.  Small lot size and a prohibition on merged
lots is an obvious limitation on home size. 
The fact that larger homes are being approved than currently exist on
these small lots does not contradict the fact that there is an inherent size
limitation.  Petitioner also ignores the
Commission’s findings of existing large structures in the area and the requirement
of articulation.
Petitioner further argues that the Commission’s finding of no adverse cumulative impacts erroneously relied
on the de novo staff report’s statement that “[r]ecent Commission hearings on Venice
projects reveal an ongoing dialogue
as to whether compliance with the Venice LUP is an
adequate measure of a project’s
consistency with community character.”[12] AR 16-17.  The Commission’s disregard of the Chapter 3
requirements and LUP policies that lawfully guide the Commission’s findings
for the substantial issue
appeal was an abuse
of discretion.  See City of
Chula Vista v. Superior Court, (1982)
133 Cal.App.3d 472, 481 (the
Commission does not have the authority to change the LUP once it
has been approved except
under certain circumstances.  As such, the Commission failed to conduct a proper cumulative impacts analysis.  Pet. Op. Br. at 20. 
The de novo staff report
and staff comment at the de novo hearing have no bearing on the
analysis.  Commission staff apparently was
expressing frustration with the City’s lack of a certified LCP and/or a need to
update the LUP.  There is no suggestion in
these comments that staff ignored the existing Venice LUP and its requirements.
 
F. Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
The Commission’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment,
serve it on other counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service
for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit
the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for May 16, 2024
at 9:30 a.m.
