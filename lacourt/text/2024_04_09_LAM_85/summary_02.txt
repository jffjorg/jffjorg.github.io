And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute between Real Parties and Petitioner regarding the approval of a development project. Real Parties claim that the Commission's staff gave advice on how to make the project comply with Coastal Act policies. Petitioner objects to the judicial notice of several documents, but the judge overrules the objection for Exhibits A-D. The judge finds that the Commission's reference to local government is a red herring and that staff communication is not part of the Commission's holding. The judge also concludes that the Special Condition in the project approval is unenforceable. The judge rules that the Commission's decision is based on substantial evidence and that the project complies with the Coastal Act.
