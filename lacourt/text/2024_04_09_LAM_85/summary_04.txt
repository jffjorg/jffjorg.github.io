Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant Alex Myung Cha to the first cause of action is overruled. The judge finds that Plaintiffs have alleged fraud in the election of directors, including misrepresentations made by Moo Han Bae about the payment of director fees by Defendants. The judge concludes that the fraud exception in Corporations Code section 5527 applies, exempting Plaintiffs from the nine-month statute of limitations. The judge also finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded fraud in the election of directors, which is required for the fraud exception to apply. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and Defendant Cha has 10 days to answer the complaint.
