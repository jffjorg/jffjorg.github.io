Chester P. Kim, et al. v.
Alex Myung Cha, et al., 24STCV02973


Tentative decision on demurrer:
overruled 



 
            
Defendant Alex Myung Cha (“Cha”) demurs to the first cause
of action of the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by Plaintiffs Chester P.
Kim (“Kim”), Howard Park (“Park”), and Al Ilsoon Choe (“Choe”).  
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. The Petition
            Plaintiffs
filed the Complaint on February 5, 2024. 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the FAC, which is the operative pleading.  The FAC is made against Defendants Cha, Young
Nae Lee, aka Brandon Lee (“Lee”), Benedict J. Pak (“Pak”), and Los Angeles
Korean Festival Foundation (“Foundation”), a California corporation, as a
nominal Defendant.  Plaintiffs moved for
declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of Corporations Code section
5527 for (1) the election of Cha, Lee, and Pak as directors, (2) the election
of Cha as Chairperson of the Board, and (3) the expulsion of Kim, Park, and Choe
as directors. 
 
            a.
Factual Allegations 
            The
Foundation is a California, non-profit public benefit corporation which was
founded in 1974 and later incorporated under the name LAHKFF CORP on August 13,
1999.  FAC, ¶1.  On February 20, 2008, its name was changed to
its current title of “Los Angeles Korean Festival Foundation”.  Id. 
The Foundation works year-round in organizing a four-day festival
(“Festival”) that carries out the mission of providing the community with a
festival that is an instrument of inclusivity, advocating cultural diversity by
celebrating not only Korean cultural heritage but also that of numerous ethnic
groups residing in Los Angeles.  FAC ¶
10. 
            On
March 23, 2021, the Foundation’s Board of Directors (“Board”) consisted of Moo
Han Bae (“Bae”), Kim, Park, and Choe. 
FAC, ¶22.  The Foundation has no
members outside of its directors.  Id.
 On March 23, 2021, the Board amended and
adopted the current Bylaws(“Bylaws”) that governed the events giving rise to the
Complaint.  Id.  
            The
Festival of 2022 was held in September of 2022. 
FAC, ¶26.  Pursuant to Article 5,
Section 17 and the power it vested in the Board to deliberate finances, the
report of the Festival’s finances was typically made at the regular Board
meeting in December of each year.  FAC,
¶¶25-26.  Hence, the financial report,
along with the CPA’s report, was supposed to be made at the December 2022 Board
meeting.  FAC, ¶26.  In 2022, Bae was chairperson and Kim was
auditor.  FAC, ¶26.  Prior to the December 2022 Board meeting,
Plaintiffs demanded that Bae produce the financial reports.  FAC, ¶26. 
Bae never produced the requested financial documents concerning the 49th
Festival.  Id.  Plaintiffs subsequently continued to request
the financial reports.  FAC, ¶27.
            During
the Board meeting on January 23, 2023, Bae suggested making three individuals (Defendants)
additional directors on the Board.  FAC,
¶29.  One of the qualifications necessary
to be elected as a director on the Board was “a person who has paid $10,000 in
director fees to the Foundation.  Id.  At said Board meeting, Bae, Kim, and Choe
were present, but Park was absent due to a scheduling conflict.  FAC, ¶30. 
During the discussions about electing Defendants to the Board, Bae
represented to Plaintiffs that each individual Defendant had fulfilled the
prerequisite $10,000 director fee payment to the Foundation.  FAC, ¶30. 
In reliance on Bae’s misrepresentation, Kim and Choe voted for the
election of Defendants to the Board.  Id.  
            On
July 25, 2023, the Board learned that Defendants had not made their
prerequisite payments.  FAC, ¶31.  Bae explained to the Board that he had “generously
allowed” Defendants to pay an initial $5000 and then the remaining $5,000 would
be paid in full before the upcoming September 2023 festival.  Id. 
Yet, pursuant to Article 5, Section 13 (Qualification of Directors), Bae
did not have the authority to override the Bylaws’ qualification of
directors.  FAC, ¶32.  Thus, Defendants’ election to the Board was both
fraudulent and invalid.  Id. 
            On
September 18, 2023, Plaintiffs, as directors of the Foundation, filed a complaint
with the California Attorney General against Bae.  FAC, ¶33. 
This complaint was filed in response to Bae’s continued refusal to
produce financial documents relating to the 49th festival in violation of
Article 7 (Financial Discal Year), Section 21 (Fiscal Year) of the Bylaws.  FAC, ¶33.  On September 25, 2023, Plaintiffs received
written acknowledgment of the complaint from the Department of Justice.  FAC, ¶34. 

At an October 19, 2023 Board meeting, Plaintiffs demanded
the financial documents for the 50th Festival which had taken place earlier
that month.  FAC, ¶¶36-37.  Plaintiffs objected to the validity of
Defendants as directors and questioned if they had paid the remaining $5,000
prior to the October 2023 festival, as Bae previously had represented they
would.  FAC, ¶38.  In response, each Defendant wrote a $5,000
check during the meeting.  Id.  Tension at the Board meeting escalated as
Plaintiffs maintained the invalidity of Defendants’ election as directors.  Id. 

The October 2023 Board meeting adjourned and was reconvened
on December 20, 2023.  FAC, ¶41.  At this meeting, Plaintiffs maintained their
position about Defendants’ director status and Bae questioned Plaintiffs why
the September 2023 Attorney General complaint was filed against him.  FAC, ¶42. 

The December 2023 Board meeting adjourned and was
subsequently reconvened on January 3, 2023. 
FAC, ¶44.  There were four written
items on agenda (1) the 2023 festival settlement audit; (2) preparation for the
2024 festival; (3) election of the Board chairperson; and (4) explanation of
JoonAng Ilbo newspaper articles relating to the Attorney General complaint. 
When it came time to elect a new chairperson, Defendants
elected Cha.  FAC, ¶47.  Plaintiffs voted against the election of Cha
and subsequently maintained that his election as chairperson was invalid.  FAC, ¶48. 
Following the election of Cha, Defendants then moved for the
expulsion of Plaintiffs Kim, Park, and Al from their respective positions and status
as directors.  FAC, ¶50.  The Bylaws have no provision excluding Board
members from voting on the expulsion of a director.  FAC, ¶51. 
On January 12, 2024, just over a week after the January 2,
2024 Board meeting, an updated Statement of Information of the Foundation was
filed, declaring Cha as the chief executive officer, Brandon as the secretary,
Benedict as the chief financial officer, and Bae as a Board member.  FAC, ¶56. 
            
            b.
Causes of Action
            The
FAC alleges three causes of action under Section 5527, seeking a judicial
determination as to (1) the validity of the election or appointment of
Defendants Cha, Lee, and Pak as directors of the Foundation; (2) the validity
of the election of Defendant Cha as the chairperson of the Board at the January
3, 2024 board meeting; and (3) the validity of the expulsion and removal of
Plaintiffs as directors at the January 3, 2023 boarding meeting. 
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
February 26, 2024, Defendant Cha filed his demurrer.
            On
March 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition. 
 
B. Applicable Law
            Demurrers
are permitted in administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§1108, 1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleading alone and will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its
face.
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP §430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels,
(1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party against
whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by demurrer or
answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is timely filed within the 30-day
period after service of the complaint. 
CCP § 430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1353, 1364.
            A
demurrer may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The
court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the
pleading; (b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to
sue; (c) There is another action pending between the same parties on the same
cause of action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The
pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f)
The pleading is uncertain (“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible);
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the
pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct;
(h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP §411.35 or (i) by §411.36.  CCP §430.10. 
Accordingly, a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters.  CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face of the pleading includes attachments
and incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d
904, 914.  
            The
sole issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the
facts pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v. Superior Court, (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326,
339.  The question of plaintiff’s ability
to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible difficulty in making
such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher,
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates,
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.
            For
all demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
CCP §430.31(a).  As part of the
meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the specific
causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide legal
support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The party who filed the pleading must in turn
provide legal support for its position that the pleading is legally sufficient
or, in the alternative, how the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be
amended to cure any legal insufficiency. 
Id.  The demurring party is
responsible for filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer
requirement has been met.  CCP
§430.31(a)(3).  
 
            C.
Analysis
            Defendant Cha
demurs to the FAP’s first cause of action on two separate grounds: (1) the FAC
is barred by the nine-month statute of limitations set forth in Corporations
Code section 5527 (“section 5527”) and (2) the cause of action is uncertain,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.010(f).  He contends that the
fraud exception in section 5527 is inapplicable because Plaintiffs did not
allege fraud with sufficient particularity.  Dem. at 3. 
Cha does not demur to
the FAC’s remaining causes of action, and no other Defendant joins his
demurrer.[1]
 
            1. Meet and
Confer
            On
February 22, 2024, Defendant Cha emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel of record inviting
him to telephonically meet and confer regarding Plaintiff’s FAC.  Dem., Ex. A. 
Cha stated his intention to file a demurrer with respect to the first
cause of action for the lack of specificity as pled with the allegations of
fraud connected to the validity of the election.  Id. 
Cha and Plaintiffs’ counsel exchanged email correspondence until Friday,
February 23, 2024 when it became clear no agreement would be reached. Id.
 
Cha satisfied his
meet and confer obligation under CCP section 430.41.
 
            2.
Merits
             Under Corporations Code Section 5527,
an action challenging the validity of an election, appointment, or removal of a
director or directors must be commended within nine months after the election,
appointment, or removal.  If no such
action is commenced, in the absence of fraud, any election, appointment, or
removal of a director is conclusively presumed valid nine months
thereafter.  Corp. Code, § 5527. 
Defendant Cha’s argument that the first
cause of action is time-barred against him relies on an argument that
Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a claim for fraud that exempts them from
the nine-month statute of limitations. 
Dem. at 5-6.  Cha reasons that
Plaintiffs cannot rely on the fraud exception because they have not, and cannot,
allege fraud with the requisite facts. 
Dem. at 6.  Cha sets forth the
elements of a fraud claim and cites to the California Supreme Court on the need
to plead fraud with specificity: “Accordingly, the rule is everywhere followed
that fraud must be specifically pleaded . . . the policy of liberal
construction of the pleadings . . . will not be ordinarily invoked to sustain a
pleading defective any material respect.” 
Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.,
(1983) 35 Cal. 3d 197, 216.  
As Plaintiffs respond, they are not
alleging a fraud cause of action.  Opp.
at 5-6.  Instead, Plaintiffs are claiming
that the statutory assumption in section 5527 that the election of Defendants
as directors is presumed valid does not apply because they have alleged fraud
in the election itself.  Id.  
Cha cites no authority that the
elements of a fraud cause of action must be pled to qualify for section 5527’s
fraud exception.  Nevertheless, although
Cha argues otherwise (Reply at 3), Plaintiffs have specifically alleged fraud resulting
in the election of Defendants.  The FAP alleges
that that Bae misrepresented at a special board meeting on January 23, 2023 that
Defendants each had made the prerequisite payment of the $10,000 director fee
to the Foundation.  Plaintiffs relied on
this misrepresentation in voting to appoint Defendants as directors and did not
discover that a misrepresentation had been made until the July 25, 2023 Board
meeting.  These allegations are
sufficient to show that section 5527’s fraud exception applies.
Cha points out that Plaintiffs fail to
allege any misrepresentation made by him. 
Reply at 3.  The answer is that
section 5527’s fraud exception does not require fraud by the prospective
director; it only requires fraud in the election of directors, regardless of
who made the misrepresentation.[2]

Cha argues that Plaintiffs cannot rely
on the discovery rule because the FAC discloses sufficient facts for them to be
suspicious of Bae’s handling of the Foundation’s finances as early as December
2022 when he refused multiple requests to disclose the Foundation’s financial
report for the previous Festival.  FAC ¶¶
26-27.  Under the delayed discovery rule,
Plaintiffs had a duty to investigate.  Doe
v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Sacramento, (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th
1423, 1432.  Reply at 4-5.  
The problem with Cha’s argument is that
there is no direct connection between Bae’s representation that Defendants had
paid $10,000 to the Foundation and his refusal to provide the Foundation’s
financial report for the previous Festival. 
There is no reason to believe that the financial report for the Festival
would have disclosed Defendants’ failure to pay the Foundation $10,000 each.  Bae’s refusal to provide the report at the December
2022 Board meeting does not necessarily create a suspicion about his representation
about Cha’s payment. 
 
            E. Conclusion
            The demurrer to the
Petition is overruled.  Defendant Cha has
ten days to answer only.
