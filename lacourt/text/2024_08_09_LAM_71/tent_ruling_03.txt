 Case No.: 
  23STCV19826
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  August 9, 2024



 
Defendant
Jackie Bunao’s motion to set aside the entry of default on October 5, 2023, and
default judgment entered on April 26, 2024, is granted.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant Jackie Bunao’s counsel, Onica Valle, is
granted in the amount of $1,000, payable to Plaintiff within 20 days.
 
Defendant
Jackie Bunao (“Jackie”) (“Defendant”) moves for this Court to set aside the
default judgment entered by the clerk on October 5, 2023, on the grounds that
Defendant was served the Summons and Complaint, but her counsel failed to
respond on her behalf due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§473,
128(a)(8), 1005; CRC, Rule 3.1300(b).)
 
Background
          On August 18, 2023, Plaintiff 1200
Management LLC (“1200 Management”) (“Plaintiff”) filed its operative Complaint
against Non-moving Defendant Alan Bunao (“Alan”) and Jackie (collectively,
“Defendants”) alleging a single cause of action for recovery of COVID-19 rental
debt as defined under C.C.P. §1179.02.  (See
Complaint.)
          On October 5, 2023, Entry of Default
was entered against Jackie.  On April 26,
2024, Default Judgment was entered against Defendants in the amount of $62,346.98.
On April
26, 2024, Jackie filed the instant motion. 
Defendant filed its opposition on July 25, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Motion to Vacate/Set Aside Dismissal
The
law favors judgments on the merits. Thus, on a motion for relief from default,
“doubts must be resolved in favor of relief, with an order denying
relief scrutinized [on appeal] more carefully than an order granting it.”  (Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th
127, 134.)
The
trial court has broad discretion to vacate the judgment and/or the clerk’s
entry of default that preceded it.  However,
that discretion can be exercised only if the moving party establishes a proper
ground for relief, by the proper procedure, and within the proper time limits.  (See Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)
The
court is empowered to relieve a party or his legal representative “upon any
terms as may be just . . . from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (C.C.P.
§473(b).)
C.C.P.
§473(b) consists of two distinct parts: “a discretionary provision, which
applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies as of right.” (Minick
v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25-26; Bailey v. Citibank,
N.A. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 335, 348.)
The
reference to “judgment . . .  order or
other proceedings” allows relief both from default judgments and from the entry
of default that preceded it. It also includes any step taken in a case,
whether by the court or by one of the parties: “Anything done from the
commencement to the termination is a proceeding.” (Zellerino v. Brown
(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1105.)
“[W]henever
an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of
judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect, [the court shall] vacate any . . . resulting default entered by the clerk
against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)  The court must
set aside the default “unless the court finds that the default . . .  was not in fact caused by the attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (Id.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares, “[d]ue to the high case load I had at the time and some
issues with staffing, the filing of Defendant’s Answer slipped through the
cracks. I admit this mistake and take full responsibility. This mistake harmed
the Defendant and I request that the Court to accept the Answer pursuant to CCP
Section 473.”  (Decl. of Cole ¶3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel properly submitted an
attorney affidavit of fault, for which relief is mandatory.  (C.C.P. §473(b).)  Plaintiff’s counsel properly submitted an
answer on behalf of Jackie,[1] which,
complies with the procedures in C.C.P. §473(b).
Plaintiff
argues in opposition that Defendant’s counsel’s conduct does not meet the
definition of “excusable neglect,” citing to Graham v. Beers (1994) 30
Cal.App.4th 1656, 1660, and therefore the mandatory provision of C.C.P. §473(b)
does not apply.  However, in Graham v.
Beers, defense counsel conceded he made a conscious decision not to
prosecute the case at issue.  (Id.)  Here, unlike in Graham, Defendant’s
counsel declares that her failure to file Jackie’s Answer was due to a mistake
exacerbated by staffing issues and a high case load.  (Decl. of Cole ¶3.)  The Court does not condone Defendant’s
counsel’s mismanagement of her case load, however, the failure to file the
answer is the result of inadvertence rather than excusable neglect, which is
subject to mandatory relief under C.C.P. §473(b). 
Plaintiff
argues it will be prejudiced if relief is granted because Plaintiff has
scheduled judgment debtor exams and is in the process of collecting on the
judgment, but does not submit evidence in support of this contention.  (See Decl. of Shy.)  Nonetheless, as discussed below, the Court is
granting Plaintiff’s request for sanctions, which should ameliorate any such
prejudice.  Therefore, Plaintiff fails to
demonstrate it will be prejudiced by the Court granting the instant motion.
Accordingly,
Jackie’s motion is granted.
 
Sanctions
“The
court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of
fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs
to opposing counsel or parties.”  (C.C.P.
§473(b).)
Plaintiff
requests this Court impose a penalty of no greater than $1,000 to Plaintiff’s
counsel.  (Opposition, pg. 9.)
The
court orders Jackie’s Counsel, Onica Valle, to pay $1,000.00 in sanctions to
Plaintiff within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Jackie’s
motion to set aside the entry of default entered on October 5, 2023, and
default judgment entered against Jackie on April 26, 2024, is granted.   The Court sets a hearing on an order to show
cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel
sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default against Jackie Bunao, as well as a
Trial Setting Conference, on September 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Jackie’s
Counsel, Onica Valle, is ordered to pay $1,000.00 in sanctions to Plaintiff
within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
