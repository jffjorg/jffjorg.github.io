And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition to approve the minor's compromise in the case of William Ernesto Quinteros, et al. vs. Buddie L. Horn as Trustee of the Horn Trust. The petition seeks approval of a settlement under which the minor claimant, Ainhoa Alexis Marin, will receive $10,907.02 after deduction of attorneys' fees and costs.

The Court finds that the settlement is reasonable and in the best interests of the minor claimant. The Court will grant the petition to approve the minor's compromise and order the funds deposited in the blocked account. The Court will also continue the hearing on the Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed in light of the settlement.

The Court notes that the minor claimant has suffered from uninhabitable conditions and has recovered completely from the injuries. The Court also notes that the attorney fees requested are reasonable given the issues, expertise, time, and experience required to bring the matter to resolution.

The Court will require attendance only by the Petitioner at the hearing to grant the petition. The Court will also set a hearing on October 28, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Dept. 71 to review the proof of deposit into the blocked account.
