  - "whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect, [the court shall] vacate any . . . resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment" (C.C.P. §473(b))
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Jackie Bunao's motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment entered against her on April 26, 2024. The Judge found that Defendant's counsel's failure to respond on her behalf was due to a mistake exacerbated by staffing issues and a high case load, which is subject to mandatory relief under C.C.P. §473(b). The Judge also ordered Defendant's counsel, Onica Valle, to pay $1,000 in sanctions to Plaintiff within 20 days. A hearing is set for September 24, 2024, to address the complaint and potential sanctions against Defendant's counsel.
