Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied Defendant Negar Modgeddi's motion for summary judgment, which argued that the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was defective and that Plaintiff Caribeth, LLC had accepted rent payments while pursuing this action. The judge found that the notice was not defective and that the Plaintiff had not accepted rent payments. The judge also struck the answer filed by Nader Modgeddi, who was not a named defendant in the action, and had failed to file an answer within the time allowed.
