And here is the summary in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The defendant, Keith A. Fink, seeks to add two new claims for negligent misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation against the plaintiff, Douglas Emmett 2007, LLC, as well as add factual allegations to his existing promissory estoppel claim. The court has granted the motion despite the defendant's failure to provide required information under California Rule of Court 3.1324(b) because the case is over a year old and the plaintiff has filed a non-opposition to the motion. The court's decision is based on the strong policy favoring amendment and the liberal policy of allowing amendments to complaints at any stage of the proceedings, absent prejudice to the adverse party.
