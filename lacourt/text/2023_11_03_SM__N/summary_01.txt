And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant/Cross-Complainant Keith A. Fink's Motion for Leave to File First Amended Cross Complaint. The First Amended Cross Complaint is deemed filed as of the date of entry of this order. The judge's reasoning is based on the strong policy favoring amendment, which is only justified in rare cases where the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the plaintiff's claim is clear. In this case, the case is over a year old, and Plaintiff has filed a non-opposition to Defendant's motion. Although Defendant failed to provide required information under rule 3.1324(b), the judge concludes that it is proper to allow Defendant leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint.
