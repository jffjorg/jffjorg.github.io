And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Richard Liu and Edward Wells, counsel for the plaintiff Thunder International Group Inc., to be relieved as counsel. However, this relief is granted on the condition that counsel submits a new order (MC-053) indicating that the next hearing will be an OSC re: Striking of Complaint on February 26, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. If the plaintiff does not have a new attorney of record by that date, its complaint may be struck. The judge also orders withdrawing counsel to give notice to the client. The judge's decision is based on the fact that counsel has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal and there is no apparent prejudice to the client or any other party.
