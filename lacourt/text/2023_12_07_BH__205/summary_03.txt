And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, Liav Mann, alleges that he was physically and verbally abused by his wrestling coach, Ryan Faintich, and that the Beverly Hills Unified School District (BHUSD) is liable for the abuse. The BHUSD demurs to the Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and moves to strike the punitive damages claim. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and breach of fiduciary duty claim, and grants the motion to strike the punitive damages claim. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not alleged extreme and outrageous conduct on the part of the district, and that a school district does not have a fiduciary relationship with its students. The Judge also finds that a public entity, such as the BHUSD, is immune from liability for punitive damages under Government Code §818.
