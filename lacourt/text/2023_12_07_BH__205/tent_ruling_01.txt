  Case Number:  21SMCV00061    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND MARKETING, LLC,    Plaintiff, v.  BRIAN DELINO, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  21SMCV00061     Hearing Date:  December 7, 2023      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL    FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL    INTERROGATORIES SET ONE, AND    REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF    DOCUMENTS, SET ONE AND REQUEST    FOR SANCTIONS     This is a theft of trade secrets case.  Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Travel Entertainment and Marketing LLC (“TEAM”) provides event planning services primarily for college fraternities and sororities, as well as for other college student organizations.  Cross-Defendant Michael Olivas is the sole owner of TEAM.   From 2016-2020, Defendant and Cross-Complainant Brian Delino worked for TEAM as a sales representative.  While working for TEAM, Delino allegedly stole TEAM’s business for himself, converted TEAM funds for his own use, and used TEAM’s proprietary and confidential information, including but not limited to TEAM’s customer lists, prospect lists and pricing information.    TEAM sued Delino and his company, BigDaddyFormals (collectively “Defendants”).  Delino countersued TEAM and Olivas, alleging they interfered with the business of BigDaddyFormals.   TEAM served document requests, set one, and special interrogatories, set one on Defendants.  This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendants to provide further discovery responses to these discovery requests.  Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions.   On a motion to compel further, this Department’s rules require Plaintiff to file a joint statement consisting of four columns: the first column will identify the number of the discovery request; the second, the text of the discovery request; the third, the text of the response, and the fourth, brief bullet-point statements, one from each party as to why a further response should or should not be compelled.   While a joint statement was filed, it did not include Defendants’ position.  Plaintiff claims Defendants refused to provide their position.  Defendants argue, however, that Plaintiff waited until defense counsel was out of the country -- a notice of unavailability was served in June 2023 -- and then attempted to file a unilateral separate statement on the day counsel returned.       Based on the foregoing, the Court continues the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to its requests for production (set one) and special interrogatories (set one) to January 8, 2024.  Plaintiff is to re-file the joint statement with Defendants’ position by December 15, 2023.  Defendants must cooperate with Plaintiff to complete the joint statement.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: December 7, 2023    ___________________________ Edward B.
