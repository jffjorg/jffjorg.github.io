And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for a writ of immediate possession in this unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff, SM 10000 Property LLC, is the owner and manager of a luxury high-rise apartment building in Los Angeles, California. The Defendant, Bryan Demosthenous, leased Unit 3408 (the "Premises") for a term of 19 months beginning on March 17, 2021, and running through September 30, 2022. The lease agreement required monthly payments of $12,850, plus electricity utilities to be separately billed. The Defendant failed to make payments, and by August 21, 2023, owed $55,843 in past due rent and fees.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff meets the requirements for a writ of immediate possession under Code Civ. Proc. §1166a(a) because the Defendant resides out of state and has failed to make payments. The Plaintiff has also shown a reasonable probability of success on its breach of contract claim. The court sets the undertaking amount at $10,000.
