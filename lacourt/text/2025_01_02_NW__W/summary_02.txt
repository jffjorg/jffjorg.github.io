And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to consolidate two separate cases: Case No. 24VECV00971 and Case No. 24VECV02984. The plaintiff, Paola Garcia Alejandre, argued that the cases should be consolidated because they involve similar questions of fact and law, and that consolidation would avoid unnecessary costs and delays. However, the judge found that the cases do not have significant common facts or issues regarding the plaintiff's claimed injuries and damages. The two accidents occurred in 2022 and 2024, allegedly caused by different defendants, and the plaintiff's injuries were not exacerbated in the second accident. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to consolidate the cases.
