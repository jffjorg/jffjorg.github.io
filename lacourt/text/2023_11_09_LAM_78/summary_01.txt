And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to change venue to San Bernardino County is granted. The parties are ordered to appear at the hearing, either remotely or in person, and a date will be set for posting fees necessary to effectuate the change in venue. The judge finds that San Bernardino County is a proper venue because the parties agreed to that location in their lease agreement. The judge also finds that the venue selection clause in the lease agreement is enforceable, despite one of the defendants not being a signatory to the agreement. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 397, 395(a), and 395.5, as well as case law.
