And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's deposition corrections is denied. The plaintiff is permitted to make changes to the form and substance of her deposition answers within 30 days of the availability of the original transcript. The defendants argue that the corrections are contradictory and may be stricken under the sham declaration doctrine, but the judge finds that the plaintiff is exercising her right to make changes to her deposition answers within the statutory period. The court notes that the sham declaration doctrine is not applicable in this case, as the plaintiff is not making a declaration contrary to her deposition testimony in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's changes to the deposition transcript are permissible under California Code of Civil Procedure, section 2025.520.
