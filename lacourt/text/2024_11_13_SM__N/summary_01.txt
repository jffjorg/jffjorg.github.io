And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shabana Arman vs. Malibu Dream Resort, LLC. The Judge has sustained the demurrer to all four causes of action brought by the Plaintiff, Shabana Arman, without leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by the Defendant, Malibu Dream Resort, LLC, arguing that the Plaintiff's claims were insufficiently pleaded.

The Judge's ruling means that the Plaintiff's claims for rescission of the Vacation Rental Agreement (VRA) and return of the $50,000 deposit, as well as claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith, conversion, and deceit, will not proceed. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations of concealment or misrepresentation by the Defendant were not sufficient to support these claims.

The Judge also granted the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of two Los Angeles County ordinances, which were relevant to the case. The Judge's ruling is subject to change based on any further arguments or evidence presented at the hearing on November 13, 2024.
