And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The motion is granted without leave to amend as to the plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. The plaintiffs have failed to provide specific facts to support their claim for punitive damages, and the court finds that the conclusory allegations are insufficient to show malice, fraud, or oppression.

The motion is denied as to the plaintiffs' request for attorney fees. The court notes that the plaintiffs have cited a statutory basis for the fee under Civil Code section 1942.4, subdivision (b)(2).

The defendants are ordered to file and serve an answer to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
