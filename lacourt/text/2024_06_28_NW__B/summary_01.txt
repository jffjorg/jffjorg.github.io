The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) have moved for summary judgment, arguing that they are immune from liability as public entities under Government Code section 830.6. The judge has found that the City and LADWP have met their initial burden of showing that no triable issue of material fact exists that would make them liable for the alleged dangerous condition of public property. The judge notes that the City and LADWP have provided evidence that the ramp at issue was built to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and that it passed inspection in 2019. The judge further notes that the Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, thus has not presented any evidence rebutting the City and LADWP's affirmative showing of entitlement to judgment as matter of law. Based on the foregoing, the judge grants the City and LADWP's motion for summary judgment and orders them to give notice.
