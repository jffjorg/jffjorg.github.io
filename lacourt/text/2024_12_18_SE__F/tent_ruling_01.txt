that: "This ex parte Application was initially brought, and granted, on
December 2, 2024 at which time the Court granted the request and continued the

did not receive e-service of a copy of the ex parte Application in advance of
the hearing. Thus, in an abundance of caution, Plaintiffs bring this ex parte
Application anew with proper service. Plaintiffs request the same dates set at
the last ex parte: November 3, 2025 for trial and October 21, 2025 for final
status conference." (Notice 2:8-13.)
