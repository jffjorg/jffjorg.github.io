[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
                                                                                        
I.        
BACKGROUND
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract arising
from Defendant, Anthony Sawyer’s, failure to honor promissory notes owed to
Plaintiff totaling $2,837,33.24. On August 9, 2024, the Hon. Anne Richardson
granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication in Plaintiff’s favor and
against Defendant, Mark Sawyer. All other Defendants have been dismissed. 
Plaintiff requests an award of fees totaling $142,762.50.
The promissory notes from which this action arises include an attorney fee
provision. (Michael Machat decl. Ex. 1, ¶ 7; Ex. 2, ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel
submits his billing records. (Machat decl., Ex.3.)  Defendant did not file an opposition. 
                                                                                 
II.       
LEGAL STANDARDS
To determine whether fees are reasonable, the court
begins with the lodestar, which is the number of hours reasonably spent
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
The court considers a number of factors including "the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its
handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case.’” (PLCM
Group at 1096.) The lodestar figure can be adjusted based
on the factors specific to the case. (Id.)
To determine a reasonable market rate, "the courts
will look to equally difficult or complex types of litigation.” (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
691, 700.) The “market rate” is generally based on the rates
prevalent in the community where the court is located. (Id.) The trial
court is in the best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys
in his or her courtroom for the type of litigation at issue. 
While counsel submits that $750 per hour is a reasonable
market rate, there is no evidence that he has been approved by a court at that
rate. Counsel bases this rate on rates obtained by opposing counsel in a
federal court action. (Matchat decl., ¶ 7.) This state-court action was not
complex; Plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract, fraud, open book
account, conversion, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition for breach of
promissory notes. 
Plaintiff’s counsel is entitled to “’compensation for all
the hours reasonably spent‘ in litigating the action to a successful
conclusion. (Ibid., italics in original.) ‘Reasonably spent’ means that
time spent ‘in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to
compensation. (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394.)
The lodestar may be augmented or diminished “by taking
various relevant factors into account including (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys; and (3) the contingent nature of the  fee award, based on
the uncertainty of prevailing on the merits and of establishing eligibility for
the award.” (Robertson
at 819.) 
The court has considered the foregoing factors and finds
that the 13-page complaint did not raise novel or complex issues. Plaintiff
filed this action on October 24, 2023, and obtained judgment on August 19,
2024, less than one year later. All of Plaintiff’s applications for relief were
unopposed, including the motion for summary adjudication as Defendant Sawyer
stopped participating in the case. (Matchat decl., ¶ 15.) The court finds that
$600 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate for a non-complex, unopposed, breach
of contract action. 
The court has reviewed the billing records. Plaintiff
provides the following breakdown of hours expended.
