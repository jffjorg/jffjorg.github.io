And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Sonia Feldman, is entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $81,000. The fees are based on the plaintiff's counsel's billing records and the reasonable hourly rate of $600 per hour. The Judge found that the litigation was not complex and that the plaintiff's counsel spent 135 hours on the case. The Judge also considered the factors set forth in PLCM Group v. Drexler, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, and the skill required in its handling. The Judge found that the plaintiff's counsel's fees were reasonable and granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees.
