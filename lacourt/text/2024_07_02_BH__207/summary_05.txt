Significant Statements:
  - "A policy of liberal construction of section 426.50 to avoid forfeiture of causes of action is imposed on the trial court." (Silver Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank)
  - "A motion to file a cross-complaint at any time during the course of the action must be granted unless bad faith of the moving party is demonstrated where forfeiture would otherwise result." (Silver Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank)
  - "The interests of justice and judicial economy will be best served by allowing WNB to file the cross-complaint, as opposed to requiring WNB to file a separate lawsuit against Regency and Vankirk, and then move to relate and consolidate that lawsuit with this case."
