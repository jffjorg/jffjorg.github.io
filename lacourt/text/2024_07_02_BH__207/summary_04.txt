And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling notes that the entry of a default against the defendant, John Smith, terminates his rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until the default is set aside or a default judgment is entered. The judge also references two previous cases, Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. and Bailey v. Citibank, N.A., which state that the entry of default cuts off the defendant's right to file pleadings and motions, and to receive notices and service of pleadings or papers.

The judge is considering striking out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in the pleadings, as allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure section 436. The judge may also strike out all or part of any pleading that is not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of the state, a court rule, or an order of the court.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to ensure that the litigation proceeds fairly and in accordance with the laws and rules of the court.
