MOTION
 
Plaintiff Wudasie Gorfu
(“Plaintiff”) originally filed suit on October 17, 2023, alleging three causes
of action for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; and (3) fraud against Defendant Hidden Sole Foundation and
Does 1-20.  
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on February 20, 2024, against Defendants
Hidden Sole Foundation; Hidden Sole; Bazar Trade, LLC; Darren Holmes; Cameron
Brooks; Obinna Okwara; and Chibuike Okwara (collectively, “Defendants”).  
 
Default was entered against Defendant
Hidden Sole Foundation on May 9, 2024, and the remaining Defendants on May 1,
2024.
 
Defendants now move to set aside
the defaults entered against them.  The
motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
            Code of Civil procedure section 473
“includes a discretionary provision, which applies permissively, and a
mandatory provision, which applies as of right.” (Minick v. City of Petaluma
(2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25 (hereafter Minick).)  “Section 473 is a remedial statute to be
“applied liberally” in favor of relief if the opposing party will not suffer
prejudice.  Because the law strongly
favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473
must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.  Unless inexcusable neglect is clear, the
policy favoring trial on the merits prevails.” 
(Minick, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 24 [cleaned up].)  
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than
six months had elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under
section 473 was unavailable”]; People v.
The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Ca.App.4th 712, 721 [motion
for relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no
case exceeding six months”]).  “The
six-month limit is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), unless an application is made within the
six-month period.”  (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340,
citations omitted.)  
 
1.     DISCRETIONARY RELIEF
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
2.     MANDATORY RELIEF 
 
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any
(1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  “In considering whether the trial court
properly denied relief under section 473(b), the first question is the
sufficiency of defendants' showing of attorney fault, if believed, to trigger
the mandatory relief provisions of that statute.”  (Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond
Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868, 896, disapproved on other
grounds by Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire
Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830 (hereafter Standard).)  “Under section 473(b), a party is entitled to
relief from a default and resulting judgment whenever, on timely application
for relief, his attorney ‘attest[s] to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect’ in connection with the default or the judgment.”  (Ibid.)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants contend that Hidden Sole Foundation was served with the
original complaint via substitute service on December 26, 2023, but believed
their insurance company would litigate the matter on its behalf, and simply
forwarded it to the insurance company. 
(Okwara Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, 11.)  Once
Defendants realized their insurance company was not representing them in this
lawsuit, they “immediately” retained counsel on May 10, 2024.  (Id. at ¶ 5.)
 
Upon retaining counsel, Defendants were informed that a FAC had been
filed, adding  additional Defendants who were
supposedly served via substitute service on March 4, 2024, and defaults had
been requested against them.  (Id.
at ¶ 6.)  Defendants filed an Answer on
May 13, 2024, but subsequently discovered that defaults had already been
entered against them.  (Id. at ¶¶
9-10.)[1]
 
Defendants later came to learn that their employee, Daniel, was served
with the summons and FAC on March 4, 2024, but did not inform anyone about the
service, and instead put them in a drawer and then three days later traveled to
Mexico for a family emergency and has not been heard from since.  (Id. at ¶¶ 12.)  
 
Therefore, Defendants have demonstrated that the defaults were entered
as a result of their mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
grants Defendant’s unopposed Motion to Set Aside Default and orders the defaults
entered against Defendants on May 1 and May 9, 2024 set aside.
 
            Further, on the Court’s own motion,
the Court strikes Defendants’ Answer filed on May 13, 2024,[2]
and orders Defendants to file and serve responses to the FAC on or before July
23, 2024.  
 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling.
