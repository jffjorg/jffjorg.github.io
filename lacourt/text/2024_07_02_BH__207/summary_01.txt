Significant Statements:
  - "The party asserting the lack of good faith . . . [is] permitted to demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement is so far ‘out of the ballpark’ in relation to [the Tech-Bilt factors] as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of [section 877.6]. Such a demonstration would establish that the proposed settlement was not a ‘settlement made in good faith’ within the terms of section 877.6."
  - "Practical considerations obviously require that the [trial court’s] evaluation [of the settlement] be made on the basis of information available at the time of settlement."
  - "The Court may take judicial notice of the existence of the above documents as court records, but not the truth of the hearsay statements or allegations contained therein."
