[1] “The entry of a default terminates a defendant's
rights to take any further affirmative steps in the  litigation until either its default is set
aside or a default judgment is entered.” 
(Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155
Cal.App.3d 381, 385.  Further, the entry
of default “[c]uts off the defendant's right to file pleadings and motions (other
than a motion to set aside default under § 473), and it also cuts off
the defendant's right to notices and the service of pleadings or papers.”  (Bailey v. Citibank, N.A. (2021) 66
Cal.App.5th 335, 347, emphasis added.)  
 


[2] “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to
Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper:  (a) Strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  (b) Strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
