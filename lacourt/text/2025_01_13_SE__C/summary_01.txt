And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendant's request to allow Shawna Bishop of Zurich America Insurance to attend the Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) remotely via telephone on January 14, 2025. The Judge finds that good cause exists to excuse in-person attendance due to Ms. Bishop's out-of-state location in New York and the undue burden of traveling to Southern California. The defendant had provided notice of Ms. Bishop's intent to appear remotely on January 9, 2025, which is more than two court days' notice as required by California Rules of Court (CRC), rule 3.672(g)(2).
