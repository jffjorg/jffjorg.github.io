  Case Number:  22NWCV01209    Hearing Date:   January 13, 2025    Dept:  C Bunn v. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC
22NWCV01209 
 
This wrongful termination action was filed on November 3,
2022. A Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) is currently scheduled for
January 14, 2025, and trial is scheduled for June 12, 2025. Defendant now moves
ex parte for an order Continuing Excusing In-Person Attendance of Shawna Bishop
of Zurich America Insurance at the MSC. Defendant argues good cause exists
because Ms. Bishop lives and works out of state, in New York, and traveling to
Southern California will be an undue burden to participate in the MSC. Ms.
Bishop will attend the MSC remotely via telephone and Defendant and its counsel
will attend in-person.
 
Defendant’s ex parte application for an order Continuing
Excusing In-Person Attendance of Shawna Bishop of Zurich America Insurance at
the MSC is GRANTED pursuant to California Rules of Court (CRC), rule
3.672 and Code of Civil Procedure section 367.75. “[W]hen a party has provided
notice to the court and all other parties that it intends to appear remotely, a
party may appear remotely and the court may conduct conferences, hearings, and
proceedings, in whole or in part, through the use of remote technology.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 367.75 subd. (a).)  Defendant provided notice of Ms. Bishop’s
intent to appear remotely on January 9, 2025, which is more than two court
days’ notice as required by CRC, rule 3.672(g)(2) (Smith Decl., Exh. A.).
Accordingly, Shawna Bishop may appear remotely for the MSC scheduled for
January 14, 2025. Moving party to give notice.
