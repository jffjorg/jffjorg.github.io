The Tentative Ruling:

The Respondent, Shirley N. Weber, in her capacity as the California Secretary of State, has filed a demurrer to the Petitioner, Aarus Enterprises, LLC, alleging that the Petitioner is not a "person" who may apply for relief under the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund. The court has reviewed the pleadings and the legislative history and has determined that the term "person" is ambiguous and should be interpreted to include limited liability companies.

The purpose of the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund is to provide restitution to the victims of corporate fraud who have been unable to collect judgments against corporations. The language of the statute is clear that the fund is meant to help victims who have been unable to collect judgments, and it is reasonable to interpret the term "person" to include limited liability companies.

Furthermore, the court has noted that the legislative history and the regulations governing the fund have not been amended to exclude limited liability companies from the definition of "person". Therefore, the court has overruled the demurrer and allowed the Petitioner's petition to proceed.

The court has also granted declaratory relief, stating that the second cause of action for declaratory relief is wholly derivative of the first cause of action for an order directing payment out of the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund.
