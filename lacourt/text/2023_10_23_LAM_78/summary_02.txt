And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue trial and all corresponding dates. The current final status conference (FSC) and trial dates are advanced and vacated. The trial is set for April 8, 2024 at 9:30 a.m., and the FSC is set for March 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. All discovery and motion cutoff dates are to be based on the new trial date. The defendants are also instructed to file an ex parte motion to advance the summary judgment motion hearing date if they are unable to reserve a date sufficiently in advance of trial.
