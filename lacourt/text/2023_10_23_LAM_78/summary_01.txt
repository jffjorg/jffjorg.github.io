And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Plaintiff Alejandro Banuelos to compel Defendant Patriot Hyundai of El Monte to provide further responses to special interrogatories (Set Two). The motion was granted, and Defendant is ordered to serve verified further responses without objections within five days after the date of this order. The Court also imposes sanctions of $1,600 jointly and severally on Defendant and its counsel.

The dispute centers around Plaintiff's request for information about the identities of people who purchased Patriot Hyundai and the reason for the sale. Defendant objected to the requests, claiming they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, irrelevant, and sought privileged and confidential information. However, the Court finds that the requests are reasonable and relevant to the discovery of material witnesses or potential other parties.

The Court concludes that Defendant failed to serve supplemental responses to the special interrogatories on the correct address and that its objections were invalid. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and imposes sanctions on Defendant and its counsel.
