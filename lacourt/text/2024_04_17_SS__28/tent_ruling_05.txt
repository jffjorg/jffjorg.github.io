BACKGROUND 
On

this action against Defendants Elizabeth Zion Seres (“Seres”), Brittney Benson,
Los Angeles Unified School District, County of Los Angeles, and Does 1-25 for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On

23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, and 23IWSC01291.  
Also
on January 8, 2024, Seres filed a motion to consolidate case numbers
23STLC07239, 23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, and 23IWSC01291 to be heard on February
9, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing
to February 20, 2024. 
On
February 9, 2024, Seres filed an answer. 
On February
20, 2024, the Court heard argument on its tentative ruling and continued the hearing on the motion to consolidate to March
22, 2024.  The
Court later continued the hearing to April 17, 2024. 
On
March 1, 2024, Seres filed a supplemental brief supporting her motion to
consolidate, which the Court has reviewed. 
On
March 4, 2024, the Court found that this case (case number 22STCV29506) and case
number 23STLC07239 are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court,
rule 3.300(a). Case number 22STCV29506 became the lead case. The Court assigned
the cases to Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for May 29, 2024. 

PARTY’S REQUEST 
Seres
asks the Court to consolidate an unlimited civil case (22STCV29506), a limited civil
case (23STLC07239), and three small claims cases (23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, and
23IWSC01291) for all purposes. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a),
provides: 
“(a) When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of
any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides: 
“(a) Requirements of motion 
“(1)  A notice
of motion to consolidate must: 
“(A)  List all
named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names
of their respective attorneys of record; 
“(B)  Contain
the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest
numbered case shown first; and 
“(C)  Be filed
in each case sought to be consolidated. 
“(2)  The motion
to consolidate: 
“(A)  Is deemed
a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
“(B)  Must be
served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the
cases sought to be consolidated; and 
“(C)  Must have
a proof of service filed as part of the motion.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a).) 
Los
Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases
were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of cases, the
first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the court.
After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the consolidated case
must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case. (3) Before
consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited case must
be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.” 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motion to consolidate case numbers 22STCV29506 and 23STLC07239 
The
Court related case numbers 22STCV29506 and 23STLC07239 on March 4, 2024.
  Seres
asserts that both cases arise from the same vehicle accident or chain of
events which took place on November 10, 2021, on Florence Avenue about 160 feet
west of Locust Street, in Inglewood, California.  The cases also involve the same defendants. 
However,
Seres has not filed a notice of the motion to consolidate in case number
23STLC07239.  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.350(a)(1)(C) [notice of motion to consolidate must “[b]e filed in each
case sought to be consolidated”].) 
The
Court denies the motion to consolidate case numbers 22STCV29506 and 23STLC07239. 
B.   Motion to consolidate case numbers 22STCV29506 and the
small claims cases 
Seres
also asks the Court to consolidate this case with small claims cases 23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, and 23IWSC01291. 
The
Court denies the motion because (1) the Court has not related these cases into
the same department (see LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)) and (2) Seres has not filed a
notice of the motion to consolidate in case numbers 23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, or
23IWSC01291.  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.350(a)(1)(C).) 
The
Court denies the motion to consolidate case numbers 22STCV295506, 23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, and 23IWSC01291. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Elizabeth Zion Seres’s motion to consolidate case
numbers 22STCV29506, 23STLC07239, 23IWSC01292, 23IWSC01646, and 23IWSC01291. 
          Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
