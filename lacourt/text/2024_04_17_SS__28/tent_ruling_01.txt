PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Chan
asks the Court to advance trial date or, in the alternative, to dismiss the case
for failure to prosecute. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 583.420, subdivision (a)(2),
provides in part: 
“(a) The court may not dismiss an action pursuant to
this article for delay in prosecution except after one of the following
conditions has occurred: 
* * *
 “(2) The action is not brought to trial within the
following times: 
“(A) Three years after the action is commenced against
the defendant unless otherwise prescribed by rule under subparagraph (B). 
“(B) Two years after the action is commenced against
the defendant if the Judicial Council by rule adopted pursuant to Section
583.410 so prescribes for the court because of the condition of the court
calendar or for other reasons affecting the conduct of litigation or the
administration of justice.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.420,
subd. (a)(2).) 
          California Rules of Court, rule 3.1340(a), provides: 
          (a) Discretionary dismissal two years after filing 
“The court on its own motion or on motion of the
defendant may dismiss an action under Code of Civil Procedure sections
583.410-583.430 for delay in prosecution if the action has not been brought to
trial or conditionally settled within two years after the action was commenced
against the defendant.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1340(a).) 
          California Rules of Court, rule 3.1342(e), provides that in
ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, the Court must consider
“all matters relevant to a proper determination of the motion,” including: 
“(1)  The
court's file in the case and the declarations and supporting data submitted by
the parties and, where applicable, the availability of the moving party and
other essential parties for service of process; 
“(2)  The
diligence in seeking to effect service of process; 
“(3)  The extent
to which the parties engaged in any settlement negotiations or discussions; 
“(4)  The
diligence of the parties in pursuing discovery or other pretrial proceedings,
including any extraordinary relief sought by either party; 
“(5)  The nature
and complexity of the case; 
“(6)  The law
applicable to the case, including the pendency of other litigation under a
common set of facts or determinative of the legal or factual issues in the
case; 
“(7)  The nature
of any extensions of time or other delay attributable to either party; 
“(8)  The
condition of the court's calendar and the availability of an earlier trial date
if the matter was ready for trial; 
“(9)  Whether
the interests of justice are best served by dismissal or trial of the case; and 
“(10)  Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to a fair determination of the issue. 
“The court must be guided by the policies set forth in
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.130.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1342(e).) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 583.130 provides: 
“It is the policy of the state that a plaintiff shall
proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action but that all
parties shall cooperate in bringing the action to trial or other disposition.
Except as otherwise provided by statute or by rule of court adopted pursuant to
statute, the policy favoring the right of parties to make stipulations in their
own interests and the policy favoring trial or other disposition of an action
on the merits are generally to be preferred over the policy that requires
dismissal for failure to proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution
of an action in construing the provisions of this chapter.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.130.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
October 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed this action against Chan and other defendants.  On February 3, 2022, Chan filed an answer.  On July 17, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel. 
Since
the Court granted his counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel on July 17, 2023,
Plaintiff has not appeared at any hearings or filed any papers in this case.
 Plaintiff
has not sent Chan discovery since April 5, 2022 and has never attempted to take
Chan’s deposition.  Plaintiff did not
appear for a January 3, 2024 deposition noticed by Chan. 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1342(e), and the policies set forth in Code of
Civil Procedure section 583.130 and concludes that dismissal is appropriate
under the authorities listed above based on Plaintiff’s failure to prosecute
the case.  Therefore, the Court exercises
its discretionary authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.420,
subdivision (a)(2), and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1340, and dismisses
Plaintiff’s case against Chan with prejudice. 
CONCLUSION
 The
Court GRANTS Defendant Ting Kwan Chan’s
motion to dismiss and dismisses Plaintiff
Hongde Cui’s claims against Defendant Ting Kwan Chan with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.420, subdivision
(a)(2), and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1340. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
