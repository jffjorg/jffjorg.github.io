And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to attend a mental examination with neuropsychologist Ted D. Evans, Ph.D., is denied. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The court's previous order to compel the plaintiff to attend an examination was granted in January 2024, but the defendant failed to comply with the deadline. Instead of asking for additional time or seeking ex parte relief from the court, the defendant filed a motion to enforce the order. The judge has determined that the defendant's actions were not in compliance with the court's order and has denied the motion.
