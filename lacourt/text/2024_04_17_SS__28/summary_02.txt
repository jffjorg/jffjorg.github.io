And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente's claims. The Court notes that the petition is incomplete and fails to provide necessary information regarding the compromise. Specifically, the petition does not clarify the amount to be paid to Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente, and the calculation of medical expenses is unclear. The Court denies the petition without prejudice, ordering the petitioner to modify the petition to provide the required information and supporting evidence.
