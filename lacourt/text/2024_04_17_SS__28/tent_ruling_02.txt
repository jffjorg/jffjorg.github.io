 Case Number:  21STCV04307    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On February
3, 2021, July 29, 2022, Plaintiffs Hernan Vicente,
Ani Piliposian, and Nicholas Vicente filed this action against Defendants
City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort. 
Also
on February 3, 2021, the Court appointed Ani Piliposian to serve as Plaintiff
Nicolas Vicente’s guardian ad litem. 
On
May 3, 2021, Plaintiffs Hernan Vicente,
Ani Piliposian, and Nicholas Vicente, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem,
filed a first amended complaint against Defendant and Does 1-50 for negligence—motor
vehicle (Government Code section 815.2, subdivision (a)). 
On
May 24, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
March 29, 2024, Petitioner Ani Piliposian (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente’s claims. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Ani Piliposian asks the Court to approve the
compromise of Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente’s claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
          Section 2 of the petition defines Plaintiff Nicholas
Vicente as the “claimant.”  Section 11 of
the petition states that Defendant has agreed to pay $85,000.00 to the “claimant,”
i.e., Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente. 
However, Section 12 of the petition shows that $85,000.00 is the amount
Defendant has offered to settle the claims of all three plaintiffs (Hernan
Vicente, Ani Piliposian, and Nicholas Vicente), including $5,000.00 for
Plaintiff Nicholas Vicente.  Petitioner
should modify the petition to clarify the amount to be paid to Plaintiff
Nicholas Vicente. 
          Section 13a(1) of the petition states that total medical
expenses were $1,149.00.  Section 13b(3)
of the petition states that the total amount of medical expenses ($1,149.00) was reduced by $451.67 as the result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual
reductions.  That should mean that the
remaining amount -- $697.33 – will be paid or reimbursed out of the settlement
proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the
petition states that only $451.67 of the medical expenses will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
This leaves $245.66 in medical expenses unaccounted for. 
It
seems possible that the amount listed in Section 12a(3) does not include all of
the reductions from the $1,149.00 in total medical expenses listed in Section
12a(1) of the petition. The only reduction documented in the petition is the
Department of Health Care Services’ agreement to accept $451.67 as
reimbursement for Medi-Cal’s payment of $602.22. 
In
addition, it seems possible that the total medical expenses may have exceeded
$1,149.00.  An exhibit to the petition
shows that Valley Presbyterian Hospital provided $1,149.00 in services, but the
February 5, 2024 letter from the Department of Health Care Services lists
additional medical care providers and charges which Medi-Cal paid: $461.17 for Altamed
Health Services and $9.30 for Renaissance Imaging Med.  
The
Court cannot approve the petition unless it shows that the minor’s compromise
will reimburse all of Plaintiff’s medical expenses that have not been reduced
or waived.  Accordingly, Petitioner
should determine (1) the total amount of medical expenses before any reductions,
(2) the total amount of reductions, and (3) the amount of medical expenses to
be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  Petitioner should include this information
and supporting evidence in the petition. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Petitioner Ani Piliposian’s petition for
expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff Nicolas Vicente filed on March
29, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
