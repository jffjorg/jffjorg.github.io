SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of an agreement between Defendant
024 Management Services, Inc. (024 Management), Defendant JW Brands LLC (JW
Brands) (collectively, Defendants) and Plaintiffs Chris Lacroix and Martin
Willerford (collectively, Plaintiffs).  (Complaint,
Ex.A).  Plaintiffs allege that in or
about 2020, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered a written agreement whereby
Defendants hired Plaintiffs to operate a division of its business, Plaintiffs
would provide services, pricing and terms, and Defendants would pay for said
products. (Complaint ¶6, p.3).  Plaintiffs further allege that they provided a
loan of startup capital to Defendants.  (Id.
and Ex.A thereto). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached the agreement by
preventing Plaintiffs from providing services and refusing to return the
startup loan funds. (Complaint ¶12, p.4).
 
On 1/10/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against 024
Management Services, Inc., JW Brands LLC, Michael Wayman, Tim McCandless and
Derek Markstein for: (1) Fraud, (2) Breach of Written Contract, (3) Quantum
Meruit, (4) Account Stated and (5) Open Book Account.  On 10/4/22, JW Brands and Derek Markstein
filed separate answers to the complaint.  On 10/10/22, default was entered against 024
Management and on 10/11/22, default was entered against Tim McCandless and
Michael Wayman.
 
On 12/12/23, Markstein and JW Brands filed a
cross-complaint against 024 Management, Wayman and McCandless for: (1)
Intentional or Negligence Misrepresentation, (2) Concealment, (3) Equitable
Indemnity, (4) Implied and Comparative Indemnity, (5) Contribution and
Equitable Apportionment and (6) Declaratory Relief.  
 
On 11/20/23, Plaintiffs dismissed Markstein from the
complaint.  On 1/10/24, the Court granted
JW Brands motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the 1st cause
of action for Fraud and the 3rd cause of action for Quantum Meruit
in Plaintiffs’ complaint.
 
On 4/29/24, JW Brands attorney filed a substitution of
attorney form indicating that JW Brands was representing itself.  
On 5/30/24, Plaintiff Chris LaCroix (LaCroix) filed the
instant motion seeking an order granting summary judgment in his favor.  No proof of service for the motion has been
filed.  No opposition or other response
to the motion has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS 
 
CCP 437c(a)(2) requires that the notice of a motion for
summary judgment be served at least 75 days before the hearing date, if personally
served.  As noted above, no proof of
service for the motion has been filed.  LaCroix
was required to file a proof of service for the motion at least five court days
before the hearing date.  CRC 3.1300(c).  
 
The Court further notes that while the separate statement
and memorandum of points and authorities filed in support of the motion are
dated March 7, 2024, the notice of motion is dated  May 30, 2024. 
(See Separate Statement, p.2:19, Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, p.12:17; Notice of Motion, p.2:6). 
As such, the notice of motion could not have been served at least 75
days before the 6/5/24 hearing date as required by CCP 437c(a)(2).    
 
As noted above, no opposition or other response to the
motion has been filed to cure the defects in notice.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the hearing on the motion is
placed off calendar.
