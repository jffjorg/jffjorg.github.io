And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, Dr. Ashish Sehgal, sexually assaulted him in 2009 while administering emergency medical care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital. The plaintiff served the complaint on a non-entity, "Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan Inc.", which is not a legal entity or a known alias of the defendant. The defendant claims it has not received any service of process.

The judge found that the plaintiff has not met his burden of proof to demonstrate that service was proper. The plaintiff's service of process was defective in several ways, including the fact that the proof of service listed the incorrect party name and did not include all the required documents. The judge ordered that the plaintiff must properly serve the defendant with the summons and complaint and any other required documents if he wishes to continue the lawsuit.
