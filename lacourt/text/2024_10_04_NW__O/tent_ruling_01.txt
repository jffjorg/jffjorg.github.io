     CASE NO.: 21STCV32534  
 
 
ORDER
  GRANTING DEFENDANT KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN, INC.’S MOTION TO QUASH
 
 



 


 
I.              
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
Jose Flores (“Plaintiff”) alleges Defendant Ashish Sehgal (“Sehgal”) sexually
assaulted him on June 2, 2009, while administering emergency medical care at a Kaiser
Permanente hospital in Panorama City, CA. (See Complaint, ¶¶ 16-22.) 
Plaintiff served
his Complaint and Summons on a defendant Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan
Inc. on September 3, 2021. The clerk of court entered judgment against Kaiser
Foundation & Health Plan Inc. on November 4, 2021. 
On December
17, 2021, the court approved Plaintiff’s amendment to his Complaint, correcting
Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan Inc.’s name to Defendant Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan, Inc. (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff
attempted to have default judgment entered against Defendant several times
since initially filing his action on September 2, 2021. As part of that
process, on March 22, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Sehgal.
Defendant now seeks to quash
Plaintiff’s service of summons for improper service. In addition, Defendant filed
a demurrer which is also pending.
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On September
2, 2021, Plaintiff served his Complaint, alleging (1) Sexual Rape; (2) Sexual
Battery Pursuant to Civil Code § 1708.5; (3) Assault; (4) Battery; (5)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Professional Negligence (As
to Dr. Sehgal, Ashish); and (7) Professional Negligence (As to Kaiser
Permanente).
On November
4, 2021, the clerk of court entered default against “Kaiser Foundation &
Health Plan Inc.”
On December
17, 2021, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to correct Defendant’s name to
“Kaiser Foundation Health Plain, Inc.”
On August 18,
2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Seal.
On October 2,
2023, this matter was transferred to this Court, which has held several
hearings addressing various defects in Plaintiff’s default judgment package.
On March 22,
2024, Plaintiff dismissed Sehgal. 
On August 27,
2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Quash (“Motion”). 
On September
24, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Opposition. 
Defendant has
not filed a Reply.
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
A.            
Motion To Quash 
Code of Civil Procedure § 418.10(a)(1)[1]
provides, “[a] defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead
or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve
and file a notice of motion… [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” A motion to quash must be
granted if the court finds that either (1) there is no basis for exercising
personal jurisdiction over the defendant or (2) service on the defendant was
improper. (See Ziller Elecs. Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
1222, 1229.)  
“When a defendant challenges the
court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove . . . the facts requisite to an effective
service.”¿(Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413 (internal quotations omitted).)
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Defendant moves
to quash Plaintiff’s service of summons. (See Motion.) The Court finds
Defendant is entitled to an order quashing Plaintiff’s service of summons. 
To effectuate
service on a corporation, summons may be delivered to the agent for service of
process or to the president, chief executive officer, or other head of the
corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer
or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general
manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of
process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 416.10(a)-(b).) 
On September
3, 2021, Plaintiff served via personal service his Complaint on one of
Defendant’s authorized agents for service, Koy Saechao, located at 2710 Gateway
Oaks Drive, Sacramento, CA. (See Proof of Service filed September 8,
2021.) At the time, Plaintiff’s Complaint listed Defendant’s name as “Kaiser
Foundation & Health Plan Inc.” (Id.) “Kaiser Foundation & Health
Plan Inc.” is not a legal entity or a known alias of Defendant. (See Declaration
of Edmond Ng filed August 27, 2024 (“Ng Decl.”), ¶ 2.) 
On November
4, 2021, the clerk of court entered default against “Kaiser Foundation &
Health Plan Inc.” (See Request for Entry of Default filed November 4,
2021.)   
On November
15, 2021, Plaintiff submitted his proposed amendment to his Complaint, seeking
to correct “Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan Inc” to Defendant’s legal name,
“Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.” (See Amendment to Complaint filed December
17, 2021 (the “Amendment”); see also Ng Decl., ¶ 2.) 
On November
17, 2021, Plaintiff served the Amendment via personal service on Koy Saechao, at
the same address as the Summons and Complaint: 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive,
Sacramento, CA. (See Proof of Service filed August 14, 2023 (“August
2023 POS”.) 
However, the
court did not approve and file the Amendment until December 17, 2021. (See Amendment.)
And Plaintiff
did not file his proof of service of the Amendment until August 14, 2024, almost
three years after the court approved and filed the Amendment. This was
also three days after the court pointed out the omission at the August 11,
2023, hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Seal. (See Minute Order dated
August 11, 2023.) 
Defendant claims
it has not received any service of Plaintiff’s amended Complaint,
whether before or after the court approved his amendment. (See Ng Decl.,
¶ 6.) Defendant further claims it “has never received service of any documents
related to this case after the ineffective service of the Complaint on a
non-entity, Kaiser Foundation & Health Plan, Inc.” (Ng Decl., ¶ 7.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues Defendant is in default and therefore cannot
participate in this action, rendering its Motion improper. (See Opposition,
pg. 2:7-12.) Plaintiff also argues “[o]n 11/15/2021 Plaintiff corrected
defendant’s name by filing an amendment to the complaint, clearly defendants
were aware of Plaintiff’s complaint but chose to ignore it,” and “Defendant
Kaiser included in its motion exhibits which are copies of the summons,
complaint and other documents that Plaintiff served upon it, that confirms
Kaiser was aware of the action.” (Id. at 9:22-25; 10:21-24.) 
Plaintiff
does not, however, address whether he served Defendant after the court approved
the amendment to his Complaint. (See Opposition.) In fact, Plaintiff
does not address the timing of his service of process at all, except for one
section of his Opposition where he simply states “Defendant Kaiser was
personally served by a licensed server of process upon Kaiser’s designated
agent for service of process.” (Id. at 6:6-8.) In addition, the proof of
service he filed on August 14, 2023, to purportedly reflect Plaintiff served
the Amendment on Defendant is defective in several ways. First, in Section 2,
it states that only the “Amendment to Complaint” was served, not the Summons,
Complaint, ADR Package, and, if necessary, Civil Case Cover Sheet. (See August
2023 POS.) Second, in Section 3 it still has the incorrect party name: “Kaiser
Foundation & Health Plan Inc.” instead of Defendant’s proper entity name. (See
id.) This mistake was repeated in Section 6, where is states “Kaiser
Foundation & Health Plan Inc.” is the entity on whose behalf the agent for
service was served. (See id.) In addition, after making the Amendment,
Plaintiff never obtained default against Defendant, which is a necessary
step because his November 4, 2021, default judgment against Kaiser Foundation &
Health Plan Inc. does not apply to Defendant.
Accordingly,
the Court finds Plaintiff has not met his burden of proof to demonstrate
service was proper and GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Quash. As a result, Defendant’s
Demurrer and Motion to Strike are moot and the Court takes them off calendar.
If Plaintiff wishes to proceed against Defendant, he must properly serve
Defendant with his Summons and Complaint and any other documents required by law.
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Quash. 
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      October 4, 2024
