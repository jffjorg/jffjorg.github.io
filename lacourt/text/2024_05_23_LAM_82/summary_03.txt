And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the application for a temporary restraining order filed by Plaintiffs Artuozo Neihule and Yvonne Neihule against Defendant Bianca Hillier. The Plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to prevent Defendant from blocking the driveway they constructed on their property, which Defendant claims is on her land. The court finds that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable probability of success on the merits and that the balance of hardships favors them. The court orders Defendant to remove the "No Parking" signs and fence, and permits Plaintiffs to use the driveway to access their house. The court denies the ex parte application insofar as Plaintiffs are not permitted to park their vehicles on the disputed land. The court also sets a hearing for a preliminary injunction and sets forth the schedule for the filing of supplemental pleadings.
