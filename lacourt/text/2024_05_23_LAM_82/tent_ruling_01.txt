INTRODUCTION 
 
            Maria Frias
filed this action on January 22, 2023. 
Then, on January 25, 2024, Maria Frias filed a first amended verified
petition seeking appointment of a provisional director under Corporations Code
section 308, determination of invalidity of certain actions, and injunctive
relief.  Maria Frias named Shaira Frias
as a respondent and Luna Magic, Inc. (“Luna Magic”) as a nominal defendant.  On February 20, 2024, Shaira Frias filed a
cross-petition for removal of corporate director Mabel Frias pursuant to Corporations
Code section 304.  Further, on March 25,
2024, Shaira Frias filed an amended cross-complaint asserting causes of action
for breach of duty of loyalty, intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, violation of Penal
Code section 496, and Unfair Competition under Business and Professions Code
section 17200.  Now, the parties have
filed a series of motions:
 
1.         Luna Magic
moves for a preliminary injunction for an order returning $150,000 that Mabel
Frias transferred from Luna Magic’s bank account and directing Mabel Frias to refrain
from contacting its employees, vendors, and customers concerning Luna Magic’s
business.  
 
2.         Mabel Frias
moves to deposit the $150,000 with the court under Code of Civil Procedure
section 572.
 
3.         Mabel Frias
demurs to the first amended cross-complaint. 
 
4.         Mabel Frias moves
for leave to file a second amended petition. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
            Luna Magic manufactures
and distributes various cosmetic products. 
(First Amended Cross Complaint ¶ 5.) 
Luna Magic is “a Delaware corporation, organized and existing under and
by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of
business in the County of Los Angeles, State of California, and engaged in
business in the County of Los Angeles.” 
(Id. ¶ 1; Cross-Pet. ¶ 3; FAP ¶ 2.)  Mabel Frias and Shaira Frias are sisters who
dispute ownership of Luna Magic.  (See
FAP ¶¶ 8-10.)  
 
Shaira Frias declares that she founded Luna Magic in 2018 with
an angel investment from her then-husband. (Shaira Frias Decl. ¶ 3.)   Shaira
Frias declares that “[i]n 2021, I agreed to let my sister Mabel start working
full-time for Luna Magic. During her tenure with Luna Magic, Mabel was always a
W-2 employee.”  (Id. ¶ 4.)  In her cross-petition to remove Mabel Frias as
a director, Shaira Frias alleges that “[a]lthough Shaira and Mabel came up with
the idea of Luna Magic, it was always their intent and understanding that
Shaira would own one hundred percent (100%) of the company because Shaira would
invest all of the money for operating capital, and Shaira would run the company
on a full-time basis.”  (Cross-Pet. ¶
6.)  To that end, “[i]n 2018, Shaira
formed Luna Magic LLC as a Delaware limited liability company.”  (Id. ¶ 7.)
 
In her opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction
and in her proposed, verified second amended petition (“proposed SAP”), Mabel Frias
presents evidence that she became a 50% owner of Luna Magic in or about 2020,
which was then structured as a limited liability company, before the sisters
appeared on the television show “Shark Tank” in early 2021.  Mabel Frias also alleges that the sisters
converted Luna Magic to a corporation in or about 2021-2022, after the Shark
Tank appearance, with each sister owning 50% of the corporation and being named
one of the two directors.  (See
Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Mabel Oppo.”) 8-10; Mabel Frias
Decl. ¶¶ 6-22, Exh. 5-21; and Proposed SAP ¶¶ 8-26 and Exh. 3-24.)  
 
Among other supporting evidence, Mabel Frias authenticates
an email from Shaira Frias dated July 3, 2020, to a producer of “Shark Tank,”
which states in part: “Here is our signed agreement as requested.”  (Mabel Decl. Exh. 8.)  The attached agreement, signed and initialed
on each page by Shaira Frias, identifies Shaira Frias as a “co-founder” and
states that both Mabel Frias and Shaira Frias are 50:50 owners of Luna Magic,
LLC.  (Id. Exh. 8A at 45-46.)  After the Shark Tank appearance, Shaira
emailed to Barbara Corcoran, an investor and star of “Shark Tank,” a “Limited
Liability Company Agreement” apparently signed by Shaira Frias and Mabel Frias on
August 5, 2020, and stating that each sister held a 50% interest in the limited
liability company.  (Id. Exh. 9 and
9A.)  Mabel Frias also authenticates
various tax returns and corporate organizational documents in support of her
contentions that she is a 50% owner of Luna Magic, including after its
conversion to corporate form.  (See Mabel
Oppo. 10-11 and Mabel Decl. Exh. 11-21A.)
 
            In her
declaration in opposition to Mabel Frias’s motion to amend the FAP, Shaira Frias
disputes Mabel Frias’s contentions that the sisters are 50-50 owners of Luna
Magic.  Shaira Frias declares: 
 
In June,
2020, while Mabel was still working for Savage X Fenty, Mabel told me (after
the fact) that she had recently submitted an online application to abc.com to
appear on the popular television show ‘Shark Tank.’  Mabel convinced me that an appearance on
Shark Tank was an opportunity for greater visibility and publicity, in short,
free advertising…. Mabel told me that the producers [of Shark Tank] informed
her that in order to appear on the show, they needed a document showing that
Mabel was a 50% owner.  On June 22, 2020,
Mabel sent me an email confirming that she was just ‘putting down 50/50’ on the
Shark Tank application papers, knowing full well that the representation was
not true…. I was naïve and trusted Mabel, and did not suspect her of any evil
intention.  On or about August 5, 2020,
for the benefit of the Shark Tank producers, Mabel linked to Legalzoom and
prepared an (Amended) Operating Agreement for Luna Magic, LLC, inaccurately
showing an allocation of 50 percent to Mabel and 50 percent to me.” 
 
(Shaira Frias Decl. in opposition to Motion to Amend ¶¶
18-26.)  Shaira Frias further declares: 
 
“Though the
parties ultimately did not sign an investment deal, the publicity from the show
propelled Luna Magic to the forefront of the Latina make-up market.  After the Shark Tank episode aired in
January, 2021, Luna Magic obtained deals with major retailers such as Target in
2021 and CVS in 2023. Because I assumed Mabel had my best intentions at heart,
and since the company was able to generate additional revenues after the Shark
Tank segment, in January, 2021, Luna Magic hired Mabel full-time as the company’s
digital strategist.”  
 
(Id. ¶¶ 28-30.) 
With respect to the corporate conversion, Shaira Frias declares: 
 
“Unbeknownst
to me and without my consent, in November 8, 2021, Mabel filed documents with
the Delaware Secretary of State listing herself as a 50/50 co-owner of Luna
Magic, Inc. with me. Specifically, on November 8, 2021, Mabel filed a
Certificate of Conversion with the Delaware Secretary of State changing Luna
Magic from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation.  Also on November 8, 2021, Mabel filed a
Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State ‘forming’
Luna Magic, Inc. On each of these documents, Mabel forged my signature…. In or
about September 2022, without my knowledge or consent, Mabel caused the
company’s (former) accountants to issue 2021 K-1 returns showing that Mabel was
suddenly identified on a company tax return as a 50/50 owner of Luna
Magic.  I entrusted to my sister, Mabel,
the duty to accurately report to the company’s accountants and to prepare
truthful tax returns.” 
 
(Id. ¶¶ 32-40.) 

 
            Shaira Frias
declares that she terminated Mabel Frias’s employment with Luna Magic on
December 8, 2023.  (Shaira Frias Decl. in
support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction ¶ 6.)  Mabel Frias contends that this termination
was invalid and did not comply with Luna Magic’s bylaws because Shaira Frias did
not own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Luna Magic, and, therefore,
did not hold the majority of shares needed to remove Mabel Frias as a director
or an officer.  (Oppo. 11-12.)
 
            On or about
December 9, 2023, Mabel Frias withdrew $150,000 from Luna Magic’s Chase Bank
account and deposited that money in a different account at Silicon Vally Bank
created for Luna Magic.  (Mabel Frias Decl.
in support of motion to deposit funds ¶ 3 and Exh. 1.)  Mabel Frias explains that she “fear[ed] that
any money left in the Chase Bank account created on behalf of Luna Magic would
be mismanaged or spent for personal use by Shaira Frias.”  (Id. ¶ 6.)
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
Luna Magic’s evidentiary objections
to the declaration of Mabel Frias submitted in support of Mabel’s motion to
deposit disputed funds are OVERRULED. 
Shaira Frias’s request for judicial notice, filed May 9, 2024, of
Exhibits I, J, K, and N is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        Luna Magic’s Motion for Preliminary
Injunction 
 
            1.         Legal Standard 
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending a decision on the merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Ass’n.
(1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623.)  In
deciding whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction, the court looks to
two factors, including “(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on
the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms that is likely to result from
the granting or denial of interim injunctive relief.”  (White
v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.)  The factors are interrelated, with a greater
showing on one permitting a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.)  However, the party seeking
an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of success on
the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the
burden of demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the
occurrence of irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if the plaintiff can show an
inadequate remedy at law.  (CCP §
526(a).) 
 
For the second factor, the court must consider “the interim harm that
the plaintiff would be likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as
compared to the harm the defendant would be likely to suffer if the preliminary
injunction were issued.”  (Smith v. Adventist Health System/West (2010)
182 Cal.App.4th 729, 749.)  “Irreparable
harm” generally means that the defendant’s act constitutes an actual or
threatened injury to the personal or property rights of the plaintiff that
cannot be compensated by a damages award. 
(See Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 405, 410.)  
 
            2.         Mandatory Injunction to Return the
Funds 
 
Luna Magic moves for a preliminary injunction directing Mabel Frias to return to Luna Magic’s bank accounts $150,000 that she
admittedly transferred into a separate account, under her control, on December
9, 2023.  This motion is denied.  As Luna Magic acknowledges, the requested
injunction is mandatory in nature in that it would compel performance of an
affirmative act.  (See FACC Prayer ¶ 3
[seeking “a
mandatory injunction requiring Cross-Defendants to return all monies
fraudulently taken from Luna Magic, including, but not limited to, the $150,000
stolen on or about December 9, 2023”]; Davenport v.
Blue Cross of Calif. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th
435, 448 [“The general rule is that an injunction is prohibitory if it requires
a person¿to refrain from a particular act and mandatory if it compels
performance of an affirmative act that changes the position of the parties.”].)  “The granting of a mandatory injunction
pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases where the
right thereto is clearly established.”  (Teachers Ins. &
Annuity Ass'n v. Furlotti (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1487,
1493.)  Further, as a general rule, an
injunction will not issue to recover money. 
As summarized in the Rutter treatise: “Normally, an injunction will not issue
where only money is involved. The rationale is that there is no threat of
irreparable harm, because monetary losses are compensable in damages. Moreover,
statutes governing prejudgment attachment limit
the conditions on which payment of money may be restrained.”  (Rutter, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial ¶ 9:510, discussing Doyka v. Superior
Court
(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1134, 1136-37; see also Heckmann v. Ahmanson (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 119, 134-36.)  
 
            Reaching the merits, the court is
not persuaded that Luna Magic has established irreparable harm.  Shaira Frias declares that “Luna Magic needs
the money to address its current financial obligations, which include $106,290
in open purchase orders since January 1, 2024 as well as payroll and tax
obligations.”  (Shaira Frias Decl. in
support of motion for preliminary injunction ¶ 10.)  This evidence is conclusory.  Shaira Frias does not sufficiently describe
Luna Magic’s financial condition, including whether it holds other cash or
liquid assets, that could be used to pay for purchase orders, payroll, and tax
obligations.  Shaira Frias does not
describe Luna Magic’s cash flow from operations and whether such monies could
be used to pay for Luna Magic’s liabilities pending trial.  Nor does Shaira provide any detail concerning
Luna Magic’s “current financial obligations.” 
More important, the record suggests that these funds are not essential
to the survival of Luna Magic.  For
example, in her reply declaration, Shaira Frias acknowledges that she withdrew
close to $300,000 from Luna Magic’s Chase account on December 11, 2023, and
that Shaira maintains control of these funds, which can be used to pay for Luna
Magic’s financial obligations pending trial. 
(Reply Shaira Decl. ¶¶ 10-16.)  Similarly,
in her declaration in opposition to Mabel Frias’s motion for leave to amend the
petition, Shaira Frias declares that Luna Magic had over $2.5 million in sales
in 2022.  (Shaira Decl. in opposition to
motion for leave to amend ¶ 13.)  
 
            Nor does Luna Magic demonstrate that
a money judgment against Mabel would be an inadequate remedy.  In considering the adequacy of damages, a
court may consider whether the defendant is insolvent such that a monetary
judgment may be inadequate.  (West Coast Construction Co. v. Oceano
Sanitary District (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 693, 700.)  There is no evidence that Mabel Frias is
insolvent or that a money judgment would not make Luna Magic whole for the
alleged conversion.  There is no evidence
that Mabel Frias has spent the funds.  
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
denies Luna Magic’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  This order is without prejudice to Luna Magic
seeking a preliminary injunction to prohibit dissipation of the funds under Heckmann v. Ahmanson (1985) 168
Cal.App.3d 119, 134-36, a writ of attachment, or a writ of possession.  
            
                        3.         Prohibitory Injunction to Prevent
Contact 
 
Luna Magic also seeks a preliminary injunction directing
Mabel Frias to refrain, pending trial, from “contacting (by any means) any Luna
Magic employees, vendors, or customers concerning Luna Magic business.”  (See Mot., Notice 1-2.)  Because the requested injunction against
contacting Luna Magic’s employees, vendors, or customers
concerning Luna Magic business is prohibitory in nature, the heightened
standard for a mandatory injunction does not apply.  
 
Initially, Mabel
Frias agreed not to communicate with Luna Magic’s customers, employees, or
vendors.  (Mot. 5-6; see Shaira Frias Decl.
¶¶ 11-13, Exh. B-D; Gladstein Decl. ¶¶ 18-25, Exh. J-P.)  On February 15, 2024, Mabel Frias’s attorney represented:
“In the interest of unnecessarily escalating the conflict, Ms. Mabel Frias will
refrain from contacting Luna Magic customers, employees, and vendors, until
further notice.”  (Gladstein Decl., Exh.
J.)  On March 11, 2024, Mabel Frias’s
attorney represented: “[I]n the interest of resolving this dispute, I talked to
Mabel.  Mabel represented to me that she
will not be contacting any Luna Magic customers, vendors, or employee[s], as
her previously counsel has agreed on below, until further notice.”  (Id., Exh. L.)  Mabel Frias then violated that stipulation
between the parties.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  
 
The court does not
have sufficient information to resolve this motion because Luna Magic provides
no information concerning the subject matter of Mabel Frias’s communications
with Luna Magic’s customers.   
 
B.        Mabel
Frias’s Motion to Deposit Disputed Funds with the Court – DENIED 
            
            Mabel Frias moves for
an order under Code of Civil Procedure section 572 to deposit the disputed
funds with the court.  Section 572
states:  
 
 “When it is
admitted by the pleadings, or shown upon the examination of a party to the
action, that he or she has in his or her possession, or under his or her
control, any money or other thing capable of delivery, which, being the subject
of litigation, is held by him or her as trustee for another party, or which
belongs or which is due to another party or which should, under the
circumstances of the case be held by the court pending final disposition of the
action, the court may order the same, upon motion, to be deposited in court or
delivered to such party, upon those conditions that may be just, subject to the
further direction of the court.”  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. §
572.)  Among other things, section 572
generally requires “a judicial determination, upon the facts as then shown to
the court, that the party from whom the payment is asked has no right or title
to hold the money.”  (Ex parte Elias (1962)
209 Cal.App.2d 262, 273.)  Section 572
was intended for a third-party who has possession of disputed funds to
extricate themselves from litigation by depositing the funds with the court
pending the outcome of the case.  Section
572 was not intended to allow someone to remove corporate assets and deposit
them with the court for “safekeeping” based upon a belief that the company will
misuse them.  Accordingly, the court
exercises its discretion and denied Mabel Frias’s motion.
 
            C.        Motion
for Leave to File Second Amended Verified Petition           
 
            Mabel Frias seeks leave to file a
second amended verified petition under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.  Leave to amend at any time is liberally
allowed in the interests of justice and in the absence of prejudice to another
party, even up to the time of trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 473(a)(1) & 576; Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
487.)  “[T]he trial court has wide
discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Record v. Reason (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 472, 486.)  However, the court may condition the
amendment on “any terms as may be proper.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473(a)(1).)
 
            Mabel Frias filed her original
petition on December 22, 2023, approximately five months ago.  Mabel Frias retained new counsel, who filed a
substitution of attorney form on February 23, 2024.  Shaira Frias filed a demurrer on February 27,
2024, and this motion was filed on April 17, 2024.  The motion is not untimely because the case
has only been pending for five months, and the motion was filed less than two
months Mabel Frias retained new counsel. 

 
            However, the court agrees with
Shaira Frias’s argument that an amendment to add the second cause of
action—Determination of the Validity of Efforts to Terminate Petitioner under
California Corporations Code section 119(e)—would be futile.  First, section 119 applies only to California
Corporations, per section 119(a)(4), which states: “No corporate action may be
ratified under subdivision (b) by a dissolved corporation or a foreign
corporation, and no petition may be filed under subdivision (e) in respect to
any corporate action or security of such a corporation.”  Second, section 119 may be used only to
ratify or validate a corporation action, not to invalidate or challenge one,
per the plain language of the statute.  Mabel
Frias does not address these points in the reply brief thereby conceding the
points.  (See Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328,
1345, fn. 16 [failure to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  Moreover,
on February 1, 2024, Mabel filed a request for dismissal, without prejudice, of
her second cause of action for determination of validity of actions pursuant to
Corporations Code section 119(e).[1]
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Shaira Frias’s motion for a preliminary
injunction is ___________. 
 
            2.         Mabel Frias’s motion to deposit the
disputed funds with the court is denied.
 
            3.         Mabel Frias’s motion for leave to file
a second amended petition is granted in part and denied in part.  Mabel Frias may file the petition as it
relates to the first cause of action, but not the second cause of action.
 
            4.         Shaira Frias’s demurrer to the first
amended petition is denied as moot.
 
            5.         The court shall hold a trial setting
conference on Mabel Frias’s petition for appointment of a provisional director
on June 5, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.  
 
            6.         Counsel for Luna Magic shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
