In this tentative ruling, Judge Randolph M. Hammock of the Superior Court addresses Defendant Amit Jain's motion for reconsideration of the court's July 12, 2023, ruling on his Demurrer. The case involves Plaintiff DailyGobble, Inc., which alleges that Defendants Amit Jain, Alliance Group Ventures, LLC, and Chirag Patil committed conversion, fraud, and violated Corporations Code §§ 25402 and 25502. The dispute arises from Defendant Jain's representation that the shares of Bridg were worth no more than $0.75 each, while negotiating a sale of Bridg in a transaction that would represent a substantial premium. Plaintiff DailyGobble sold 851,601 shares of Bridg stock to Alliance Group Ventures at a price of $0.725 per share. Months later, Cardlytics, Inc. acquired all of Bridg’s outstanding stock at $9 per share, a 1200% increase in the price Plaintiff received for its shares.

The court denies Defendant Jain's motion for reconsideration, except for clarifying that Defendant’s Demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Conversion was and remains overruled. The language regarding leave to amend was included in error and is now deleted from the Final Ruling. No new facts or subsequent material changes in the law have been presented, and the court stands by its 07/12/2023 Ruling, except as corrected herein.
