The court also deletes language regarding leave to amend, which was included in error. The Motion for Reconsideration was based on the premise that the court's Final Ruling was incorrect, but the court has reconsidered the points made by Defendant and stands by its prior ruling, except for the clarification. The court may reconsider its prior interim orders to correct its own errors at any time and exercises that discretion in this case. The ruling is properly reflected in the court's Minute Order, and the court denies the Motion for Reconsideration, except as stated.
