Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint adds six new defendants and allegations of misconduct to the original complaint. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause to file the amended complaint, and that the motion is timely made and will not prejudice the opposing party. The judge orders the plaintiffs to file and serve the amended complaint within three days of the date of the order, and directs that notice of the order be given.
