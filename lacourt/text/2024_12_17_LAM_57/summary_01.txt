And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Fridman's motion for leave to amend her complaint to add claims of age discrimination and harassment. The judge found that Fridman's proposed claims are time-barred because she received a right-to-sue letter from the Civil Rights Division (CRD) on April 25, 2023, and more than a year has passed since then. The judge also found that Fridman's claims do not relate back to her initial administrative complaint filed on April 25, 2023, which alleged discrimination on the basis of religion and disability. The judge applied the relation-back doctrine, which requires that the amended complaint rest on the same general set of facts, involve the same injury, and refer to the same instrumentality as the original complaint. The judge found that Fridman's initial administrative complaint did not bear the weight of the new claims for age discrimination and harassment, and therefore did not give the defendant adequate notice of the new claims.
