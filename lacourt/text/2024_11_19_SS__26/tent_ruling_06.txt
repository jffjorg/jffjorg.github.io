ON THE PLEADINGS
(CCP §§ 430.31,
et seq., 435, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Donald
Cunningham’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Jennita Foster dba Guest House Management (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for unlawful detainer against Defendant Donald Cunningham (“Defendant”)
on February 15, 2024. Defendant filed an answer on February 26, 2024. 
 
On April 30,
2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. (Minute Order
04/30/24.) This action was deemed related to Foster v. Cunningham, LASC
Case No. 24STUD05853 on May 16, 2024. (Minute Order, 05/16/24.) On August 5,
2024, the unlawful detainer court determined that possession was no longer at
issue and put the case out for reassignment. (Minute Order, 08/05/24.)
Following assignment of the case to Department 26 in the Spring Street
Courthouse, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on
September 30, 2024. The Motion initially came for hearing on November 1, 2024
and was continued to allow the Court to consider Plaintiff’s late-filed
opposition, filed on October 31, 2024. No reply in support of the Motion has
been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff brought this action for
unlawful detainer against Defendant with respect to the premises located at
1628 West Blvd., #3, Los Angeles, California (“the Premises”). (Compl., ¶¶2-3.)
On February 11, 2023, Defendant agreed to rent the premises for $2,190.00 per
month, pursuant to a written agreement. (Id. at ¶6.) Defendant was
served with a 3-day notice to perform covenants or quit on February 11, 2024,
which expired on February 14, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶8-9.) Plaintiff demands
possession due to the expiration of a fix-term lease; the amount owing is
$894.45 from the date of service of the 3-day notice. (Id. at ¶¶11-12.)
The fair rental value of the Premises is $73.15 per day and Plaintiff is also
entitled to statutory damages. (Id. at ¶¶13-14.) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant asks the Court to take
judicial notice of the trial order dated June 21, 2024 in LASC Case No.
24STUD05853 that possession of the Premises is no longer at issue. The request
is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d).
 
Judgment on the Pleadings
 
Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that (1)
possession of the Premises is no longer at issue, but Plaintiff has not filed
an amended Complaint; and (2) the Complaint fails to state a cause of
action for unlawful detainer because the Notice to Vacate is defective. A claim
for unlawful detainer under Civil Code section 1161, Plaintiff’s moving
statute, exists when the tenant continues in possession of the property. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161.) Once possession is no longer at issue, the plaintiff must
convert the action to one for damages by filing an amended complaint. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1952.3, subd. (a)(1).) Here, despite possession of the Premises
no longer being at issue, Plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint. At the
hearing on November 5, 2024, Plaintiff argued that amendment of the Complaint
was not necessary. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1952.3, states in relevant part:
 
(a) Except as provided in
subdivisions (b) and (c), if the lessor brings an unlawful detainer proceeding
and possession of the property is no longer in issue because possession of the
property has been delivered to the lessor before trial or, if there is no
trial, before judgment is entered, the case becomes an ordinary civil action in
which:
 
(1) The lessor may obtain any
relief to which he is entitled, including, where applicable, relief authorized
by Section 1951.2; but, if the lessor seeks to recover damages
described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 1951.2 or any other
damages not recoverable in the unlawful detainer proceeding, the lessor
shall first amend the complaint pursuant to Section 472 or 473 of the
Code of Civil Procedure so that possession of the property is no longer in
issue and to state a claim for such damages and shall serve a copy of the
amended complaint on the defendant in the same manner as a copy of a summons
and original complaint is served.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1952.3, subd.
(a)(1) [emphasis added].) Code of Civil Procedure section 1951.2, subdivision
(a)(3) allows for damages of “the worth at the time of award of the amount by
which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award
exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the lessee proves could be
reasonably avoided.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1952.1, subd. (a)(3).) Plaintiff’s
Complaint does not seek damages under subdivision (a)(3) of section 1951.2,
such that an amended Complaint is required under the statute. Defendant’s
Motion does not address the fact that amendment is only required when seeking damages
under section 1951.2, subdivision (a)(3) that are not recoverable in the
unlawful detainer proceeding. 
 
Next, Defendant argues that the
Notice to Quit issued by Plaintiff did not strictly comply with the statutory
requirements. The statutory requirements in unlawful detainer proceedings “must
be followed strictly, otherwise a landlord’s remedy is an ordinary suit for
breach of contract with all the delays that remedy normally involves and
without restitution of the demised property.” (WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 516, 526.) The Notice (1) did not give Defendant the
option to sign any written lease renewal or extension as a means to cure; and
(2) did not identify a witness concerning the reason for eviction. (Compl.,
Exh. 2.) These defects are in violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and
state law. (See LAMC, § 151.09(C)(1); Delta Imports, Inc v. Municipal Court
(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1036 [citing Hinman v. Wagnon (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 24, 27] [“Where the condition or covenant allegedly violated is
capable of being performed, the notice must give the tenant the alternative of
performing or quitting possession.”].) Plaintiff’s opposition argues that
Defendant is not entitled to move for judgment on the pleadings using the
exhibits attached to the Complaint, but offers no supporting authority. Due to
the defective Notice to Quit issued by Plaintiff, the Complaint did not state a
cause of action for unlawful detainer when possession of the Premises was at
issue. However, it remains that the Complaint is now adequate to state a cause
of action for possession.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Donald Cunningham’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
