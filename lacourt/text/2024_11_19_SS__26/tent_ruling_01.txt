(CCP § 1209(a)(5), LASC Rule 3.11)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Third-party Sammy
Hakim’s Motion for Order to Show Cause Regarding Contempt is GRANTED. THE ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING CONTEMPT IS SET FOR DECEMBER 18, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN
DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021. Judgment Creditor filed a Motion to Compel Third Parties to
Produce Documents (“first Motion”) on September 25, 2023. Third-party Bank of
Hope filed an opposition on November 13, 2023 and third-party Sammy Hakim
(“Hakim”) filed a “Response to Subpoena for Production”, which partially
opposed the first Motion, on December 11, 2023. 

 
The first Motion initially came for hearing on December 14,
2023, at which time the Court granted the Motion in part and continued it in
part. Specifically, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request for
production of Judgment Debtor and Hakim’s confidential marriage license and
continued the request for production of documents from third-party financial
entities to March 14, 2024. (Minute Order, 12/14/23, pp. 1-2.) The request for
production of documents by third-party financial entities was continued to
allow for clarity on the question of the marriage of Judgment Debtor and Hakim.
(Id. at p. 3.) On February 9, 2024, the Court granted Judgment
Creditor’s Motion for In Camera Examination with respect to the confidential
marriage license of Judgment Debtor and Hakim. (Minute Order, 02/09/24.) Hakim
also filed an Objection to Third Party Subpoena on March 7, 2024.
 
Following the in-camera hearing on March 25, 2024, the Court
found that “there is a Confidential Marriage License. Date of marriage is
3/5/22 which is after the judgment date of 1/4/21.” (Minute Order, 03/25/24.)
The first Motion was set to be heard on April 8, 2024, but on the day before,
Judgment Creditor continued the matter to May 16, 2024. (Registrar of Actions,
04/07/24.) On May 16, 2024, the Court denied the first Motion. (Minute Order,
05/16/24.) Also on that date, the Court struck Judgment Creditor’s “Amended
Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents,” filed on May 6, 2024,
which purported to supplant the original Motion to Compel Third Parties to
Produce Documents. (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Creditor filed a renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties
to Produce Documents (“the Renewed Motion”) on May 20, 2024. Bank of Hope filed
an opposition on May 30, 2024. On June 12, 2024, the Court heard oral argument
from both parties and then denied the Renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to
Produce Documents. On August 20, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed a second,
renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents (“the Second
Renewed Motion”). The Second Renewed Motion remains pending following a hearing
on October 23, 2024, and is set for a continued hearing date on December 18,
2024. 
 
Hakim filed the instant
Motion for Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt Against Plaintiff on September 23,
2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Hakim brings this motion
to direct Plaintiff to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for
failing to comply the June 12, 2024 court order. Contempt is any act, in or out
of court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the
discharge of its duties.” (In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.)
Contempt includes “[d]isobedience of any lawful judgment, order, or process of
the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1209 subd (a)(5).) A contempt proceeding is
commenced by the filing of an affidavit showing (1) the rendition of a valid
order; (2) respondent’s actual knowledge of the order; (3) respondent’s ability
to comply with the order; and (4) respondent's willful disobedience of the
order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1211, subd. (a).) Each allegation (valid order,
knowledge, ability to comply and willful disobedience) must be pleaded by
factual statements; however the affidavit may be amended to correct technical
insufficiencies if the respondent would not be prejudiced thereby. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1211.5(b).) Contempt includes “[d]isobedience of any lawful judgment,
order, or process of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1209 subd. (a)(5).
 
The Motion is supported
by the affidavit of Hakim’s counsel, Kevin M. Badkoubehi (“Attorney
Badkoubehi”), who attaches a copy of the Court’s June 12, 2024 order. (Motion,
Badkoubehi Decl., Exh. A.) The order denied Plaintiff’s Renewed Motion to
Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents. (Id. at Exh. A, p.1.) The Renewed
Motion sought reconsideration of the Court’s order dated May 16, 2024, in which
the Court denied Plaintiff’s initial Motion to Compel Production of Documents sought
by subpoenas issued to (1) Sammy Hakim; (2) Bank Of Hope; (3) Bank Of America,
N.A.; (4) Capital One, N.A.; (5) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Newrez, LLC; (6)
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; (7) Chex Systems, Inc.; and (8) Lexisnexis Risk
Solutions, Inc. (Id. at Exh. A, p. 2; Minute Order, 05/16/24, pp. 1-2.) The
subpoenas at issue in the May 16, 2024 and June 12, 2024 orders were issued in
June and July 2023. (Motion, filed 09/25/23, Exhs. A, C.) Attorney Badkoubehi
goes on to declare that they “have been informed that Plaintiff herein has a
practice of serving subpoenas since that date without giving any notice and in
violation of the Court’s order.” (Id. at ¶4.) Also, Attorney Badkoubehi
has contacted some of these entities and been informed that Plaintiff
subpoenaed them for production of records without Hakim’s knowledge. (Id.
at ¶6.) Although these are hearsay statements, they are sufficient to initiate
the contempt proceedings. (Freeman v. Superior Court, San Diego County (1955)
44 Cal.2d 533, 537.) Nor has Plaintiff filed an affidavit in response. Therefore,
the Motion for an Order to Show Cause Re Contempt is granted. The Motion for an
Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt is granted.

Third-party Sammy
Hakim’s Motion for Order to Show Cause Regarding Contempt is GRANTED. THE ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING CONTEMPT IS SET FOR DECEMBER 18, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN
DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
