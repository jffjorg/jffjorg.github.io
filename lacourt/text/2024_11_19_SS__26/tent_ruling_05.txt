Beckett v. Couture, et al.MOTION TO
COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION,
(CCP §§ 2031.300)
ANALYSIS:
 
On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff Anthony Beckett (“Plaintiff”)
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Steven Couture (“Defendant
Couture”). (Motion, Kennedy Decl., Exh.
1.) Despite a meet and confer effort, to date, Defendant Couture has not served
verified responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One. (Id.
at ¶7-8 and Exh. 2.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to
Request for Production, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on July 18, 2024. The
Motion was set for hearing on August 12, 2024. On July 24, 2024, the Court
vacated the hearing date; on August 8, 2024, the Court reset the Motion hearing
for September 24, 2024. No notice of the new hearing date was in the Court’s
docket so the matter was continued again to November 19, 2024. (Minute Order,
09/24/24.) 
 
Notice of the new hearing date was mailed to the parties by
the Court on the same date. (Certificate of Mailing, 09/24/24.) However, on
October 9, 2024, notice to one of the parties was returned with an indication
that the party was deceased. (Returned Mail, 10/09/24.) No opposition to the
Motion has been filed to date. 
 
Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff’s counsel of record
to appear for the hearing and address this apparent change of status in the
parties.
