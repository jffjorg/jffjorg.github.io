And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions. As a result, the Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with prejudice. The Defendant is also awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,225.00, which must be paid within 20 days of the order.

The Judge's decision is based on the Plaintiff's failure to comply with a discovery order. Despite being served with a notice of the Court's ruling, the Plaintiff failed to serve responses or pay sanctions. The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted given the Plaintiff's willful disobedience of the discovery order.

The Judge also awards monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff in connection with the Defendant's motion. The sanctions are based on five hours of attorney time billed at $245.00. The Court's previous order of sanctions in connection with the motions to compel responses also remains in effect.
