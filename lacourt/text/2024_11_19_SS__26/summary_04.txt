And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Movses Melkumyan, has filed three motions to compel responses to discovery requests and seek sanctions against the plaintiff, Jennifer Jacqueline Godoy. The defendant served the discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a request for production of documents, on May 7, 2024. Despite a meet-and-confer effort, the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests. The defendant filed the motions to compel responses and sanctions on September 18, 2024, and no opposition has been filed.

The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that the defendant is entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. The court also finds that the amount of sanctions sought is excessive and awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $884.95, which is based on four hours of attorney time billed at $175.00 per hour and costs of $61.65 per motion.

The court grants the defendant's motions to compel responses and sanctions and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days of the service of this order. The court also orders the plaintiff to pay the sanctions of $884.95 to defense counsel within 20 days of the service of this order.
