ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Fasica Shiferaw (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
motor vehicle negligence against Defendant Administrative Services Cooperative,
Inc. (erroneously sued as United Checker Cab CO-OP) (“Defendant”) on April 5,
2022. Defendant answered the Complaint on January 23, 2024. On August 7, 2024,
the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents, Sets One, and Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 08/07/24.) 
 
Defendant
filed the instant Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions on September 10, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The Court granted Defendant’s motions
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to interrogatories and requests for production,
and requests for sanctions on August 7, 2024. (Minute Order, 08/07/24;
Motion, Mendoza Decl., Exh. H.) Defendant served Plaintiff with Notice of the
Ruling on August 15, 2024. (Motion,
Flowers Decl., ¶3.) As of the filing of this Motion on September 10,
2024, Plaintiff has not complied with the order to serve responses or pay
sanctions. (Id. at ¶¶7-9.) 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiff’s non-compliance with the discovery order. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiff failed to serve responses as ordered. Nor has
Plaintiff filed an opposition to this noticed motion. This demonstrates that
compliance with the Court’s orders cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions.
Although terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not
required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) 
 
Monetary sanctions are also warranted for Plaintiff’s
non-compliance with the Court’s order to respond to discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (g).) Based on a lodestar calculation, sanctions of $1,225.00
are awarded to Defendants against Plaintiff in connection with the instant
Motion based on five hours of attorney time billed at $245.00. (Motion, Mendoza
Decl., ¶10.) The Court’s previous order of sanctions in connection with the
motions to compel responses also remains in effect. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Administrative Services Cooperative, Inc.’s Motion
for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF FASICA SHIFERAW’S COMPLAINT, FILED ON APRIL 5, 2022, IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. THE
REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS IS GRANTED AGAINST PLAINTIFF FASICA SHIFERAW IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,225.00, TO BE PAID
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
