And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Donald Cunningham's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff, Jennita Foster, filed an action for unlawful detainer against the defendant, who agreed to rent the premises for $2,190.00 per month. The plaintiff served a 3-day notice to perform covenants or quit, but the defendant failed to do so. The plaintiff demands possession of the premises due to the expiration of the fix-term lease. The defendant argues that possession of the premises is no longer at issue and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. However, the judge finds that the complaint is now adequate to state a cause of action for possession.
