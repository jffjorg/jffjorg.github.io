And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Donald Cunningham's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The motion was filed on September 30, 2024, and argued that the Complaint does not state a cause of action for unlawful detainer because possession of the Premises is no longer at issue and the Notice to Quit issued by Plaintiff is defective.

The judge finds that the Complaint does not require an amended Complaint to be filed, as it is adequate to state a cause of action for possession. The judge also finds that the Notice to Quit issued by Plaintiff did not strictly comply with statutory requirements, but this defect does not render the Complaint invalid.

The judge concludes that Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is denied, and the case will proceed as an ordinary civil action for possession.
