ANALYSIS:
 
On May 7, 2024, Defendant Movses Melkumyan (“Defendant”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff Jennifer Jacqueline
Godoy (“Plaintiff”). (Motions, Thacker Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the
deadline to serve verified responses without objections, Plaintiff has not
served responses. (Id. at Exhs. B-D.) Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions;
(2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions, on September 18, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.  
 
There is no
requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel
initial responses can be filed or granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 20230.290,
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant
is entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses to the
discovery requests without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.) 
 
Plaintiff’s failure
to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed.
However, the amount of sanctions sought is excessive under a lodestar
calculation for straightforward and unopposed motions to compel initial
responses. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $884.95
based on four hours of attorney time billed at $175.00 per hour and costs of $61.65
per motion. (Motions, Thacker
Decl., ¶5.) 
 
Conclusion
 

Defendant Movses Melkumyan’s (1)
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; and (3) Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
JENNIFER JACQUELINE GODOY IS TO SERVE
VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS FURTHER ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $884.95 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE
OF THIS ORDER.
