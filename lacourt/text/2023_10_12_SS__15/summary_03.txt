  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."
  - "The evidence falls far short of establishing that any containers of Mennen Shave Talc sold between 1959 and 1971 or 1962 contained asbestos, much less that it is more likely than not that the containers [the plaintiff] used contained asbestos."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the claims of plaintiffs Sueko Brockett and Steve Brockett that Sueko Brockett was exposed to asbestos in products she purchased at Safeway stores. The plaintiffs had dismissed their fraud and punitive damages claims, mooting the motion for summary adjudication. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs do not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence of exposure to asbestos-containing products from Safeway, citing the plaintiffs' deposition testimony that they cannot recall where they purchased the products. The judge found that the defendant has shifted the burden to the plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact, and that the plaintiffs have failed to do so. The judge noted that the case is similar to Berg v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., where the court held that the plaintiff's expert's declaration did not support a conclusion that all or most of the Mennen shave talc containers sold from 1959-1962 contained asbestos. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs' evidence falls far short of establishing that any products they purchased from Safeway contained asbestos, and that the defendant has met its burden to show that the plaintiffs do not possess and cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence. The motion is granted, and the defendant is to file a proposed judgment within five days.
