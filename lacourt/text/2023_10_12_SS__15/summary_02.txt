And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in response to two motions filed by Pfizer and the plaintiffs. The motions are related to the 1991 memo, which was produced inadvertently by Pfizer's attorneys in 2013. Pfizer claims that the memo is attorney-client privileged and demands that the plaintiffs' counsel destroy all copies of the memo. The plaintiffs argue that the memo is not privileged and that Pfizer waived its privilege by producing the memo and failing to take adequate steps to claw it back.

The judge rules that the 1991 memo is indeed attorney-client privileged and grants Pfizer's motion for a protective order. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' motion to declare that the memo is not privileged. The judge orders the plaintiffs' counsel to immediately destroy all copies of the memo, notify all experts and anyone else to whom they have sent copies of the memo to destroy all copies, and confirm in writing that all copies have been destroyed within 10 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the 1991 memo was produced inadvertently by Pfizer's attorneys in 2013 and that Pfizer has been taking reasonable steps to claw back the memo when it becomes aware that it is being used. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' counsel failed to take the necessary steps to notify Pfizer's counsel that they had obtained possession of the memo and to destroy it, as required by the California Supreme Court's ruling in Rico v. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
