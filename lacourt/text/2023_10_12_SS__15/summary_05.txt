And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC, Defendant, alleging lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge notes that a defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and that a court may dismiss the complaint without prejudice when dismissal is made pursuant to Section 418.10. The judge also cites several legal precedents, including Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz and Asahi Metal Industry Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court of California, Solano County.

The judge states that a plaintiff must provide specific evidentiary facts to allow the court to independently conclude whether jurisdiction is appropriate, and that a defendant is subject to a state's general jurisdiction if its contacts are so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the forum state. The judge also notes that a nonresident defendant may be subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum if the defendant has purposefully availed itself of forum benefits and the controversy is related to or "arises out of" a defendant's contacts with the forum.

The judge finds that Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC has provided evidence that it is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Connecticut, and therefore is not a resident of California and not subject to its general jurisdiction. However, the judge also notes that the Plaintiff has requested jurisdictional discovery to obtain evidence that Defendant's talc was in the DAP patching and caulk products to which Plaintiff was exposed, and therefore continues the motion to January 11, 2024, for jurisdictional discovery on this issue.
