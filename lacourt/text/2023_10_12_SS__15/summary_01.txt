Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Pfizer's motion for a protective order is granted, and the motion for an order that the 1991 memo is not attorney-client privileged is denied. The Judge finds that the 1991 memo is privileged and that Pfizer's counsel has been taking reasonable steps to claw back the document. The Judge also finds that plaintiffs' counsel has failed to notify Pfizer's counsel that they have obtained possession of the 1991 memo and has failed to destroy the document. Therefore, the Judge orders that plaintiffs' counsel must immediately destroy all copies of the 1991 memo in their possession, notify all experts and anyone else to whom they have sent copies of the memo that they must destroy all copies of it immediately, and confirm in writing within 10 days that all copies of the memo have been destroyed.
