CARLOS PINEDA,  
  
        
  vs.
 
KIA AMERICA, INC., et al.


 Case
  No.:  24STCV07918
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 2, 2025



 
Plaintiff Carlos Pineda’s motion to compel
further responses from Defendant Kia America, Inc. to his Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) is off calendar.  
Plaintiff and Defendant failed to appear at
the December 12, 2024, hearing scheduled for this matter, and did not
communicate to the Court either their acceptance of the Court’s tentative
ruling or request for oral argument.  The
Court continued the hearing to January 2, 2025, and ordered the parties to
schedule an IDC with this Court prior to the January 2, 2025, hearing.  Neither party has filed anything in response
to the December 12, 2024, order nor have they scheduled an IDC.  Accordingly, the Court deems that the parties
no longer require the Court’s assistance in the discovery dispute and so take
the matter off calendar.
