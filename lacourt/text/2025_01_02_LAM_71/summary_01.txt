And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take the matter of Plaintiff Carlos Pineda's motion to compel further responses from Defendant Kia America, Inc. off the calendar. This decision comes after both parties failed to appear at a scheduled hearing on December 12, 2024, and failed to communicate with the court about their intentions. The court had continued the hearing to January 2, 2025, and ordered the parties to schedule an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to the hearing. However, neither party filed a response to the court's order or scheduled an IDC, leading the court to conclude that the parties no longer require the court's assistance in resolving the discovery dispute.
