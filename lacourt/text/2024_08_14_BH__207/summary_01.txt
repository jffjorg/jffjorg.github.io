And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant Lucid Group USA, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in the action. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Issa Diab's lawsuit alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The court has ruled that the arbitration agreement between the parties is valid and enforceable. The agreement allows for opt-out within 60 days of signing the agreement, and the court has found that Plaintiff did not opt out of the arbitration provision.

The court has also found that the arbitration provision is not unconscionable, despite Plaintiff's arguments that it is a contract of adhesion and that Plaintiff had no bargaining power. The court has ruled that the parties have delegated the threshold issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, and that the arbitration agreement is enforceable.

As a result, the court has granted Defendant's petition to compel arbitration and stayed the proceedings in the action. The court has also vacated the Case Management Conference and set a Status Conference re Arbitration for March 18, 2025.
