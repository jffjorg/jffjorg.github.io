And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff A. U. C. to compel Defendant Aroldo Marroquin to comply with the court's November 30, 2023 order and to impose monetary sanctions. The judge notes that Defendant served responses to the discovery requests with objections, but has not provided supplemental responses. The judge also notes that Plaintiff has inquired about Defendant's compliance with the court's order.

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion to compel compliance because Defendant has already served responses, although they were served prior to the issuance of the court's November 30, 2023 order. The judge also denies Plaintiff's alternative motion for terminating sanctions because Defendant raised legitimate third-party privacy concerns and has not abandoned the case.

The judge concludes that Plaintiff is not entitled to conduct discovery to determine the full extent of Defendant's violations of the Immigration Consultant Act (ICA) as to other customers, and that the remedies available to Plaintiff are limited to individual claims.
