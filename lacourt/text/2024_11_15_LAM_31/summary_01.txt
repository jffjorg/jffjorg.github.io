```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Comerica Bank's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication as to the first and third causes of action (breach of promissory note and breach of personal guaranty) because there are triable issues of material fact with respect to modification of the note. The court has also denied the motion as to the second cause of action (foreclosure of security agreement and possession of collateral) because the parties orally modified the note and the court finds that the defendants have presented evidence sufficient to show that the plaintiff waived enforcement of the contract provision requiring amendment or modification to be in writing. The motion is also denied as to the fifth cause of action (account stated) because the plaintiff did not plead the claim and the evidence offered in support of the claim is irrelevant.
