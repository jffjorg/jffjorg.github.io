And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue discovery dates, which was filed on September 30, 2024, and construed as a motion to reopen discovery. The plaintiff sought to reopen discovery because of the complexity of the case and the need for additional discovery and witness testimony. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that there was no good cause to reopen discovery.

The judge considered the relevant factors, including the necessity of and reason for discovery, the diligence or lack of diligence of the parties, and the likelihood that permitting discovery would prevent the case from going to trial or interfere with the trial calendar. The judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause to reopen discovery and that the defendant had not been diligent in completing discovery.

As a result, the judge denied the motion to continue discovery dates and ordered the defendants to give notice, unless waived. The case is scheduled to go to trial on February 18, 2025.
