And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel discovery in a case involving an Insurance Claims Act (ICA) claim. The plaintiff argues that the defendant has not served responses to discovery requests, citing the defendant's opposition to the motion to compel. However, the judge notes that the opposition omits any indication that discovery responses were served or prepared. The judge also finds that the ICA is not a qui tam action, which is an action brought on behalf of the government under a statute that allows a private person to sue for a penalty and share a portion of the recovery with the government. Unlike qui tam actions, the ICA allows the plaintiff to keep all of the civil penalties recovered. The judge ultimately denies the plaintiff's request for discovery on other grounds not specified in the document.
