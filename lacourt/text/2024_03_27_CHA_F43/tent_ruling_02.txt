SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This action
arises from Plaintiff Brenda Vela’s (Plaintiff) purchase of an allegedly
defective 2021 Jeep Compass. On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint
against Defendant FCA US LLC (Defendant) and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive,
alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of the Song-Beverly Act—breach of
express warranty and (2) violation of the Song-Beverly Act—breach of implied
warranty.
 
On April 3,
2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.
 
On October 6,
2023, Plaintiff filed and served this unopposed motion to compel further
responses to special interrogatories and for monetary sanctions against
Defendant and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C., in the amount of $2,535.00.
 
On March 20,
2024, Plaintiff filed and served a notice of non-opposition to Plaintiff’s
motion to compel. 
 
As of March 22,
2024, Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was 
required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP
§ 1005(b).)
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant has not provide code-compliant responses to Special
Interrogatories numbers 18-23, 25, 26, 29-31, and 43-48, pursuant to CCP §§
2030.300(e) and 2023.030(g). Plaintiff argues that its interrogatories are
relevant and that there is good cause to require Defendant to answer them.
Plaintiff further argues that Defendant responded to the interrogatories with
insufficient, boilerplate responses, and answered several of the
interrogatories with the same response. Next, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
reliance on the option to produce writings was waived because it failed to
serve timely verified responses. Finally, Plaintiff argues that its
interrogatories were relevant, so Defendant should not have objected on
relevancy grounds.
 
The Discovery
Act allows “[a]ny party [to] obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other
party to the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.” (CCP §
2030.010(a).) “An interrogatory may relate to whether another party is making a
certain contention, or to the facts, witnesses, and writings on which a
contention is based.” (CCP § 2031.030(b).) The responding party must then
respond separately to each interrogatory with either an answer containing the
information sought to be discovered, an exercise of the party’s option to
produce writings, or an objection. (CCP § 2030.210.) If the demanding party
deems that “(1) [a]n answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete; (2) [a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate; [or] (3) [a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general,” the demanding party may seek an order compelling Code-complaint
responses. (CCP § 2030.300(a)(1)-(3).)
 
Plaintiff
argues in her motion that the motion is proper because it was timely filed and
she engaged in sufficient meet and confer by sending the letter that Defendant
did not respond to. Plaintiff also argues that there is good cause to seek
further responses to special interrogatories because the information sought in
the special interrogatories is material and relevant to Plaintiff’s claims.
 
Next, a party
is required to provide responses to interrogatories that are “as complete and 
straightforward
as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (CCP
§ 2030.220(a).) “If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be
answered to the extent possible.” (CCP § 2030.220(b).)
 
In response to
interrogatory numbers 18, 23, 26, 43, and 44, Defendant states “In California
and pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, FCA US would offer to
repurchase or replace a new motor vehicle if it contained a non-conformity
covered by the applicable limited express warranty that substantially impaired
its use, value or safety that was not repaired after a reasonable number of
attempts to do so.” Plaintiff argues that this is boilerplate text and is not
at all responsive to the questions being asked. Plaintiff argues that this is
not in accord with CCP § 2030.220(a) and (b) because it is not complete and
straightforward and does not answer to the extent possible. Plaintiff also
argues that this statement is conclusory and does not answer the question.
 
The Court
agrees with Plaintiff’s argument. Defendant cannot simply restate the same
answer over and over by copying and pasting its answer to prior interrogatories.
Defendant must answer each interrogatory individually to the best of its
ability.
 
Defendant also relies
on the option to produce writings under section 2030.230. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant has waived that right because it failed to timely serve verified
responses. (CCP § 2030.290(a); see Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [“Unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at
all.”]; see also Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
905-906.) Plaintiff argues that this means that further responses are
warranted. Defendant answered in this manner for interrogatory numbers 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 25, and 26.
 
If Defendant
wishes to answer in this manner, Defendant must submit verified responses. It
is also worth noting that several of the listed responses simply use
boilerplate, conclusory language that is the same as the other responses. Once
again, Defendant must respond to the interrogatories individually.
 
For the
remaining interrogatories, Defendant objected to them on the basis that they
are not relevant and not reasonably calculated to lead discoverable
information. Defendant used this argument for Interrogatory Numbers 29-31 and
45-47. For Interrogatory Number 48, it appears that Defendant did not answer
the interrogatory at all. While some of these interrogatories may have been
objectionable for being overly broad, Defendant did not verify its answers, and
most of the interrogatories are relevant to the case. Defendant must also state
why the particular answers are objectionable, rather than simply copying and
pasting the same objection to every interrogatory.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant must submit verified, code-compliant responses to Special
Interrogatories numbers 18-23, 25, 26, 29-31, and 43-48. Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to special interrogatories is granted.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010(d)-(f); CCP § 2031.310(h).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the total amount of $2,535.00 against Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel of record. The amount was based on $975.00 in attorney fees
(at $375.00 an hour for 2.6 hours), $60.00 in costs, an expected $750.00 for reviewing
the opposition and preparing a reply, and an expected $750.00 for attending the
hearing. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 8.) Because no opposition and no reply were filed, the
Court will only impose an additional $750.00 for attorney fees for the hearing
on this matter. That makes the total amount of sanctions $1,785.00.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record is
granted in the total amount of $1,785.00.
