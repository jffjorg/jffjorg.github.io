SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
December 3, 2021, Plaintiffs were involved in an automobile accident. On November
29, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Motor Vehicle and Negligence.
 
Plaintiff Ruzanna Hovhannisyan submits a petition for
approval for minors compromises on behalf of Alfost Khalatyan (16) for a settlement
with defendant Mario Valenzula for $11,000. Petitioner represents total deductions
of $5,500 as follows: $56.25 in medical expenses to the Department of
Healthcare Services, and $2,7500 in attorney fees (25%), thereby leaving a net
balance of $5,500.
 
The settlement exceeds $5,000 and the payment will therefore
be deposited into a blocked account. (Probate Code §§ 3610, 3611(b).)
 
This Court previously continued
the hearing on this petition because petitioner had not filed proof of service.
Proof of service of the petition was filed on January 3, 2024, and proof of
service of the continued hearing was filed on March 19, 2024. Now that proof of
service has been filed, it appears that everything is in order to approve the
Minor’s Compromise. The petition and proposed order were filed on the MC-350
and MC-351 forms. The petitions comply with CCP § 372; Probate Code §§ 3500,
3600-3613; and Cal. Rules of Court Rules 3.1384, 7.101, 7.950-7.952.
 
The Court approves the Petition to
Confirm Minor’s Compromise filed on behalf of Alfost Khalatyan.
 
The Court will also set a hearing to verify the deposit of
funds into the blocked account. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
