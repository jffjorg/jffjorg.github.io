And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Brenda Vela's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from Defendant FCA US LLC. The motion was filed because Defendant failed to provide complete and straightforward responses to the special interrogatories, instead providing boilerplate and conclusory language. The judge found that Defendant's responses were evasive and incomplete, and that Defendant had waived its right to rely on the option to produce writings by failing to serve timely verified responses. As a result, the judge has ordered Defendant to serve supplemental responses within 30 days and has granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,785.00.
