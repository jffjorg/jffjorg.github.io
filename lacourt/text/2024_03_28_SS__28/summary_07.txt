And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions. The defendant did not respond to the plaintiffs' requests for admission and is now seeking to withdraw or amend those admissions. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond was not the result of excusable neglect, as the law firm representing the defendant had already assigned a new attorney to the case after the initial handling attorney resigned. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300 and noted that the requirements for relief under this section are similar to those governing relief from default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The judge ultimately denied the motion, finding that the defendant had not shown that the deemed admissions resulted from the mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect of the defendant or his counsel.
