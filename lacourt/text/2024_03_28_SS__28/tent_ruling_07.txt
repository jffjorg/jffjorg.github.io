 Case Number:  23STCV04214    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving and opposing papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
February 27, 2023, Plaintiffs David Hurtado-Segura (“Hurtado-Segura”) and Luis
Mejia (“Mejia”) filed this action against Defendants Carmen Fernandez
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for negligence. 
On
June 28, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
December 11, 2023, the Court granted Hurtado-Segura’s and Mejia’s motions to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission served on Defendant. 
On
January 22, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to be relieved from deemed
admissions, be heard on March 28, 2024. On March 15, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for August 26, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court for relief from the order deeming admitted matters specified in
requests for admission. 
Plaintiffs
ask the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300 provides: 
“(a) A party may withdraw or amend an admission made
in response to a request for admission only on leave of court granted after
notice to all parties. 
“(b) The court may permit withdrawal or amendment of
an admission only if it determines that the admission was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained
the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s
action or defense on the merits. 
“(c) The court may impose conditions on the granting
of the motion that are just, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) An order that the
party who obtained the admission be permitted to pursue additional discovery
related to the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended admission. 
“(2) An order
that the costs of any additional discovery be borne in whole or in part by the
party withdrawing or amending the admission.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300.) 
“The
trial court's discretion in ruling on a motion to withdraw or amend an
admission is not unlimited, but must be exercised in conformity with the spirit
of the law and in a manner that serves the interests of justice. Because the
law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying
section 2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.
Accordingly, the court's discretion to deny a motion under the statute is
limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence, or
neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the withdrawal or amendment
would substantially prejudice the party who obtained the admission in
maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.”  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420–1421 (New
Albertsons).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
June 6, 2023, Hurtado-Segura and Mejia served requests for admission on
Defendant. Defendant did not serve timely responses and had not served
responses by September 25, 2023, when Hurtado-Segura and Mejia filed motions to
deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission.  Defendant did not oppose the motions and did
not appear at the hearing on the motions.  On December 11, 2023, the Court granted the
motions and deemed admitted the matters specified in the requests for
admission. 
Defendant
now argues that the attorney initially assigned to handle Defendant’s case
resigned in November 2023.  Defendant’s
case “was left unassigned for several months” until the law firm that
represents Defendant hired more attorneys and assigned Defendant’s current attorney
to the case in January 2024.  Based on these facts, Defendant
argues that the law firm’s “excusable neglect” caused the failure to respond to
Plaintiffs’ requests for admission. 
The
party against whom a “deemed admitted” has been entered “may seek relief . . .
by filing a motion to withdraw or amend the ‘deemed admission’ under [Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.300].”  (L.
Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1369.5, p. 8G-23 (Cal. Practice Guide).)  The court will permit a party to withdraw or amend
an admission only if the court finds (1) the admission resulted from mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect and (2) the party who obtained the admission
will not be substantially prejudiced.  (Id.,
¶ 8:1386.1, p. 8G-30, citing Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.300, subd. (b).) 
“The
requirements for relief under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300] are
similar to those governing relief from default under [Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b)].  The terms
‘mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect’ as used in [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.300] are given the same meanings as similar terms found
in [Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)].”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1386.2, p. 8G-30, citing New Albertsons, supra,
168 Cal.App.4th at p. 1419.)   
“Counsel’s
failure to discharge routine professional duties is not excusable” for purposes
of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  (Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 5:341.2, p. 5-103.) 
“ ‘Conduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as failure
to timely object or to properly advance an argument, is not therefore
excusable.’ ”  (Ibid., quoting Generale
Bank Nederland, N.V. v. Eyes of the Beholder Ltd. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th
1384, 1400.) 
“In
the absence of an ‘attorney affidavit of fault’ [citation], attorney neglect is
imputed to the client.  If the neglect is
excusable, the party is excused.  If
inexcusable, . . . there is no ground for relief under [Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b)].”  (Cal.
Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:341, p. 5-102.) 
The
attorney declaration attached to Defendant’s motion describes the resignation
of Defendant’s initial handling attorney and the law firm’s delay in assigning
a new attorney to the case.  However, the
declaration does not acknowledge the law firm’s fault or admit “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” 
The
Court finds that Defendant has not shown that the “deemed admissions” resulted
from the mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect of Defendant or his counsel.  Therefore, the Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES Defendant Carmen Fernandez’s motion to be
relieved from deemed admissions. 
          Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling with the Court within five days.
