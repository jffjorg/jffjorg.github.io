The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has considered the motions and supplemental papers and rules as follows. The case involves Taylor Briscoe as the Plaintiff and Heide Orellana as the Defendant. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company intervened in the case and filed an answer in intervention and cross-complaint.

The Plaintiff filed the action against the Defendant and Does 1-50 for negligence on April 20, 2020. The Plaintiff filed proof of service showing substituted service on the Defendant on November 9, 2021, and on February 17, 2022. The Clerk entered the Defendant's default on March 29, 2022. The Court dismissed the action without prejudice on July 15, 2022, but granted the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal on March 3, 2023. The Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice on May 24, 2023.

The Intervenor, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, filed a motion to set aside the entry of default on November 30, 2023. The Court heard argument and denied the motion.

The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), which allows the Court to correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, or to set aside any void judgment or order. The Intervenor argued that the Court should set aside the Defendant's default because it has a direct and immediate interest in contesting the Defendant's liability and litigating both liability and damages, and because the summons and complaint were not timely served on the Defendant.

The Court found that the Intervenor's argument was not supported by legal authority. The Court denied the motion and set the case for further hearing on March 28, 2024.
