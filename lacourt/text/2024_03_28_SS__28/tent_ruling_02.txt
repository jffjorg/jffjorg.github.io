 Case Number:  20STCV15001    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving and supplemental papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 20, 2020, Plaintiff Taylor Briscoe (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Heide Orellana (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
November 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service on Defendant of the summons, complaint, and other documents on November
2, 2021. 
On
February 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service on Defendant of a statement of damages on February 14, 2022. 
On
March 29, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
July 15, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. On March 3,
2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. 
On
May 24, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
November 17, 2023, the Court granted Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance
Company’s ex parte application to intervene and to file an answer in
intervention. 
On
November 27, 2023, Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company
(“Intervenor”) filed an answer in intervention and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-50 for equitable indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief. 
On
November 30, 2023, Intervenor filed a motion to set aside entry of default, to
be heard on March 8, 2024.  The Court
continued the hearing to March 12, 2024. 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
On
March 8, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument, and continued
the hearing to March 28, 2024. 
On
March 21, 2024, Intervenor filed an additional brief. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
INTERVENOR’S REQUEST 
Intervenor asks the Court to set aside Defendant’s default. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), provides: 
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or
its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered,
so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (d).)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Framing the issues 
Citing
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), Intervenor argues that
the Court should set aside Defendant’s default.  Intervenor does
not, however, assert or show that the default contains a “clerical mistake” or
is “void” for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d).  Similarly, Intervenor does not establish
a basis for relief from default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, or under the Court’s
equitable power based on extrinsic fraud or mistake.  (See, e.g., L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:276, p. 5-74 to
¶ 5:473, p. 5-139 (Cal. Practice Guide).) 
Instead,
Intervenor argues the Court should vacate Defendant’s default because (1) “Intervenor
has a direct and immediate interest in contesting [Defendant’s] liability and
litigating both liability and damages” and (2) “The summons and complaint were
not timely served on [Defendant].” 
(Motion p. 2.)  The Court
addresses each argument below. 
B.    Intervenor’s
interest in the case 
As
clarified at the March 8, 2024 hearing, Intervenor asserts that once an insurer
intervenes in a case to protect its interests, the Court is required to set
aside a default entered against the insurer’s insured.  As authority for this proposition, Intervenor
relies on Western Heritage Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1196 (Western Heritage). 
In Western
Heritage, the insurer (Western Heritage) provided a defense to its insured,
a commercial provider of home health care services, and to the insured’s
employee in an action for damages resulting from an automobile accident.  The plaintiff alleged that the employee’s negligence
resulted in the decedent’s death and that Western Heritage was vicariously
liable for the employee’s negligence.  The
trial court struck the employee’s answer and entered her default because she
did not provide discovery responses or appear for her deposition.  (Western Heritage, supra, 199
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1199-1200.) 
To
protect its interests, Western Heritage moved to intervene.  The trial court granted the motion to
intervene but ordered that Western Heritage could dispute only damages and not
the employee’s liability.  (Western
Heritage, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 1200.)  “Since the claim against the insured was
vicarious and depended upon evidence of the employee’s wrongful conduct, this
order effectively precluded Western Heritage from contesting liability at all.”  (Id. at p. 1200, fn. 1.) 
The
Court of Appeal granted writ relief, holding that “Western Heritage, as an
intervener, has the right to assert, on its own behalf, all defenses that
otherwise would be available to the insured parties whether as to liability or
damages.” (Western Heritage, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 1200.)
 The court
reasoned that “there would be no purpose in allowing an insurer to intervene in
order to protect its own interests but then limit the scope of the insurer’s
defense to those issues to which its insured, because of [a] default, is
limited to pursuing.”  (Id. at p. 1207.)  In other words, “an intervening insurer is
not bound by a default taken against its insured.”  (Id. at p. 1211, emphasis omitted.)  “Thus, an insurer intervening in an action to
pursue its own interests after its insured has defaulted is not required to
move to vacate the insured’s default as to itself; the insured’s default simply
has no effect on the insurer.”  (Ibid.,
emphasis added.) 
Western
Heritage confirms that an intervenor can
protect its interests without an order setting aside its insured’s default.  The decision does not support Intervenor’s
argument that the Court is required to set aside Defendant's default. 
C.   Service of summons and complaint 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b), provides: 
“The complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of
service on those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days of the
filing of the complaint.”  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.110(b).) 
Here,
Plaintiff served the summons and complaint more than 60 days after filing the
complaint, beyond the rule’s deadline.  Intervenor
argues the Court therefore should vacate Defendant’s default. 
Intervenor
has cited no authority for the proposition that a plaintiff’s failure to serve
the summons and complaint within 60 days of filing the complaint voids the
defendant’s subsequent default.  In fact,
the statutory and rule-based penalties for failing to effect timely service under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b) do not include voiding a default: 
·       Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(f), “If a
party fails to serve and file pleadings as required under [rule 3.110], and has
not obtained an order extending time to serve its pleadings, the court may
issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed.’  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(f).)  “The court is presumably limited to awarding
monetary sanctions for violation of Rule 3.110.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:352,
p. 4-63.) 
·       “[T]he court has discretion to dismiss an action for
delay in service exceeding two years after filing a claim against the
defendant.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:353, p. 4-64, citing Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 583.410, 583.420, subd. (a)(1).) 
·       “[I]f service is not completed within three years,
dismissal is mandatory.”  (Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 4:356, p. 4-64, citing Code Civ. Proc., §§ 583.2100,
583.250.) 
 Intervenor
has not provided legal authority supporting its argument that the Court should
set aside Defendant’s default.  The Court
denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company’s motion to set
aside Defendant Heide Orellana’s default entered on March 29, 2022. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
