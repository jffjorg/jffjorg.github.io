BACKGROUND 
On

against Defendants Veteran’s Towing & Transport, Inc. (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-25 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. 
On
February 16, 2021, the Court entered Defendant’s default. 
On
April 22, 2022, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice. 
On

true name, Veterans Towing, LLC. 
On

8, 2022, and February 15, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate
the dismissal. 
On

on Defendant of (1) the summons, complaint, and other documents on October 4,
2022 and (2) a statement of damages on December 3, 2022. 
On

On
February 22, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a request for Court judgment to be heard
on March 28, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Veterans Towing,
LLC and award Plaintiff $78,967.04, consisting of $8,370.82 in special damages,
$70,000.00 in general damages, and $596.22 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter
Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is
not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties
under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause
of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has not provided a copy of the statement of damages served on Defendant on December 3, 2022. 
The Court must ensure that the damages sought in the default judgment application
do not exceed the amounts listed in the statement of damages.  The Court continues the hearing and orders
Plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration providing a copy of the
statement of damages served on Defendant on
December 3, 2022. 
Plaintiff
should also provide a new Declaration of Mailing for the CIV-100 form.  The current Declaration of Mailing states
that Plaintiff mailed the form to “Bryce Doe” on October 4, 2022 and to “Juan
Doe” on December 3, 2022.  Plaintiff
should ensure that he is serving the appropriate person or persons and list the
correct date(s) of service. 
The
JUD-100 form states that the total amount requested is “78,967.”  The Court will assume that the total amount
requested is $78,967.04 (the combined amount of the damages and costs listed). 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff Eugene
Taulbee’s application for default judgment to April 29, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
The
Court orders Plaintiff Eugene Taulbee to submit a supplemental declaration by
April 23, 2024 providing (1) a copy of the statement of damages served on Defendant
Veterans Towing, LLC on December 3, 2022, and (2) a new Declaration of
Mailing for the CIV-100 form. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
