The Court has granted the plaintiffs' motions to compel discovery and deem requests for admissions admitted. The defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, which constitutes discovery abuse and warrants sanctions. The Court awards the plaintiffs $820 in sanctions for two hours of attorney time at a rate of $350 per hour and $120 in filing fees. The defendant is also ordered to pay one $60 filing fee to the Court. The sanctions and fees are to be paid within 30 days of notice of the Court's order.
