And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by the defendant, Roberto Corzo, in an action for negligence. The motions seek to compel the plaintiff, Junior Blake, to respond to discovery requests and to appear for deposition. The court grants the motions to compel discovery, finding that the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the defendant's discovery requests. However, the court denies the motion to compel deposition, finding that the defendant failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff to reschedule the deposition after the plaintiff's original counsel suffered a stroke. The court awards the defendant $510 in sanctions for 3 hours of attorney time at a rate of $150 per hour and $60 in filing fees.
