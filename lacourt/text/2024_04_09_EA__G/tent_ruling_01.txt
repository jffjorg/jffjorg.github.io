TENTATIVE RULING

reduced amount of $66,316.52. Fundation Group LLC is further ordered to submit an updated proposed judgment consistent with

BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In December 2022, Plaintiff Fundation Group LLC
(Fundation Group) entered into an agreement with Defendants Meza Poultry L.L.C.
(Meza Poultry) and Jacqueline Garcia in which Fundation Group agreed to extend
a business line of credit to Meza Poultry and Garcia. In January 2023,
Fundation Group alleges Meza Poultry and Garcia breached the agreement by
failing to make timely installment payments and owe an outstanding sum of
$53,189.84.
On July
3, 2023, Fundation Group filed a complaint against Meza Poultry, Garcia, and
Does 1-10, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract and (2) money
had and received. On August 8, Fundation Group’s process server served Garcia
with substitute service in El Monte. On September 4, Fundation Group’s process
server served Meza Poultry with substitute service at the same address.
On February
27, 2024, default was entered against Meza Poultry and Garcia. On the same day,
Fundation Group submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for April 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Fundation
Group seeks default judgment against Meza Poultry and Garcia in the total amount
of $66,908.42, including $53,189.84 in damages, $10,417.33 in interest, $2,545.70
in attorney fees, and $755.55 in costs. Because the court finds Fundation Group
has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application
for default judgment with the following modification. While Fundation Group
requests $2,545.70 in attorney fees, the court finds the reasonable amount of attorney
fees is $1,953.80 ($1,890 + $63.7968 or 2% of $3,189.84) pursuant to Local Rule
3.214.
Accordingly,
the total judgment amount is reduced to $66,316.52.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Fundation
Group’s application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $66,316.52. Fundation Group
is further ordered to submit an updated proposed judgment in accordance with
this ruling.
