And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to vacate and reset, or continue trial. The defendant has shown good cause for a continuance because it has filed a timely motion for summary judgment, and the hearing is set for February 20, 2025. The current trial date is set for March 14, 2024, but the court has advanced the date of trial to early April 2025. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date. The defendant is ordered to give notice.
