part.
Background
This arises from
a motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on August 19, 2020.  Plaintiff Naser Baharloo (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action on September 13, 2021, asserting motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence causes of action against Defendant Mina George Baskharon (“Defendant”), and Does 1
through 10.  Defendant filed an Answer on
March 22, 2023.
 
On March
22, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demands for Production of
Documents. (Yerzinkyan Decls., ¶ 2.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.
 
On August
1, 2023, Defendant filed the three motions that are currently before the Court,
seeking to compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses the Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of Documents.  
 
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even
if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and] substantially
resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses … the trial court
retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On March
22, 2023, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Demands for Production of Documents (Set One) on
Plaintiff. (Yerzinkyan Decls., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff
did not serve responses. (Id., ¶ 3.)  
 
Plaintiff
did not file an opposition to any of these three motions.
 
Defendant need not show anything more.  Defendant’s three motions to compel are
GRANTED.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in
part.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses, and the
economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court
sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $354.15, calculated based on 1.5
hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $195 per hour,
plus a $61.65 filing fee.  (See Yerzinkyan
Decls., ¶ 5.)
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of Documents are
GRANTED.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant
written responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories
(Set One), and Demands for Production of Documents (Set
One) within 30 days of notice of this order.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part.  The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of
record Steven Slavitt, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to
Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $1,062.45 within
30 days of notice of this order.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
