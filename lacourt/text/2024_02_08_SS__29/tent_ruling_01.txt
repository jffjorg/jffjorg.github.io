  Case Number:  20STCV20123    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Geovanni
Solis.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Background
On May 27, 2020, Plaintiff Geovanni Solis (“Plaintiff”)
filed his complaint against Defendant Martha Lewis (“Defendant”) for the causes
of action of (1) Assault, (2) Battery, and (3) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress.
The Defendant’s default was entered on
November 2, 2020.  Default judgment was
never entered, despite several attempts by Plaintiff to submit sufficient
default judgment papers and the issuance of numerous OSCs re dismissal for
Plaintiff failure to submit a proper default judgment packet.
On December 15, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel
failed to appear at an OSC hearing.  The
hearing was continued to January 20, 2023. 
On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel appeared; the Court reviewed
the default papers, identified certain defects, and continued the OSC hearing
to March 9, 2023.
On March 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel again
failed to appear at the OSC hearing.  The
Court dismissed the case without prejudice.
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion
to set aside the dismissal.  No
opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…” (Code Civ. Pro., §473, subd. (b).) 
To qualify for relief under section 473,
the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit
affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the
default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.) 
“In a motion under section 473 the initial
burden is on the moving party to prove excusable neglect by a “preponderance of
the evidence. [Citations]”” (Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d
619, 624.) “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory
excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after
discovery of the default.” (Id. at 625.)
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
counsel states that dismissal occurred because his office miscalendared the hearing
date. (Lee Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
No opposition
has been filed.
 
The Court finds
Plaintiff has established the dismissal occurred due to counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.  This
motion was filed diligently, less than a month after the dismissal.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal is
GRANTED.   
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal is GRANTED.
 
The Court SETS ASIDE the Order of dismissal dated March
9, 2023.
 
The Court sets an OSC re dismissal for failure to file a
complete and accurate set of default judgment papers for _______________, 2024,
at 8:30 am, in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
                                                                                                                                                            
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
