And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was originally filed by Geovanni Solis against Martha Lewis on May 27, 2020, and the defendant's default was entered on November 2, 2020. Despite several attempts by the plaintiff to submit sufficient default judgment papers, default judgment was never entered. The plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at an OSC hearing on December 15, 2022, and again on March 9, 2023, resulting in the case being dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal on April 3, 2023, stating that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court finds that the plaintiff has established a satisfactory excuse for the default and has acted diligently in seeking relief. Therefore, the court grants the motion to set aside the dismissal and sets an OSC re dismissal for failure to file a complete and accurate set of default judgment papers for February 8, 2024.
