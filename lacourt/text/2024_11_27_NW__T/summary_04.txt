Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's ex parte opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike. The plaintiff, Tatia Calhoun, claimed that she did not receive the demurrer and motion to strike and that she was hospitalized between August 29, 2024 and September 2, 2024. However, the court found that the plaintiff had admitted to requesting additional time due to her surgery and that the subsequent notice of the ruling was served upon her at the same address, which she evidently received in order to file the opposition and ex parte opposition. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to present any new or different facts, law, or circumstances to support her claims.

The court noted that the plaintiff's hospitalization did not provide sufficient reasons for her failure to respond to the demurrer/motion to strike between July 24, 2024 and August 29, 2024 or between September 3, 2024 and September 12, 2024. The court also found that the plaintiff's assertion that she was in discussion with a new attorney, Dennis Block, was not supported by any additional facts.

The court further noted that the plaintiff's ex parte opposition was not persuasive and was denied. The court ordered the plaintiff to advise the court and counsel by filing a change of address form if she is no longer receiving mail at the address on her papers.
