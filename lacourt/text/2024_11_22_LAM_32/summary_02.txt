And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Daniel N. Glassman and Glassman Technology Group, Inc. (GTG), against the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Justin Mayer. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, converted plaintiff's property, and failed to account for profits made from the exploitation of software and intellectual property.

The judge finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and common count. The judge also finds that the demurrer is OVERRULED, meaning that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge also addresses the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the federal court's remand of the case to state court is final and binding. The judge concludes that the state court retains subject matter jurisdiction over the case.

The judge's ruling is based on several legal principles, including the requirement that a complaint must be sufficient to state a cause of action, and the doctrine of judicial estoppel, which prohibits a party from asserting a position in one court that is contrary to a position taken in another court. The judge also cites several cases that support his ruling, including Hahn v. Mirda, Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power, and Landmark Screens, LLC v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP.
