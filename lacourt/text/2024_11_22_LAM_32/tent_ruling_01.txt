AERRIANNA MCCLELLAN,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
KIEWIT INFRASTRUCTURE WEST CO., et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV20733
  Hearing Date:  November 22, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant kiewit infrastructure west
  co.’s motion to compel deposition




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff
Aerrianna McClellan filed this action against Defendants Kiewit Infrastructure
West Co. and Katie Williams, asserting FEHA claims and wage violations. 
            On October 22, 2024, Defendant
Kiewit filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination . . . or
to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
 
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant served a deposition notice
on September 27, 2024, setting Plaintiff’s deposition for October 16, 2024.
(Shook Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B.) Plaintiff did not serve written objections to the
notice. (Id., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff failed to appear on October 16, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 6.) Thereafter, Defendant attempted to contact Plaintiff to discuss the
deposition, but Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 7.) 
            These facts show that Plaintiff has
failed to appear for a duly noticed deposition. Therefore, an order compelling
the deposition is warranted. Defendant’s preemptive request for terminating
sanctions is unnecessary at this stage. Should Plaintiff fail to appear for the
court-ordered deposition, Defendant may file a separate motion for sanctions to
address that. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall appear for deposition on or before
_______________, 2024.
