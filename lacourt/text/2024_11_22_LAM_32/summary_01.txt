And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Kiewit Infrastructure West Co.'s motion to compel the deposition of Aerrianna McClellan, the plaintiff in this case. The motion was filed on October 22, 2024, and the plaintiff did not file an opposition. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to appear for a deposition that was scheduled on October 16, 2024, and failed to serve written objections to the deposition notice. The judge ruled that an order compelling the deposition is warranted, and granted the defendant's motion to compel. The plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition on or before a date to be determined, and the defendant may file a separate motion for sanctions if the plaintiff fails to appear for the court-ordered deposition.
