            v.

                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  24STCV22893
  Hearing Date:  November 22, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s demurrer to complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff Yan
Zhang filed this legal malpractice action against Defendant Ping C. Shen. The
complaint alleges that Plaintiff hired Defendant to represent her in a civil
case regarding her late husband. Defendant allegedly failed to appear for a
hearing on September 8, 2023, causing Plaintiff to lose her case. Plaintiff
sues for unspecified monetary damages. 
            On October 17, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiff filed a late opposition on
November 18, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Shen Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            “The elements of a claim for
professional negligence are (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill,
prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and
exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between
the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage
resulting from the professional's negligence.” (Paul v. Patton (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1095, internal citations omitted.)
            The facts alleged are sufficient to
state a claim for legal malpractice. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant was
her attorney and therefore owed her a duty of care. Plaintiff has alleged that
Defendant breached his duty by failing to appear at a hearing. Plaintiff has
alleged causation and damages because the failure to appear caused her to lose
the case and sustain monetary damages. The precise hearing that Defendant
supposedly failed to appear for, and how the failure to appear caused Plaintiff
to lose the case, are factual matters for discovery. For pleading purposes, the
allegations are sufficient “to put the defendant on notice about what the
plaintiff is complaining and what remedies are being sought.” (See Leek v.
Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 415.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
