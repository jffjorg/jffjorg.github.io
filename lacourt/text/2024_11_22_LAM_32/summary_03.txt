And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to deem matters admitted in a case between plaintiff Javier De La Rosa and defendants Fat-Buffalo Foods, Inc. and Sherry Doe. The plaintiff filed the motion on October 18, 2024, after the defendants failed to respond to discovery requests despite a voluntary extension. The judge has granted the motion, stating that the matters in RFAs Set One will be deemed admitted unless the defendants serve substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion. The defendants have failed to respond to discovery despite the extension, and the judge has noted that this failure is a waiver of any objections the defendants may have had. The plaintiff originally filed the action on June 28, 2024, alleging causes of action for discrimination, wrongful termination, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and harassment.
