TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 




AND RELATED
  CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Michael
Y. Lavaee, Esq. of Lavaee Law Group (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel
for Defendants and Cross-Complainants Samuel Ohana and Tamim, LLC.  
While Counsel has provided sufficient
reason for withdrawal, Counsel’s declaration (Form MC-052) and the proposed
order (Form MC-053) do not reference the Final Status Conference set for March
15, 2024 in this action. The Court notes that pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (e), “[t]he proposed
order relieving counsel…must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action
or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.”   
In addition, Item 9(b) of the proposed
order lists the March 27, 2024 trial date, but does not specify the time of the
trial. Item 6 of Counsel’s declaration lists the March 27, 2024 trial date, but
does not specify the time or place of the trial. 
Further, Item 6 of the proposed order does
not list Counsel’s clients’ telephone numbers. 
Lastly, the Court notes that on November
2, 2023 (after the instant motion was filed), a motion to strike, or in the
alternative to tax costs was filed and set for hearing on July 22, 2024. 
The Court notes that any amended motion must reference this hearing.
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (e), “[t]he proposed order relieving counsel…must specify
all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of
trial, if known.”)  
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the motion without
prejudice.  
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this Order.
