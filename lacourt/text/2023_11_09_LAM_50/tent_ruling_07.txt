[1]The first and
third causes of action are alleged against the District only, and the second, fourth,
and fifth causes of action are alleged against both Defendants. The Court notes
that in the SAC, the fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress is incorrectly labelled as the “fifth cause of action.”
Similarly, the fifth cause of action for false imprisonment is incorrectly
labeled as the “sixth cause of action.” 


[2]In addition, the Jeffra
Court found that “[t]he authorities support the proposition that an
internal investigation by a state-created entity is an ‘official proceeding
authorized by law.’” (Jeffra v.
California State Lottery, supra, 39 Cal.App.5th at p. 482.)
Defendants do not appear to provide evidence that the District is a “state-created
entity.”
