And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the lawsuit. The court notes that the plaintiff's amended complaint (SAC) incorrectly labels the fourth and fifth causes of action. Additionally, the court points out that the defendants do not provide evidence that the District is a "state-created entity", which is relevant to the court's consideration of the case. The court cites a previous case, Jeffra v. California State Lottery, which supports the proposition that an internal investigation by a state-created entity is an "official proceeding authorized by law". The judge intends to correct the labeling error and determine if the District is a "state-created entity" before the next court hearing.
