Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike filed by the defendants, Manhattan Beach Unified School District, against the plaintiff, Nancy Klosowski. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity and are therefore subject to an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge finds that the defendants have failed to establish that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity and denies the special motion to strike. The judge also denies the defendants' request for attorney's fees.
