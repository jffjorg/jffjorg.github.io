TENTATIVE RULING
  RE: 
 
MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE



 
Background
Plaintiff
Ayako Kosuge (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on April 27, 2023 against
Defendant Naoki Jim Mizutani (“Defendant”). 
Defendant
filed the instant “motion for continuance.” No opposition to the motion was
filed. 
Discussion
As an initial matter, Defendant did not file any proof of service with
the instant “Motion for Continuance.” Thus, it is unclear if Plaintiff was
served with the instant motion. 
In addition, the Court does not find that Defendant has demonstrated
good cause for any order. Defendant states in the instant motion that he
“request[s] a continuance in the above-mentioned case.” (Motion, p. 1.) Defendant
further states that he “request[s] that the court grant a continuance in Case
No. 23STCV09387 to a date that falls after my completion of basic military
training, which is expected to conclude on October 26, 2023.” (Id. at p.
2.) However, it is unclear what Defendant seeks a continuance of. Defendant
does not appear to indicate that he seeks a continuance of any particular
hearing. In addition, no legal authority is cited in the motion to support
Defendant’s request for “a continuance.”[1]
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Defendant’s motion.  
The Court orders Defendant to give
notice of this order.
