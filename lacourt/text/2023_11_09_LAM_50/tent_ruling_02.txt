[1]The Court notes
that Plaintiff interposes certain evidentiary objections in his opposing
separate statement of undisputed material facts. The Court notes that pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1354, subdivision (b), “[a]ll written
objections to evidence must be served and filed separately from the other papers in support
of or in opposition to the motion. Objections to specific evidence must be
referenced by the objection number in the right column of a separate statement in opposition or reply to
a motion, but the objections must not be restated or reargued in the separate statement.” Accordingly, the Court
declines to rule on the objections contained within Plaintiff’s opposing
separate statement. 


[2]In her declaration
filed in support of the motion, Ms. Anderson states that she is Regional Director employed by NMH. (Anderson Decl., ¶ 1.) 


[3]In her declaration
filed in support of the motion, Ms. Castillo states that she is an executive
director for NMH. (Castillo Decl., ¶ 1.) 


[4]Based on the
foregoing, the Court need not and does not address the NM Defendants’ assertion
that Mr. Villareal, Ms. Castillo, and Ms. Anderson were not officers,
directors, or managing agents of the NM Defendants.
