And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion by Counsel, Michael Y. Lavaee, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Samuel Ohana and Tamim, LLC. The motion was filed on an incomplete declaration (Form MC-052) and proposed order (Form MC-053) that failed to reference a Final Status Conference set for March 15, 2024, and did not specify the trial date and time, which is scheduled for March 27, 2024. The Court also notes that a motion to strike or tax costs was filed and set for hearing on July 22, 2024, and any amended motion must reference this hearing. The motion is denied without prejudice, and Counsel is ordered to give notice of this Order.
