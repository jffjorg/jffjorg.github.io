And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Court addresses the Plaintiff's evidentiary objections and the NM Defendants' motion. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's objections were not properly served and filed in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1354, subdivision (b), and therefore declines to rule on them. The Court also states that it does not need to address the NM Defendants' assertion that certain individuals were not officers, directors, or managing agents of the NM Defendants, based on the declarations filed in support of the motion. The declarations from Ms. Anderson and Ms. Castillo establish their roles as Regional Director and Executive Director of NMH, respectively.
