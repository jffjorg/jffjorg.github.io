And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues the Order to Show Cause hearing to May 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse. The Court had previously reviewed the petition on January 11, 2024, and was inclined to approve the settlement and proposed distribution of settlement funds. However, the proposed trust instrument must be amended to meet Probate Division requirements, including adding terms related to the purchase or sale of a personal residence and restrictions on the trustee's authority to borrow, lend, and encumber estate property. Additionally, CPT Institute, the proposed trustee, is required to post a bond based on calculations set forth in the Probate Code. The Court orders the Plaintiff to file an amended petition and proposed order, including a date for the first trust accounting within one year of approval and a Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust. The Court also orders the Plaintiff to file an application or motion to permit filing of sealed records.
