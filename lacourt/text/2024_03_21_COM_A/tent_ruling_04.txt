[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
MOTION
 TO APPOINT SUCCESSOR-IN-INTEREST
 
      The
complaint alleges claims for negligence arising from injuries sustained in a motor
vehicle accident. Plaintiff’s spouse, Lakrisha Lynn Colbert, requests an order
appointing her as successor-in-interest to Plaintiff’s claims. The motion was
timely served on Defendants. No opposition has been filed. 
      An
action for or against a decedent is not lost by reason of that person’s death. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.21.) The claims survive subject to the applicable
limitations period. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.20.) The court “shall allow a pending action or
proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the decedent's personal
representative or, if none, by the decedent's successor in interest pursuant to
a noticed motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.31.) 
      The
motion is adequately supported by Lakrisha Lynn Colbert, who submits a declaration
and a copy of the death certificate, stating the decedent’s name, date, and
place of death. (Elina Shakhbazyan Decl., Ex. A; Lakrisha Lynn Colbert Decl.) Ms.
Colbert declares that no proceeding is pending in California for administration
of the decedent’s estate, that she is decedent’s successor-in-interest, and
that no other person has a superior right to continue the decedent’s claims. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.32.)            
      Based
on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED.
