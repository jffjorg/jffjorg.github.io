Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel further discovery responses to requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for admission. The Plaintiff, Mario Denhoff, alleges that the Defendant, Lil'Wave Financial, Inc., and others, agreed to lend him $450,000 and delayed providing information, leading to a pending balloon payment and late charges. The Plaintiff claims breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, common counts, and statutory violations for unfair business practices. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's objections are without merit and requests an order compelling further responses and imposing sanctions. The Judge finds that the 45-day deadline did not begin to run because the Plaintiff did not serve substantive responses and that the Defendant did not meet and confer in good faith prior to filing the motion. The Judge requires a "serious attempt" at an informal resolution before filing a motion to compel.
