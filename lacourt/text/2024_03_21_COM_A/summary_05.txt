Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses and documents filed by Plaintiff Sergio Armando Mayagoitia against Defendant Prime Healthcare Services, et al. The Court grants the motion, ordering Defendant to provide further, verified, supplemental responses without objection and to produce documents responsive to requests 19, 21, 22, 25-27, 30-33, 37, and 38, within 10 days. The Court also imposes monetary sanctions of $1,400 and awards costs of $2,210 against Defendant and its attorneys, Kelly Trotter & Franzen.

The Court finds that Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's requests for production of documents are without merit, and that Defendant has not shown substantial justification for its objections. The Court also notes that Defendant's responses are incomplete and without merit, and that Defendant has failed to provide adequate explanations for its objections.

The Court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Code of Regulations, and is guided by the principles of liberally construed discovery and the requirement that discovery be conducted in a manner that is not oppressive or burdensome. The Court's decision is a significant victory for Plaintiff, as it requires Defendant to provide further information and documents that are relevant to the case.
