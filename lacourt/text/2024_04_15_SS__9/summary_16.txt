And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the petition for name change. The petitioner must review the proposed decree with the new name to ensure it is legible and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A signed copy of the decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing.
