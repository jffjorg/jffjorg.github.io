And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling notes that the criminal history assessment conducted by the Clerk's Office was incomplete, only checking California criminal history databases. The Court had previously requested a more comprehensive assessment, including databases from other states. Despite this, the Clerk's Office failed to re-run the assessment as requested. As a result, the petition is continued to April 22, 2024, to allow the Clerk's Office to re-run the assessment and provide clear results. The Clerk's Office is also required to provide the results more clearly.
