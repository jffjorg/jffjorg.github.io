And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the Petitioner's petition to change their name. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree for spelling and legibility before the hearing date. If the new name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The court will provide a signed decree in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
