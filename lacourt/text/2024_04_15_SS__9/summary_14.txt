The tentative ruling grants the petition to change name, but requires the petitioner to double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The decree will be signed and a copy will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
