The judge's tentative ruling outlines the procedure for the upcoming hearing on April 15, 2024. The petitioner is required to review the proposed decree with the new name and ensure that it is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge grants the petition and notes that once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without filing a new petition.
