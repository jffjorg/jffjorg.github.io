If the new name meets these criteria, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. After the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
