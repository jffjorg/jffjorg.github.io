The court grants the name change petition. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name is not satisfactory, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposal. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
