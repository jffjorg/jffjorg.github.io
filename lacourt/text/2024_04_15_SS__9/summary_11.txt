And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants the petition and issues a tentative ruling regarding the name change. The petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing.
