 Case Number:  24STCP00091    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal
history assessment that the Clerk’s Office ran on February 9, 2024 states in
part “no information found.”  This notation
is vague and ambiguous.  It is unclear whether
this notation means (1) that no information can be found because Petitioner
cannot be identified; or (2) that Petitioner can be identified and has no arrests
or convictions and no criminal history?  The
petition is continued to April 29, 2024 at 9:30 am.  The Clerk’s Office must re-run the criminal
history assessment and provide more clear notation whether Petitioner has any
convictions, including for offenses that require sex offender registration.
Court Clerk
