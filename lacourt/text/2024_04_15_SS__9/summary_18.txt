If the name is not clear or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
