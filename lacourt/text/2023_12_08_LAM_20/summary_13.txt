And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kevin C. Brazile regarding a motion for an award of defense costs filed by the defendants, City of Azusa and Azusa Valley Water Company, in the case of Running et al v. Covina Irrigating Company et al. The motion was denied.

The defendants argued that they were entitled to an award of defense costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1038(a) because the case was not maintained in good faith or with reasonable cause. However, the court found that the plaintiffs maintained the case in good faith based on the Court of Appeal's reversal of summary judgment.

The court also found that there were triable issues of fact as to the claims for elder abuse and contract, and that the plaintiffs had a viable theory of liability supported by triable issues of fact. Therefore, the court denied the motion for an award of defense costs.

The court also denied the defendants' request for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420(a) because the plaintiffs had a reasonable basis for denying certain requests for admission. The court found that the defendants failed to demonstrate that the plaintiffs had no good reason for denying the requests for admission, and that the requests were not of substantial importance.
