And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel Defendant Wendy Seratan to comply with discovery requests. The Plaintiff, Hennig, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP, is seeking to compel compliance with responses to requests for production nos. 2-3. The Defendant contends that the motion is improper because the Plaintiff failed to file a motion to compel further responses, which is required by law. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant waived any objections by providing late responses and therefore the Plaintiff is not seeking a further response, but rather to compel compliance with the representation that documents will be provided. The Judge agrees with the Defendant and denies the motion, stating that the Plaintiff should have filed a motion to compel further responses. The Judge also declines to award sanctions. The moving party is instructed to give notice of the ruling.
