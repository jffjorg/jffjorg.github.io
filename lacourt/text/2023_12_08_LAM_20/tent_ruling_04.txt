 This is an action in which Plaintiff, Defendant’s former attorney, claims that Defendant failed to compensate Plaintiff after Plaintiff was able to settle Defendant’s case.  Plaintiff Hennig, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP seeks to compel Defendant Wendy Seratan to comply with her responses to requests for production nos. 2-3.   For the subject discovery, Defendant stated that she would produce non-privileged documents and produced documents and a privilege log.  Defendant contends the Motion is improper as Plaintiff was required to file a motion to compel further responses, but the deadline for this has passed and Plaintiff did not meet and confer. Plaintiff argues that Defendant waived any objections when she provided late responses and, therefore, Plaintiff does not seek a further response, but rather to compel compliance with the representation that documents will be provided.  A motion to compel further responses should have been filed.  This is because if a party waives an objection but later inappropriately asserts such objections, then the response would be considered inadequate and the Court would be required to make that determination within a motion to compel a further response—that is, whether the party should provide a response without objections due to waiver. The instant Motion seeks for the Court to consider the responses inadequate and to order further responses and production with no objections whatsoever.  Thus, Plaintiff should have filed a motion to compel further responses.  Because Plaintiff has not shown that any motion to compel further responses would be timely given that responses were served on May 22, 2023, the Motion is denied. The Court declines to award sanctions.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
