And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about an employment action where the plaintiff, Victoria White, is seeking to compel initial responses to her requests for production from the defendants, Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi. The defendants claim they were surprised by the motions because the parties had agreed to engage in settlement discussions and pause discovery. However, the court finds that there was indeed an agreement to pause discovery and engage in settlement discussions, and that the plaintiff's counsel was supposed to initiate these discussions. The court will compel responses within 30 days, but will not award sanctions. The defendants can still assert objections, and counsel are encouraged to submit their positions via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
