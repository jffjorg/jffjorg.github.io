  Case Number:  21CHCV00042    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  F49 Dept. F49  Date: 5/7/24 Case  Name: Alma D. Rivera v.  Barbara Nania, et al. Case # 21CHCV00042   LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MAY 07, 2024    MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 21CHCV00042    Motion  filed: 1/11/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Brett A. Berman and The  Berman Law Group, APC (the “Moving Defendants”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Alma D. Rivera (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order granting the moving Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED.   BACKGROUND   This case arises from Plaintiff’s alleged damages caused by  Defendants’ failure to withdraw the Lis Pendens recorded against Plaintiff’s  property on May 19, 2014.    On or about June 8, 2009, Plaintiff purchased 19120  Ballinger Street, Northridge, California 91324 (the “Subject Property”) and  became the sole owner in fee. (Compl, ¶ 9, Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”),  No. 1.) Subsequently, Plaintiff married Henrik Johansen (“Johansen”) on or  about October 2, 2013. (Compl., ¶ 9, UMF, No. 2.)    On or about May 16, 2014,  Defendant Barbara Nania’s (“Nania”) counsel filed a civil action (the “Civil  Action”) against Plaintiff and others, alleging a Quiet Title claim for the  Subject Project and other causes of action. (Compl., ¶ 10, UMF, No. 4.) Nania  alleged that Plaintiff purchased the Subject Property with Nania’s community  funds with Johansen during their prior marriage. (Ibid.) Subsequently,  the Notice of Pendency of Action (Lis Pendens) was recorded against the Subject  Property on May 22, 2014 (the “2014 Lis Pendens”). (Rinka Decl., Ex. “B.”)   On or about March 27, 2015, the  Civil Action was dismissed. (Compl., ¶¶ 16-18, UMF, No. 9.) However, the 2014 Lis  Pendens remained on the Subject Property. (Compl., ¶ 18, UMF, No. 10.)   On April 29, 2019, Plaintiff was  joined in another family action by Nania, entitled Henrik Johansen v.  Barbara Nania, LASC Case No. BD484837 (the “Family Action”).    On December 24, 2020, Plaintiff  filed a Motion to Expunge Two Lis Pendens, including the 2014 Lis Pendens and a  2019 Lis Pendens (the “Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens”). (UMF, No. 15.) Subsequently,  on March 15, 2021, Judge Lynn H. Scaduto (“Judge Scaduto”), presiding over the  Family Action, ruled on the Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens, without a hearing,  holding that Nania acted with substantial justification and that the  circumstances presented in the Family Action makes the imposition of sanctions,  fees, or costs unjust. (Rinka Decl., Ex. “G,” 3/15/21 Notice of Ruling on the  Motion to Expunge Two Lis Pendens, UMF, No. 17.)   On January 20, 2021, Plaintiff initiated  the present action against Defendant Nania, Andrew M. Rosenfeld, the Moving  Defendants, and Does 1-10, for Disparagement of Title.    On March 24, 2021, Plaintiff  filed her Request for Dismissal, dismissing with prejudice Defendant Andrew M.  Rosenfeld.   On March 26, 2021, the Moving  Defendants, also serving as Nania’s counsel in the Family Action, submitted a  Notice of Withdrawal of the 2014 Lis Pendens. (Rinka Decl., Ex. “H.”)   On September 14, 2021, Nania and  the Moving Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint.   On June 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed  an Amendment to Complaint, substituting Defendant Jason J. Allison (“Allison”)  for Doe 1. Subsequently, Allison filed an Answer on October 17, 2022.    On January 11, 2024, the Moving Defendants  filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed  her Opposition on March 21, 2024, and the Moving Defendant replied on April 24,  2024.    ANALYSIS   “A party may move for summary judgment in an action or  proceeding if it is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no  defense to the action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(1).)   “The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the  papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact  and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In  determining if the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any  material fact, the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the  papers, except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained by  the court, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, except  summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences  reasonably deducible from the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or  evidence that raise a triable issue as to any material fact.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 437c, subd. (c).)    “[I]f the moving papers establish a prima facie  showing that justifies a [ruling] in the [plaintiff's] favor, the burden then  shifts to the [defendant] to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a  triable material factual issue.”' (Citation.)" (See's Candy Shops,  Inc. v. Superior Court (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 889, 900, quoting Rehmani  v. Superior Court (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 945, 950.) “The defendant or  cross-defendant shall not rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings  to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set  forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists  as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,  subd. (p)(1).)    A.     Doctrine of Res  Judicata   The doctrine of res judicata  precludes parties, or their privies, from relitigating a cause of action  determined with finality in a prior proceeding.   (E.g., Smith v. ExxonMobil Oil  Corp. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1413-14; Wright v. Ripley (1998)  65 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1193.) “Res judicata bars the relitigation not only of  claims that were conclusively determined in the first action, but also matter  that was within the scope of the action, related to the subject matter, and  relevant to the issues so that it could have been raised” and includes ‘matters  which were raised or could have been raised, on matters litigated or  litigable.’” Burdette v. Carrier Corp. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1668,  1674-1675; accord Mark v.  Spencer (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 219, 229 [bars claims that parties had fair  opportunities to litigate].)   Res judicata applies “to all  legal theories, proofs, and demands for relief that might have been presented  in the first matter, provided both suits assert the same cause of action.”  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161  Cal.App.4th 509, 541 (Ferraro) n. 21 [citing Mycogen Corp. v.  Monsanto (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 897]; Burdett v. Carrier Corp.  (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1668, 1687.) Res judicata applies as a bar to splitting a cause of action for  partial, later litigation, or relitigation of the same cause of action based on  another legal theory or associated with different relief, that could have been  sought in the prior action. (Noble v. Draper (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th  1, 10; Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd.   (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1146.)   Res judicata  precludes the relitigation of a cause of action only if (1) the decision in the  prior proceeding is final and on the merits; (2) the present action is on the  same cause of action as the prior proceeding; and (3) the parties in the  present action or parties in privity with them were parties to the prior  proceeding. (Busick v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. (1972) 7 Cal.3d  967, 974.) Res judicata bars the litigation not only of issues that were  actually litigated in the prior proceeding, but also issues that could have  been litigated in that proceeding. (Id. at p. 975.) (Zevnik  v. Superior Court (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 76, 82-83; Levy v. Cohen  (1977) 19 Cal.3d 165, 171.)   “The burden of establishing  preclusion by prior adjudication (res judicata) rests squarely on the party  asserting it.” (Ferraro, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 529.) The  defense of res judicata “presents a question of law for the determination of  the trial court.”  (Rohrbasser v.  Lederer (1986) 179 Cal. App. 3d 290, 296.)    1)       The Same Issue  Was Ruled on the Merits in the Prior Proceedings and Was Final.   Here, the Moving Defendants argue that the present case  involves the same issue previously addressed in the Motion to Expunge during  the early Family Action. Specifically, they note that in both proceedings,  Plaintiff has contested the justification for maintaining the 2014 Lis Pendens.  Additionally, the Moving Defendants highlight that in both proceedings,  Plaintiff seeks the same relief for attorney fees and costs relating to the  expungement of the Lis Pendens. (Mot., at p. 7.)   In her response, Plaintiff argues that the basis of the  current Complaint is distinct from the earlier proceeding. She argues that it  focuses on proving the damages she suffered due to the unlawful 2014 Lis  Pendens, whereas the previous Motion to Expunge aimed solely at expunging it.  (Opp’n., at p. 5.) Furthermore, Plaintiff asserts that despite Judge Scaduto’s  order to deny her request for attorneys’ fees and costs, not all issues raised in  the current case were resolved in that proceeding.   As further analyzed below, the Court agrees with  Plaintiff’s argument and finds merit in her position, distinguishing the issues  presented in the two proceedings.   i)                    Cause of Action  – Disparagement of Title (Slander of Title)   Slander  of title is a tort claim brought for disparagement of title to either real or  personal property, which affects its vendibility or salability. (M.F. Farming, Co. v.  Couch Distributing Co. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 180, 199 (“‘If the matter is  reasonably understood to cast doubt upon the existence or extent of another’s  interest in land, it is disparaging to the latter’s title where it is so  understood by the recipient….’”); Manhattan Loft, LLC v. Mercury Liquors,  Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1040, 1051; see  Chao Fu, Inc. v. Wen Ching Chen (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 48, 58 [although slander of title does not seek  transfer of an interest in property, it may be prosecuted only by someone with  an interest in  property]; see CACI 1730.)                 The  elements of a cause of action for slander of title are: (1) publication, (2)  which is without privilege or justification, (3) which is false, and (4) which  causes direct and immediate pecuniary loss. (Klem v. Access Ins. Co.  (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 595, 612.)                          In the  Complaint, Plaintiff seeks the following relief: general and special damages  according to proof at the time of trial; punitive damages according to proof at  the time of trial; damages caused to Plaintiff for inconvenience and time  suffered by Plaintiff in removing this cloud on title according to proof at the  time of trial; attorney’s fees and cost according to proof at the time of  trial; other costs of suit incurred herein; and other and further relief as the  court may deem just and proper. (Compl., at p. 5.)   ii)                  Motion  to Expunge Lis Pendens   A Lis Pendens may be expunged  either (i) if the pleadings do not contain a real property claim, or (ii) if  the court finds that the party claiming the Lis Pendens has not established by  a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property  claim. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.31, 405.32.)   “The burden is upon the  recording party to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the  action was commenced and prosecuted for a proper purpose and in good faith.” (McKnight  v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 291, 298.) “Probable validity”  exists when “it is more likely than not that the claimant will obtain a  judgment on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.3.)                                           Furthermore,  Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38 provides that “the court shall  direct that the party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded  the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion  unless the court finds that the other party acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s  fees and costs unjust.” (Underlines added.)               Based on the elements involved in a  cause of action for Slander of Title and a Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens, it is  clear to the Court that they do not address the same issues. For instance, a  motion to expunge lis pendens specifically addresses the validity of lis  pendens filings and does not extend to other forms of publication or legal  issues. Conversely, a cause of action for slander of title requires additional  elements, notably the falsity of the publication and direct pecuniary loss  resulting from it.    Furthermore,  although Plaintiff’s previous Motion to Expunge raised the issue of requesting attorneys’  fees, its scope is limited under the authorization of Code of Civil Procedure  section 405.38 for “reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing  the motion” only. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.38.) The language of the order  further substantiates that it was rendered based on the same code section, finding  that “the respondent acted with substantial justification and that the  circumstances presented here ... [make] the imposition of sanctions, fees, or  costs unjust.” (Rinka Decl., Ex. “G,” 3/15/21 Notice  of Ruling on the Motion to Expunge Two Lis Pendens.)               Consequently,  the Court finds that the previous matter, the Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens, neither resolved all issues raised  in the Complaint nor was it capable of presenting all the relief sought  therein. These findings lead the Court to conclude that the Moving Defendants  have not successfully established the applicability of the doctrine of Res  Judicata in the current case. By failing to meet the first required condition  to implicate the doctrine of Res Judicata, the Court does not need to examine  the remaining two conditions.   Therefore, the Court determines that the Moving Party’s argument  based on the doctrine of Res Judicata shall not prevail.   B.      Statute of  Limitation   An action  for slander of title to real property is subject to a three-year statute of limitations.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (g).) “Such a cause of action does not accrue until the  plaintiff could reasonably be expected to discover its existence.” (Arthur  v. Davis (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 684.)              The Court first rejects Plaintiff’s alternative theory of  continuing harm inasmuch as she remained harmed due to the allegedly invalidly  recorded 2014 Lis Pendens. However, the recurring or ongoing conduct at issue  in the case Plaintiff cites to support her argument bears no similarity to the  Lis Pendens here. (Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55  Cal.4th 1185, 1200-1201 [recurring imposition of fraudulent charges for copier  rental.]) Nevertheless, the Court finds that there are trial issues as to when  the Statute of Limitation began to accrue in the present case.              Here, the Moving Defendants argue that the statute of  limitation accrued as far back as 2015, when Plaintiff demanded Defendant  Nania’s counsel to remove the 2014 Lis Pendens. (Mot., at p. 10.) They also  contend that Plaintiff had reasonable opportunities to discover the 2014 Lis  Pendens when she received rejections from mortgage brokers going back at least  2016. (Ibid.) To support their position, the Moving Defendants proffered  correspondence between Plaintiff and mortgage broker Jarrot Bell, as well as  Plaintiff’s declaration previously filed with her Motion to Expunge Lis  Pendens. (Rinka Decl., Ex. “C” and “D.”)               In response, Plaintiff disputes the  Moving Defendants’ assertions, claiming that she requested the Moving  Defendants to remove the Lis Pendens in 2019-2022, and asked the same to  Nania’s prior counsel in 2020. (Pl.’s’ Separate Statement, No. 11.) Plaintiff attests  that “I was never served with the Summons and Civil Complaint in LASC Case No.  BC 545476. And I was never served with the Lis Pendens associated with the  case.” (Rivera Decl., ¶ 4.) She further points out that the correspondence with  mortgage brokers did not occur until about 2020. (Pl.’s Separate Statement, No.  12.)               Upon reviewing the correspondence  from mortgage broker Jarrot Bell, the Court finds that it is not inconsistent  with Plaintiff’s claim that the correspondence occurred in about 2020, as the  letter notes that “now there are two Lis Pendens recorded on your Property,”  indicating that the observation was made following the recording of the 2019  Lis Pendens.    Regarding the letter’s mention of the Lis Pendens problem “as  “it was back in 2016,” the Court finds that Plaintiff’s declaration stating  “[w]e learned years later, probably in 2019 or 2020 that a Lis Pendens was  recorded against my property and that was the reason for the rejection. It was  then that I sought an attorney to be compensated by the Defendants for all the  damages that I suffered that they caused” (Rivera Decl., ¶ 6) sufficiently  makes a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable material factual  issue as to when she is reasonably expected to discover the 2014 Lis Pendens.    Based  on the finding of the existence of triable material factual issues regarding  when the Statute of Limitation began to accrue, the Motion for Summary Judgment  must be DENIED on this basis.               Accordingly,  the Court DENIES the Motion for Summary Judgment.               CONCLUSION   Moving  Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.   Moving  party is ordered to provide notice of this order.
