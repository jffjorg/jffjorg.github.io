  - "The Court is not persuaded as it relates to these document requests. In response to these requests for production of facially relevant documents, Defendant asserted boilerplate objections, failed to specify responsive documents, failed to identify documents which would not be produced, and, despite agreeing to make all responsive materials available for inspection, failed to do so."
  - "The Court therefore awards sanctions in the amount of $15,375, reflecting the 20.5 hours of attorney time reasonably incurred on this motion."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of this order. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $15,375, which reflects the 20.5 hours of attorney time reasonably incurred on this motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the defendant has failed to produce all responsive documents and has asserted boilerplate objections. The judge finds that the defendant's behavior has been unreasonable and that the plaintiff has been entitled to an order compelling further responses. The judge also finds that the defendant's counsel has failed to act in good faith and has engaged in misconduct, warranting the award of sanctions.

The judge's ruling is effective immediately, and the defendant is ordered to provide the required responses within 30 days.
