And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel, Paul K. Schrieffer and P.K. Schrieffer LLP. The defendant argued that Schrieffer's representation of Chubb Limited, the parent corporation of Great Northern Insurance Company, creates a conflict of interest. However, the judge found that the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a substantial relationship between Schrieffer's representation of Chubb Limited and the representation of Great Northern Insurance Company. The judge also noted that the Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit a lawyer from representing clients who are directly adverse in the same tribunal, but Schrieffer has not represented Great Northern Insurance Company. The judge is not inclined to override the plaintiff's right to counsel of its choice based on mere presumption.
