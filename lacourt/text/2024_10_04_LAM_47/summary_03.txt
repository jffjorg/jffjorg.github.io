And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The defendants had moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for breach of implied warranty of habitability, negligence, and nuisance. The judge found that the defendants had not met their burden to demonstrate that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on these claims. The judge rejected the defendants' arguments that the plaintiffs had failed to give timely notice and cooperate with repairs, and that the plaintiffs had consented to the presence of mold and cockroaches. The judge also found that the defendants had not addressed all allegations in the plaintiffs' complaint, which is a requirement for summary adjudication. As a result, the motion for summary adjudication was denied. The judge has scheduled a hearing on the motion and will issue a final ruling after considering any submissions from the parties.
