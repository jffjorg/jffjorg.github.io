 Case Number:  22STCV36344    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) and Request for Sanctions
Giavanna Papasavvas vs. 1016 Industries, Inc., et al.,
22STCV36344
Moving Party: Defendant Peter Northrop

Responding Party: Plaintiff
Giavanna Papasavvas

Motion
            Defendant
Peter Northrop (Defendant) filed this motion after Plaintiff Giavanna
Papasavvas (Plaintiff) objected to eight of the special interrogatories and did
not provide what Defendant considered to be full and complete responses. The
relevant Special Interrogatories are Nos. 41-44, 48, 51, 54, and 58.  Defendant filed this motion pursuant to CCP §§
2030.300 et seq. and 2023.010. Defendant filed the motion on October 10, 2023. After
Defendant filed the motion, Plaintiff served supplemental responses to the
interrogatories on October 16, 2023. It is unclear from Defendant’s Reply whether
Defendant has any specific further objections to the supplemental responses
served by Plaintiff. Defendant’s reply appears to be focused on the issue of
sanctions for having to bring this motion. Based on the Court’s review of Plaintiff’s
supplemental responses to the Special Interrogatories, further discovery
responses are not necessary.
            Monetary Sanctions: 
            “The Court shall impose a monetary
sanction…against a party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2030.300(d).)
            Defendant has requested $8,789.50 in
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for having to bring this motion.
Plaintiff’s attorney’s hourly rate is $495, and he stated that he will have spent
9.7 hours preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply,
and attending the hearing for a total of $4,801.50. (Ellis Decl., ¶ 16.) Defendant
has also requested costs in the amount of $60.00. (Ellis Decl., ¶ 18.)
            Defendant’s attorney’s declaration
contains a confusing paragraph about the amount of time that Defendant’s former
counsel spent on a motion to compel further responses. (Ellis Decl., ¶ 17.) The
billing amounts for these attorneys is how Defendant got to the $8,789.50
amount. The relevance of this paragraph is unclear, and Plaintiff objected to
the paragraph on the grounds that it lacks foundation. The Court sustains
Plaintiff’s objection to this paragraph.
            Because Plaintiff did not serve
supplemental responses until after the motion was filed, the Court will impose
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $4,861.50 ($4,801.50 plus the
$60.00 filing fee).
Order
1.      Plaintiff
is ordered to pay $4,861.50 in sanctions to defendants counsel within 20 days
of this order.
