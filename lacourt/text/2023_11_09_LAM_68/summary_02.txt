And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Giavanna Papasavvas vs. 1016 Industries, Inc., et al., regarding a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The defendant, Peter Northrop, filed the motion after the plaintiff, Giavanna Papasavvas, objected to eight special interrogatories and did not provide full and complete responses. The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's supplemental responses and finds that further discovery responses are not necessary.

The defendant has requested $8,789.50 in monetary sanctions against the plaintiff for having to bring this motion. The plaintiff's attorney has estimated that he will have spent 9.7 hours preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, and preparing a reply, and has requested $4,801.50 in sanctions. The judge has sustained the plaintiff's objection to a paragraph in the defendant's attorney's declaration regarding the amount of time spent by the defendant's former counsel on a previous motion to compel further responses.

The judge has imposed sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $4,861.50, which includes the cost of preparing the motion and attending the hearing. The plaintiff is ordered to pay this amount to the defendants' counsel within 20 days of the order.
