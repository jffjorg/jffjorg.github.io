And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion filed by The Five LLC to set aside/vacate default and default judgment. The motion is based on the argument that the default judgment is void because the amount exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint. The Court agrees with this argument and finds that the default judgment is invalid. The Court also notes that the complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought, which is required by law. Therefore, the Court grants The Five's motion to set aside/vacate default and default judgment.
