  Case Number:  20STCV24694    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  68 Will Thatcher, et al. vs. The Bucket, 20STCV24694
Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default and Default Judgment
Moving Party: The Five LLC

Responding Parties: Plaintiffs Will
Thatcher and Delia Salgado

Background
            This action
was filed on June 29, 2020 naming “The Bucket, an unknown business organization”
as defendant.  The Bucket was defaulted
on March 21, 2021.  A year later on March
9, 2022 Plaintiff filed for a default prove up. 
Judgment was entered for Plaintiff against The Bucket on March 13, 2022
for $312,493.85.  Another year passed and
on April 13, 2023 Plaintiff filed an Affidavit of Identity and Order seeking to
list as an additional name of The Bucket “The Five, LLC dba The Bucket aka
bucket.”  Plaintiff began enforcement
proceedings more recently.
Judgment Debtor The Five, LLC (The
Five) has moved to set aside/vacate default and default judgment. The Five moves
to set aside the default judgment on the basis that it was not named in the
complaint and was named for the first time in the Affidavit of Identity. The
Five also moves to set aside the default on the basis that Plaintiffs’
complaint did not specify the amount of damages that they were seeking.
            Plaintiffs
argue in their opposition that the motion should be denied due to unreasonable
delay pursuant to CCP § 437(b), which has a six month time frame. Next,
Plaintiffs argue that the judgment is not void if exceeds the prayer in the
complaint; it is only void to the excess amount. However, the prayer for relief
in the complaint does not include an amount. (The Court is unclear why
Plaintiff makes this argument as the judgment that Plaintiff would have is for
zero dollars.)  Finally, Plaintiffs argue
that the Affidavit of Identity detailed how the creditor discovered that the
“The Bucket” was a fictious business name filed by The Five. Plaintiffs argue
that The Five is a successor to The Bucket pursuant to Cal. Labor Code §
200.3(a), and therefore liable for the damages.
            The Five
argues in its reply that its relief is based on CCP § 473(d), not § 473(b). CCP
§ 473(d) allows any void judgment or order to be set aside. There is no time
period listed under that subsection. The Five argues that Plaintiffs’ judgment
is void because the amount of the default judgment exceeds the amount demanded
in the complaint because the complaint does not include an amount for damages.
Finally, The Five argues that no default or default judgment may be entered
against someone served as a Doe barring some exception. (But The Five was not
served as a Doe, so the Court does not understand this argument.)  The complaint must be amended to show the
defendant’s true name argues The Five.
Analysis
            CCP
§ 473(d) states that “The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its
own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so
as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”
There is no time requirement for setting aside void judgments.
            Code of Civil Procedure § 425.10 states
that a complaint:
“… shall contain both of the following:
(1)   A
statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and
concise language.
(2)   A
demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims to be
entitled.  If the recovery of money or
damages is demanded, the amount demanded shall be stated.”  (Bold added.) 
It has long been recognized that
the purpose of requiring that the claimant set forth the amount of monetary
relief claimed is to provide notice to the defendant of the amount at risk
should the defendant decide to not defend the action.
“Section 585 authorizes a court to
enter default against a defendant that does not answer a complaint; section
580, however, provides: “The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no
answer, cannot exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint.”
Accordingly, until amendments in 1974 [when the Legislature added provisions
directing that the amount of punitive damages and personal injury damages be
set forth in a separate document], plaintiffs in all actions were required to
state in their complaints the amount of damages claimed before they could
obtain damages in a default judgment.”  Schwab
v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 431 [280 Cal.Rptr. 83, 84, 808
P.2d 226, 227]
In this case, the Complaint does not identify the amount
sought.
“It is well settled that a
plaintiff may not take a default against a defendant without giving the
defendant actual notice of the amount of damages claimed.  (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991)
53 Cal.3d 428, 430, 280 Cal.Rptr. 83, 808 P.2d 226.)  In general, this notice is found in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (§ 425.10,
subd. (a).)  * * *  Thus, “[n]ot only is a default judgment for an
amount greater than that specifically demanded void, but when a statement of
damages is required but not served, the underlying entry of default is invalid
also and is subject to set-aside.”  (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1521, 127 Cal.Rptr.3d 542.)”  Department of Fair Employment &
Housing v. Ottovich (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 706, 712 [173 Cal.Rptr.3d 881,
885-886].
            The default
judgment is invalid because the amount of damages requested in the default
package, $312,493.85, exceeded the amount requested in the complaint.  (See also Aris Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data
Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013.)
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court grants The Five’s motion to set aside/vacate default
and default judgment.
Order
            The Five’s
motion to set aside/vacate default and default judgment is GRANTED.
