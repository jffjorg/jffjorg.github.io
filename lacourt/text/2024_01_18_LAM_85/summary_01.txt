Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the application for a writ of possession and turnover order for the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S Class Vehicle. Reginald Holland breached the contract by failing to pay monthly installments, and as a result, Ally Bank seeks a writ of possession to recover the Vehicle. The court finds that Ally Bank has a first-priority security interest in the Vehicle and that the Vehicle's retail value is estimated to be $27,000. The balance owed by Reginald Holland is $24,109.85.

The court requires an undertaking of $5,780.30, and the redelivery bond shall be $24,109.85. The levying officer may enter a private residence at 25554 Fisher Street, San Bernadino, CA 92404, as well as any commercial or public address.

The court orders that the writ of possession and turnover order be served on Reginald Holland and that he be notified that failure to comply may subject him to contempt of court. The court also orders that Ally Bank file a proposed order for writ of possession within two court days of this hearing, or it will be waived.
