amend. The First Amended Complaint filed on November 7,
2024 is deemed to be the operative pleading. 
Defendants shall file and serve an answer or responsive pleading within
10 days.  

Defendants to give notice. 
 
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff Hynes Packing Company Dba
Koret Business Park -- Santa Fe Springs (“Plaintiff”) filed an unlawful
detainer complaint against Defendants Jade Spec, LLC, Dylan Rodriguez, and
Steve Weiss (“Defendants”).  
Defendants demur to the Complaint on the grounds that it
fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. 
Legal Standard 
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.) 
The Demurrer is Unopposed
Defendant filed the instant demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint on March 5, 2024. No opposition has been filed.  However, on November 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). “¿A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike.” (CCP § 472, subd. (a).) Here, Plaintiff is not granted leave
to file a FAC in lieu of an opposition because Plaintiff did not file and serve
the FAC on or before the due date for the opposition.  The opposition was due on November 5, 2024, or
nine court days before the hearing. (CCP § 1005, subd. (b).) When Plaintiff
filed the FAC on November 7, 2024, it was already two days late.  Thus, the Court will address the merits of
the demurrer, which is unopposed.  
Discussion
“[T]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment
of rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th
Supp. 10, 16.)
In the unlawful detainer context, “[a] valid three-day pay
rent or quit notice is a prerequisite to an unlawful detainer action.” (Bevill
v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 697.) “Because of the summary nature of
an unlawful detainer action, a notice is valid only if the lessor strictly
complies with the statutorily mandated notice requirements.” (Ibid.)
“[A] commercial landlord who invokes the summary procedures of unlawful
detainer must strictly comply with the notice requirements of the statute under
which he/she elects to proceed.” (WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 516, 526.) “A judgment must be reversed when it is based on a
three-day notice which lacks the information required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2).” (Foster v. Williams (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th Supp. 9, 14 (Foster).) 
In support of the demurrer, Defendant argues that the
three-day notice improperly seeks monies owed beyond the one-year period preceding
the notice.  
A notice that seeks rent in excess of the amount due is
invalid and will not support an unlawful detainer action. (Levitz Furniture
Co. v. Wingtip Communications, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1038.)
CCP § 1161(2) provides that “[the three-day notice of nonpayment of rent] may
be served at any time within one year after the rent becomes due.”  This provision “prevents a landlord's sitting
on his or her rights, when rent is unpaid at some point during the life of a
lease, then using long-overdue rent (but no recently overdue rent) to effect an
eviction.” (Levitz Furniture Co. v. Wingtip Communications, Inc., supra,
86 Cal.App.4th at 1040.) “If the landlord waits over a year to sue
for unpaid rent, he or she is limited to collecting such rent in a standard
breach of contract action, ‘which results only in a money judgment without
restitution of the demised property.’” (Id. at 1038.)  
Here, the three-day notice seeks past due rent from January
2022 through January 2024.  Thus, the notice
seeks rent beyond the one-year period preceding January 25, 2024, when the
notice was served.  Moreover, the amount
stated in the notice is not clearly identified by the notice as an
estimate. (CCP § 1161.1, subd. (a).) Under these circumstances, the notice
seeks rent in excess of the amount due and is invalid. (Levitz, supra,
at 1038.)
Accordingly, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 The First Amended Complaint filed on
November 7, 2024 is deemed to be the operative pleading.  Defendants shall file and serve an answer or responsive
pleading within 10 days.
