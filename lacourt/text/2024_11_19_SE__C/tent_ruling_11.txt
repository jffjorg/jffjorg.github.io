Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Urban Soccer 5 Center, LLC’s Demurrer
is OVERRULED. Defendant to Answer within 5 court days.  
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
This is an unlawful detainer action. On September 11, 2024
Plaintiff Lisa Marie Vernola-Salas, Successor Trustee of the Vernola Family
Trust (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Urban Soccer 5 Center,
LLC. 
Defendant Urban Soccer 5 Center, LLC Demurs to the
Complaint on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. 
Legal Standard 
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines
Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint
includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987)
189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those
alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel
Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on
other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
506, 521.) 
In the unlawful detainer
context, “[a] valid three-day pay rent or quit notice is a prerequisite to an
unlawful detainer action.” (Bevill v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694,
697.) “Because of the summary nature of an unlawful detainer action, a notice
is valid only if the lessor strictly complies with the statutorily mandated
notice requirements.” (Ibid.) “[A] commercial landlord who invokes the
summary procedures of unlawful detainer must strictly comply with the notice
requirements of the statute under which he/she elects to proceed.” (WDT-Winchester
v. Nilsson (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 516, 526.) “A judgment must be reversed
when it is based on a three-day notice which lacks the information required by
Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2).” (Foster v. Williams (2014)
229 Cal.App.4th Supp. 9, 14 (Foster).) 
“[T]he basic elements of
unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the
tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without
permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant
has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default
continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.)
Discussion 
The Complaint alleges that “Defendants remain in possession
of the Premises pursuant to a holdover, month-to-month tenancy” (Complaint,
¶¶10, 21) and “Defendants… have refused to surrender possession of the Premises.”
(Id., ¶20.) “Defendants have breached the lease by failing to pay
amounts coming due under the lease.” (Id., ¶ 17.) “On September 5, 2024,
PLAINTIFF caused a "Three (3) Business Day Notice to Pay Rent or
Quit" (hereinafter the "Three (3) Day Notice") to be served upon
DEFENDANTS, by subservice and U.S. Mail. A true and correct copy of the “Three
(3) Day Notice” and that “More than three (3) days have elapsed since the
"Three (3) Day Notice” was served on DEFENDANTS, who have failed to pay
the rental demanded therein, and have refused to surrender possession of the
Premises.” (Id., ¶¶ 18, 20; Ex. C.) 
Defendant argues that the Complaint overstates the monthly
amount due in taxes by $1,500 for seven months, resulting in an overstatement
in the amount of $10,500.00.  According
to Defendant, the excessive amount renders the notice defective and subject to
demurrer. (Ernst Enterprises, Inc. v. Sun Valley Gasoline, Inc. (1983)
139 Cal.App.3d 355, 359.) 
Defendant’s reliance upon Ernst Enterprises, Inc. is
misplaced because that case involved a motion for summary judgment.  A demurrer, on the other hand, admits the
truth of all material facts properly pleaded. 
At issue here, paragraph 12 of the Complaint alleges, “Pursuant to
Article 54 of the Lease, DEFENDANTS are obligated to pay to 9 PLAINTIFF, as
"Additional Rent", DEFENDANTS' estimated pro rata share of the Taxes
10 incurred in connection with the Center, which totaled the following monthly
amount: $5,500.00.”  Defendant argues
that the allegations in paragraph 12 of the Complaint are contradicted by the
actual language in paragraph 54 of the Lease which “provides for pro-rata share
of property taxes at $4,000/monthly.”  Plaintiff
argues that paragraph 54 specifically states that Defendant "shall be
responsible for its pro-rata share of property taxes. Current property taxes as
estimated to be $4,000.00/monthly."  According to Plaintiff, taxes increase on an
annual basis, so Defendant’s pro-rata share would not remain stagnant through the
entire ten 10-year term of the Lease.  The
Court notes that the copy of the Lease attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint
does not contain paragraph 54.  As such, Defendant
refers to extrinsic evidence which is not properly considered when ruling on a
demurrer.
Next, Defendant argues that the Complaint alleges a ten-year
lease term expiring on August 31, 2024 (Complaint, ¶9) which is contrary to the
terms of the Lease which provides for an automatic lease extension from
September 2024 to August 2034.  Plaintiff
argues that the Automatic Renewal Clause in the Lease provides for automatic
renewal only if “(i) Tenant is current with all rent payment obligations; (ii)
has never been late with any rent payment obligation and (iii) does not have
any other uncured breaches under the terms of the Lease."  According to Plaintiff, the Lease did not
automatically renew because Defendant is substantially behind in rent
payments.  The parties do not refer the
Court to the specific paragraph number in the Lease pertaining to automatic
renewals.  In any event, the Court
determines that the issue requires a factual finding which cannot be made when
ruling on a demurrer.  
The Court finds that Plaintiff has properly pleaded the
elements of unlawful detainer.  
The demurrer is OVERRULED.
