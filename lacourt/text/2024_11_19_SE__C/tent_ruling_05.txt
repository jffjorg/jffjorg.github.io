Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background 
This is a personal injury action. On July 17, 2023,
Plaintiff Bryan Miranda (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Luis
Hernandez (“Defendant”) alleging a sole cause of action for negligence arising
from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on or about August 27, 2021. 
Defendant moves to compel responses to Request for Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant
also seeks sanctions.
As of November 15, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party to whom interrogatories and document demands are
directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a
court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that
needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good
faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A
motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting
and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate
statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion
On November 15, 2023, Defendant served Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Production of Documents, Set One. (Magnus Decl.,
Ex. A.) Despite meet and confer efforts, no response had been received from
Plaintiff as of May 15, 2024, the date the instant motions were filed. (Magnus
Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Defendant’s motions to compel responses to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set One) are
GRANTED.  Plaintiff Santos is ordered to
provide verified responses without objection, including objections based on privilege or the protection
for work product, within 30 days.  
Sanctions 
 
Misuse of the discovery process constituting conduct subject to
sanctions include “failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery” and “failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an
opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve
informally any dispute concerning discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subds. (d) and (i).) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).) 
 
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $585.00 for
each motion, or $1,170.00 in total for (2 hours preparing the motion and 2
hours to attend the hearing at a rate of $175.00 plus reimbursement of the
$60.00 filing fees). Because the motions are unopposed and substantially
similar to each other, the Court imposes sanctions in the total amount of $645.00
upon Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, payable within
60 days.
