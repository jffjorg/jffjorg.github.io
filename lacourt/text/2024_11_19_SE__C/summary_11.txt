Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Urban Soccer 5 Center, LLC in response to the unlawful detainer action brought by Lisa Marie Vernola-Salas, Successor Trustee of the Vernola Family Trust. The court has determined that the complaint states a cause of action and has overruled the demurrer. The court has found that the plaintiff has properly pleaded the elements of unlawful detainer, including the service of a three-day notice to pay rent or quit and the failure of the defendant to pay the rental demanded.

The court has also addressed the defendant's arguments regarding the overstatement of the monthly amount due in taxes and the automatic renewal clause in the lease. The court has determined that the issue of automatic renewal requires a factual finding, which cannot be made on a demurrer. The court has also determined that the defendant's reliance on Ernst Enterprises, Inc. v. Sun Valley Gasoline, Inc. is misplaced, as that case involved a motion for summary judgment, not a demurrer.

The court's ruling is tentative and is subject to revision after the parties have had an opportunity to respond.
