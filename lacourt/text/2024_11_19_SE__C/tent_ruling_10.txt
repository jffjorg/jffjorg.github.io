Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background
On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff MSP Properties, VIII, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Camacho Tapia, Inc.
dba Little Trattoria 25 (“Defendant”).
On September 10, 2024, default was entered against
Defendant.  
On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Application for Issuance
of Writ of Execution, Possession, or Sale. 

On October 28, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s ex parte
application for an Order Staying Execution of Judgment and Shortening Time for
Hearing on Motion to Set Aside Default.  The
ex parte application was deemed to be the moving papers and the hearing was
specially set on today’s date.  The Court
granted the request for stay of execution of judgment subject to payment of
rent during the stay.
As of November 15, 2024, the motion to set aside default is
unopposed.  
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473, subd. (b).)
Timeliness
Defendant filed its ex parte application to set aside
default on October 25, 2024, which was within the six-month period following
entry of default on September 10, 2024. 
Thus, the motion to set aside default is timely.  
Discussion 
Defendant contends that its failure to file an Answer was
due to attorney misrepresentation and through no fault of its own.  Upon learning of this action, Defendant sought
help at Tramite Express in Huntington Park and was told that Bryan Castorina, a
licensed attorney, would file an Answer on its behalf, but no Answer was filed.
(Declaration of Joaquin Tapia [Tapia Decl.], ¶4.) The policy of hearing cases on their merits is
well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d
900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults, the
Court finds that Defendant’s declaration is sufficient to warrant relief. The
law favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th
975, 980.) 
However, the motion cannot be
granted at this time because it is not accompanied by a copy of the Proposed
Answer.  Application for relief “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted …” (CCP §473(b),
italics added.) 
The Motion to Set Aside Default is CONTINUED to December
12, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
Defendant is ORDERED to file and serve a Proposed Answer or other
responsive pleading no later than November 26, 2024
