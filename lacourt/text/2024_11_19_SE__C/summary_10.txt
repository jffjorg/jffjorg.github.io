And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of MSP Properties, VIII, LLC (Plaintiff) versus Camacho Tapia, Inc. dba Little Trattoria 25 (Defendant). The Defendant has filed an unopposed motion to set aside a default judgment entered against it on September 10, 2024. The Judge has granted the motion to set aside the default, but has continued the hearing to December 12, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve a proposed answer or other responsive pleading by November 26, 2024.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Defendant's failure to file an answer was due to attorney misrepresentation and not its own fault. The Defendant had sought help from Tramite Express, who told it that attorney Bryan Castorina would file an answer on its behalf, but no answer was filed. The Judge has taken into account the policy of hearing cases on their merits and the liberality associated with motions to set aside defaults. The Judge has also cited relevant case law, including Berman v. Klassman and Rappleyea v. Campbell.
