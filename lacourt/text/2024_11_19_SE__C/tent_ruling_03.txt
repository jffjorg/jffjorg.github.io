Moving party to give notice.
 
Background 
This consolidated action arises from a multi-car collision
on October 23, 2021 near Norwalk, CA.  All
parties were traveling westbound on SR-91 when traffic stopped suddenly.  TONYA CASTANEDA rearended DASHAWN JAMOR JARVIS
who rearended NATHALIE TRAN who rearended PATRICK DICORATO and JAXSON DICORATO who
rearended TINA HAHN.  DICORATO, HAHN and JARVIS
filed separate lawsuits which were consolidated per stipulation on August 23, 2024.  
On February 16, 2024, Plaintiff PATRCIK DICORATO
(“Plaintiff”) filed this motion to compel further responses to Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One) from Defendant TONYA CASTANEDA (“Defendant”) pursuant
to CCP §2031.230.  Plaintiff also moves
for sanctions.   
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A motion¿to compel further responses to requests for
production “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and
confer requirement. 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further responses requires a separate
statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly
filed separate statements.
Legal Standard
“The party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to each item or
category of item by any of the following: (1) A statement that the party
will comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling by the date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section
2031.030 and any related activities; (2) A representation
that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of item; (3) An objection
to the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.” (CCP §
2031.210.) 
“A statement that the party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with
the particular demand shall state that the production, inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in
whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category
that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no
objection is being made will be included in the production.” (CCP § 2031.220.) 
“A representation of inability to comply with the
particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the
inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” (CCP § 2031.230.)
If the responding party objects to the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category of item, the
response shall do both of the following: (1) Identify
with particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored
information falling within any category of item in the demand to which an
objection is being made; (2) Set forth clearly the extent of, and the specific
ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege,
the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection is based on a
claim that the information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010),
that claim shall be expressly asserted. (CCP 2031.240, subd. (b).)
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive; (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”  (CCP §2031.310, subd. (a).)

Defendant with Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (“RFP”). (Jurczak
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) On December 20, 2023, Defendant served responses. (Id.,
¶ 3, Ex. 2.) On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff sent a detailed meet and confer
letter requesting a response by January 4, 2024, and reminding Defendant that
the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further response was

and confer efforts, Defendant served supplemental responses to some, but not
all, of the discovery requests. (Id., ¶¶ 5-14.)
