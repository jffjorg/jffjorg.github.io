And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including requests for production of documents and form interrogatories. The court has also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and their counsel in the amount of $645.00, payable within 60 days. The defendant had served the discovery requests on November 15, 2023, and despite meet and confer efforts, the plaintiff had not responded by May 15, 2024. The court has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objection within 30 days. The sanctions are intended to deter misuse of the discovery process and to compensate the defendant for their reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests.
