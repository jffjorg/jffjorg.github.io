And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Hynes Packing Company Dba Koret Business Park -- Santa Fe Springs vs Jade Spec, LLC, et al. The defendants have filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The judge has determined that the demurrer is unopposed and that the complaint does not meet the necessary standards for an unlawful detainer action. Specifically, the judge has found that the three-day notice, which was served on January 25, 2024, improperly seeks monies owed beyond the one-year period preceding the notice. As a result, the notice is invalid and will not support an unlawful detainer action. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, and the first amended complaint filed on November 7, 2024 is deemed to be the operative pleading. The defendants are directed to file and serve an answer or responsive pleading within 10 days.
