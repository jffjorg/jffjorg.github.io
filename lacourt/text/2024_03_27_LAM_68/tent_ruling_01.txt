RESPONDING PARTIES: Unopposed/Plaintiff, Mural Media, LLC

RELIEF REQUESTED
Demurrer to the Complaint
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On May 9, 2023, plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan acquired
a single parcel of real property with a multi-unit building. The property was
sold pursuant to a trustee sale following the default on the secured loan to
the property by defendant Linda Maultsby. On September 1, 2023, plaintiff filed
a complaint for unlawful detainer as to 5109 Westhaven St., Los Angeles.
 
On October 2, 2023, the clerk entered a default against all
unnamed occupants. On October 24, 2023, the court denied Defendant’s motion to
quash service of the summons and complaint. The court ordered Defendant to
serve a responsive pleading within five (5) days of service of the order. On
November 2, 2023, Defendant filed a notice of filing of a petition for writ of
mandate. On November 30, 2023, the Appellate Division issued an order denying
the writ of mandate. 
 
On December 12, 2023, the clerk rejected the request for
entry of default applications seeking possession of the premises, due to the
failure to dismiss all unnamed occupants. At the time of the January 5, 2024,
Case Management Conference, the court set an OSC re: Why Default Should Not Be
Entered Based on The Determination of The Writ Proceedings Before the Court of
Appeals for January 19, 2024. On January 19, 2024, the court acknowledged the
petition to the California Supreme Court, and set a hearing date for March 5,
2024. 
 
RULING: Off-Calendar/Moot.
Request for Judicial Notice: Granted.
 
Defendant Linda Maultsby submits a demurrer to the complaint
for unlawful detainer on grounds of lack of capacity to bring the unlawful
detainer action, insufficient facts, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The
court electronic filing system shows no opposition on file at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff. Plaintiff in reply filed both a notice of
non-opposition and extensively reiterates the basis of the demurrer due to
defective notice. Plaintiff introduces new argument as well regarding a failure
to file notices of related cases to a series of identified actions (see request
for judicial notice).
 
On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint before the opposition
due date to the instant demurrer. The first amended complaint was therefore
timely filed. The scheduled demurrer is therefore moot. The court takes the
demurrer off-calendar. 
 
The court will concurrently hear the motion for transfer and
conduct the case management conference. The court orders Plaintiff to address
the related cases identified in the March 21, 2023, filed notice of related
cases showing seven other actions involving claims for possession of the
subject property, as well as confirmation that notices of related cases were
filed in each and every other identified action. The court reserves the right
to stay the instant case pending ruling(s) on the notice of related cases,
especially if Plaintiff failed to file notices of related cases in any and all
of the other courtrooms as part of an effort to forum shop for a cooperative
courtroom.

2024. 
 
RULING: Off-Calendar.
Defendant Linda Maultsby moves to transfer the action to
either Marin or Sonoma County courthouse, due to the residence of certain
witnesses expected to testify at trial residing in both Marin and Sonoma
Counties. Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan in opposition contends the
motion is premature given the lack of an answer to the complaint (e.g. case not
at issue); plaintiff improperly seeks a change of venue as a defendant even
though the property and defendant reside in the subject district; and, even if
the court considered the motion, Defendant lacks admissible evidence in support
of any inconvenience. The court electronic filing system shows no reply on file
at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
“The
Supervising Judge of the Civil Division may, for the convenience of witnesses
or to promote the ends of justice, transfer a civil case from one district to
another. ... [M]otions to transfer a civil action from one district to another ...
must be made in Department 1 in the Central District.” (Los Angeles Local Rule
2.3(b)(2).) The court directs Linda Maultsby to file a new motion in Department
1. 
 
The court will concurrently hear the demurrer and conduct
the case management conference. The court orders Plaintiff to address the
related cases identified in the March 21, 2023, filed notice of related cases
showing seven other actions involving claims for possession of the subject
property, as well as confirmation that notices of related cases were filed in
each and every other identified action. The court reserves the right to stay
the instant case pending ruling(s) on the notice of related cases, especially
if Plaintiff failed to file notices of related cases in any and all of the
other courtrooms as part of an effort to forum shop for a cooperative
courtroom.
