 Case Number:  BC685290    Hearing Date:   February 1, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  December 1, 2017, Plaintiffs Michael Fullerton (“Fullerton”)  and Brenda Severns (“Severns”) filed this action against Defendants Licea  Logistics, Inc. (“Licea”), John Vela (“Vela”), and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle  tort and general negligence.  On  January 2, 2018, Plaintiffs filed proofs of service of the summons, complaint,  statements of damages, and other documents on Vela and Licea.  On  January 24, 2018, Licea and Vela (“Defendants”) filed an answer.  On  May 26, 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as  counsel. Counsel was relieved on June 8, 2021. Defendants have not notified the  Court that they have retained new counsel.  On  December 16, 2022, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a notice of termination of stay,  which stated in part:  “On or about June 8, 2020, in the case of Commissioner  of the Department of Financial Regulation v. Global Hawk Insurance Co. Risk  Retention Group, (Civil Division Docket No. 196-5-20 Wncv), before the State of  Vermont, Superior Court Washington Unit, an Order of Liquidation was entered,  which included a stay of proceedings involving any claim being defended by  Global Hawk Insurance Co. Risk Retention Group (‘Global Hawk’). SEE EXHIBIT 1  (page 8, Paragraph 9.) Global Hawk was the insurance carrier providing defense  for Defendants Licea Logistics, Inc and John Vela in this action up to that  point.”   “The stay  described above as to Global Hawk is no longer in effect because it expired on  August 8, 2020 (60 days from when the above order was issued.) Plaintiff’s  counsel learned of this on September 19, 2022 as a result of email  correspondence with the liquidator in the Vermont case. SEE EXHIBIT 2. 4. As a  result, the lawsuit against Defendants in the current matter with this Superior  Court may proceed.”  On  October 19, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike Defendants’ answer and  enter their defaults. Defendants did not file an opposition.  On  October 27, 2023, the Court issued an order stating: “The Court intends to  strike defendants’ Answer pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 575.2 and  the 8th Amended Standing Order re: Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub if the  Defendants fail to appear at the Final Status Conference and Trial.”  (See October 30, 2023 Nunc Pro Tunc Order.)  The Court continued the final status conference and trial to November 14, 2023.  On  November 14, 2023, Defendants did not appear for the final status conference  and trial.  The Court struck Defendants’  answer.  On  November 15, 2023, Fullerton and Severns each filed statements of damages sought  against Vela and Licea.  On November  21, 2023, the clerk entered Vela’s and Licea’s defaults.  On  December 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on  February 1, 2024.  On  December 8, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at  Plaintiffs’ request.  PARTIES’ REQUEST  Plaintiffs  ask the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendants and award  Plaintiff $1,131,208.86, consisting of $750,000.00 in general damages and  $381,208.86 in special damages.LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Default judgment  “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party  seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry  of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following  must be included in the documents filed with the clerk:  “(1)  Except in  unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and  the nature of plaintiff's claim;  “(2)  Declarations  or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;  “(3)  Interest  computations as necessary;  “(4)  A  memorandum of costs and disbursements;  “(5)  A  declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is  sought;  “(6)  A proposed  form of judgment;  “(7)  A dismissal  of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for  separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section  579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;  “(8)  Exhibits  as necessary; and  “(9)  A request  for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800(a).)  B.   Damages            “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,  plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case  for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,  Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson  v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying  preponderance of the evidence standard].)            The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a  defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for  personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the  amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),  585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure  fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27  Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases  which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may  be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is  demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in  court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.  493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of  the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at  p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,  p. 5-70.)  DISCUSSION  As Plaintiffs' supporting papers explain, Fullerton requests judgment of $579,451.02 (consisting  of $167,859.13 for past medical expenses, $30,000 for lost income, $6,591.89 for  property damage, and $375,000 for pain and suffering) and Severns requests  judgment of $551,757.84 (consisting of $94,757.84 for past medical expenses,  $80,000 for future medical expenses, $2,000 for past lost income, and $375,000  for pain and suffering). Plaintiffs' statements of damages listed $25,000 in past medical expenses.  However, Plaintiffs are now asking the Court to award Fullerton $167,859.13 in past medical expenses and to award Severns $94,757.84 in past medical expenses.  The Court cannot award damages that exceed the amounts in the statements of damages served on Defendants. In addition, Plaintiffs should re-submit their CIV-100 forms and proposed judgments,  with one CIV-100 form and one proposed judgment for each Plaintiff.  Although  use of the JUD-100 form is optional, Plaintiffs may wish to consider using that  form for each of their proposed judgments.  The Court denies the application without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the request for default judgment filed by  Plaintiffs Michael Fullerton and Brenda  Severns.  Plaintiffs  are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
