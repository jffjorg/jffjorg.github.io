BACKGROUND 
On
January 4, 2021, Plaintiff Tony Nguyen (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Grant McPheron (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5 for negligence (auto
accident) and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
On
June 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of personal service of the summons and
complaint on Defendant on January 30, 2021. 
On
June 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages with a proof of personal
service on Defendant on June 27, 2022. 
On
September 16, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
November 29, 2022, the Court dismissed Does 1-5 without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On January
25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment against Defendant to be
heard on February 1, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgment against Defendant and award Plaintiff
$200,000.00, consisting of $100,000.00 in special damages and $100,000.00 in
general damages. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
“Where
a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to
introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580,
subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).)  “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The
statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have
adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.]
‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the
defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the
matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its
jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the
complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
asserts that on January 6, 2019, Defendant’s vehicle rear-ended Plaintiff’s
vehicle as the result Defendant’s negligence, injuring Plaintiff and damaging
his vehicle.  (Plaintiff appears to mean
January 5, 2019.)  He seeks $200,000.00
in damages, consisting of $100,000.00 in special damages and $100,000.00 in
general damages. 
Despite
Plaintiff’s request for $100,000 in special damages, Plaintiff has submitted bills
showing only about $6,400 in medical expenses. 
He has also submitted statements from Hung Dinh Doan, M.D. (“Dr. Doan”),
who asserts: “The Costs for Dr Tony Nguyen treatments stemming from this
accident not lee [sic] than $400,000.” However, aside from Dr. Doan’s
assertion, the application contains no evidence to support this conclusion. 
Plaintiff
has submitted a revised declaration from Thomas Winn (“Winn”), the Chief Human
Resources Officer of the Air Force Law Center. The revised declaration states: “I
got personal knowledge and can verify the facts as below . . . .”  Winn repeats the statement in his previous
declaration that Plaintiff’s income before the accident was $15,000 per month
and is now $1,000 per month.  Winn provides
no facts to support his assertion that he has personal knowledge of these
facts, however, and Plaintiff presents no other evidence to support Winn’s statements. 
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
 The Court DENIES Plaintiff Tony Nguyen’s
request for default judgment against Defendant Grant McPheron. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
