And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff is seeking $200,000 in damages, including $100,000 in special damages and $100,000 in general damages, due to an auto accident on January 5, 2019. However, the court has found that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is insufficient to support the claimed damages. Specifically, the court notes that the plaintiff's medical expenses are only $6,400, and that the doctor's assertion of $400,000 in medical expenses is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the court finds that the revised declaration submitted by the plaintiff's witness, Thomas Winn, lacks facts to support his statements about the plaintiff's income before and after the accident. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
