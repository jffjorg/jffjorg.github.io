And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment and is issuing a tentative ruling. The case was filed on December 1, 2017, and the stay of proceedings was terminated on August 8, 2020. The Defendants failed to appear at the final status conference and trial, and the Plaintiffs filed a request for default judgment.

The judge is denying the request for default judgment without prejudice, stating that the Plaintiffs should re-submit their CIV-100 forms and proposed judgments, with one CIV-100 form and one proposed judgment for each Plaintiff. The judge is also denying the application because the Plaintiffs are asking for damages that exceed the amounts in the statements of damages served on the Defendants.

The judge notes that the relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases, the amount listed in the statement of damages. The judge is ordering the Plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
