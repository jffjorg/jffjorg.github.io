And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Dawn Suskin, moves to strike portions of the plaintiff, FirstService Residential California, LLC's, first amended complaint. Suskin argues that the plaintiff's allegations regarding injunctive relief and punitive damages are improper. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has adequately alleged sufficient facts to obtain injunctive relief, including that Suskin shared FirstService's proprietary documentation and used confidential information to aid Seabreeze. The court also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to constitute malice, including that Suskin intentionally caused injury to FirstService. Therefore, the defendant's motion to strike is denied, and the defendant is ordered to answer the first amended complaint within 20 days.
