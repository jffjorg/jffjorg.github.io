Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to reopen discovery. The defendant, Flintridge Riding Club, seeks to reopen discovery to further depose plaintiff David Johnston and compel him to produce additional documents. The judge has considered the relevant factors, including the necessity of the discovery, the defendant's diligence, the likelihood of the discovery interfering with the trial calendar, and the length of time since the last trial date. The judge finds that the first, third, and fourth factors support the defendant's motion, but the second factor weighs against it. However, the judge concludes that reopening discovery serves the interests of justice and grants the defendant's motion. The court hereby reopens all discovery and requires the parties to complete it by June 26, 2024, the current trial date.
