Plaintiff Dimerco Express USA Corp.
(“Plaintiff”) moves to enter a stipulated judgment against defendant Concord
Displays, LLC (“Defendant”) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 644.6.
The motion is unopposed. 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) In hearing a section 664.6 motion, the
trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms of
a settlement agreement as a judgment. (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies,
Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)
The stipulation for conditional entry
of judgment is attached to the motion and provides that Defendant shall make
six monthly payments of $1,000 and one payment of $20,656.27 on July 16, 2023.
If Defendant does not adhere to this payment plan, Plaintiff may obtain a
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 for $26,130.83, plus
court costs, interest, and attorney’s fees, less any payments made to date.
(Motion, Ex. A, p. 2.) Therefore, in total, Plaintiff requests a judgment of
$23,837.26. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that Defendant has paid $6,000 to
date, therefore the principal amount of the judgment should be $20,130.83.
Plaintiff states that the interest due on this amount is $2,178.54 based on an
interest rate of 10% per annum and a default date of June 19, 2023. Additionally,
attorney fees, according to Local Rule 3.214, are $993.89. Plaintiff also
claims costs of $534 for filing the complaint ($450) and serving Defendant
($99). 
Based on the attached stipulation and
calculations provided by Plaintiff’s counsel, the motion is GRANTED.
