The plaintiff has paid $6,000 to date, so the principal amount of the judgment is $20,130.83. The plaintiff is also entitled to interest, attorney fees, and costs. The judge has determined that the total amount owed is $23,837.26. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment in this amount.
