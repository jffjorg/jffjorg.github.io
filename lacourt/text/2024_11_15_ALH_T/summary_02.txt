And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The Judge found that the Defendant did not exercise reasonable diligence in bringing the motion, and that the Defendant was aware of the litigation and proceedings but chose to ignore them. The Judge noted that the Defendant received multiple notices and communications about the case, including written discovery, requests for entry of default, and notices of entry of judgment, but failed to respond or take any action. The Judge concluded that the Defendant's claimed ignorance of the proceedings was not excusable, and that the Defendant's motion was not reasonably diligent. As a result, the Judge denied the motion to set aside the default judgment.
