And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which sought to dismiss Ralphs' express indemnity cause of action. The defendants argued that the altercation did not arise from the use of the Common Area, but the judge found that the evidence is too ambiguous to make a determination as a matter of law. The judge concluded that there are factual issues that must be resolved by trial, including when and where the altercation "arose". The judge noted that the defendants' proposed characterization of the events is just one of several possible interpretations of the evidence, and that the Court cannot conclude that there is only one reasonable inference regarding when or where an altercation arose. As a result, the defendants have not met their initial burden required for summary judgment, and the motion is denied.
