Significant Statements:
  - "The court finds the TAC merely amplifies the existing allegations of agency and ratification set forth in the Second Amended Complaint, at least as to Hallmark Cards, Inc. and Crown Media Holdings. The SAC alleged that these two entities were liable for Hemmis and Short's misdeeds (Trespass, Negligence and other causes of action) because Hemmis and Short were their agents, and they ratified their trespass and other malicious acts by broadcasting shows produced in plaintiffs' home."
