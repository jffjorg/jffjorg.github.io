And here is an English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has ruled on the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Jessica Alvarado and Brian Mendes against Defendants Ford Motor Company and Sunrise Ford. The demurrer was based on the argument that the Plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent concealment are insufficient to state a claim. The court, however, finds that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a fraudulent concealment claim, as they have alleged symptoms of a transmission defect in their vehicle and that the Defendants knew about the defect and concealed it. The court also finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations are not barred by the economic loss rule under current case law. As a result, the court has overruled the demurrer and the case will proceed.
