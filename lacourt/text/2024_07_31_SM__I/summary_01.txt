And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by GMR, a defendant in a case related to a crowd surge at a concert in Las Vegas, Nevada. GMR claims it is a healthcare provider and is protected by California's MICRA law, and that the plaintiff never sought medical care from GMR, so there can be no professional negligence. The plaintiff disputes this, claiming that GMR is not a healthcare provider and that its causes of action are legitimate. The judge is puzzled by why California law applies in this case, given that the injury occurred in Nevada, GMR's services were to be rendered in Nevada, and the contract was to be performed in Nevada. The judge intends to discuss the matter with counsel and may require supplemental papers to be filed based on Nevada law, unless the parties stipulate that California law applies.
