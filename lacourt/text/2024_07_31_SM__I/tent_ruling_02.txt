 Case Number:  23SMCV02729    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion for summary judgment.  Plaintiff states that it will not oppose the
motion if defendant waives costs.  That
is not technically proper—there is no conditional non-opposition where the
condition is a settlement.  However, the
court will inquire whether defendant agrees to waive costs.  If so, the motion will be GRANTED and
defendant can prepare a judgment.  The
court notes that this is a merits motion, so the judgment will also be on the
merits.
