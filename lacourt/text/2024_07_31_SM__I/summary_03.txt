And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for the appointment of a receiver and a preliminary injunction will be granted. The case involves a loan of $5,386,000 from the lender to the defendant, which has been assigned to the plaintiff. The loan is secured by certain real property, and the borrower agreed not to allow any other liens on the property. However, the borrower allowed MRC to place a lien on the property of $30 million to secure certain other obligations. The plaintiff asserts that this violates the loan agreement and seeks the appointment of a receiver and the assignment of rents from the property. The court finds that the plaintiff has a strong likelihood of success on the merits and that the balance of hardships tilts in their favor. The court will grant the motion as prayed, with a $10,000 bond for the receiver and a $10,000 bond for the injunction.
