And here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a deposition subpoena seeking employment records from St. John's Hospital, where the plaintiff, Maria Gabriela Vieyra, is currently employed. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena violates her right to privacy and seeks inadmissible character evidence, while the defendants argue that the records are relevant to assessing the plaintiff's damages claim for future lost employment income and benefits and to assessing her claim of ongoing emotional injuries. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash and ordered her to pay sanctions to the defendants in the amount of $1,485.00.
