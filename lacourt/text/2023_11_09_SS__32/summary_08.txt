The ruling states that Defendant has met its burden to establish the absence of a triable issue of fact, and Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden by not opposing the motion. The Court finds that the curb/sidewalk where the plaintiff fell did not constitute a dangerous condition, and therefore, there is no triable issue of material fact. The ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the deemed admissions of Plaintiff and the lack of opposition from Plaintiff.
