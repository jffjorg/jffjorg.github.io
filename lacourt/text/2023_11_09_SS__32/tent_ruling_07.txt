[1] The
complaint in this case named as a defendant the “Chen Family Trust, with
Co-Trustees Jack M. Chen and Shirley Chen (‘Chen Trust’),” (Complaint ¶ 3),
which appears to name this entity as one defendant, rather than naming the
Co-Trustees as separate defendants. In response, the Chen Family Trust, without
naming Co-Trustees Jack M. Chen and Shirley Chen, filed an answer. Accordingly,
this ruling refers only to the Chen Family Trust as defendant.
