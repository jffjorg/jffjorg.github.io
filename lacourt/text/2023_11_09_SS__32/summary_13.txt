Significant Statements:
  - "The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390)
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted])
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Progressive Insurance Company (Petitioner) against Antasha Carter (Respondent) in an uninsured motorist proceeding. The Petitioner moves for terminating sanctions, claiming that Respondent has failed to comply with the Court's July 6, 2023 order compelling initial responses to discovery. The Court finds that Respondent's failure to respond was not willful, and therefore, terminating sanctions at this time are excessive. The Petitioner's motion is denied, and Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
