Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to relieve Shaun Bauman, counsel for Plaintiff Nazario Mejia Jimenez, from his representation. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication and Plaintiff's uncooperativeness in assisting with his case. The Court finds that relieving Counsel would likely prejudice Plaintiff's rights, particularly given the proximity to the trial date. The Court notes that the proposed order does not list all dates currently scheduled in the case. Counsel for the moving party is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service.
