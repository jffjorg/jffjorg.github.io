And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, set one, and special interrogatories, set one, is granted. The plaintiff failed to respond to the interrogatories, which were served on January 31, 2023, and extensions were granted until May 1, 2023. The plaintiff's former counsel was relieved on July 19, 2023, and it does not appear that the plaintiff has retained new counsel since then. The judge is ordering the plaintiff to serve complete and verified responses to the interrogatories, without objection, to the defendant's counsel within 30 days of notice of this order. The defendant is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
