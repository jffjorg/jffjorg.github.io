And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Roberta Stephens Villas Preservation, L.P.'s motion to compel Plaintiff Joy White's deposition. The motion was filed on March 22, 2023, and Plaintiff did not appear for the deposition on February 16, 2023. However, Plaintiff later appeared for deposition on May 1, 2023, making the motion to compel moot. The judge declines to award monetary sanctions to Defendant because Defendant failed to provide a meet and confer declaration. The judge denies Defendant's motion to compel and orders Defendant to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service.
