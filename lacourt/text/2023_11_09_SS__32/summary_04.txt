And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which will be revisited at a future court hearing. The judge is considering whether the defendant exercised reasonable care in mopping the floor and moving a warning sign during the process. The plaintiff slipped and fell on the wet floor, but disputes seeing the condition at the time. The judge notes that a reasonable person could be expected to see a wet condition when using due care, but that other factors such as how the floor looks and how much time has passed are also important considerations. The judge also cites a previous case, Melancon v. Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken, which held that a restaurant exercised reasonable care by placing warning signs near the counter and entrance. However, the judge notes that the warning sign in this case was moved during the mopping process, which is significant. The judge ultimately concludes that the issue of whether the defendant exercised reasonable care cannot be determined as a matter of law, and that the factfinder will need to determine this issue at trial.
