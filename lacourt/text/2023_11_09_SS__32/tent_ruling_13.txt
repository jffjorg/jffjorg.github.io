Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions

OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Progressive
Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
petition for a case number in connection with an Uninsured Motorist proceeding
pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.2 involving Respondent Antasha Carter
(“Respondent”).
 
Petitioner moves for terminating sanctions against Respondent
dismissing Respondent’s arbitration proceeding because of her misuse of the
discovery process. Petitioner asserts she has failed to comply with the Court’s
July 6, 2023 order compelling initial responses to discovery.   
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“[T]he
uninsured motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive jurisdiction to
hear discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist arbitrations. Invested
with the exclusive power to rule, and because the uninsured motorist statute
makes available ‘all rights, remedies, obligations, liabilities and procedures
set forth in [the Civil Discovery Act]’ (§ 11580.2, subd. (f)), the court
necessarily ha[s] the power to dismiss the case as a terminating
sanction.”  (Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th
913, 926 [trial court did not abuse discretion in dismissing insured’s
underinsured motorist arbitration as terminating sanction for insured’s refusal
to obey prior discovery order].)   
 
If a person is engaging in misuse of the discovery process, the Court
may issue a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
(2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order
for discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 (d).) 
 
“Misuse of the discovery process” includes: “(d) Failing to respond or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.)  
 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions
imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and
for violating various discovery statutes].) 

 
DISCUSSION
 
Petitioner first served Special Interrogatories, Set One and Demand
for Production of Documents, Set One on Respondent,
on July 15, 2022. (Calendo Decl. ¶ 3.) An extension to respond until September
5, 2022, was granted. (Id. ¶ 4.) On September 7, 2022, Petitioner learned
that Respondent was no longer represented by
her then-counsel. Petitioner began sending correspondence to Respondent, who remained unrepresented, to respond
to discovery. On November 17, 2022, Petitioner received an email from Respondent stating that she intended to respond to the
discovery requests. Respondent was informed
that if she served complete and verified responses prior to a hearing on a
motion to compel, the motion would be taken off-calendar. (Id. ¶ 9, Exh.
G.) The motions to compel were filed on December 30, 2022. On March 2, 2023, Petitioner
received notice that attorney David Esfeh was retained to represent Respondent. (Id. ¶ 13, Exh. K.) Petitioner
granted another discovery extension until May 12, 2023. (Id. ¶ 15.) On
July 6, 2023, the Court granted the motion to compel Special Interrogatories
and Demand for Production and ordered Respondent to pay $923.30 in sanctions,
within 30 days. Respondent did not appear at the hearing. On July 11, 2023,
Petitioner received notice that Respondent was no
longer represented by David Esfeh. (Id. ¶ 18.)  As of the filing of this motion, Respondent
has not complied with the order. (Id. ¶ 8.)
 
Petitioner, however, does not present additional evidence that Respondent’s
actions are willful, other than the fact responses have not been served. For
example, in Miranda, there was evidence that the plaintiff “announced, through
counsel, she would not sign the authorizations. Thus, the evidence established
that plaintiff flatly refused to obey a court order.” (Miranda v.
21st Century Ins. Co.
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 929.) Unlike in Miranda, here, there is no evidence
that the failure to respond was willful. The correspondence with Respondent
herself was that she intended to respond to discovery requests. She was then
represented by counsel. No further statements by Respondent are referenced in
counsel’s declaration.
 
As a result, the Court finds that terminating sanctions at this time is
excessive. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Petitioner’s motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Petitioner shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
