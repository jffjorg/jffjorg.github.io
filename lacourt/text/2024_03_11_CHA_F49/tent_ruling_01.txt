  Case Number:  22STCV23442    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    3/11/24     Case    Name: Krystal Shin, by and through GAL You Sun Jang v. City of Los    Angeles, et al.     Case    # 22STCV23442      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MARCH 11, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT  PLAYCORE WISCONSIN INC.’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S FORM  INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 22STCV23442    Motion  filed: 9/27/23   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Krystal Shin, by and through  her parent and guardian ad litem (“GAL”) You Sun Jang (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant PlayCore Wisconsin Inc.  (“Defendant” or “PlayCore”)  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court compelling Defendant PlayCore to produce further  responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1.1; 3.6; 3.7;  12.1; 15.1; 16.1; 16.2; 16.3; 16.4 and 16.5, and imposing monetary sanctions in  the amount of $4,950.00 against PlayCore and its counsel jointly and severally.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED. The monetary sanction is GRANTED IN PART.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from a 5-year-old Plaintiff’s injuries on  February 20, 2022, allegedly caused by the playground equipment located at a  Los Angeles City Community Park, 11075 Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace,  California 91432 (the “Park”).   On July 20, 2022, Plaintiff initiated the present action against  Defendants City of Los Angeles, and Does 1 through 20. The Complaint alleges  the following causes of action: (1) dangerous condition of public property, (2)  negligence, and (3) strict liability.   On September 16, 2022, Defendant City of Los Angeles filed its  Cross-Complaint against Roes 1 to 20 for (1)  apportionment of fault, (2) declaratory relief, and (3) indemnification.   On February 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Amended to  Complaint, substituting Defendant PlayCore for Doe 1.    On February 16, 2022, Defendant City of Los Angeles filed  its Answer.               On March  13, 2023, Defendant PlayCore filed its Answer to the Complaint.                On  September 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to compel Defendant  PlayCore to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set  One. Subsequently, PlayCore filed its Opposition on February 27, 2024, and  Plaintiff replied on March 1, 2024.   ANALYSIS   “A propounding party may move  for an order compelling further response [to interrogatories] if the  propounding party deems … (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is  evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under  Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those  documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to the interrogatory is without merit  or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 (a).)   “The court shall impose a  monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories,  unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 (d).) A.     All  Procedural Requirements Are Met   1.       45-Day Rule “Unless notice of this motion  [to compel further responses to interrogatories] is given within 45 days of the  service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on  or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the  responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right  to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c).)   Plaintiff filed and served this  Motion on September 27, 2023, within 45 days of receiving Defendant PlayCore’s  supplemental responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, on September 15,  2023. (See Nazdjanova Decl., ¶ 12, 9/27/23 Proof of Service.) 2.       Meet and Confer A motion to compel further  responses to interrogatories must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)               Plaintiff met and conferred with  Defendant PlayCore on multiple occasions before filing the instant Motion. This  includes a meet and confer letter dated August 7, 2023, which outlines the  deficiencies in PlayCore’s initial response, and a second meet and confer  letter dated September 19, 2023, seeking to resolve the discovery dispute and requesting  supplemental responses. (Nazdjanova Decl., ¶ 13.)                Therefore, the meet and confer  requirements per Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 subdivision (b)(1)  are satisfied.   3.       Separate Statement A motion to compel further  responses to interrogatories must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(2).) “A separate statement is a separate  document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the information  necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that  are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) Plaintiff  has met the above requirement by filing a separate statement explaining the  interrogatories at issue, Defendant PlayCore’s responses, and why further  responses to the interrogatories are necessary.   B.      Plaintiff  Sufficiently Demonstrates Defendant PlayCore’s Further Responses are Warranted    1.       Supplemental Responses Dated September 15, 2023 The Court observes that PlayCore’s supplementary responses,  dated September 15, 2023, consist of the same generic, boilerplate answers to  all form interrogatories at issue. Specifically, each supplemental response  states,    “Objections:  Responding  party asserts all general and specific objections previously asserted all off  prior discovery; further objects on the grounds that the propounding party  refused a request for a time extension of time to respond to the instant  discovery based on the full disclosure to opposing counsel of the unavailable  of responding party to review and verify' said responses and that responding  party's attorneys are engaged to commence a multi-party trial with a month-long  trial estimate. In the spirit of discovery and cooperation, Propounding Party  was given a lengthy extension to file any motion to compel, if necessary, if  the discovery matter could not be resolved informally. Propounding party,  therefore, is acting bad faith and non-compliance with local court guidelines  for civility in litigation. Additionally, Propounding party's counsel served a  Notice of Unavailability which opposing counsel expects to be honored.”   Plaintiff correctly points out that “propounding party  refused a request for a time extension of time to respond ... and that  responding party’s attorneys are engaged to commence a multi-party trial with a  month-long trial estimate” does not warranty a failure to provide  code-compliant responses. A review of the records indicates that Plaintiff’s  counsel had granted a 30-day extension for the time to respond, around the end  of June 2023 (Nazdjanov Decl., ¶ 5), and later granted an additional three-week extension on  September 5, 2023. (Id., ¶ 9.) Consequently, although the Court agrees that  parties should make efforts to resolve discovery issues, including scheduling  and availability, the Court determines that Plaintiff is not obligated to grant  any additional time extensions and did not act in bad faith in refusing the  request from Defendant.   Since  PlayCore’s supplementary responses did not provide material answers beyond the  boilerplate objection. The Court now proceeds to review the answers and  objections provided in its initial response dated August 3, 2023. (Nazdjanova  Decl., Ex. “B.”)   2.       Responses  Dated August 3, 2023   For  No. 1.1, PlayCore acknowledged its inadvertent omission and stated it “will be  glad to provide a supplemental response.” (Def.’s Separate Statement, at 3.)   For  No. 3.6, which asks for any fictitious names used by Defendant, despite numerous  instances in case files where PlayCore’s counsel’s signature block self-identifies  as “Attorneys for Defendant PlayCore Wisconsin, Inc., dba GameTime, a  Wisconsin corporation sued herein as DOE 1” (Opp’n., at 4) (Underlines added),  PlayCore’s answer to No. 3.6 is “No.” (Def.’s Separate Statement, at 4.)   For  No. 3.7, asking for identification of any public entity registered or licensed  Defendant’s business, PlayCore answered “Responding party has all of the  necessary business license at the time of the incident to conduct business.” (Ibid.)   For  No. 12.1, which requests the names of all witnesses to the accident, PlayCore  responded, “Responding Party was not present at the time of Plaintiff's  incident.” (Id., at 6.)    Pursuant  to the Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (a), (b), each answer in the response  must be “as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably  available to the responding party permits.… If an interrogatory cannot be  answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent  possible.” Where the question is specific and explicit, an answer that supplies only a portion of the  information sought is improper. It is also improper to provide “deftly worded conclusionary  answers designed to evade a series of explicit questions.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)   Additionally,  “[i]f the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an  interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information  by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally  available to the propounding party.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (c); Regency  Health Services, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1504.)              Furthermore,  settled law states that where an interrogatory asks for the names of all  witnesses to a particular event then known to the responding party, a response  omitting the name of a known witness could subject the adversary to unfair  surprise at trial and therefore may result in an order excluding that witness’  testimony. (R & B Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2006) 140  Cal.App.4th 327, 356.)   Consequently,  the Court finds Defendant PlayCore’s answers to Nos. 3.6, 3.7, and 12.1,  without further elaboration, to be evasive and conclusory, failing to meet the  requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.   For  No. 15.1, asking for facts and evidence supporting Defendant’s denial or  allegation or defenses, PlayCore answered “Based on the advice of its  attorneys, Responding Party filed a general denial as it is  entitled to do under the Code of Civil Procedure. Parties are permitted to use a general denial as a means  of preserving all possible defenses on all issues, including those which may surface during the  discovery phase of litigation. On the advice of its attorneys, Responding Party  has also filed a number of affirmative defenses, which may become relevant as the discovery and  investigation process reveals more information. Responding Party asserted the defenses to preserve all  possible defenses, including those suggested by facts of which it may have been unaware of at the time  the answer was filed. The affirmative defenses may or may not become relevant depending upon  the information revealed during the discovery and investigation phase of the  litigation. Defendant reserves the right to supplement this response based on  continuing investigation, further discovery and evidence adduced at trial.”  (Def.’s Separate Statement, at 8.)   For  Nos. 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5, PlayCore applies a generic answer that  “Unknow at this time. Discovery and investigation is continuing.” This group of  interrogatory numbers concerns factual evidence at the occurrence of the  INCIDENT which is defined to “include the circumstances and events surrounding  the alleged accident, injury[.]” (Def.’s Separate Statement, at 6.)   In  justifying its answers, Defendant PlayCore contends that its lack of  information is due to the scheduling of its deposition of Plaintiff’s GAL,  which will not take place until March 25, 2024. (Def.’s Separate Statement, at  13, 14, 16, 17.) Plaintiff contends that Defendant had all of the documents,  including medical records produced by Plaintiff in April 2023, arguing  Defendant’s answer of ‘unknown at this time” is irresponsive and evasive.  (Reply., at 7.)    The  Court finds Plaintiff’s argument persuasive. With the medical records produced  by Plaintiff in April 2023, PlayCore’s mere assertion of “Unknown at this time”  does not sufficiently demonstrate “information reasonably available to the  responding party,” thus also fails to comply with Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.220. Furthermore, Defendant’s responses imply that supplementary  answers may be produced within a reasonable time following the deposition of  Plaintiff’s GAL.    Accordingly,  the Court concludes that Defendant PlayCore’s further responses may be ordered  for Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1.1; 3.6; 3.7; 12.1; 15.1;  16.1; 16.2; 16.3; 16.4 and 16.5, as Defendant’s responses have failed to meet  the requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.   3.       Objections  Dated August 3, 2023   Defendant  PlayCore advanced various objections to the Form Interrogatories, including,  but not limited to, claims that the requests were “vague, ambiguous, and  overbroad,” and assertions of “attorney-client privilege and/or the attorney  work product doctrine.” (See generally Def.’s Separate Statement)   “By  objecting to the requests as a whole, without some attempt to admit or deny in  part, and by making no attempt to answer with an explanation of its inability,  it failed to show the “good faith” required by the statute.” (Cembrook  v. Superior Court In and For City and County of San Francisco (1961) 56  Cal.2d 423, 430.)   Any  information that is not protected under the attorney work product or  attorney-client privilege is discoverable as long as it is relevant to an issue  in the pending matter or is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of  admissible evidence. (Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th  1599, 1612.)    In addressing  the issue of work product privilege may be implicated for form interrogatories,  the Supreme Court of California considered an interrogatory asking whether a party or its agent has “obtained” a written or  recorded witness statement in Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th  480, 500 (Coito). In its decision, the Supreme Court stated, “we hold that  information responsive to form interrogatory  [] is not automatically entitled as a matter of law to absolute or qualified work product privilege. Instead, the interrogatory usually must be answered.  However, an objecting party may be entitled to protection if it can make a  preliminary or foundational showing that answering the interrogatory would reveal the attorney's tactics,  impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in opposing counsel  taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or efforts.” (Id., at  502.)   The  Court finds these interrogatories relevant and devoid of ambiguity. Furthermore,  following the instruction in Coito, the Court finds PlayCore’s assertion  of the work product privilege objection untenable, as it fails to make any  preliminary showing that answering the interrogatory would reveal the  attorney’s tactics, impressions, or evaluation of the case.   Therefore,  the Court OVERRULES PlayCore’s objections to Interrogatories Nos. 1.1; 3.6;  3.7; 12.1; 15.1; 16.1; 16.2; 16.3; 16.4 and 16.5.                           Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Further Responses to  Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1.1; 3.6; 3.7; 12.1; 15.1; 16.1; 16.2; 16.3; 16.4 and 16.5.   C.     Monetary Sanctions   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.300, subdivision (d), the Court concludes that Defendant PlayCore  and its’ counsel may be properly subjected to the monetary sanctions against  them, jointly and severally, for unsuccessfully opposing the instant Motion.               Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions  in the amount of $4,950.00 based on 12.4 hours of work in bringing the instant  Motion at an hourly rate of $400.00. (Nazdjanova Decl., ¶ 10.) The Court deems  the hourly rate reasonable but adjusts the total hours to a reasonable 8.4  hours, encompassing 5.4 hours drafting the Motion, 2.5 hours reviewing the  Opposition and preparing the Reply, and 0.5 hours anticipated for attending the  hearing. This results in a total of $3,360.00, calculated based on $400/hr. x  8.4 hours.               Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART  Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions, awarding a total amount of  $3,360.00.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant  PlayCore’s Further Responses to Form  Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1.1; 3.6; 3.7; 12.1; 15.1; 16.1; 16.2; 16.3;  16.4 and 16.5 is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary  Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   Defendant PlayCore is ordered to  provide supplementary responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One,  Nos. 1.1; 3.6; 3.7; 12.1; 15.1; 16.1; 16.2; 16.3; 16.4 and 16.5, within 15 days  following the deposition of Plaintiff’s Guardian Ad Litem, but not later than  35 days from the date of this hearing.   Defendant PlayCore and its  counsel are further ordered to pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions, jointly and  severally, in the amount of $3,360.00 within 10 days.   Moving party to give notice.
