And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the moving Defendants. The motion was filed late and failed to present new or different facts or circumstances justifying reconsideration of the Court's previous Minute Order. The Court finds that the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 and therefore cannot be considered. The Court also rejects the moving Defendants' argument that the delay in filing the motion was excusable neglect. Finally, the Court notes that even if the delay were excusable, the moving Defendants did not present sufficient grounds for reconsideration. The motion is therefore denied.
