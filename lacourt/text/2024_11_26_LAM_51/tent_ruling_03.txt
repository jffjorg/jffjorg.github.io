LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet and Confer
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so
satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant
to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3).¿The meet and confer requirement also applies to
motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.) Here, the parties had an extensive phone
conversation to discuss the potential demurrer and motion to strike. (Wainer
Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.) However, the declaration indicates the meet and confer occurred
for another pleading (a cross-complaint with Shine FX). (Ibid.) In the context of this case, though, the court is inclined
to believe that the parties, represented by the same counsel and filing
simultaneous demurrers with motions to strike various pleadings, met and
conferred on all pleadings. Accordingly, this requirement is met.
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿ 
 
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (CCP § 436(a).) The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Id.¿§¿437.)¿“When the defect which
justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave
to amend.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman¿(1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)¿
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request
for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8
Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes judicial notice of the
foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of
public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice
of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App.
5th 389, 400.)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Demurrer
 
Moving Parties contend that the SAC claims are barred by the
litigation privilege, that Plaintiff exceeded scope of leave by naming Houman
Sarshar and Globe Theater as defendants, that the alter ego claims are a sham
on their face because Sarshar was a disclosed agent, the claims for conversion
and trespass to chattels are repackaged versions of the breach of contract
claim, and the unlawful business practice is entirely premised on the breach of
contract.
 
Plaintiff argues they sufficiently plead alter ego
allegations at this stage and the other causes of action are sufficiently
plead.[1]
 
Moving Parties reply that Plaintiff concedes the litigation
privilege point, that the alter ego claims lack factual allegations, and there
are no allegations of individual activity by Sarshar in the SAC.
 
Here, Plaintiff is correct that the court has already
decided the merits of Moving Parties’ litigation privilege argument and the
merits of the claims against it. (June 10, 2024 Final Ruling on Demurrer.) However,
Plaintiff’s claims against added defendants Sarshar and GTE exceeded the scope
of leave granted to amend the FAC to allege punitive damages. 
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer in its
entirety as to Defendant 740 South Broadway LLC and SUSTAINS the demurrer in
its entirety as to Defendants Sarshar and Globe Theater Entertainment, Inc.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Moving Parties seek an order striking the following language
from the SAC:
1.      Paragraph
48: “In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,
where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been
guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the
actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of
punishing the defendant.” (Civ Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) “‘Fraud’ means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
(Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).)”
2.      
Paragraph 58: “In an action for the breach
of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages
for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.” (Civ Code, §
3294, subd. (a).) “‘Fraud’ means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).)”
3.      
Prayer for Relief: “Additionally on the
First, Second, and Third Causes of Action:” “f. Punitive damages.”
“In order to state a prima facie claim for punitive
damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general
punitive damage statute, Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) Civil Code section 3294 permits recovery of punitive
damages where, in an action for breach of obligation not arising from contract,
the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has
been guilty “of oppression, fraud, or malice . . . .” (Civ. Code § 3294(a).)
Malice is conduct “intended by the defendant to cause injury to plaintiff, or
despicable conduct that is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code §
3294(c)(1).) “Oppression” means “despicable conduct that subjects a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) “Fraud” is “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit,
or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on
the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of punitive damages.” (Grieves v.
Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166.) “Not only must there by
circumstances of oppression, fraud, or malice, but facts must be alleged in the
pleading to support such a claim.” (Id.;
see G.D. Searle & Co. v. Superior
Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29.) 
 
In other words, “[t]he mere carelessness or ignorance of
the defendant does not justify the imposition of punitive damages . . . .
Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to levels of
extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens
should not have to tolerate.” (Flyer’s
Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
1149, 1154; see American Airlines, Inc.
v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1051
[“Punitive damages are appropriate if the defendant’s acts are reprehensible,
fraudulent or in blatant violation of law or policy.”].) 
 
Plaintiff relies on paragraph 32 to support its claims for
punitive damages. However, upon reviewing the SAC, the wrongful conduct alleged
is proceeding with the unlawful detainer action. Unlike the breach of contract
claim discussed in prior rulings, these allegations do run afoul of the
litigation privilege. Neither party addressed this in the context of the motion
to strike. Assuming the litigation privilege did not apply, the allegations
still do not support punitive damages because they merely allege breach of
contract. (See, e.g., SAC ¶ 32(e).) 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the motion to strike in
full.
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend should be liberally granted if there is a
reasonable possibility an amendment could cure the defect. (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1035.) The burden is on Plaintiff to establish that
the defect is reasonably capable of cure with leave to amend. (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723,
742.) Here, Plaintiff did not request leave to amend. The court is inclined to
deny leave to amend because Plaintiff unsuccessfully amended the complaint to
support their claim for punitive damages. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Demurrer
to the SAC is OVERRULED as to Defendant 740 South Broadway, LLC in its
entirety;
2.      Demurrer
to the SAC is SUSTAINED as to Defendants Hourman Sarshar and Globe Theater
Entertainment, Inc. in its entirety;
3.      Motion
to Strike is GRANTED in its entirety;
4.      Leave
to Amend is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
