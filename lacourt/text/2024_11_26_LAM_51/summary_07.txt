And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for limited-expedited discovery. The plaintiff seeks to identify the Doe Defendants who allegedly accessed her computer network without authorization. The plaintiff has filed a Complaint against the Doe Defendants with four causes of action, including invasion of privacy, conversion, unauthorized access to computers, and declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff alleges that she identified the Defendants' IP addresses but not their identities. The judge finds that the limited discovery is warranted because it is narrowly tailored to seek relevant information to identify the Doe Defendants and there is no other source where the plaintiff can obtain this information. The judge also finds that the plaintiff can address Google's concerns regarding lack of sufficient information in the subpoena by issuing new subpoenas. As a result, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to conduct limited-expedited discovery.
