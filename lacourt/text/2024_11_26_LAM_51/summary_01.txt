And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax the defendants' costs. The defendants had filed a memorandum of costs seeking to recover $439.20, but the plaintiff argued that the costs were unreasonable and improper. The judge found that the plaintiff's action was not frivolous and that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to convince the court that the action was objectively frivolous. The judge also noted that the plaintiff presented evidence at trial to support his position, and while the jury ultimately decided in favor of the defendants, that finding alone does not necessarily establish that the claims were objectively frivolous. As a result, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendants' memorandum of costs in its entirety.
