STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On May 24, 2022, Plaintiff Severino Dela Rosa (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Tutor Perini Corporation, Tutor-Saliba

on his age and eventually wrongfully terminated by Defendants.  
 
On

DENIED.
 
On
October 24, 2022, Defendants filed an Answer.
 
On
May 21, 2024, Trial commenced.
 
On
June 24, 2024, Defendants filed Judgment on Jury Verdict. The Judgment was in
favor of Defendants. Judgment was entered that same date.
 
On
July 3, 2024, Defendants filed a memorandum of costs.
 
On
July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to strike or tax costs. On
November 12, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition. On November 19, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
In general, the prevailing party is entitled as a matter
of  right to recover costs for suit in any action of proceeding. (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 1032(b); Santisas
v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott
Co. of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Allowable
costs under CCP § 10335 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and
must be reasonable in amount. An item not specifically allowable under section
1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable
in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e.,
reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
761, 773-774.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends Defendants cannot recover costs because
Plaintiff’s FEHA Complaint was not frivolous, unreasonable, or without
foundation. Alternatively, Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ requested costs
are unreasonable and improper. Defendants argue costs are warranted because the
action was objectively frivolous but concedes that two trial transcripts,
totaling $806.75, should be stricken from its memorandum of costs.[1]
 
After a
prevailing party files a memorandum of costs, the losing party may dispute any
or all of the items in the prevailing party's costs memorandum by a motion to
strike or tax costs. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).)¿ 
 
A prevailing
party is “the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(a)(4).) ¿“Except as
otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs.” (Id., § 1032(b).)¿¿ 
 
 “A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety’ of the
items listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to
demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487
italics and brackets omitted.)¿ On the other hand, items that are properly
objected to are put in issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming
them as costs.¿ (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Ass'n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774–776.)¿ Whether an item
listed on the cost bill was reasonably necessary is a question of fact for the
trial court, whose decision is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.¿ (Bender v. County of Los Angeles, supra,
217 Cal.App.4th at 989.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“…Government Code
section 12965(b) is an express exception to Code of Civil Procedure section
1032(b) and the former, rather than the latter, therefore governs costs awards
in FEHA cases.” (Williams v. Chino Valley
Independent Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 105.)¿ 
¿ 
Per Government
Code section 12965, subdivision (b),¿ 
¿ 
“In civil actions brought under this section, the court, in
its discretion, may award to the prevailing party, including the department,
reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees, except
that, notwithstanding Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a prevailing
defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action
was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff
continued to litigate after it clearly became so.”¿¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s motion is well taken. First, Plaintiff’s
action concerns wrongful termination due to his age (80 years old). (Rodriguez
Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.) Defendant, on the other hand, did provided insufficient evidence
(if at all) to convince this court that Plaintiff’s action was objectively
frivolous. That the jury ultimately decided in Defendants’ favor is not dispositive.
(See Rosenman v. Christensen, Miller,
Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 859, 873-974.)
In this case, Plaintiff presented evidence at trial to support his position.
(Rodriguez Decl. ¶¶ 10-17.) While the jury ultimately rejected the evidence, that
finding alone does not necessarily establish that the claims were objectively frivolous.

 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to
strike Defendants’ memorandum of costs.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Strike Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs is GRANTED;
2.      Defendants’
July 3, 2024 Memorandum of Costs is STRICKEN in its entirety.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
