And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants The Walt Disney Company, International Famous Players Radio Picture Corporation, and John Ridley IV. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's allegations regarding the employer-employee relationship and liability for FEHA and Labor Code violations.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the first three causes of action, which are based on FEHA violations. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action, which are based on negligent supervision and retention and intentional infliction of emotional distress, respectively.

However, the judge overrules the demurrer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, which are based on Labor Code violations. The judge also overrules the demurrer to the seventh cause of action, which is based on wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

The judge grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer. The plaintiff has 20 days to file an amended complaint.
