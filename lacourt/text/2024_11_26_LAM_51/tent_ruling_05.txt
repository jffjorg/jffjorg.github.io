STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff Asta Jonasson (Plaintiff) filed
a Complaint against Defendants The Walt Disney Company, ABC Signature, LLC dba
ABC Studios, International Famous Players Radio Picture Corporation, and John
Ridley IV (Defendants) with nine causes of action for: (1) Discrimination in
Violation of the FEHA, (2) Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA, (3) Failure to
Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA, (4) Violation
of Equal Pay Act, (5) Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5, (6)
Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code § 98.6, (7) Wrongful Termination in
Violation of Public Policy, (8) Negligent Supervision and Retention, and (9)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff
worked for Defendants. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants failed to pay
her commensurate with her skill, effort, and responsibility. Additionally,
Defendants hired a white woman to perform tasks Plaintiff was already
performed, paid that person substantially more money, and terminated Plaintiff
for complaining about it.
 
On May 6, 2024, The Walt Disney
Company (Disney) and ABC Signature, LLC (ABC) filed an Answer.
 
On June 18, 2024, International Famous Players Radio Picture
Corporation (IFP) and John Ridley IV (Ridley) filed a Demurrer to the
Complaint. On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On August 14,
2024, IFP and Ridley filed a reply.
 
On September 17, 2024, the case was reassigned pursuant to
recusal.
 
On October 18, 2024, the court held a Case Management
Conference and reset the hearing on IFP and Ridley’s Demurrer to November 27,
2024.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court GRANTS Moving Parties’ request for
judicial notice.
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿ 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
Prior to
filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and
confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate
that they so satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a
declaration pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3).¿The meet and confer
requirement also applies to motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.)¿Here, the parties
spoke via telephone on June 7, 2024 but were unable to resolve the dispute
necessitating the demurrer. (Hughes Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.) Therefore, this requirement
is met.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Moving Parties contend that Plaintiff’s Complaint
insufficiently alleges they are her employers, that her specific claims
contradict her general allegations, and that her conclusory alter ego
allegations support no claims. Plaintiff argues she sufficiently alleged facts
supporting her claims. 
 
Causes of Action
Nos. 1-3: FEHA Claims
 
Moving Parties contend that Plaintiff’s FEHA claims fail
because they cannot be held liable as supervisors, not employers.
Alternatively, Moving Parties contend that Plaintiff insufficiently alleged
they are employers under FEHA. Plaintiff argues she sufficiently alleged Moving
Parties are employers.
 
To bring a cause of action under the FEHA, a plaintiff must
establish an employer-employee
relationship between herself and the defendant.  (See Gov. Code, § 12940
(a); Patterson v. Domino's Pizza, LLC
(2014) 60 Cal.4th 474, 499 (Patterson)
(“Essential to plaintiff’s statutory [FEHA] claims is the existence of ‘an
employment relationship’”).  
 
i.                   
Defendant Ridley
Plaintiff insufficiently alleged liability for Ridley in his
individual capacity. First, it is undisputed that individuals are not liable
for FEHA violations. (Reno v. Baird
(1998) 18 Cal.4th 640, 643.) Here, Plaintiff alleges that Ridley “is an
individual” and “was a supervisor with and/or officer or director of IFPRPC.”
(Complaint, ¶ 7(a).) Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that ABC employed Ridley. (Complaint
¶ 17.) Plaintiff then alleges, in a conclusory fashion, that the Defendants
(including Ridley) are alter egos of each other and/or aided and abetted the
various misconduct. (Complaint, ¶¶ 9, 11.) This is insufficient to show Ridley
was anything but Plaintiff’s supervisor.
 
ii.                 
Defendant IFPRPC
Plaintiff’s claims against IFPRPC are also problematic.
First, Plaintiff unequivocally alleges that IFPRPC is employed by ABC.
(Complaint, ¶ 17.) As with Ridley, if IFPRPC is merely a supervisor, then it
cannot be liable under FEHA. (Reno,
supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 643.) 
 
However, liability may attach if IFPRPC is a business-entity
agent of Defendant ABC. According to the California Supreme Court, FEHA’s
definition of employer “permits a business entity acting as an agent of an
employer to be held directly liable as an employer for employment
discrimination in violation of FEHA in appropriate circumstances when the
business-entity agent has at least five employees and carries out
FEHA-regulated activities on behalf of an employer.” (Raines v. U.S. Healthworks Medical Group (2023) 15 Cal.5th 268,
291.) Here, Plaintiff failed to allege that IFPRPC has at least five employees
or that it carries out FEHA-regulated activities on behalf of an employer.
(Complaint, ¶6(c).) As with the Raines
Court, this court declines to decide whether a business-entity agent with less
than five employees is similarly bound. (Raines,
supra, 15 Cal.5th at p. 291.) 
 
Finally, Plaintiff’s argument that Moving Parties are dual
employers with Defendant ABC is not well taken. An employee may have two
employers “when an employer lends [that] employee to another employer and
relinquishes to the borrowing employer all right of control over the employee’s
activities.” (Mathieu v. Norrell Corp.
(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1183 [citing Riley
v. Southwest Marine, Inc. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1242, 1247-1248.]) The
first employer is called the “general employer” and the second is called the
“special employer.” (Id. at p. 1184.)
Here, as in Mathieu and Riley, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
ABC was her general employer because they “assigned” her to work for Moving
Parties and she “continued to receive her earned wages directly from ABC.”
(Complaint, ¶ 17.) It follows that Defendant IFPRPC is the alleged special
employer because Plaintiff “was performing tasks that befit her title at IFPRPC.”
(Complaint, ¶ 20.) Even so, Plaintiff did not satisfy the Raines test to hold Defendant IFPRPC liable as an employer under
FEHA.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
First, Second, and Third Causes of Action.
 
Causes of Action
Nos. 4, 5, & 6: Labor Code Violations (Labor Code §§ 1197.5, 1102, 98.6)
 
In order to allege a cause of action under the Equal Pay
Act, a plaintiff must plead the following factual elements: (1) plaintiff was
paid less than the rate paid to a person of the opposite sex, (2) plaintiff was
performing substantially similar work as the other person, considering the
overall combination of skill, effort, and responsibility required, and (3)
plaintiff was working under similar working conditions as the other person of
the opposite sex.  (Lab. Code, § 1197.5, subd. (a) [“An employer shall not
pay any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of
the opposite sex for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of
skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working
conditions”].)   
A “prerequisite to asserting a Labor Code section 1102.5
violation is the existence of an employer-employee
relationship at the time the allegedly retaliatory action occurred.”  (Hansen v. Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation (2008) 171 Cal.App.4th 1537, 1546 (Hansen) (emphasis added).) Plaintiff must similarly assert a
violation of Labor Code § 98.6 claim against an employer. (See Lloyd v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 320, 330.)
 
The court is unaware of authority imposing the same employee
number requirements as in the FEHA.[1]
 
As with the FEHA claims, Plaintiff insufficiently alleged
liability against Defendant Ridley. However, unlike the FEHA claims, Plaintiff
has sufficiently alleged that Defendant IFPRPC was her employer for purposes of
the Labor Code claims. (Complaint, ¶ 17.) Notably, Plaintiff’s
allegations support her argument for dual employers. 
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the Fourth,
Fifth, and Sixth Causes of Action as to Defendant Ridley and OVERRULES the
Demurrer as to Defendant IFPRPC.
 
Cause of Action No.
7: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
 
“The elements of a claim for wrongful discharge in violation
of public policy are (1) an employer-employee relationship, (2) the employer
terminated the plaintiff's employment, (3) the termination was substantially
motivated by a violation of public policy, and (4) the discharge caused the
plaintiff harm.” (Yau v. Allen (2014)
229 Cal.App.4th 144, 154.)  A four-part test is utilized to determine
whether a particular policy can support a common law wrongful termination
claim.  The “policy” in question must meet the following requirements: (1)
the policy is supported by either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2)
the policy is “public” in that it “inures to the benefit of the public” and not
merely the interests of the individual; (3) the policy was articulated at the
time of the discharge; and (4) the policy is “fundamental” and
“substantial.”  (Franklin v.
Monadnock Co. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 252, 258.) 
 
The analysis is the same as for the Fifth and Sixth Causes
of Action.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the
Seventh Cause of Action as to Defendant Ridley and OVERRULES the Demurrer as to
Defendant IFPRPC.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
Seventh Cause of Action.
 
Cause of Action No.
8: Negligent Supervision and Retention
The elements of a claim for negligent supervision and
retention are: (1) an employer’s supervising an employee, (2) who is
incompetent or unfit, (3) the employer had reason to believe undue risk of harm
would exist because of the employment; and (4) harm occurs. (Delfino v. Agilent Technologies, Inc.
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 790, 815.)
 
Here, Moving Parties’ argument is well taken. First,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Ridley is the bad actor who discriminated
against her. (Complaint, ¶¶ 23, 24, 25, 29, 30.) However, Plaintiff also argues
that Ridley is the alter ego of IFPRPC. (Opp. 12:17-18.)  The court is unaware of authority supporting
Plaintiff’s position that Ridley can negligently hire and supervise himself. Additionally,
Plaintiff alleges that IFPRPC wrongfully terminated her employment “in
retaliation for her complaints and in discrimination on the bases of her
gender, race, color, and national origin.” (Complaint, ¶ 31.) This is the same
harm purportedly supporting Plaintiff’s claim against IFPRPC for negligently
supervising Ridley. (Complaint, ¶¶ 98, 100.) 
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
Eighth Cause of Action.
 
Cause of Action No.
9: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)
 
In order to properly allege a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must allege the
following elements: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with
the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and
(3) the defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct was the actual and proximate
cause of the severe emotional distress.”  (Crouch v. Trinity Christian Center of Santa Ana, Inc. (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 995, 1007.)  “Conduct, to be ‘ “outrageous,” ’ must be so
extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in civilized
society.”  (Trerice v. Blue Cross
California (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 878, 883.)  “Liability for
intentional infliction of emotional distress ‘ “does not extend to mere
insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other
trivialities.” ’ ”  (Hughes v. Pair (2009)
46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.)  “In order to avoid a demurrer, the plaintiff must
allege with ‘great[ ] specificity’ the acts which he or she believes are so
extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.”  (Vasquez v. Franklin Management Real Estate Fund,
Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832.) 
 
Upon reviewing the Complaint, Plaintiff has insufficiently
alleged facts supporting a claim for IIED. Notably, terminating Plaintiff’s
employment by itself is not outrageous conduct. (Trerice supra, 209 Cal.App.3d at p. 883.) Plaintiff has no factual
allegations supporting this claim.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Ninth
Cause of Action.
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend should be liberally granted if there is a
reasonable possibility an amendment could cure the defect. (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1035.) The burden is on Plaintiff to establish that
the defect is reasonably capable of cure with leave to amend. (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723,
742.) Here, Plaintiff can reasonably amend the Complaint to address the
deficiencies.[2]
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Demurrer
by Defendant Ridley to the entire Complaint is SUSTAINED;
2.      Demurrer
by Defendant IFPRPC is SUSTAINED as to the First, Second, Third, Eighth, and
Ninth Causes of Action and OVERRULED as to the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Causes of Action;
3.      Plaintiff
is GRANTED 20 days’ leave to amend from notice of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
