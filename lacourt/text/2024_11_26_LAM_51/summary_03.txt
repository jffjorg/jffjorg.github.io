And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer was filed in response to the Second Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, and the motion to strike was filed to strike certain language from the complaint.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the defendants Houman Sarshar and Globe Theater Entertainment, Inc. in their entirety, meaning that the complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action against these defendants. The judge has also granted the motion to strike in full, meaning that the language in the complaint that is being struck must be removed.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the defendant 740 South Broadway LLC in its entirety, meaning that the complaint does sufficiently state a cause of action against this defendant.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff had requested leave to amend the complaint to add new claims and parties, but the judge has denied this request.

The judge has ordered that the moving party give notice of the ruling.
