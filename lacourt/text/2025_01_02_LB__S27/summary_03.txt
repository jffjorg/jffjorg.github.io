And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Business Alliance Insurance Company v. Virginia Trinh. The case involves a dispute over liability for damages caused by a fire on a property owned by Virginia Trinh, where a business operated by Yao Yuan Huang was located. The business was insured by Business Alliance Insurance Company, which paid damages to Yao Yuan Huang.

Virginia Trinh moves for summary judgment, arguing that she is an additional named insured on the insurance policy and therefore cannot be sued for subrogation. Business Alliance Insurance Company opposes the motion, arguing that Virginia Trinh is not an additional named insured and is liable for subrogation.

The judge finds that the facts of this case are substantially similar to the facts of Gemini Ins. Co. v. Delos Ins. Co. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 719, and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment. The judge also denies the request for sanctions made by Virginia Trinh.

The case will proceed to a hearing on January 2, 2025, where the parties will have an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.
