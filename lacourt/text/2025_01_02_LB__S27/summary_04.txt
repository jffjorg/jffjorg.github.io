And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between King Fio Trucking, LLC (the plaintiff) and International Almond Exchange (the defendant). The parties agreed to settle the action in April 2024 and submitted a stipulation to the court, which included a payment schedule and a provision for the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. However, the defendant has failed to make the fourth payment and the third payment was not in the full amount due. The judge has granted the motion to enforce the settlement and has ordered the plaintiff to lodge a proposed judgment for processing. The judge has also granted the request for attorneys' fees. The parties are required to submit on the tentative ruling by email to the court, and any party that does not submit on the tentative must make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on January 2, 2025.
