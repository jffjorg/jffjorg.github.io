  Case Number:  20STCV19755    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Ikrusher, Inc.’s Motion for
Order to Enter Stipulated Judgment
Plaintiff
Ikrusher, Inc. moves under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enter
stipulated judgment against defendant Blacklist Holdings, Inc. dba Ionic
Brands.  “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court... for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (CCP § 664.6(a).)    
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 664.6
Plaintiff
meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  The parties stipulated in writing to settle
this action.  They signed a settlement
agreement in February 2023.  (Liberzon
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1.)  The agreement
required defendant to pay plaintiff $105,000 “[w]ithin 180 days of December 1,
2022.”  (Id., § 1(a).)  The agreement further provides: “In the event
that Defendant fails to timely pay, Defendant agrees to a judgment entered by
the Court against Defendant in the amount of $217,696.00 plus recoverable costs
and fees.”  (Id., § 1(d).)  The parties also entered a stipulation for
entry of judgment with the same substantive provisions as the settlement
agreement.  (Id., Ex. 2.)  Defendant has not paid the $105,000
settlement amount.  (Id., ¶
6.)  
Void
Penalty Clause
Though
plaintiff is entitled to stipulated judgment, entering judgment of $217,696 would
constitute enforcing a void penalty clause. 
A provision for liquidated damages upon default in a settlement
agreement is void as an unenforceable penalty when it is disproportionate to
the anticipated damages caused by the default. 
(Vitatech International, Inc. v. Sporn (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th
796, 805 (Vitatech); Sybron Corp.
v. Clark Hosp. Supply Corp. (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 896, 898-899.)
In
Vitatech, the plaintiff prayed for $166,372.14 in damages.  The parties settled via a stipulation
providing that judgment shall be entered for the full amount prayed for in the
complaint, but plaintiff would accept $75,000 as full settlement if paid by a
certain date.  (Vitatech, supra,
16 Cal.App.5th at p. 802.)  Defendants
did not pay in time, and the trial court entered judgment for plaintiff for
over $300,000 based on the complaint’s prayer, prejudgment interest, and fees
and costs.  (Ibid.)  The Court of Appeal
held that, though the parties did not “use the phrase liquidated damages, [the]
legal effect is the same as a liquidated damages provision.”  (Id. at p. 810.)  “[T]he stipulated judgment was void as a
matter of law because no reasonable relationship exists between the damages
that could have been anticipated based on their failure to pay the $75,000
settlement amount and the stipulated judgment for more than $300,000.”  (Id.
at p. 808.) 
Here,
the parties’ settlement agreement and stipulation for entry of judgment have an
equivalent clause escalating the amount of the judgment based on defendant’s
delay in payment.  This provision is void
as an unenforceable penalty.  Plaintiff
offers no evidence that defendant’s failure to timely pay $105,000 caused
plaintiff another $112,696 in damages. 
Plaintiff similarly offers no evidence or explanation of why, when the
parties entered the settlement agreement, it was reasonable to anticipate that
failing to timely pay plaintiff would result in causing over $100,000 in damages.  To the contrary, plaintiff’s complaint
alleged that defendant owed it $217,696 (Comp., ¶¶ 10, 12, 20) and prayed for
$217,696 in damages (Comp., prayer ¶ 1). 
The circumstances thus indicate this escalation provision intended to change
plaintiff’s compromise of its damages rather than estimate the amount of
damages plaintiff would suffer from defendant’s failure to pay the compromised
amount.
The
settlement agreement anticipated this problem. 
It provides: The parties agree that if the Court enters judgment for
this amount that it is not liquidated damages and is an entry of judgment for
the amount Defendant truly owes Plaintiff.  Plaintiff and Defendant further agree that the
amount of damages in this dispute is not speculative or uncertain and that
Plaintiff is entering into this agreement solely because of Defendant’s
documented hardship.”  (Liberzon Decl.,
Ex. 1, § 1(d)(1).)  Similarly, the
stipulation for entry of judgment states that the escalated amount “is not an
illegal penalty but a reasonable calculation of Plaintiff’s damages in this
dispute.”  (Id., Ex. 2, ¶ 9.)  
Whether
an escalation clause constitutes an unenforceable penalty, however, depends on its
“legal effect,” not the contract’s recitals. 
(Vitatech, supra, 16 Cal.App.5th at p. 810.)  It is irrelevant whether $217,696 is “the
amount Defendant truly owes Plaintiff” (Liberzon Decl., Ex. 1, § 1(d)(1)) or “a
reasonable calculation of Plaintiff’s damages in this dispute.”  (Id., Ex. 2, ¶ 9.)  Regardless of how much defendant truly owes
plaintiff or how plaintiff calculated its damages, plaintiff agreed to
compromise and settle this action for $105,000. 
The escalation clause is void unless a “reasonable relationship exists
between the damages that could have been anticipated based on [defendant’s]
failure to pay the [initial] settlement amount” and the escalated amount.  (Vitatech, supra, at p. 808.)  The court finds no such reasonable
relationship exists.  The court will
therefore not enforce the escalation clause and will enter judgment for
$105,000.
Attorney
Fees
Plaintiff
also seeks $787.50 in attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing this motion.  Plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney
fees and costs pursuant to the parties’ settlement agreement.  The agreement provides, “[T]he prevailing
party in any proceeding to enforce or defend this Agreement shall be entitled
to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.”  (Liberzon Decl., Ex. 1, § 2(d).)    Plaintiff prevailed in this proceeding to
enforce the settlement agreement.  The
court finds plaintiff reasonably incurred $787.50 in expenses in bringing this
motion.  (Liberzon Decl., ¶¶ 7-10.) 
Disposition
Plaintiff
Ikrusher, Inc.’s motion for order to enter stipulated judgment is granted in
part.  The court will enter judgment
for plaintiff in the amount of $105,000 against defendant Blacklist Holdings,
Inc. dba Ionic Brands and for $787.50 in expenses.  Plaintiff shall submit a proposed judgment in
accordance with this order forthwith.
