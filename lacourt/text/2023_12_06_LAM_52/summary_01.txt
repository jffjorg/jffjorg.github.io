  - "The stipulated judgment was void as a matter of law because no reasonable relationship exists between the damages that could have been anticipated based on their failure to pay the $75,000 settlement amount and the stipulated judgment for more than $300,000." (Vitatech International, Inc. v. Sporn)
  - "The court finds no such reasonable relationship exists. The court will therefore not enforce the escalation clause and will enter judgment for $105,000."
