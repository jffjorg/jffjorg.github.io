And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a minor's compromise of claims arising from injuries caused by the defendants' alleged failure to maintain the residence in a habitable condition. The minor claimant has fully recovered from her injuries and there are no permanent injuries. The settlement amount is $85,000, with $4,950 distributed to the claimant. The petitioner proposes distributing the remaining amount to the claimant's guardian ad litem, Alicia Brockman-Posey, as permitted by Probate Code § 3401. The judge notes that a minor's settlement is valid if approved by the court after a hearing, and that the petitioner and claimant must appear at the hearing unless good cause is shown to excuse their appearance. Subject to a hearing, the judge is inclined to grant the petition.
