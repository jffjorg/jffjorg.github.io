And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court is considering a demurrer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Jorge Delgado against Defendants FS Precision Tech. Co., LLC, et al. The complaint alleges wrongful termination, disability discrimination, and denial of a workplace environment free from discrimination and/or retaliation. The Defendants argue that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The court holds that the Defendants' demurrer is not sustained and that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action. The court finds that the existence of the Defendants' filings with the Secretary of State does not demonstrate that they did not employ Plaintiff, and that the court cannot take judicial notice of the declaration of Yun Huang, who asserts that there is no relationship between the Defendants and Precision Tech Company, LLC. The court concludes that the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that the Defendants are required to answer the complaint within 10 days.
