And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The Plaintiff, Sharaya Brown, alleges that she was subjected to sexual harassment and discrimination while working as a dispatcher for the Defendant, Forward Air Service, LLC. The Plaintiff also alleges that she was wrongfully terminated and retaliated against for reporting the harassment. The Defendant argues that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, citing the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). However, the Court finds that the sexual harassment claims are exempt from arbitration under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (the Act), which became effective on March 3, 2022. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's claims are adequately alleged and are inherently intertwined with the sexual harassment claim, making it appropriate to deny the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action.
