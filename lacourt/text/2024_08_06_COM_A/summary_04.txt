And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling denying a plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Jane Doe E.W., alleges that she was sexually abused by her teacher, Fred Tah, when she was 17 years old and attending Vista High School. The plaintiff is seeking discovery of an employee roster or similar writings identifying administrators, teachers, coaches, employees, and staff assigned to the school during the relevant time period. The defendant, Lynwood Unified School District, has refused to respond on grounds of privacy, arguing that the request is overbroad and seeks identification of virtually every District employee who worked at the school site during the year of the alleged harassment. The court has determined that the document request is indeed overbroad and that the plaintiff has not shown why every person employed by the District during the relevant time period should be identified, regardless of whether they have relevant knowledge. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses.
