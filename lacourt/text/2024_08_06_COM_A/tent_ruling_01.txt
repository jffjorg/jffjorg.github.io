21CMCV00314 Alicia Brockman-Posey, et al. v. Autumn
 Wind, LLC et al.
Tuesday, August 6, 2024
[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING
 PETITION FOR APPROVAL OF MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF CLAIMS 
 
       This
action arises from injuries caused by Defendants’ alleged failure to maintain
Plaintiffs’ residence in a habitable condition causing the minor Claimant to
suffer from respiratory illness and skin irritation. Petitioner represents that
the Claimant has fully recovered from her injuries, and there are no permanent
injuries. The matter settled globally for $85,000, with $4,950 distributed to
the Claimant. Counsel does not request reimbursement for costs and fees. Medical
expenses have not been incurred. Petitioner proposes that the settlement be
distributed to the Claimant’s guardian ad litem, Alicia Brockman-Posey, as permitted
by Probate Code § 3401, since the settlement amount is
less than $5,000.
       A
minor’s settlement is valid if approved by the court after a hearing.  (Prob. Code, §§3505, 3500.) Petitioner and Claimant must appear at the hearing, unless the
Court finds good cause to excuse their appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, 7.952.) Subject to
a hearing, the Court is inclined to grant the petition.
