And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case 24CMCV00550, Amber Hendree v. Santander Consumer USA dba Chrysler Capital & Lithia Motors, Inc. etc. The case arises from the plaintiff's purchase of a vehicle and the defendant's alleged violations of the financing terms and unlawful debt collection practices. The defendant, Costa Mesa-CJD, Inc. dba Orange Coast Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Fiat, filed a demurrer to the complaint, which is now taken off calendar as a result of the filing of a first amended complaint. The plaintiff is seeking to change the venue of the case to the United States District Court for the Central District, citing alleged violations of federal statutes. However, the Judge has denied the motion, stating that a state trial court has no authority to change venue to a federal court and that the procedure for transferring a state court matter to a federal court is by removal, a right afforded to defendants.
