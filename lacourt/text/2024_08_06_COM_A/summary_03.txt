And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel the deposition of Damion Timmons, an employee of the City of Compton, and the City's person most qualified, who is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the utility box at issue. The plaintiff had previously served notice for these depositions, but the City failed to appear and did not produce the witnesses as requested. The court finds that the City's failure to comply with the deposition notices is unjustified and that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the depositions. The court has also imposed sanctions of $1,320 on the City and its counsel, payable to the plaintiff.
