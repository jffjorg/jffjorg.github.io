Leaver (“Defendant”) for hospital/medical  expenses and general damage resulting from a motor vehicle accident that occurred  on December 24, 2022. Anahit Yeghiazaryan was appointed Claimants Emily and  Robert Avagyan’s guardian ad litem on February 7, 2024.    On February 23, 2024, Petitioner  filed notice that the parties had reached a conditional settlement agreement.    On February 29, 2024, Petitioner filed  the Petitions to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim as to Minor Claimants: Emily  Avagyan (Age 6) and Robert Avagyan (Age 5).    No opposition has been filed.   MOVING PARTY  POSITION   Claimants Emily and Robert, who are  6 and 5 years old, respectively, have agreed to settle their claims against the  Defendant for $25,000.00 each. As a result of the December 24, 2022 car  accident, both Claimants suffered psychological  impairment, moderate levels of anxiety, personal injury fears, and generalized  anxiety. Claimants received psychological  examinations and sessions.    Out of Claimant Emily’s settlement  proceeds of $25,000.00, medical expenses of $4,295.00, cost expenses of $10.89,  and attorney’s fees of $6,250.00 will be deducted, leaving Claimant Emily with  $14,444.11. The $14,444.11 will be deposited into an insured account.   Out of Claimant Robert’s settlement  proceeds of $25,000.00, medical expenses of $3,795.00, cost expenses of $10.89,  and attorney’s fees of $6,250.00 will be deducted, leaving Claimant Robert with  $14,944.11. The $14,944.11 will be deposited into an insured account.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  Court approval is required for  all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;  CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the  ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the  settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson  v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like  Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by  guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is  pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).)  Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or  she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code §  3500.     Regarding the substance of the  Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the  petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of  the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the  reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage  Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  (Italics added.)    Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed, the  Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the hearing.      II.        Discussion    Minors – Emily  Avagyan (Age 6) and Robert Avagyan (Age 5)  Guardian Ad Litem – Anahit  Yeghiazaryan Defendant – Jesse  T.J.
