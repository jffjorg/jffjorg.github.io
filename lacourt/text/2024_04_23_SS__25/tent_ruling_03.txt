BACKGROUND
 
On August 25, 2022, Plaintiff Juliana
Viveros (“Plaintiff”/ “Petitioner”) and minor Plaintiff Roberto Rivas (“Minor Claimant”
or “Claimant”) filed a motor vehicle action against Defendant Jennifer
Stephanie Huezo Quintanilla (“Defendant”) for property damage and personal
injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on October 14,
2021. Plaintiff was appointed as Claimant’s guardian ad litem on September 21,
2022. 
 
Defendant filed her Answer to the
Complaint on November 18, 2022. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Petitioner
filed notice that the parties had reached an unconditional settlement agreement
on November 22, 2023. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Petitioner filed
the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim as to Minor Claimant:
Roberto Rivas (Age 16). At the March 19, 2024 Hearing, the Court noted several
deficiencies with the Petition that needed to be remedied.
 
On March 27, 2024, Petitioner filed
the amended Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim as to Minor
Claimant: Roberto Rivas (Age 16) (“Petition”). 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Claimant, who is 16 years old, has
agreed to settle his claim against the Defendant for $7,500.00. As a result of a
car accident that happened on October 14, 2021, Claimant suffered sprains to his neck and lower back. Claimant received physio-chiropractic treatment and now
asserts he has fully recovered from his injuries. Out of the settlement
proceeds of $7,500.00, medical expenses of $2,500.00, and attorney’s fees of $2,475.00
will be deducted, leaving Claimant with $2,525.00. The $2,525.00 will be delivered
to Juliana Viveros, the parent of the minor,
without bond, on the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code
sections 3401-3402.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;
CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the
ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the
settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like
Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by
a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is
pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).)
Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or
she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code §
3500.  
 
Regarding the substance of the
Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the
petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of
the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage
Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)
(Italics added.) 
 
Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed, the
Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the hearing. 
   
II.        Discussion   
As an initial matter, the Court notes that Petitioner served a copy
of the Petition, Order and prior Petition filed on January 23, 2024, on
Respondent via email on April 16, 2024, less than 16 court days prior to the
hearing.  Pursuant to CRC 3.1300(b) and
CCP Section 1005(b), the Court on its own motion hereby shortens the applicable
notice period and deems Petitioner’s service of the Petition to be timely.

Handling of Funds 
 
How are settlement funds to be disposed of?  “$2,525.00
to be paid or delivered to a parent of the minor, without bond, on the
terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402.
The name and address of the parent and the money or other property to be
delivered are specified in Attachment 18b(5).” (Pet.
p. 8, 18(b)(5).)  Petitioner submits Attachment 18(b)(5), which identifies
that the funds should be deposited to Juliana Viveros, who’s address is 13032

The Court notes that the proposed order
submitted by Petitioner in its supplemental papers erroneously lists $2575.00
as the total amount of attorney’s fees in line 8(a)(1), rather than $2475.00.
However, given that the total amount of fees in line 8(a)(5) properly reflects
$4975.00 and the balance payable to claimant in line 8(b) properly reflects
$2525.00, the Court will correct the amount of attorney fees mistakenly
identified in the proposed order.  
 
The Court finds that the deficiencies identified
in its March 19, 2024, Order have been resolved.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Petition for Minor’s
Compromise submitted on behalf of Minor Claimant Roberto Rivas.
 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Petitioner/ Guardian ad
Litem, Juliana Viveros’s Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise Disputed Claim on
