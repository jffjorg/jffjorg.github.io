RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed
 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition papers were filed. Any opposition papers were required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1005(b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from the alleged breach of a lease for farm equipment. On March
18, 2022, Plaintiff Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Goodland Global Farm, Inc. (“Goodland”),
Utomo Tani (“Tani”), Yongsook Kim  (“Kim”) (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES
1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Leases; (2)
Breach of the Tani Guaranty; (3) Breach of the Kim Guaranty; (4) Claim and
Delivery; and (5) Conversion. On May 23, 2022, Defendants filed a joint Answer
to the Complaint. 
            
            On
June 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the Answer, to which Defendants
filed an opposition and Plaintiff replied. 
 
            On
July 18, 2022, after hearing, the Court sustained Plaintiff’s demurrer to
Defendants’ Answer with leave to amend. (07/18/22 Minute Order.) The Court
ordered an Amended Answer to be filed by August 19, 2022. (07/18/22 Minute
Order.) Defendants, however, did not file an Amended Answer. 
 
            On
August 9, 2022, after hearing, the Court granted the motion to be relieved as
counsel filed by Paul A. Hoffman as to Defendant Goodland. (08/09/22 Minute
Order.) 
 
            On
February 17, 2023, after hearing, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to strike
the Answer of Defendant Goodland. (02/17/23 Minute Order.) There were no
appearances by Defendants at the hearing. (02/17/23 Minute Order.) 
 
            On
March 6, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the Court granted the motions to
compel filed by Plaintiff. (03/06/23 Minute Order.) There were no appearances
by Defendants at the hearing. (03/06/23 Minute Order.) 
 
            On
January 23, 2024, non-jury trial commenced in this action. (01/23/24 Minute
Order.) There were no appearances by Defendants. (01/23/24 Minute Order.)  
 
On February 27, 2024, after non-jury
trial, Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff on each cause of action in
the Complaint. The Court entered a money judgment in the amount of
$4,785,847.07 against Defendants, jointly and severally, in favor of Plaintiff.
The Judgment provides that Plaintiff “is deemed the prevailing party and shall
also recover contractual attorneys’ fees in an amount to be determined pursuant
to a post-judgment motion, plus statutory costs to be determined pursuant to a
memorandum of costs.” (Judgment at p. 4: 25-28.) Defendants did not appear at
trial. 
 
            On April
25, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
(the “Motion”). Plaintiff seeks an order setting the attorneys’ fees award in favor
of Plaintiff and against Defendants in the sum of $201,021.57 or in such other
amount as the Court deems just and proper. The Motion is made on the grounds
that: (1) on February 27, 2024, the Court entered judgment against Defendants
and in favor of Plaintiff; and (2) Plaintiff, as the prevailing party, is
entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees pursuant to the parties’ contracts. The
Motion was initially set for hearing on May 22, 2024. 
 
            On
April 29, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the
Motion from May 22, 2024 to May 24, 2024. The Court ordered Plaintiff to give
notice of the continued hearing date to all parties and to file proof of
service of such notice in this department. (04/29/24 Notice Re: Continuance of
Hearing and Order.) Plaintiff did not file a proof of service showing effectuation
of notice of the continued hearing date on all Defendants; however, the Court’s
April 29, 2024 Notice of Continuance of Hearing and Order was mailed by the
Clerk’s Office to Defendants Tani and Kim. (04/29/24 Certificate of Mailing.) There
is no indication that Defendant Goodland was given notice of the continued
hearing date.   
 
DISCUSSION

             In general, a prevailing party may recover
attorney’s fees only when a statute or agreement of the parties provides for
fee shifting. (Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc. (2012) 53 Cal.4th
1244, 1248.) It is well established that the determination of what constitutes
reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court,
whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) “The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work. (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)  
 
A computation of time spent on a case
and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award. (Margolin v. Regional Planning Com.,
supra, 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to
fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) Such an approach anchors the trial
court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s
services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at p.
48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award. (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to
prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable. (Gorman v. Tassajara
Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 98.) An award of attorney fees
may be based on counsel’s declarations, without production of detailed time
records. (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363,
1365.) 
 
Issue No.1: Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees 
             Unless authorized by either statute or
agreement, attorney’s fees ordinarily are not recoverable as costs. (Reynolds
Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 127.) California Civil Code,
Section 1717(a) provides the following: in any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs. (Civ. Code § 1717(a).) Civ. Code § 1717 was enacted to
establish mutuality of remedy where a contractual provision makes recovery of
attorney’s fees available for only one party. (Reynolds Metals Co. v.
Alperson, supra, 25 Cal.3d 124, 128.) 
 
            Here,
the Court’s Statement of Decision states that Plaintiff is the prevailing party
and is entitled to its contractual attorneys’ fees. (Alper Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 2.)
Given that the Motion is unopposed, Defendants have conceded to all of Plaintiff’s
arguments raised in the Motion. (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003)
111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party and is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees. The Court will
now assess the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s claimed attorneys’ fees. 
 
Issue No.2: Reasonableness of the Requested Attorneys’
Fees
            In
support of the Motion, Andrew K. Alper (“Alper”) presents a declaration which
states the following: he is the Vice President and Shareholder of Frandzel
Robins Bloom & Csato, LLC (“FRBC”). (Alper Decl., ¶ 1.) Alper presents
billing records showing work done by FRBC’s attorneys and paralegals on this
matter in the amount of $59,354.50 from January 4, 2022, through January 30,
2024. (Alper Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. 3.) Alper sets forth the hourly rates of
attorneys and staff at FRBC who performed work on this matter and sets forth
the experience and qualifications of the individuals who worked on this matter.
(Alper Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) Alper indicates that the rates charged are reasonable
and that all time spent, work performed, and hourly fees charged were
reasonable and necessary. (Alper Decl., ¶ 11.) FRBC has billed attorneys’ fees
totaling $59,354.50 in this matter. (Alper Decl., ¶ 12.) Plaintiff requests an
award of attorneys’ fees in its favor and against Defendants in the amount of
$201,021.57. (Alper Decl., ¶ 13.) 
 
            In
support of the Motion, Benjamin J. Court (“Court”) provides a declaration. Mr.
Court is a partner at Stinson LLP (“Stinson”) and indicates that he has been
admitted pro hac vice to practice before this Court in the State of
California. (Court Decl., ¶ 1.) Mr. Court presents copies of Stinson’s invoices
covering work performed by attorneys and paralegals in this matter from August
2021 through February 2024, totaling $141,667.07, discounted by 13.5 percent
from $163,777.00. (Court Decl., ¶ 6; Exh. 4.) Counsel sets forth the hourly
rates of attorneys and paralegals at Stinson who performed work on this matter
and sets forth the experience and qualifications of some of the individuals who
worked on this matter. (Court Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.) Mr. Court declares that the rates
charged are reasonable and that all time spent, work performed, and hourly fees
charged were reasonable and necessary. (Court Decl., ¶ 11.) Stinson has billed
attorneys’ fees totaling $141,667.07 in this matter. (Court Decl., ¶ 12.) Mr.
Court sets forth some of the tasks done in this case such as researching
potential claims and planning and preparing for depositions. (Court Decl., ¶
12.) The legal tasks for this matter were allocated between Stinson and FRBC.
(Court Decl., ¶ 14.) Stinson undertook the primary laboring on discovery,
motions, and trial. (Court Decl., ¶ 14.) Plaintiff requests an award of
attorneys’ fees in its favor and against Defendants in the amount of
$201,021.57. (Court Decl., ¶ 15.) 
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff has substantiated the reasonableness of its
requested attorneys’ fees. Given that the Motion is unopposed, Defendants have
conceded to the argument that the claimed attorneys’ fees are reasonable. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th 1210,
1215.) 
 
            As
stated above, however, Defendant Goodland was not given notice of the continued
hearing date on the Motion. The Court GRANTS the Motion and awards Plaintiff
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $201,021.57 CONDITIONED ON Plaintiff providing
the Court with a proof of service—either at or before the hearing—showing that
Defendant Goodland was given timely notice of the continued hearing date. 
            
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at

not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
