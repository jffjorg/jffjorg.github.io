And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel Aquilina Oloresisimo's deposition and request for sanctions by Metlife Home and Auto. The motion is unopposed, but the judge cannot grant the motion because the case was previously dismissed without prejudice and Petitioner has not yet moved to set aside the dismissal. The judge notes that the court has not yet made a determination on the petition to reassign the court case number or reopen the case number. The judge is denying the motion without prejudice.
