RESPONDING PARTY:
Unopposed

BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from the alleged breach of a written agreement to develop real
estate. On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff KBS Holdco, LLC doing business as Regency
Outdoor Advertising (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants S3D
Partners, LLC, Jayesh Kumar, Vimal Patel, Govind Kumaar, Madhuben Kumar, Ketan Kumar
(collectively “Defendants”), as well as Doe Defendants 1 through 25, inclusive,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Promissory Fraud; (2) Fraud in the
Inducement; (3) Intentional Misrepresentation; (4) Negligent Misrepresentation;
(5) Fraudulent Concealment; (6) Breach of Written Contract; (7) Breach of the
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (8) Indemnification; and (9)
Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. 
 
            On September
1, 2023, default was entered against Defendants Ketan Kumar, S3D Partners, LLC,
and Madhuben Kumar. 
 
            On
December 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Application for Publication as to
Defendants Jayesh Kumar, Govind Kumaar, and Vimal Patel, in order to serve such
defendants via publication. 
 
            On
March 25, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Extend
Time to Seek Default Judgment. (03/25/24 Minute Order.) The Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to extend time to seek default judgment as the Court found “that
good cause exist[ed] for an extension of time for Plaintiff to seek default
judgment against all six defendants in this case.” (03/25/24 Minute Order at p.
3.) The Court set an OSC re filing of a request for default judgment against defendants
for October 18, 2024. (03/25/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) 
 
            On
April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant unopposed Motion for
Leave to file First Amended Complaint (the “Motion”).   
 
            California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b) requires that a motion to amend a
pleading before trial must include a separate declaration specifying: (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. 
 
            Here,
the declaration of Jesse Steinbach (“Steinbach”) filed in support of the Motion
does not state the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and
why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The declaration of
Steinbach does not meet the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. 
 
            Due
to the Motion not being compliant with Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, the
Court DENIES the Motion WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
             
Moving Party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.

day of May 2024
