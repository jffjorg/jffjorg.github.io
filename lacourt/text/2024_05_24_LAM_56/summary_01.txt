Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendants, who argue that the Plaintiff is not the real party in interest with respect to the claims it purports to assert, nor has the Plaintiff alleged having received any assignment from the real party in interest. The Court finds that the Defendants have satisfied their initial burden of showing that the breach of promissory note cause of action has no merit. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact regarding the intent of the parties to the promissory note and whether the note should be reformed to reflect the proper party. The Court denies the motion for summary judgment in full.
