RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed

have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1005(b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            On April
13, 2022, Petitioner Metlife Home and Auto (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition for Assignment
of Miscellaneous Court Number in Uninsured Motorist Arbitration Matter (the
“Petition”) against Respondent Aquilina Oloresisimo (“Respondent”). The
Petition indicates that this is an uninsured motorist arbitration action and Petitioner
has been unsuccessful in obtaining written discovery responses from Respondent.
Petitioner requested “the issuance of a miscellaneous court number, so that it
could file . . . motions to compel written discovery responses.” (Petition at
p. 4:15-17.) 
 
            Also,
on April 13, 2022, this action was assigned for all purposes to the Honorable
Holly J. Fujie sitting in Department 56 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
            
            On
May 11, 2022, Petitioner filed and served a Notice of Filing of Petition for
Miscellaneous Case Number and Setting of Status Conference. 
 
            On
July 13, 2022, the Court held a Status Conference and the Court indicated that
“[t]he parties are trying to resolve pending issues.” (07/13/22 Minute Order.)
The Court set a Non-Appearance Case Review re: Dismissal for October 14, 2022.
(07/13/22 Minute Order.) The Court’s minute order provides that “[i]f a
dismissal is not filed, Plaintiff is to file a declaration as to why the case
should not be dismissed. The declaration is to be filed by October 7, 2022. If
the declaration is not filed the case will be dismissed.” (07/13/22 Minute
Order.) 
 
            On
October 14, 2022, the Court held a Non-Appearance Case Review re: Dismissal. The
declaration as to why the case should not be dismissed was not filed by
Petitioner. (10/14/22 Minute Order.) The Court therefore ordered the Petition,
which was filed on April 13, 2022, to be dismissed without prejudice. (10/14/22
Minute Order.) 
 
            On
January 9, 2024, Petitioner filed and served a Petition for Re-Assignment of
Court Case Number/Re-Opening of Case Number in Uninsured Motorist Arbitration
Matter (the “2d Petition”).
 
            On January
29, 2024, Petitioner filed and served the instant unopposed Motion to Compel
Respondent’s Deposition and Request for Sanctions (the “Motion”). Petitioner
seeks an order compelling Respondent to attend, to produce documents, and to
testify at deposition. Petitioner also seeks monetary sanctions against
Respondent and her counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$1,500.00. 
 
            As of
May 22, 2024, the Motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Due to the lack of opposition,
an inference is created that the Motion is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
            
            Although
the Motion is unopposed, the Court cannot grant the Motion. The Court has not
yet made any determination as to whether to reassign the court case number or
reopen the case number as is requested in the 2d Petition. The Court dismissed
this action on October 14, 2022 due to the failure of Petitioner to file a
declaration as to why this case should not be dismissed. 
 
            Petitioner
may move to set aside or vacate the Court’s October 14, 2022 order of
dismissal. (Peltier v. McCloud River R.R. Co. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th
1809, 1825.) Until Petitioner moves to set aside the dismissal, or the Court otherwise
deems the 2d Petition as the operative petition in this action, the Court
cannot rule on any discovery motions. 
 
            The
Motion is therefore DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
        
    Dated this 24th day of May 2024
