BACKGROUND 
 
This premises liability case was
initiated on November 15, 2021, but the proof of service was not filed until
February 23, 2023. On March 24, 2023, the Defendant served special
interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories – general set one, and request
for production set one to Plaintiff. The deadline to respond was April 25, 2023.
On June 5, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel requested an extension to provide the
discovery responses by July 6, 2023. However, as of January 10, 2024, the date
when the current motions were submitted, Plaintiff has failed to respond to any
of the discovery requests. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
A party
must respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within
30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for
a motion to compel initial responses to interrogatories or production of
documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before
trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to
compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)    
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court
may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿ 
  
Here, Defendant served the three
discovery requests at issue on March 24, 2023. (Exhibit A to Declaration of
Cathy M. Diehl for MTC Special Interrogatories, Exhibit A to Declaration of
Cathy M. Diehl for MTC Request for Productions, Exhibit A to Declaration of
Cathy M. Diehl for MTC Form Interrogatories (Collectively as “Diehl Decls.”).) The responses for the discovery requests were due on April 25,
2023. Plaintiff's attorney requested an extension on June 5, 2023, to submit
discovery responses by July 6, 2023. (Exhibit C to Diehl Decls.) However, no
responses were provided as of January 10, 2024, the date on which the motions
were filed. (Diehl Decls. ¶ 7.) Accordingly, Defendant’s Motions to compel are
GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff's failure to respond
necessitated the filing of the current three motions to compel, with the
Defendant seeking monetary sanctions of $1,170 for each motion. This
calculation is based on 2 hours to draft each motion, 2 hours to review any
opposition and draft a reply, 2 hours preparing for and appearing at the
hearing, at a rate of $185 per hour, and a filing fee of $60. (Diehl Decls. ¶ 8.)
The court finds that allocating 2
hours for preparing each motion is reasonable. However, since no opposition was
filed, no time is deemed necessary for reviewing oppositions or preparing reply
briefs. Since the hearing for all motions will be conducted simultaneously, the
court considers 1 hour to attend the hearing as reasonable. Therefore, the
total sanctions for the three motions amount to 7 hours at the rate of $185 per
hour plus $180 in filing fees, for a total amount of $1,475. Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motions for sanctions are GRANTED in the amount of $1,475.00.
Conclusion
Defendant’s motions to compel are granted.  Plaintiff is to provide responses, without
objection, within 20 days of this order. 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is granted against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1475, to be paid
within 20 days of this order.
The moving party is ordered to give notice.
