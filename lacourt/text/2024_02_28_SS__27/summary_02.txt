And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests, including special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to these requests despite a deadline and despite an extension granted by the plaintiff's counsel. The judge has also granted the defendant's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,475, which is based on the reasonable expenses incurred by the defendant in preparing and filing the motions. The plaintiff is ordered to provide responses without objection within 20 days of the order, and the defendant's counsel is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the order.
