And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer to the Third Amended Cross-Complaint and has sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend as to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, overruled as to the second, sixth, eighth, and ninth causes of action, and sustained without leave to amend as to the fifth, seventh, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth causes of action.

The Court has analyzed each cause of action and has found that some of the claims are insufficient or duplicate existing claims. For example, the claim for intentional misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment is insufficient because it lacks specific facts about the alleged misrepresentations and concealments. The claim for violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act is insufficient because it lacks facts linking the alleged conduct to the plaintiff's disability. The claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is insufficient because it lacks evidence of extreme and outrageous conduct.

The Court has also noted that the pleading is excessively lengthy and lacks clarity, making it difficult to determine the nature of the claims and the relief sought. The Court has advised the parties to consider amending their pleadings to cure the deficiencies and to provide more specific facts to support their claims.

The parties are hereby notified of the tentative ruling and are given 30 days to file any objections or responses.
