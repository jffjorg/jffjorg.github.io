LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
(Evid. Code § 452(d).)   
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
(Evid. Code §452(c), (d).)   
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants
demur on the grounds that the entire first amended complaint (FAC) is
time-barred.  Unless a
complaint affirmatively discloses on its face that the statute of limitations
has run, a demurrer must be overruled. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881.) “Generally,
a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitation begins to run when a
suit may be maintained. Ordinarily this is when the wrongful act is done and
the obligation or the liability arises . . .. In other words, a cause of action
accrues upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of
action. [Citation.]” (Cobb v. City of Stockton (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 65, 72-73, alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.) 
 
Defendants rely
on Code of Civil Procedure section 366.3, which provides for a one-year limitation
period as follows: 
 
(a) If a person has a claim that arises from a promise or agreement
with a decedent to distribution from an estate or trust or under another
instrument, whether the promise or agreement was made orally or in writing, an
action to enforce the claim to distribution may be commenced within one year
after the date of death, and the limitations period that would have been
applicable does not apply.
 
(b) The limitations period provided in this section for
commencement of an action shall not be tolled or extended for any reason except
as provided in [the Probate Code].”
 
(CCP § 366.3.) The statute thus applies to actions
seeking to enforce a promise of distribution from an
estate or other testamentary instruments. (See Smith v. Myers (2024)
103 Cal.App.5th 586 [amendment to trust did not constitute promise or agreement
to distribute property within meaning of the statute where claimants did not allege
that settlor promised to create testamentary documents that would
provide them a distribution or that they would gain full title to a ranch when
he died, but instead alleged a valid amendment to the trust instrument itself
which required the distribution].)
This action arises from Decedent Byron Scott Minerd’s promise that
he would transfer real property to Plaintiff via his will. Plaintiff alleges she
owns real property located at 3009 Ocean Avenue, Venice, CA (“Property”)
pursuant to an oral agreement entered into with Decedent in 2011 wherein he
agreed to leave the Property to Plaintiff upon his death so long as she lived
at the property and provided care for Mr. Minerd’s pets. (FAC, ¶¶ 6-7, 16-17.) The
FAC alleges that as long as Plaintiff abided by these terms for the rest of Decedent’s
life, Plaintiff would receive the title to the Property outright and free and
clear of any debt. (¶¶ 16, 18, 24.) In addition, “Plaintiff claims a right to
the Real Property based on an oral agreement to make a will and convey
unencumbered title to the Real Property to Plaintiff in the Decedent’s will in
consideration of Plaintiff’s completed performance under the terms of the oral agreement.”
(¶ 34.) Decedent passed away on December 21, 2022. (¶¶ 3, 11, 19.) In his will,
Minerd did not leave Plaintiff with the property. (¶ 22.) Fedoris was named in
the will to serve as the executor of Mr. Minerd’s estate. (¶¶ 3, 20.) From
these facts, Plaintiff seeks the following relief: 1) quiet title to the
Property in her favor (¶ 26); 2) enjoin Defendant from interfering with her
property rights (¶28); 3) impose a constructive trust on the property for her
benefit (¶ 43); 4) compel specific performance of the oral contract by
transferring the interest in the LLC or property to Plaintiff (¶ 49); and 5)
quantum meruit for the reasonable value of her services and lost earning
capacity (¶ 53).
CCP section 366.3 applies to the first four causes of action.
Facially, these claims seek to enforce a promise by Decedent for a distribution
from his estate or other testamentary instrument. Decedent allegedly promised
that Plaintiff would receive the Property pursuant to Decedent’s will. (FAC ¶¶
16-17.) The fact that an LLC currently holds title would
not affect the nature of the instant claims as “arising from” the pled promise
to make a distribution. Plaintiff further pleads no facts to establishing
equitable estoppel, as there are no facts showing how Defendants induced Plaintiff
to forbear from filing suit, a required element of equitable estoppel. (McMackin
v. Ehrheart (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 128.) Plaintiff’s proffered explanation,
the concealment of the Nevada probate, does not show how Plaintiff was
precluded from filing the instant lawsuit within a year after Decedent’s death.
Plaintiff fails to submit any authority that Nevada Probate law would apply in
this California civil action. Moreover, each of Plaintiff’s arguments ignores
the express language of the statute forbidding tolling or the application of
other statute of limitations. Thus, the statute of limitations described in
section 366.3 bars the first four causes of action. 
Section 366.3, however, does not bar the fifth cause of action
because it is incidental to any pled promise of a testamentary transfer. Quantum
meruit is a quasi-contract, implied in law, designed to restore the aggrieved
party to their former position. (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 379, 388, fn. 6.) “Quantum meruit refers to the well-established
principle that ‘the law implies a promise to pay for services performed under
circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously rendered.’” (Chodos
v. Borman (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 76, 96.) A party “need not prove
the existence of a contract”, but only that there was some understanding or
expectation by both parties of compensation. (Id.) The elements of quantum
meruit are: 1) performance of services, work or labor; 2) at defendant’s
request; and 3) circumstances inferring defendant’s promise to pay a reasonable
value. (Maglica v. Maglica (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 442, 449-450.) The instant
cause expressly seeks the reasonable value of Plaintiff’s services during
Decedent’s lifetime, without reliance on any promise to make a testamentary
instrument. (FAC ¶ 53.) The cause simply compensates Plaintiff for her labor performed
at Decedent’s direction during his lifetime. As noted, section 366.3 only
applies to claims which seek to enforce a promise or agreement from a
decedent make a testamentary distribution. Plaintiff’s equitable action recovering
the value of her labor is not an action to enforce a promise of
distribution. As such, the section does not bar this cause of action.
Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the first four causes
of action without leave to amend.  As to the
fifth cause of action, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
