And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants in the case of Chiota v. Fedoris, et al. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the entire first amended complaint is time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 366.3.

The judge has concluded that the first four causes of action, which seek to enforce a promise by the decedent to distribute real property to the plaintiff, are barred by the statute of limitations. However, the judge has ruled that the fifth cause of action, which seeks quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the plaintiff's services performed during the decedent's lifetime, is not barred by the statute of limitations.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the first four causes of action without leave to amend, but has overruled the demurrer as to the fifth cause of action. The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any further briefing or oral argument that may be presented.
