Summary:
The Judge is considering a motion to quash two subpoenas issued by Defendant Pepperdine University. The subpoenas seek documents and records from Plaintiff Breanna Webb and third-party deponent California Lutheran University. The Judge has granted the motion to quash the email-transfer subpoena, finding that the sought-after documents are not relevant to the case and that Defendant has failed to establish a legitimate and important countervailing interest in obtaining them. The Judge has denied the motion to quash the academic records subpoena in part, finding that some of the requested records may be relevant to Plaintiff's damages claim. However, the Judge has limited the scope of the subpoena to only academic-related disciplinary records and deleted the "any correspondence and notes" category.
