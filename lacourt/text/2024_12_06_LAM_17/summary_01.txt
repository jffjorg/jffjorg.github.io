And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has denied Cross-Defendants' motion for summary judgment and motion for summary adjudication. The dispute arises from a cross-complaint alleging interference with an easement by the planting of trees, shrubs, and landscaping by Nehoray, a cross-defendant. The easement was created via a grant deed in 1962, and Cross-Complainants purchased their property in 2015. The Judge found that Cross-Defendants' evidence supports a reasonable inference that the complained-of trees, shrubs, and landscaping do not obstruct or prevent Cross-Complainants' use of the easement. However, Cross-Complainants' evidence raises a triable issue as to whether Cross-Defendants' use of the easement constitutes an unreasonable interference. The Judge therefore denied Cross-Defendants' motions and left the matter for further adjudication.
