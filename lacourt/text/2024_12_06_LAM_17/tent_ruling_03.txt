  ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES, INC.
  


 Case
  No.:  23STCV03252
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: December 6, 2024



 
 
            Defendants’ demurrer is procedurally
defective, and is therefore OVERRULED, WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
            On 2/14/2023, Lynn Stepanian
(Plaintiff) initiated this action. On 7/15/2024, Plaintiff filed a Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) against 10 different Defendants, alleging: (1) breach
of contract; (2) quantum meruit; (3) breach of good faith and fair dealing; (4)
wrongful termination; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) fraudulent inducement; (7)
fraudulent transfer; (8) wrongful termination; (9) discrimination; (10)
retaliation; (11) violation of Labor Code sections 201 and 203; (12)
declaratory relief; (13) promissory estoppel; (14) intentional infliction of
emotional distress; and (15) violation of Business and Professions Code section
17200. 
 
            On 8/14/2023, Raven Capital
Management, LLC, (Raven Capital Management), Rive Releasing, LLC, (Rive
Releasing), OR Acquisition Co, LLC, (OR Acquisition), Rive TM, LLC, (Rive TM),
Rive CS, LLC, (Rive CS), RCM AWC, LLC, (RCM AWC), RCM Film Services LLC (RCM
Film Services), James Masciello, (Masciello), and Matthew Sidari, (Sidari, and
collectively the Defendants) demurred to the SAC.
 
            California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule
3.1113, subdivision (d) expressly provides (emphasis added) that “Except in a summary judgment
or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15
pages.” Despite this clear mandate, Defendants first filed a demurrer totaling
54 pages. Then, in response, filed an amended demurrer. However,
that filing totaled 26 pages. 
 
            Such a filing is procedurally defective,
and will not be considered. CRC Rule 3.1113, subdivision (e) clearly provides that in order to file
a memorandum exceeding the page-limit, a party must apply to the Court ex
parte at least 24 hours before filing the memorandum to seek permission for
the filing. Such an application must expressly set forth the reasons why the
argument cannot be made within the stated limit.
 
            There is still no indication that
Defendants have taken any steps to comply with this procedural requirement, and
thus cannot be considered. While the Court understands the necessity of
responding to all 15 causes of action, all Defendants are required to do is
follow the clearly laid out rules to file a memorandum which still exceeds the
mandatory limit. Rather than do so, Defendants filed an amended motion which still
exceeds the page limit by 11 pages. Defendants’ repeated and willful failures
to comply with clear Court rules are not well-taken, and will not be
considered. 
 
It is
so ordered.
