And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further discovery responses from the plaintiff, Iris Au. The plaintiff is representing herself after her former counsel was relieved from the case. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Requests for Admission, and Requests for Production. The judge finds that the plaintiff's responses are deficient and grants the defendant's motion. The plaintiff is sanctioned $1,400 for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The judge notes that it was obvious that the plaintiff had abandoned her case, and the plaintiff's lack of response to the discovery requests is a concession to the defendant's motion.
