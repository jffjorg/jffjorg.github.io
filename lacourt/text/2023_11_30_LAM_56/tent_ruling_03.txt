Jury Trial: July 15, 2024
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Jon Markarian (“Markarian”)
 
On
November 1, 2023, Markarian filed a motion to be relieved as counsel (the
“Motion”) for Plaintiffs Willow Creek Homes (“Willow Creek”) and Todd C.
Nolette (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). The Motion is compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motion is unopposed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
In
support of the Motion, Markarian declares that irreconcilable differences have
arisen that prevent the representation from continuing.  The Court finds this to be an adequate basis
for withdrawal.  For this reason and
because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  As a business entity, Willow
Creek must be represented by counsel.  (See
Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  The Court will
hold an OSC regarding Willow Creek’s representation on December 20, 2023 at
8:30 a.m. in this department.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the
instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
         Dated this 30th day of November 2023
