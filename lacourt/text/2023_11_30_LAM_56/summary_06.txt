The Honorable Holly J. Fujie, Judge of the Superior Court, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph L. Parker vs. Regency Outdoor Advertising et al. (Case No. 23STCV04352). The case arises from a landlord-tenant relationship and involves allegations of breach of oral contract and promise, fraud and deceit, senior abuse and harassment, illegal unit as residence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendant, Regency Outdoor Advertising, filed a demurrer, which the court has sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The court has not received opposition papers, and the demurrer is therefore unopposed. The court has ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling and has instructed parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the court. If no email is received and no appearances are made at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
