MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Centaurus
Financial, Inc. (“Defendant”)
 
            The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises
out of alleged mishandling of Plaintiffs’ investment property.  The currently operative second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) California
financial elder abuse; (3) Illinois financial elder abuse; (4) breach of
contract; (5) breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (6) aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (7) negligence; (8) violation of
Business & Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500; (9) common law fraud;
and (10) negligent misrepresentation.  
 
On October 31,
2023, Plaintiffs filed: (1) a motion to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One (the “FROG Motion”); and (2) a motion to compel
further responses to Requests for Production, Set One (the “RFP Motion”).  The Motions also request evidentiary and
monetary sanctions due to Defendant’s failure to comply with its discovery
obligations. 
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
Under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
2030.300, on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party
may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party
deems that any of the following apply: (1) an answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) an exercise of the option to
produce documents under CCP section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) an objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
(CCP § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  As
to interrogatories: (1) if only a part of an interrogatory is objectionable,
the remainder of the interrogatory shall be answered; and (2) if an objection
is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific
ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response, and if an
objection is based on a claim of privilege then the particular privilege
invoked shall be clearly stated.  (CCP §
2030.240, subds. (a)-(b).)  The burden is
on the party responding to discovery to justify his or her objections to such
discovery.  (Coy v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)  
 
 
 
A motion to compel
further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (CCP § 2031.310,
subd. (c).)  A motion to compel further
production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand.  (See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1).)  The good cause requirement is met if the
proponent shows that there exists “a disputed fact that is of consequence in
the action and the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove
that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the
fact.”  (Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216,
224.)
 
Analysis
On July 7, 2023, after holding an
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”), the Court ordered Defendant to provide
complete further responses to the discovery requests at issue in the Motions by
August 7, 2023.  After receiving several
extensions, Defendant provided unverified responses to both the FROGs and RFPs
on September 12, 2023.  (Declaration of
Marc S. Ehrlich (“Ehrlich Decl.”) ¶ 9.)  The
originally filed RFP Motion contends that Defendant failed to produce any documents,
but in a supplemental declaration, Plaintiffs note that Defendant’s
supplemental responses included document production that Plaintiffs mistakenly
overlooked.  (See Supp. Ehrlich
Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
 
 
Defendant’s oppositions (collectively,
the “Oppositions”) provide evidence that Defendant provided verifications to
its written discovery responses on November 13, 2023.  (See Declaration of Joshua Norton
(“Norton Decl.”) ¶ 13.)
 
Plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding
their error regarding Defendant’s document production, Defendant’s supplemental
responses to the RFPs and FROGs remain deficient because they contain improper
objections and incomplete statements of compliance.
 
The unverified supplemental responses
that Defendant provided before Plaintiffs filed the Motions do not constitute
legally sufficient responses because unverified responses are tantamount
to no responses at all.  (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
Defendant’s failure to timely provide verifications
controverted the Court’s July 7, 2023 IDC order.   
 
            With
respect to the RFP Motion, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show good
cause.[1]
 Plaintiffs were not required to show
good cause with respect to the FROG Motion, and Defendant’s FROG Opposition
fails to set forth facts that justify Defendant’s broad objections.  The Court therefore DENIES the RFP Motion and
GRANTS the FROG Motion.  Defendant is
ordered to provide supplemental FROG responses without improper objections and
with proper statements of compliance within 20 days of the date of this order.  Plaintiffs’ request for evidentiary sanctions
is DENIED.
 
Monetary Sanctions
            Plaintiffs
request monetary sanctions in the amount of $6,000 in connection with each
Motion.  (See Supp. Ehrlich Decl.
¶ 8.)  This amount is amended in
light of Plaintiffs’ error about Defendant’s document production represents a
25 percent reduction of the initial request for sanctions in the amount of
$8,000 per Motion, which represented: (1) six hours preparing the moving papers
at a rate of $400 per hour; (2) four hours preparing the moving papers at a
rate of $550 per hour; (3) an anticipated three hours reviewing the opposition
papers and drafting reply papers at a rate of $400 per hour; and (4) an
anticipated four hours reviewing the opposition papers, drafting reply papers,
and attending the hearing at a rate of $550 per hour.  (See Ehrlich Decl. ¶¶ 15-18.)
 
            The
Court declines to impose monetary sanctions in connection with the RFP
Motion.  With respect to the FROG Motion,
the Court exercises its discretion and grants Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in
the reasonable amount of $1,600, which represents four hours preparing the
moving papers at a rate of $400 per hour. 
(Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029,
1034.)  Defendant and counsel are jointly
responsible for paying this amount within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
