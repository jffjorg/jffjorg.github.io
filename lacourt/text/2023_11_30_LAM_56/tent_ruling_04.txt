[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO AMEND

Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition papers were
filed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005,
subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
On
July 13, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s application to enter default
judgment (the “Application”) against Defendant Shangri-la Construction, LP
(“Defendant”).  On November 16, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion to amend the default judgment entered by the Court on
the grounds that the proposed judgment submitted by Plaintiff did not include
the damages that were requested in the Application, and the judgment therefore
does not accurately reflect Plaintiff’s damages. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Under CCP section 473, subdivision
(d), the court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion,
correct clerical mistakes in its judgments or orders as entered, so as to
conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party
after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.  (CCP § 473, subd. (d).)
 
The
Court notes that the Application is valid in all respects except that it does
not set forth a basis for Plaintiff’s recovery of attorney’s fees.  (See Civ. Code § 1717.5, subd. (a).)[1]  The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion to
amend the judgment to be consistent with the damages listed in the CIV-100 form
submitted with the Application, except for the requested attorney’s fees.  
 
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
