[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEMURRER 
 
Date: November 30, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Regency Outdoor Advertising (“Moving Defendant”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges:
(1) breach of oral contract and
promise; (2) fraud and deceit; (3) senior abuse and harassment; (4) illegal
unit as residence; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (6)
breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  
 
 
Moving
Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the grounds that the Complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain. 
 
As it is unopposed, the Court SUSTAINS
the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
