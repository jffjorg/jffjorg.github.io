And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has denied the motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Todd Wakefield and the Barrett Law Firm. The Court found that Wakefield's declaration did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure Section 2015.5 and therefore had no evidentiary value. The Court also sustained many of the objections to the declarations submitted by both sides.

The Court analyzed the evidence presented by both sides and found that there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether Joseph Barrett was a substantial factor in causing the Plaintiff's injuries. The Court also found that the Plaintiff had presented evidence of other wrongs, such as the pressure to sign the settlement agreement and the lack of knowledge of the mediation in the underlying action, that occurred prior to the theft of the settlement proceeds by Phillip Layfield.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff had presented evidence that he would not have signed the settlement agreement but for the pressure from Joseph Barrett urging him to sign. The Court concluded that the Plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether Joseph Barrett was a substantial factor in causing the Plaintiff's injuries.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff had presented evidence of a contract between himself and the law firm, Layfield & Wallace, and that Joseph Barrett was a party to that contract. The Court therefore denied the motion to strike the fifth cause of action for breach of contract.
