 Case Number:  23STCV06158    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 20, 2023, Plaintiff Wawanesa General Insurance
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Janae Wheeler
(“Wheeler”), Kenneth Lyne Parsons (“Parsons”), and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle
tort and subrogation.  The complaint
demanded $100,000.00. 
Also
on March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages listing uninsured
motorist bodily injury payments of $100,000.00. 
On
April 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on Wheeler
and Parsons on April 3, 2023. 
On
August 30, 2024, the Court dismissed Parsons without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request.  The same day, the clerk entered
Wheeler’s default. On September 3, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants
without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
August 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Wheeler and award Plaintiff
$100,519.00, consisting of $100,000.00 as the demand of the complaint and
$519.00 in costs.

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a “Bodily Injury Report Summary”
that lists $21,283.64 in medical expenses (after adjustments) for the period
May 6, 2020 to June 29, 2020.  However,
Plaintiff has not explained the basis for Plaintiff’s total payments of
$100,000.00, which is approximately $79,000.00 more than the documented medical
expenses.  Plaintiff should explain the
basis for this payment and provide supporting evidence. 
Plaintiff
has also submitted the declaration of Latecia Henry, who saw Defendant’s
vehicle strike Ms. Henry’s son while he was crossing the street.  Ms. Henry’s declaration states: “Injuries
were sustained by the occupants of the vehicle . . . .”  If Ms. Henry is referring to Defendant’s
injuries, Plaintiff should explain the relevance of Defendant’s injuries to
Plaintiff’s obligation to pay uninsured motorist benefits to its insured.  If Ms. Henry is referring to her son’s
injuries, the statement is inconsistent with Ms. Henry’s statement that her son
was crossing the street when Defendant's car struck him. 
The
Court denies the application.         
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Wawanesa General Insurance Company’s
application for default judgment against Defendant Janae Wheeler filed on
August 30, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
