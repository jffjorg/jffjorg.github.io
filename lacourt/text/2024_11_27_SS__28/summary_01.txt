And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied a request for default judgment filed by the plaintiff, California Automobile Insurance Company, against defendants Sami Alnabahin, Hadley Tow, and Pacific Truck & Auto Towing, Inc. The request was filed on July 9, 2024, and the plaintiff seeks a default judgment and damages totaling $34,585.99. However, the plaintiff's JUD-100 form, which was also submitted, requests a different amount of damages and costs, totaling $28,646.04. The judge cannot grant the application because it is inconsistent and exceeds the jurisdiction of the court. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling and denies the application without prejudice.
