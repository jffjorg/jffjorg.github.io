oppositions. 
On
September 18, 2024, the Court dismissed the City and the Department without

PARTY’S REQUESTS 
The

production of documents, set one, (2) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
special interrogatories, set one, (3) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and (4) to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission served on Plaintiff. 
The County also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff based on the motions to compel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:         
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).”
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
          C.  Requests for
admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On April 26, 2024, the County served request for
production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, form
interrogatories, set one, and requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses by the time the County filed these motions on September 4,
2024. 
The Court grants the County’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents, set one, and
orders Plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses without objections
and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other
things requested without objections by December 27, 2024. 
The Court grants the County’s motions to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant
responses to the special and form interrogatories without objections by
December 27, 2024. 
The Court grants the County’s motion to deem admitted
matters specified in requests for admission, set one, served on Plaintiff.  The Court deems the matters admitted. 
The County asks the Court to impose monetary sanctions
on Plaintiff based on the County’s motions to compel responses to the request
for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.
 Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and
2031.300, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories or a demand for inspection unless the Court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].) 
Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions
are not available under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other statutes addressing misuse of the discovery
process do not, by themselves, authorize a sanctions award for these
motions.  In City of Los Angeles v.
Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17 Cal.5th 46 (PwC), the Supreme
Court held: “It is already well-established that a court may not rely on [Code
of Civil Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by
any other applicable sanctions provision in the [Civil Discovery] Act. A court
may invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery
abuse, or a pattern of abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions
provision.  And where it invokes that
authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally governing the
imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp.
74-75.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision
(c), and 2031.300, subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose
sanctions when (as here) the non-moving party does not oppose a successful
motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands.  Because these statutes address this issue,
the Court will not invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,  supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp. 74-75.) 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated [a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (b)].”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)  However, the
County has not requested sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280
and has given the Court no information which the Court could use to calculate
an appropriate sanctions amount. 
Therefore, the County has waived its right to seek sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Maria
Palencia’s responses
to request for production of documents, set one.  The Court orders Plaintiff Maria Palencia to serve verified code-compliant responses without
objections to the request for production of documents and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested

responses to the special interrogatories without objections by December 27,
2024.

motion to compel Plaintiff Maria Palencia’s responses to form interrogatories,
set one.  The Court orders Plaintiff
Maria Palencia to serve verified code-compliant responses to the form

The Court GRANTS Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
motion to  deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission, set one, served on Plaintiff Maria
Palencia.  The Court deems the matters
admitted. 
The Court DENIES Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
requests for sanctions on its motions to compel responses to request for
production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form
