And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment against Defendant Janae Wheeler. The plaintiff, Wawanesa General Insurance Company, is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $100,519.00, consisting of $100,000.00 as the demand of the complaint and $519.00 in costs.

The court has denied the application for default judgment without prejudice. The court found that the plaintiff has not explained the basis for the $79,000.00 difference between the total payments of $100,000.00 and the documented medical expenses of $21,283.64. The court also found that the declaration of Latecia Henry is unclear and inconsistent, and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support the award of damages.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
