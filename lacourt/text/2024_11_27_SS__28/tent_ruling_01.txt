  Case Number:  21STCV29702    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 11, 2021, Plaintiff California Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Sami
Alnabahin (“Alnabahin”), Hadley Tow (“Hadley Tow”), Pacific Truck & Auto
Towing, Inc. (“Pacific”), and Does 1-20 for auto negligence—subrogation.
The complaint sought $33,895.79 plus costs and interest. 
On
October 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Pacific and Hadley Tow on
September 15, 2021 and on Alnabahin on September 23, 2021. 
On
January 3, 2022, the clerk entered the defaults of Alnabahin, Hadley Tow, and
Pacific. 
On
January 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed amended proofs of service. 
On
June 14, 2022, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
July 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for entry of default judgment
against Alnabahin, Hadley Tow, and Pacific. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
In its
CIV-100 form, Plaintiff asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Alnabahin,
Hadley Tow, and Pacific and award Plaintiff $34,585.99, consisting of $33,895.79
as the demand of the complaint and $690.20 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form asks the Court to enter a default
judgment and award Plaintiff $34,585.99, consisting of $33,895.79 as the demand
of the complaint and $690.20 in costs. 
Plaintiff’s JUD-100 form, however, asks the Court to enter a default judgment and award
Plaintiff $28,646.04, consisting of $27,955.79 in damages and $690.25 in costs. 
The Court
cannot grant an application for default judgment when the CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms
request different amounts of damages and costs. 
The
Court denies the application.         
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff California Automobile Insurance
Company’s application for default judgment against Defendants Sami Alnabahin,
Hadley Tow, and Pacific Truck & Auto Towing, Inc. filed on July 9, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
