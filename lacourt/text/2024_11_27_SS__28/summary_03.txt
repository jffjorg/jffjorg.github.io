And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Jose Ramon Preciado's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. Preciado argued that the sudden emergency doctrine, which he has asserted as an affirmative defense, provides a complete defense to Plaintiff Francisco Miguel Garcia's claims. However, the judge found that Preciado has not carried his initial burden on summary judgment or summary adjudication because he has not shown that Garcia will be unable to prove that Preciado's negligence caused or contributed to the accident. Garcia has presented evidence that creates a triable issue of fact concerning whether Preciado's negligence caused or contributed to the accident. The judge concluded that the sudden emergency doctrine does not provide a complete defense and that a trial is necessary to determine the facts of the case.
