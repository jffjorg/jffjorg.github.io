And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (AHM) is OVERRULED as to the 2nd cause of action for fraudulent inducement – concealment brought by Byron Enamorado. The judge finds that Enamorado has successfully pleaded a cause of action for fraudulent inducement – concealment, and that the economic loss rule does not bar this claim at the demurrer stage. The judge also denies AHM's Motion to Strike Enamorado's prayer for punitive damages, finding that Enamorado has pleaded sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against AHM, a corporate entity.
