```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The plaintiff has met its burden to demonstrate reasonable diligence in serving the defendant, as three different process servers attempted to personally serve the defendant at his usual place of business, but were denied access to the elevator on each attempt. The court has concluded that substitute service of the summons and complaint at the defendant's usual place of business was sufficient to confer jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant's motion to quash is denied, and the defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
