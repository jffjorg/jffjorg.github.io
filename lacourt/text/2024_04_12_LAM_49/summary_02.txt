Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Marlon Dumlao and Bernadette Bernardo, move to set aside their defaults entered by the clerk. The defendants argue that they were surprised to receive the default and did not intentionally allow it to occur. The court finds that the defendants' surprise and lack of knowledge about the lawsuit are excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motion to set aside the defaults. The court notes that the defendants demonstrated relief from their defaults is warranted based on "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." The court also finds that the settlement negotiations were ongoing at the time Plaintiff obtained Defendants' defaults, and that Plaintiff did not demonstrate it will suffer any undue prejudice if the defaults are set aside.
