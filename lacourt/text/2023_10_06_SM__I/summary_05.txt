```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to vacate the default judgment is granted. The defendant must file a standalone answer within 5 court days. The judge notes that while the plaintiff's counsel did not notify the new defense counsel of the service, the evidence suggests that the defendants may have been aware of the suit or were turning a deliberate blind eye to the question. The judge also notes that the defendants' claim of surprise that there was a lawsuit does ring somewhat hollow. The judge will inquire into the actual costs associated with filing the request for entry of default judgment and is likely to require the defendant to pay that amount. The judge advises all parties to do a re-set on their relations, as this case has the potential to be long, painful, and expensive for everyone.
