And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a case where the plaintiff brings three motions to compel the defendant to respond to discovery. The discovery was served on March 20, 2023, and the defendant sought and obtained three extensions to respond, but never did. The plaintiff tried to set up a call to discuss the matter, but the defendant provided no responses. Despite warnings, the defendant still failed to respond. The court grants the motions to compel, ordering the defendant to provide complete and verified responses without objection and the documents requested within 30 calendar days. The court also grants the request for sanctions, awarding $2925 to the plaintiff. Additionally, the court reduces the time allowed for meet and confer from 15 hours to 3 hours and for preparing the motions from 10 hours to 5 hours. The court also awards time for the hearing, but limits it to 1 hour. The total amount of sanctions is $3185, payable within 30 days by the defendant.
