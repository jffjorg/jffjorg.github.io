```
And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

In the case of Starnet Insurance Company v. Michael Esquibel, the court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant's answer is stricken. The court's decision is based on the fact that the defendant failed to obey the court's order compelling discovery responses, and has not responded to discovery requests for over a year. The court finds that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, and therefore, the ultimate sanction of terminating sanctions is justified. The court's decision is in line with the legal standard set forth in Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.
