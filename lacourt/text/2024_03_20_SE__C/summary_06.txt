And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Whittier has moved to stay the action against it, citing an injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in favor of Boy Scouts of America and its chartered organizations. The City argues that its Explorer Post program was chartered by the Los Angeles Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and therefore, the action is subject to the injunction. However, the court finds that the City has not advanced admissible evidence to support this claim. The court concludes that the Explorer Post program was not a chartered organization of the Boy Scouts of America, and therefore, the injunction does not apply to the Plaintiff's claims. The motion to stay the action is denied.
