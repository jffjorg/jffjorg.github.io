moves to stay the action until April 19, 2024 when the Limited Protected Party
Injunction of the reorganization plan of the Boy Scouts of America ends.

Whittier’s motion. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Trial
courts have the inherent power to stay proceedings to promote justice and
judicial efficiency. (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)
 
Requests for Judicial
Notice
 
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the
following under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d)(2): (1) March 11, 2024
Memorandum and Order issued and filed by Hon. Laurie Selber Silverstein in the
matter captioned In Re: Boy Scout of America and Delaware BSA, LLC, case number
20-10343 (LSS); (2) pages 124:15 to 127:3 of the Notice of Filing of Hearing
transcripts filed on September 27, 2021 in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware, Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, case number 20-10343 (LSS).

 
The Court takes judicial notice of the fact of
the stated court records, but not of the truth of the factual findings. (Weiner
v. Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 39,
45-46.)  
 
Defendant requests judicial notice of the
following under Evidence Code sections 452 subdivision (a), (c), and (h), 453,
and 1280: (1) Plan of Reorganization of the Boy Scouts of America and Delaware
BSA, LLC, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, case
number 20-10343-LSS; (2) supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law
confirming the third modified fifth amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization
for Boy Scouts of America and Delaware BSA, LLC, case number 20-10343-LSS; and
(3) Notice of Entry of Confirmation Order and Occurrence of Effective Date of
Third Modified Fifth Amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization for Boy Scouts
of America and Delaware BSA, LLC, filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware, case number 20-10343-LSS. 
 
Similarly, the Court takes judicial notice of
the fact of the stated court records, but not of the truth of the factual
findings. (Weiner v. Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp (1980) 114
Cal.App.3d 39, 45-46.)  
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff
objects to the evidence submitted by the City of Whittier. The Court rules as
follows:
 
1.    Overruled

2.    Overruled

3.    Sustained
4.    Overruled

 
Stay
 
City of Whittier moves to stay the action
until April 19, 2024 on the grounds that its Explorer Post program was
chartered by the Los Angeles Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Thus,
this action is subject to an injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware in favor of Boy Scouts of America and its chartered
organizations. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff asserts that the City of Whittier has not provided proper
evidentiary support for its conclusion that the City of Whittier was a
chartered organization of the Boy Scouts of America at the time of Plaintiff’s
claims. Separately, Plaintiff asserts that her claims are mixed claims and the
parts of her claims that do not arise out of Explorer Post activities are not
subject to the injunction.  
 
City
of Whittier advances the declaration of Charles Drylie, who states, “In my
position as an advisor with the Explorer Post, it was my understanding that the
WPD Explorer Post was chartered by the Los Angeles Area Council of the Boy
Scouts of America.” (Decl. Drylie, ¶ 4.) He also states, “During my entire time
with the WPD Explorer Post, it was my understanding that the WPD Explorer Post
chartered by the Los Angeles Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America.” (Decl.
Drylie, ¶ 5.) 
 
City
of Whittier also advances the declaration of Yolanda Martinez, City of
Whittier’s Director of Human Resources and Risk Management. She submits a
letter dated October 5, 1990, from then-Chief James Bale of the Whittier Police
Department to James Peterson of the Los Angeles Area Council of the Boy Scouts
of America. (Decl. Martinez, ¶ 4, Ex. A.) 
 
Based on the above, the Court finds that City of Whittier has not
advanced admissible evidence to support that the Explorer Post is a chartered
organization of the Boy Scouts of America. First, Charlies Drylie seems to
state that the basis of his personal knowledge of the fact is his
“understanding.” To have personal
knowledge, the witness must have the capacity to perceive a matter through his
or her own senses and remember or recollect what he or she has perceived. (See
Comment to Evid. Code §§ 701, 702.) Drylie’s statement is conclusory. He
does not state the source of this understanding. Second, the letter does not
establish that the Explorer Post is a chartered organization of the Boy Scouts of
America. It is a recommendation letter for Charles Drylie. Nowhere does it
state that the Explorer Post is a chartered organization of the Boy Scouts of
America. The letter is not relevant to prove or disprove that the Explorer Post
is a chartered organization of the Boy Scouts of America. (Evid. Code, § 210.) 
 
Based on the above, the motion is DENIED.
