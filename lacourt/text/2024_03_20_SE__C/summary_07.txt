Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant, Forest River, Inc., granting its motion to stay the action based on Code of Civil Procedure section 410.30. The plaintiffs, Randall Bruce and Jean Eiselein, sued Forest River, alleging violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act due to alleged defects in the recreational vehicle they purchased. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs are bound by a mandatory forum selection clause that requires them to litigate in the state of Indiana. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that enforcement of the clause would be unreasonable or unfair. The court granted the stay, requiring the moving party to give notice.
