This is an action for bed bug
bites. Specially Appearing Defendants Hilton Worldwide
Holdings, Inc., Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc., and Doubletree by Hilton
Whittier Los Angeles move to quash service of summons. 
 
Quash Service of Summons
 
“When a motion to quash is
properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish
the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”  (Aquila, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 556, 568.) This may be
done through presentation of declarations, with opposing declarations received
in response. (Ibid.) 
 
This
motion is unopposed. Further, Plaintiff did not file a proof of service as to
her summons and complaint. Thus, Plaintiff has not met her burden. 
 
The
motion is GRANTED.
