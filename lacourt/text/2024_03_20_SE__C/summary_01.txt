And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a breach of contract action. The plaintiff, Marcel P. Padilla, has moved to lift a stay of the action pending institution and final determination in Mexico. The defendants, Hermenegildo Espinoza Mendoza, Jose Luis Espinoza, and Alejandra Romero Oceguera, have moved for nonstatutory dismissal. The judge has denied both motions.

The plaintiff argues that Mexican laws do not provide adequate remedies, but fails to demonstrate a change in circumstances following the Court's January 26, 2022 order granting, in part, the defendants' motion to dismiss the action based on inconvenient forum. The plaintiff also fails to show that the remedy available in Mexico is inadequate.

The judge notes that the "no remedy at all" exception applies only in rare circumstances, such as where the alternative forum is a foreign country whose courts are ruled by a dictatorship. Since Mexico is not such a country, the plaintiff's motion to lift stay is denied.

The defendants' motion for nonstatutory dismissal is also denied, as the plaintiff has applied for a lift of stay of the instant action for California to prosecute it. The court has inherent authority to dismiss an action under California Code of Civil Procedure, § 583.150.
