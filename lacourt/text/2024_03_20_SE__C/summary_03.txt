Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied H MART NORWALK LLC's motion for summary adjudication of the breach of lease and constructive trust causes of action. The court found that H MART NORWALK LLC has not met its burden of proof to prove that no triable issue of material facts exists with regard to the breach of lease cause of action. Specifically, the court found that H MART NORWALK LLC has not demonstrated that Alondra & Pioneer Property, LLC's failure to repair the fire damage was a material breach that excuses performance by the other party. The court also found that H MART NORWALK LLC's pleading of excuse or waiver of performance of conditions precedent is general and not specific, and therefore, the court will not adjudicate the fourth element of damages. As for the constructive trust cause of action, the court found that H MART NORWALK LLC has not met its burden to prove that no triable issue of material facts exists that a constructive trust formed. The court also found that H MART NORWALK LLC's pleading is vague and does not specify the grounds for judicial notice.
