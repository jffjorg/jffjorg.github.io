And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a name change petition. The petition was unable to be processed due to an incomplete social security number provided by the petitioner. The court requested that the petitioner complete a live scan, but the petitioner was unable to do so due to a disability. The court has ordered the petitioner to provide a new criminal history assessment form, including the petitioner's complete social security number and California identification card, by December 26, 2024. If the petitioner fails to provide this information, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The petition is continued to January 27, 2025, at 9:30 am. The name change clerk is ordered to run and complete a criminal history assessment at least one week prior to the continued hearing.
