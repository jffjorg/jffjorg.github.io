And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petition to change name and has provided guidance on the proposed decree. The petitioner must carefully review the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is unclear or incorrectly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. If the new name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
