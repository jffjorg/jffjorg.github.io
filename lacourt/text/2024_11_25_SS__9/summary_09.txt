The court has issued a tentative ruling in a petition to change name. The petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is correct, no appearance is necessary at the hearing scheduled for November 25, 2024. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
