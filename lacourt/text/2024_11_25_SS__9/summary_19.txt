And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to change name is granted. However, the Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is clearly written and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. If the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
