The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCP02965. The petitioner has submitted a petition to change their name, and the judge has granted the petition. However, the judge has also made it clear that the petitioner must ensure the new name is correctly written and spelled on the proposed decree. If the name is not legible or accurately spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to correct the mistake. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
