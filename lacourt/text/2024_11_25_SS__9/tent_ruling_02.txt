 Case Number:  24STCP02174    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  9 On August 26, 2024, the Name Change Clerk indicated that Petitioner provided an incomplete social security number, and thus, Petitioner could not be identified.
 
On September 9, 2024, the Court noted that the Name Change Clerk was unable to verify Petitioner’s identity with the information provided and requested Petitioner complete a live scan before the continued hearing date – November 25, 2024. 
 
In the declaration filed on October 28, 2024, Petitioner states that he was unable to complete the livescan due to a disability. 
 
A criminal history assessment is required before the Court can grant a name change petition.
 
Pursuant to the original criminal history assessment, Petitioner failed to include his California ID number and his full social security number;  Petitioner provided only an incomplete social security number. However, in the Declaration re fingerprints, Petitioner included copies of Petitioner’s California Identification Card. The Name Change Clerk should be able to run a Criminal History Assessment with Petitioner's full social security number and California Identification Card.
 
Accordingly, Petitioner is ordered to submit a new Name Change Criminal History Assessment form and properly include the mandatory information -- including Petitioner’s California ID Number and Petitioner’s complete Social Security Number -- no later than December 26, 2024.   If Petitioner fails to follow these instructions and provide sufficient information to run a criminal history assessment prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. 
 
The Petition is continued to January 27, 2025 at 9:30 am.
 
The Name Change Clerk is ordered to run and complete a criminal history assessment at least one week prior to the continued hearing. 
 
Court Clerk to give notice.
