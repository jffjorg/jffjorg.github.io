And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a petition to change name filed by the Petitioner. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing scheduled for November 25, 2024. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
