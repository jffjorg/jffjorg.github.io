And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the proposed decree with a new name and has granted the petition. However, the judge has concerns about the legibility and spelling of the new name and is requiring the petitioner to double-check these details. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. But if there are issues with the name, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
