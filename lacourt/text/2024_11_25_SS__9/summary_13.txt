And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling concerns a petition to change name filed by the Petitioner. The Judge has granted the petition, subject to the Petitioner reviewing the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, no appearance is necessary at the hearing scheduled for November 25, 2024. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
