And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the petition for a name change, but with some conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name meets these criteria, the Petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not legible or contains spelling errors, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
