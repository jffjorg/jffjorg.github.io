And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has noted that the Petitioner has an outstanding bench warrant (# SD91604619800) and has failed to clear it as ordered. Despite this, the Petitioner appeared in court and requested a further continuance to comply with the court's order. The court has granted the continuance, but emphasized that the Petitioner must clear the outstanding warrant and file evidence of such before the court will rule on the petition for name change. The court has also ordered the Petitioner to appear at the continued hearing to answer questions about the clearing of the warrant and has set a deadline for the Petitioner to file written proof that the warrant has been fully addressed. Failure to comply with these orders may result in the petition being denied without prejudice.
