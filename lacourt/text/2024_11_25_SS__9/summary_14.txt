This tentative ruling outlines the judge's decision regarding a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing on November 25, 2024. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Additionally, the judge notes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
