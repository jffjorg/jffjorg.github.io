And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to change the petitioner's name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name meets these requirements, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
