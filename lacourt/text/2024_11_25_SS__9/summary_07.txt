The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a petition for a name change. The judge has ordered the petitioner to double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the petitioner is satisfied with the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Additionally, the judge has ruled that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
