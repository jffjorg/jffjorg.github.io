          On December 3,
2021, Plaintiff Aziza Georgian filed this action against US GC Investment, LP,
New Prosperity Investment LLC, and Youhong Fu (“Fu”).  On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed this
motion to compel Fu’s responses to her Form Interrogatories – Employment Law,
Set One and requested sanctions.  On
September 20, 2023, at Plaintiff’s request, the clerk entered default against
Fu.  
A defendant in default has no right to
participate in the action until either (a) their default is set aside (in which
event, they may respond to the complaint), or (b) a default judgment is entered
(in which event, they may appeal).  (Devlin
v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.)  Since Defendant is now in default, they are
now “out of court.”  Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s discovery motion is DENIED as moot. 

Plaintiff requests sanctions in the
amount of $1,064.77, which the Court finds excessive.  Accordingly, pursuant to California Rules of
Court rule 3.1348, the Court imposes sanctions in the reduced amount of $410
against Defendant, consisting of 1 hour at a reasonable hourly rate of $350 and
a $60 filing fee, to be paid within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Dated this 28th day of September,
2023
