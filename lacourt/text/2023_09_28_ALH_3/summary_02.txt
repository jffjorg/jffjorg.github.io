Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant GP Commercial Investment Corp. to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Paseo Pasadena Hotel Investment, LLC. The demurrer is unopposed. The judge grants Defendant's request for judicial notice of various documents filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office.

The judge sustains Defendant's demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for intentional/negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, finding that Plaintiff fails to allege a prospective economic relationship, fails to allege facts describing the acts committed, and fails to allege that the acts were independently wrongful.

The judge also sustains Defendant's demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for civil conspiracy, finding that Plaintiff fails to allege an independently actionable tort and fails to state a viable theory of liability.

The judge orders that Defendant's demurrer is sustained in its entirety, and as Plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer and show how amendment is possible, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
