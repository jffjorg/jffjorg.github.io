Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant GP Commercial Investment Corp. to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Paseo Pasadena Hotel Investment, LLC. The demurrer is unopposed. The judge grants Defendant's request for judicial notice of various documents filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office.

The judge sustains Defendant's demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for intentional/negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, finding that Plaintiff fails to allege a prospective economic relationship, fails to allege facts describing the acts committed, and fails to allege that the acts were independently wrongful.

The judge also sustains Defendant's demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for civil conspiracy, finding that Plaintiff fails to allege an independently actionable tort and fails to state a viable theory of liability.

The judge orders that Defendant's demurrer is sustained in its entirety, and as Plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer and show how amendment is possible, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.

## English Summary

The Judge's tentative ruling states that Defendant GP Commercial Investment Corp.'s demurrer to Plaintiff Paseo Pasadena Hotel Investment, LLC's First Amended Complaint is **sustained**. This means the Court finds the Plaintiff's lawsuit lacks sufficient legal basis.

The Court specifically ruled against two causes of action:

1. **Intentional/Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage:** The Court found this claim fails because the alleged economic relationship was a pre-existing contract, not a prospective one. Additionally, the Plaintiff didn't allege any independently wrongful acts by the Defendant.
2. **Civil Conspiracy:** This claim failed because the Plaintiff did not allege an independently actionable tort as the basis for the conspiracy.

Therefore, the Plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed without the opportunity to amend the complaint.

And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Defendant GP Commercial Investment Corp. to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Paseo Pasadena Hotel Investment, LLC. The demurrer argues that the FAC fails to state sufficient facts to support the claims of civil conspiracy and intentional/negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.

The Court agrees with the demurrer and sustains it in its entirety. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claim for interference with prospective economic advantage fails because the alleged economic relationship was with the original landlord, not the defendant. Additionally, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to allege an independently actionable tort and that the claim for conspiracy must be based on a wrongful act.

As a result, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit, and the Court will consider whether to adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
