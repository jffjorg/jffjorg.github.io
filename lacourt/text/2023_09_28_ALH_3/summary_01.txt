And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel defendant Youhong Fu's responses to Form Interrogatories and a request for sanctions. Since Fu is now in default, the court has denied the motion as moot. The court has also imposed sanctions in the amount of $410 against Fu, consisting of 1 hour at a reasonable hourly rate of $350 and a $60 filing fee, to be paid within 20 days of the date of the order. The court finds the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,064.77 to be excessive.
