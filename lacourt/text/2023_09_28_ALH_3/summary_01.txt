## English Text Summary 

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Aziza Georgian's motion to compel Defendant Youhong Fu's responses to discovery requests and request for sanctions. The Judge notes that Defendant Fu is now in default after a default judgment was entered against them on September 20, 2023.  

Because Fu is in default, they are considered "out of court" and cannot participate in the case until their default is set aside or a default judgment is entered. As a result, the Judge denies the motion to compel discovery as moot.

The Judge also addresses the Plaintiff's request for sanctions. While the Plaintiff requested $1,064.77, the Judge finds this amount excessive and imposes sanctions in the reduced amount of $410.
