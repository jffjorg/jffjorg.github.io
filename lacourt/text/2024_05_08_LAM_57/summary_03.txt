And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling allows counsel for the Defendant to refresh the Plaintiff's recollection through text messages that were not disclosed during discovery. The Court cites Evans v. Hood Corp. (2016) in support of this decision, noting that there is no authority requiring the disclosure of documents used to refresh a witness's recollection. The ruling also allows for the production of the text messages at trial and permits the impeachment of the Plaintiff's testimony using the text messages. The Court will reconsider its decision at the close of the trial and may strike the text messages and related testimony if persuaded by the Plaintiff's arguments.
