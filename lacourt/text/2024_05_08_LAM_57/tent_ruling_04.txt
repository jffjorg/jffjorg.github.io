 Case Number:  23STCV11642    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  57 The separate statements that Plaintiff filed in support of his three motions to compel Defendant Pop ID Inc. to provide further responses to discovery --  special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and request for production of documents -- that Plaintiff propounded are defective.  California Rule of Court 3.1345 requires separate statements in support of such motions to set for the text of the interrogatories and request that are the subject of the motions.  Plaintiff's separate statements do not comply with that requirement.   As a result of that void, the Court cannot ascertain to what it is that Plaintiff is seeking to compel further responses.   In response to that defect, the Court's recourse is the same one taken in connection with Defendant's discovery motions that were supported by separate statements that failed to comply with Rule 3.1345: like Defendant, Plaintiff will be given an opportunity to file and serve amended separate statements in support of his three motions, and as with Defendants' motions, Plaintiff's will have to be continued.
