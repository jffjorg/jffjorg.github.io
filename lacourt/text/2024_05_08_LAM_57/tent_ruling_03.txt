 Case Number:  21STCV16804    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court will permit counsel for Defendant to refresh Plaintiff's recollection through the text messages that Defendant did not disclose to Plaintiff during to discovery even though the messages were responsive to Plaintiff's discovery requests.  The authority for this decision is Evans v. Hood Corp. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1022, 1042, which observed that there is "no authority stating that a document used to refresh a witness's recollection must be disclosed in discovery . . .  To the contrary, Evidence Code section 771 . . . anticipates that a document used to refresh a witness's recollection will be produced at the hearing in which the witness is testifying . . . and need not be admissible, and indeed are inadmissible under Evidence Code section 771(b), except when proffered by the adverse party."    This decision is tentative in that the impeachment will be allowed today so that the trial can proceed expeditiously.  At the close of the trial, however, Plaintiff may argue that, notwithstanding Evans v .Hood,  the Court should strike all references to the text messages used to refresh Plaintiff's recollection and all testimony that follows the refreshing.   This is a bench trial, not a jury trial.  After the trial and in deciding the case, the Court will be able to disregard the text messages and related testimony if Plaintiff persuades the Court to strike the text messages and related testimony.
