And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the case. The plaintiff has filed separate statements in support of three motions to compel the defendant to provide further responses to discovery. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's separate statements do not comply with California Rule of Court 3.1345, which requires that the text of the interrogatories and request be set forth in the statement. As a result, the judge cannot determine what the plaintiff is seeking to compel further responses. The judge has given the plaintiff an opportunity to file and serve amended separate statements, similar to what was done in a previous case involving the defendant. The hearing date remains May 8, 2024.
