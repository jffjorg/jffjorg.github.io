PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Dalia Gamboa asks the Court to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Joshua Seth
Hernandez’s action against Peco Foods, Inc. 
DISCUSSION 
“Subject
matter jurisdiction is a fundamental requirement for judicial consideration of
claims.”  (Saffer v. JP Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1239, 1248 (Saffer).) “ ‘The
California Supreme Court has defined subject matter jurisdiction thusly: “Subject
matter jurisdiction . . . is the power of the court over a cause of action or to
act in a particular way.” [Citations.]  By contrast, the lack of subject matter
jurisdiction means the entire absence of power to hear or determine a case;
i.e., an absence of authority over the subject matter. [Citations.]  Where the
evidence is not in dispute, a determination of subject matter jurisdiction is a
legal question subject to de novo review.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Dial 800
v. Fesbinder (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 32, 42.) 
“Subject
matter jurisdiction may not be ‘ “ ‘conferred by consent, waiver, agreement,
acquiescence, or estoppel.’ ” ’ [Citation.]” (Saffer, supra, 225
Cal.App.4th at p. 1248.) “ ‘ “[T]he adequacy of the court's subject matter
jurisdiction must be addressed whenever that issue comes to the court's
attention.” [Citation.]’” (Ibid.) “ ‘[A]ny judgment or order rendered by
a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is “void on its face . . . .”[Citation.]’
” (Ibid., quoting Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005)
35 Cal.4th 180, 196.) 
“A
judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action
or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 577.) “ ‘It is elementary that where a
tribunal has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, the
jurisdiction continues until a final judgment is entered.’ ” (Diamond
Heights Village Assn., Inc. v. Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corp.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 290, 305, quoting Riley v. Superior Court (1957)
49 Cal.2d 305, 309 [“The court lost jurisdiction over Financial Freedom once
judgment was entered in its favor”].) 
Here,
the Court entered judgment in favor of Peco and against Plaintiff on May 26,
2022.  On June 3, 2022, Plaintiff
appealed the judgment.  On December 16,
2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal at Plaintiff’s request and
issued the remittitur.  
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition to give the parties an opportunity
to provide legal authority, if any, showing that the Court has jurisdiction to rule on the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action against
Peco. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition filed by Petitioner Dalia Gamboa to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff Joshua
Seth Hernandez’s action against Defendant Peco Foods, Inc. to January 5, 2024,
at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Petitioner Dalia Gamboa and/or Peco Foods, Inc. may submit supplemental legal authority (if any) by January 2, 2024 showing that, despite the entry of judgment on May 26, 2022, the Court has jurisdiction to rule on the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Joshua Seth Hernandez's action against Defendant Peco Foods, Inc.
