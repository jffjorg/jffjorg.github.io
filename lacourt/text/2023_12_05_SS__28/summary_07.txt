And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling to transfer and reassign Case Number 22STCV04273 to an independent calendar court, specifically Department 205 of the Beverly Hills Courthouse, presided over by Judge Edward Moreton. This decision was made due to the complexity of the case, which has required multiple pretrial hearings. The case will no longer be heard in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse on December 5, 2023. Instead, the parties will need to contact the newly assigned court to determine if their motion or hearing will be rescheduled.
