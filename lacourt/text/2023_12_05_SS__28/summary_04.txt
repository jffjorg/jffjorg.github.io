And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted by the plaintiff, Jacob Ali, for a default judgment against the defendant, Anargyros Lazaridis. The plaintiff is seeking $76,184.94 in damages, including $49,278.12 in special damages, $25,000.00 in general damages, and $1,906.82 in costs. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's evidence does not support the request for $49,278.12 in special damages, and that the amount of special damages requested is greater than the amount listed in the billing records. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff has not dismissed the Does 1-50, as required by the California Rules of Court. Therefore, the judge denies the application for default judgment without prejudice, ordering the plaintiff to provide additional information about the "investigation" fees and to give notice of this ruling.
