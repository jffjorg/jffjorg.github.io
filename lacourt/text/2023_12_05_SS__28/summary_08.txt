The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition filed by Elizabeth Silva to approve the compromise of Emma Silva's claims. The petition was filed on September 29, 2023, and was scheduled to be heard on December 5, 2023. The court found that the petition lacked important information, including the total medical expenses incurred and the total amount of contractual or statutory liens.
