 Case Number:  21STCV23426    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 24, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Roland Ononaiwu aka Roland
Onoaiwu (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for subrogation. The complaint sought
damages of $78,363.35. 
On
July 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Defendant on July 15, 2021. 
On
December 20, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
September 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment against
Defendant to be heard on November 20, 2023.  The Court continued the hearing to December 5,
2023. 
On
October 2, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $84,935.44, consisting of $78,363.35 as the demand of the complaint,
$6,057.09 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $515.00 in
costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment;
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental
fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
(Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494; see Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the
court may take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
“[T]he
court in its discretion may permit the use of affidavits, in lieu of personal
testimony, as to all or any part of the evidence or proof required or permitted
to be offered, received, or heard . . . . The facts stated in the affidavit or
affidavits shall be within the personal knowledge of the affiant and shall be
set forth with particularity, and each affidavit shall show affirmatively that
the affiant, if sworn as a witness, can testify competently thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
November 20, 2023, the Court continued the hearing because Plaintiff’s application
included an “Interest Declaration” which stated that “Exhibit A” to the
declaration supports the requested prejudgment interest, but no Exhibit A was attached.
 The Court ordered Plaintiff to submit documents
supporting Plaintiff’s calculation of prejudgment interest prior to the continued
December 5, 2023 hearing date.  Plaintiff
has not submitted the requested documents.
The
Court again continues the hearing and orders Plaintiff to submit the missing
documents.  The Court will deny the
application for default judgment if Plaintiff does not provide the documents before
the next hearing. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s application for default judgment filed on
September 27, 2023, to January 8, 2024, at 8:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the
Spring Street Courthouse. 
The
Court orders Plaintiff to submit documents supporting Plaintiff’s calculation
of prejudgment interest by January 2, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
