considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 21, 2021, Plaintiff Jacob Ali (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Anargyros Lazaridis (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle
tort, general negligence, violation of Vehicle Code section 20001, subdivision
(a), and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
On
March 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on
Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on February 24, 2023. 
On
April 17, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
August 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
October 12, 2023.  The Court continued
the hearing to December 5, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Jacob Ali requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant
Anargyros Lazaridis and award Plaintiff $76,184.94, consisting of $49,278.12 in
special damages, $25,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest,
$0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $1,906.82 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to
Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the
documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the
court may take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has not dismissed Does 1-50.  A default
judgment application must include “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment . . . .” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7).) 
Plaintiff’s
evidence does not support the request for $49,278.12 in special damages.
Plaintiff appears to be requesting special damages based on medical expenses.
Plaintiff’s billing records list expenses of $45,691.12 and $710.00.  Added together, the billing records show
expenses of $46,401.12.  This is less
than the amount of special damages requested. 
Plaintiff
requests $477.50 for “investigation” fees. 
Plaintiff should provide additional information about these fees so the
Court can determine whether they are recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which excludes “investigation expenses in preparing the case
for trial.” 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the application for default judgment filed on August 17, 2023
without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
