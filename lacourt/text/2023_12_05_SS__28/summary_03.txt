And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the motion of Plaintiff Donnovan Lewery to deem admitted the matters specified in requests for admission, set one, served on Defendant Frontline Protection, Inc., and for sanctions will be continued to a date to be determined at the December 5, 2023 hearing. The Judge also orders counsel for Frontline Protection, Inc. to appear at the continued hearing. The Judge notes that Frontline's counsel did not file a response to Plaintiff's motion and did not effectively substitute another attorney in his place. The Judge also notes that Frontline has not responded to three other pending discovery motions scheduled for December 7, 2023. The Judge finds that Frontline failed to respond to requests for admission and did not file an opposition to Plaintiff's motion, and therefore, the Court will consider the matters specified in the requests for admission to be deemed admitted.
