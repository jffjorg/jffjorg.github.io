And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement in the case of Marie Dekermenji vs. City of Glendale. The motion was filed by the Aghayani Defendants, who entered into a settlement with the plaintiff in the amount of $25,000.00 during mediation on June 4, 2024. The judge found that the settlement was made in good faith, considering the Tech-Bilt factors, which include the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after a trial. The judge also considered the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling defendants. The judge noted that the moving party has made a sufficient showing and that the settlement agreement was reached in good faith during mediation.
