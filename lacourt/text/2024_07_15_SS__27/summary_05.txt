And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Court will hear from the parties on July 15, 2024, regarding the status of the outstanding depositions. The case involves a motion to compel depositions of Defendant Albertsons' employees, which was filed by Plaintiff Yelena Meloyan. The Defendant served objections to the deposition notice and refused to produce the employees for deposition, citing that the depositions were unilaterally noticed. The Plaintiff's counsel sent emails requesting the depositions, but the Defendant did not respond. The Defendant has attempted to arrange the employees' depositions, but the depositions of three employees (Trinidad Schema, Yesenia Martinez, and Natalie Vanderham) remain outstanding. The Judge notes that the Defendant has acted with substantial justification, as it noticed the Plaintiff's daughter's deposition first in November 2023 and produced the employees' depositions soon after. The Judge will address the issue of monetary sanctions at the hearing.
