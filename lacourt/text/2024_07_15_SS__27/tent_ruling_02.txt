MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS 
Hearing Date: 7/15/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV45806 DELIA RAMIREZ vs
MOKHTAR ZHOOBIN, et al. 
Moving Party: Defendant Tarzana Treatment
Center 
Responding Party: Unopposed 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED
 
Background 
 
This matter arises from an alleged fall at the
residence located at 7101 Oso Ave #7, Winnetka, CA 91306. Plaintiff Delia
Ramirez was a resident of a facility operated by Defendant Tarzana Treatment
Centers, Inc.
 
On June 22, 2023, nearly one year ago,
Tarzana’s Counsel served a Deposition Notice and Request for Production of
Documents on Plaintiff’s Counsel for Plaintiff to appear at a deposition on
August 16, 2023. At Plaintiff’s request, Defendant continued the deposition
numerous times until finally filing a motion to compel deposition on March 4,
2024.
 
On May 1, 2024, the Court granted Tarzana’s
Motion to Compel, and ordered Plaintiff to appear for deposition within twenty
days of the date of the order and to pay a monetary sanction of $2,000.
Defendant then noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for June 3, 2024, pursuant to the
Court’s May 1 order. On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear for her
Court-ordered deposition. On the same day, Defendant attempted to meet and
confer, but Plaintiff did not respond. Defendant now moves the Court for
terminating sanctions. Plaintiff failed to file an opposition.
 
Although a terminating sanction is a “drastic measure which should be employed with caution” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.), the court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater
sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not
an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)
 
Based on the totality of the circumstances,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has abandoned her case. Plaintiff failed to
comply with Tarzana Treatment Center's Court order to sit for her deposition,
failed to respond to Court orders to respond to Defendant Mokhatar Zhoobin’s
discovery requests, failed to pay Tarzana Treatment Center monetary sanctions,
failed to respond to Defendants’ meet and confer attempts, and failed to oppose
the present motion and Mokhtar Zhoobin’s motion for terminating sanctions. The Court
finds that lesser sanctions would not curb the discovery abuse. Thus, the
present motion is granted.
