And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for sanctions in part and denies it in part. The plaintiff had previously requested verifications for discovery responses and had not received them. The defendant had complied with the court's order to provide further supplemental responses, but failed to provide verifications for certain requests. The plaintiff had also requested monetary sanctions, which the defendant had not paid. The defendant later provided the verifications and paid the outstanding sanctions. The court found that less severe sanctions would not have produced compliance with the discovery rules, and therefore imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000 on the defendant.
