```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case was filed in 2020 and was dismissed in 2024 due to lack of prosecution. The Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at a hearing on December 4, 2023, and again on January 24, 2024, which contributed to the dismissal. However, the Court finds that the primary reason for the dismissal was the Plaintiff's failure to obtain a default judgment over an extended period. The Plaintiff's motion to vacate is denied, and the parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
