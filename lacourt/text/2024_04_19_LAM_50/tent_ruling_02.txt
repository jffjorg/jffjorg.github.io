  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION FOR TRIAL CONTINUANCE



 
Background
Plaintiff
Ricardo Armando Nunez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on June 19, 2020 against
Defendant San Martin De Porres Medical Clinic of South Gate, Inc.
(“Defendant”). 
Plaintiff
filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on April 17, 2023,
asserting causes of action for (1) FEHA retaliation, (2) violation of Labor Code sections 510, 1194, and 1198, (3) violation
of Labor Code section 2802, (4) violation of Labor Code sections 226.7 and 512, (5) violation of Labor Code section 226, (6) violation of Labor Code sections 200-204, and (7) violation of Labor Code section 1194.  
The
trial date in this action is currently set for June 12, 2024. 
Defendant now moves “for
a continuance of trial of this case from June 12, 2024 to 60 days thereafter or
as soon thereafter as the Court may deem proper.” Plaintiff opposes. 
            Discussion
“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must
consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the
determination.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(d).) 
            Defendant
asserts that good cause exists for continuing the trial date here. 
            Defendant notes that on March 13,
2024, Defendant filed a motion for summary adjudication in this case. The
motion is noticed for hearing on May 30, 2024. In his supporting declaration,
Defendant’s counsel states that “[o]n November 10, 2023 I secured a hearing
date for a Motion for Summary Adjudication via the Court Reservation systema
[sic] and was able to secure the hearing date of May 30, 2034…Unfortunately, I
was unable to secure a sooner hearing date.” (Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) 
            Defendant notes that pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(a)(3), a motion for
summary judgment “shall be heard no
later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause
orders otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not extend the time within
which a party must otherwise file a responsive pleading.” As set forth above,
the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication is set for May 30,
2024. As noted by Defendant, May 30, 2024 is less than 30 days before the June
12, 2024 trial date. 
            Defendant
asserts that “there is good cause for a trial continuance because Defendant
will be deprived of its statutory right to have its summary judgment
adjudication [sic] heard unless trial is continued.” (Mot. at p. 6:4-6.)
Defendant cites to Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d
526, 529, where the
Court of Appeal found that “[a] trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.”
The Sentry Court noted that “[w]e are sympathetic to the problems the
trial courts experience in calendaring
and hearing the many motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to
these problems cannot rest in a refusal
to hear timely motions.” (Id. at p. 530.) 
            Defendant asserts that here, “the
motion was served more than 75 days prior to the hearing date…” (Lopez Decl., ¶
5.)[1] Defendant
asserts that it thus “prepared a Motion for Summary Adjudication in a timely
manner but was unable to secure a Motion date 30 days prior to the current
trial date.” (Mot. at p. 6:1-2.) Defendant asserts that it will suffer
irreparable harm if trial is not continued.
            In the opposition, Plaintiff appears
to assert that none of the factors set forth in California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332 support Defendant’s request for a trial continuance. 
Plaintiff asserts that “Defendant is now seeking a fifth trial
continuance – their second without agreement from Plaintiff.” (Opp’n at p.
4:21-22, emphasis omitted.) However, Plaintiff does not show that Defendant
sought trial continuances on four prior occasions (to the extent that is what
Plaintiff is arguing).   
            Rather, as noted by Plaintiff, on October
21, 2021, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that
“[t]he Ex Parte Application Defendant’s Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial;
Memorandum of Points and Authorities; Declaration of Steve Lopez; and
Declaration of Jasmine Chavez filed by San Martin de Porres Medical Clinic of
South Gate, Inc., a California business organization on 10/18/2021 is Granted.
Pursuant to the request of defendant, the Jury Trial scheduled for 01/12/2022
is continued to 07/06/22…” 
Plaintiff also notes that the parties filed a Joint Stipulation to
Continue Trial, and on June 20, 2022, the Court issued an Order, inter alia,
continuing trial from July 6, 2022 to September 21, 2022. 
            Plaintiff further notes that on September 9, 2022, the
Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “Reset
- Court Unavailable, the Final Status Conference scheduled for 09/09/2022, and
Jury Trial scheduled for 09/21/2022 are advanced to this date and vacated.”  
On
October 6, 2022, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia,
“Jury Trial is scheduled for 05/17/23…” On May 5, 2023, the Court issued a
minute order providing, inter alia, “[o]n the Court’s own motion, the
Jury Trial scheduled for 05/17/2023 is advanced to this date and vacated.” Plaintiff
notes that on July 19, 2023, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter
alia, “Jury Trial is scheduled for 06/12/24 at 09:30 AM in Department 50 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” 
            Plaintiff also argues that “[t]he
need for a trial continuance claimed by Defendant is of Defendant’s own doing
and the lack of planning on the part of Defendant and its counsel.” (Opp’n at
p. 5:5-7.) In addition,
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that “Plaintiff will be prejudiced in
that Plaintiff has made every effort to properly litigate this case, absent the
obstacles posed by Defendant and its counsel. Plaintiff is ready and prepared
for trial as scheduled on June 12, 2024. Plaintiff will be compelled to put up
with more of Defendant’s unfair gamesmanship should Defendant be allowed to
continue trial…” (Zambrano Decl., ¶ 30.)
            However, as set forth above, the Sentry
Court noted that “[w]e are sympathetic to the
problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for
summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely motions.” (Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra,
207 Cal.App.3d at p. 530.) Here,
Plaintiff does not appear to argue that Defendant’s subject motion for summary
adjudication is untimely. As discussed, Defendant’s counsel states that he was
unable to secure a sooner hearing date for the motion for summary adjudication.
(Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) 
The Court
notes that pursuant to California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332, circumstances relevant to the Court’s determination of a
motion for a trial continuance include, inter alia, “[w]hether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(10).) 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated good cause for a trial continuance. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
motion is granted.
The Court continues the
final status conference to ______________, at 10:00 a.m., in Dept. 50 and trial
to _____________, at 9:30 a.m., in Dept. 50.
Defendant is ordered to
give notice of this ruling.
