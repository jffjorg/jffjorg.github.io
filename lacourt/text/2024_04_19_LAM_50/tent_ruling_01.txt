  ORDER RE:
 
MARK BEAMISH
  WATERPROOFING, INC.’S MOTION FOR DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT




AND RELATED
  CROSS-ACTIONS


 



            
            Background
Plaintiff Savoy Community Association
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on July 26, 2019 against Defendants Perennial
Engineering & Construction, Inc., dba DM Construction Services (“Perennial”), SBBC
Associates Inc. dba Stonemark Construction Management, and Angelus
Waterproofing & Restoration, Inc. (“Angelus”). 
The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1)
breach of contract, (2) breach of express warranty, (3) breach of implied
warranty, (4) negligence, and (5) strict liability. Plaintiff is a nonprofit
mutual benefit corporation composed of owners of condominium living units located
at 100 South Alameda Street, Los Angeles California (the “Property”). (Compl.,
¶ 1.) Plaintiff alleges that there are a number of deficiencies at the Property
due to renovations and repairs. (Compl., ¶ 22.) Among other allegations, Plaintiff
alleges that defendants negligently, carelessly, and in an unworkmanlike manner
performed work, labor, and/or services on the Property such that the Property
was reconstructed and repaired improperly, negligently, carelessly, and in an
unworkmanlike manner. (Compl., ¶ 51.) 
On February 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed an
amendment to the Complaint naming Mark Beamish Waterproofing, Inc. (“Beamish”)
in place of “Doe 1.” 
On December 4, 2019, Angelus
filed a Cross-Complaint against Moes 1-50. On February 5, 2021, Angelus filed
an amendment to the Cross-Complaint naming Beamish as “Moe 3.” 
On April 1, 2020, Colony
Insurance Company (“Colony”) filed a Complaint in Intervention on behalf of
Perennial. On May 9, 2022, Colony filed a First Amended Complaint in
Intervention on behalf of Perennial.  
On July 7, 2021, Beamish filed a
Cross-Complaint against Roes 1-50. On April 6, 2023, Beamish filed the
operative First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against Cross-Defendants
P’Rae’s General Contractors, Inc. dba DM Construction Services, Inc., Perennial,
DM Construction Service, Inc., and David Solomos. The FACC alleges causes of
action for 
(1) equitable
indemnity, (2) comparative contribution, (3) comparative fault, (4) breach of
third party beneficiary contract, and (5) express indemnity. 
            Beamish indicates that on or about
January 2024, Beamish and Plaintiff reached a settlement. (Le Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Beamish now moves for an order determining
that “the
settlement entered into between [Beamish] and [Plaintiff] was made in good
faith.” Beamish also moves for an order “[b]arring any
other joint tortfeasor from maintaining any present, further or future claims
against [Beamish] for implied indemnity, equitable indemnity, comparative
indemnity and/or contribution based on comparative negligence or fault in
accordance with Code of Civil Procedure § 877.6(c),”
and “[d]ismissing all complaints and/or cross-complaints for equitable
indemnity, implied indemnity, comparative indemnity, and/or contribution,
including claims that are derivative equitable indemnity claims, against [Beamish]…”
No opposition to the motion was filed. 
 
Discussion
“[Code
of Civil Procedure] Section 877.6 was enacted by
the Legislature in 1980 to establish a statutory procedure for determining if a
settlement by an alleged joint tortfeasor has been entered into in good faith
and to provide a bar to claims of other alleged joint tortfeasors for equitable
contribution or partial or comparative indemnity when good faith is shown.” (Irm Corp. v.
Carlson (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 94, 104.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(1) provides, in
relevant part, that, on noticed motion, “[a]ny party to an action in which it
is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a
contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of
a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more
alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 877.6, subd. (a)(1).) “The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have
the burden of proof on that issue.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
877.6, subd. (d).)
“A
determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar
any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the
settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or
partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or
comparative fault.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (c).)  
In Tech-Bilt, Inc.
v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985)
38 Cal.3d 488, 499, the California Supreme Court identified the following
nonexclusive factors courts are to consider in determining if a settlement is
in good faith under section 877.6: “a rough
approximation of plaintiffs’ total recovery and the settlor’s proportionate
liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds
among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in
settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.  Other relevant considerations include the financial
conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as well as the
existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the
interests of nonsettling defendants.” 
The evaluation of whether a settlement was made in good faith is
required to “be made on the basis of information available at the time of
settlement.” (Ibid.)  
Significantly, when the good faith nature of a
settlement is uncontested, the Court need not consider and weigh the Tech-Bilt factors. (City of Grand
Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.) “[W]hen no
one objects, the barebones motion which sets forth the ground of good faith,
accompanied by a declaration which sets forth a brief background of the case is
sufficient.” (Ibid.)
In support of the
motion, Beamish submits the declaration of its counsel. Beamish’s counsel sets
forth a brief background of the case. (Le Decl., ¶¶
2-5.) 
Beamish’s counsel
states that “[f]ollowing
multiple arms-length negotiations with mediator, Al Clarke, and informal
settlement discussions between counsel for Plaintiff and [Beamish], [Beamish]
and Plaintiff reached a settlement on or about January 2024.” (Le Decl., ¶ 8.)
Beamish’s counsel states that “[p]ursuant to the settlement agreement between [Beamish]
and Plaintiff, [Beamish], through its insurer, will pay Plaintiff the policy
limit of One Million dollars and Zero cents ($1,000,000.00) in full settlement
of all claims arising out of or potentially arising out of the Project and in a
cost of defense decision to relieve any and all indemnity/contribution
obligations.” (Le Decl., ¶ 9.)
In addition, Beamish’s counsel states that “[i]n consideration for [Beamish’s]
settlement payment of $1,000,000.00, Plaintiff agrees to dismiss its Complaint
with prejudice against [Beamish],” and that “[Beamish] and Plaintiff agree that
each party will bear its own fees and costs.” (Le Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) 
Beamish’s counsel
further states that “[t]he
parties to this settlement and their respective experts have inspected the
Property and conducted extensive discovery, including numerous fact witness
depositions. [Beamish] questions Plaintiff’s ability to prove negligence
against [Beamish]. [Beamish] asserts that it is not responsible in any manner
for any alleged defect or deficiency at the Property, and the only reason [Beamish]
has agreed to settle is to terminate expeditiously and economically its
involvement in this litigation and not because of any potential liability that
it faces. As such, this settlement figure exceeds [Beamish’s] proportionate
liability as no credible evidence exists that would result in liability being
assessed against [Beamish] for an amount greater than the settlement amount.”
(Le Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Beamish
asserts that “[b]ecause the settlement of $1,000,000 represents a rough
approximation, if not an overpayment, of [Beamish’s] proportionate share of
alleged comparative liability, the settlement amount is reasonable and within
the ballpark under Tech-Bilt.” (Mot. at p. 7:23-25.) 
The
Court finds that the unopposed motion describes the background
of this case, details the nature of the proposed settlement, and provides sufficient
reasoning as to why the settlement was reached in good faith. All indications
are that the settlement was reached as a result of arm’s length negotiations
between the settling parties. 
            Conclusion
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
grants Beamish’s motion for an order determining that the
settlement entered into between Beamish and Plaintiff was made in good faith. 
            The Court will sign the proposed
order submitted on March 14, 2024, subject to the Court changing the word “and”
after “forever bar” at page 2:9 of the proposed order to “any.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (c), “[a] determination by the
court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint
tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling
tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or
comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.” 
Beamish is ordered to provide notice of this
ruling.
