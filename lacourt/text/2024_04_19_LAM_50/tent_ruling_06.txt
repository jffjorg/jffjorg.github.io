  ORDER RE:
 
SUBARU OF
  AMERICA, INC.’S DEMURRER TO FIRST SIX CAUSES OF ACTION IN PLAINTIFFS’
  COMPLAINT; 
 
SUBARU OF
  AMERICA, INC.’S MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES 
 




 
On November 3,
2023, Plaintiffs Alexandra Spencer and Matthew Spencer (jointly, “Plaintiffs”)
filed this action against Defendants Subaru of America, Inc. and Subaru of
Sherman Oaks. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) violation of
subdivision (d) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (2) violation of subdivision (b) of Civil
Code section 1793.2,
(3) violation of
subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (4) breach of the implied
warranty of merchantability, (5) fraudulent inducement – concealment, (6)
violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and (7) negligent repair. 
On January 10,
2024, Subaru of America, Inc. (“SOA”) filed a demurrer to the first
six causes of action of the Complaint. On January 10, 2024, SOA also filed a motion to strike
Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages in the Complaint. No opposition to the
demurrer or motion to strike was filed. However, on April 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a First Amended Complaint. 
The Court notes
that “[b]ecause
there is but one complaint in a civil action…the filing of an amended complaint
moots a motion directed to a prior complaint…Thus, the filing of an amended
complaint renders moot a demurrer to the original complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477 [internal citations omitted].)

Accordingly, SOA’s demurrer to the
Complaint and motion to strike Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages in the Complaint are moot.
