And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has determined that Subaru of America, Inc.'s demurrer to the first six causes of action in the original Complaint and motion to strike Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages in the Complaint are moot, due to the filing of a First Amended Complaint on April 8, 2024. The Court cites the case of JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, which states that the filing of an amended complaint renders moot a demurrer to the original complaint. Therefore, the Court will deny both the demurrer and the motion to strike.
