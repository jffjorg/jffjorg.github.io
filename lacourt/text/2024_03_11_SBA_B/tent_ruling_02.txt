            The court considered the moving

RULING
            The Motion to Vacate and Enter
Different Judgment is denied.  
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiffs allege Defendant Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority is using Plaintiff’s
private property for public usage without compensation.  Plaintiffs allege Defendants Evan Rosenberg
and Alvin Kusumoto converted the property as employees of LACMTA.  Plaintiffs filed a complaint on February 18,
2022.  
            The operative complaint was the
Third Amended Complaint filed on October 13, 2023.  The TAC alleges Due Process Violation Enforce
Public Contract.  On January 4, 2024, the
court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the TAC without leave to amend.  On January 11, 2024, a judgment of dismissal
was entered in Defendants’ favor.  
            
LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP
§663
A
judgment or decree, when based upon a decision by the court, or the special
verdict of a jury, may, upon motion of the party aggrieved, be set aside and
vacated by the same court, and another and different judgment entered, for
either of the following causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of
the party and entitling the party to a different judgment:
1.
Incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision, not consistent with or not
supported by the facts; and in such case when the judgment is set aside, the
statement of decision shall be amended and corrected.
2.
A judgment or decree not consistent with or not supported by the special
verdict.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate per CCP §663 must be denied for several reasons:
·        
The motion was not served on Defendants.  Plaintiff was required to serve Defendants
with notice of this motion in conformity with CCP §1005.
·        
CCP §663 does not apply to orders sustaining
demurrers without leave to amend.  A
motion to vacate under section 663 may only be brought when “the trial judge
draws an incorrect legal conclusion or renders an erroneous judgment upon the
facts found by it to exist.” (County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5
Cal.3d 730, 738.) “A motion to vacate under [Code of Civil Procedure] section
663 is a remedy to be used when a trial court draws incorrect conclusions of
law or renders an erroneous judgment on the basis of uncontroverted evidence.”
(Plaza Hollister Ltd. Partnership v. County of San Benito (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 1, 14.)  “Applying these
principles, it is clear that a section 663 motion does not lie to vacate a
judgment following an erroneous ruling on a demurrer.  First, a demurrer tests only the sufficiency
of the pleadings. (§ 430.30.) There were no ‘conclusions of law’ to be
corrected from ‘uncontroverted evidence.’ 
Indeed, a ruling on a demurrer does not involve either admission of
evidence or findings of fact. Second, section 663 only ‘empowers a trial court,
on motion of ‘[a] party ... entitl[ed] ... to a different judgment’ from that
which has been entered, to vacate its judgment and enter ‘another and different
judgment.’”  (Payne v. Rader (2008)
167 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1575 (disapproved of on other grounds in Ryan
v. Rosenfeld (2017) 3 Cal.5th 124).)  
ORDER
            For
the aforesaid reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Judgment pursuant to CCP
§663 is DENIED.  
            The
clerk to give notice of ruling.
