```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the judgment and enter a different one. The motion was not served on the defendants, and CCP §663 does not apply to orders sustaining demurrers without leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant is using their private property for public usage without compensation, and the plaintiff filed a complaint and third amended complaint. The court sustained the defendant's demurrer and entered a judgment of dismissal. The plaintiff's motion to vacate is denied because it is not a proper remedy to correct an erroneous judgment on a demurrer.
