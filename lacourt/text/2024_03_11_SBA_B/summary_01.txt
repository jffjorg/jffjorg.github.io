And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a case involving a plaintiff, Jane Doe, who was sexually assaulted by Thomas Wallace while a student at Mira Costa High School, which is part of the Manhattan Beach Unified School District. The defendant, the school district, moves to compel a mental examination of Jane Doe, arguing that her mental and emotional health are directly relevant to her claims and that good cause exists to compel the examination. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the request is unduly delayed and will prejudice her, and that the terms of the examination are unreasonable.

The Judge grants the defendant's motion, but limits the examination to 4 hours and orders the defendant to provide results from the testing within 48 hours. The Judge also orders the plaintiff to appear for the mental examination on March 14, 2024 at 9:00 am within 75 miles of San Marcos, CA. The Judge finds that the defendant has established good cause to compel the mental examination, and that the plaintiff's objections to the scope and length of the exam are not sufficient to deny the request.
