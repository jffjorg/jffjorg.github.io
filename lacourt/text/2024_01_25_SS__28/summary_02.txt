And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motions filed by Defendant Jonathan Aguilar to compel responses to special and form interrogatories from Plaintiffs Derrell Hochstein and Rachel Hochstein. The judge grants the motions and orders the Plaintiffs to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the interrogatories without objections by February 23, 2024. The judge also denies Aguilar's requests for sanctions, as sanctions are only available when a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, which sets forth the rules for responding to interrogatories and the consequences of failing to do so.
