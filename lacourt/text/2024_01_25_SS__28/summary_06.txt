And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the petition to approve the compromise of Matthew Levine's claims. The petition was filed by Dolores Gadbury, the guardian ad litem of Matthew Levine, who is a minor. The petition seeks to approve a settlement agreement between West Hills Hospital and Barbara Levine, the widow of Robert F. Levine, who is the father of Matthew Levine. The settlement does not include any payment to Matthew Levine because he lacks standing to bring suit. The court previously ruled that Ryan Levine and Matthew Levine, as the decedent's grandsons, lacked standing to bring suit. The court finds that the parties do not need the court's authorization to resolve the adult plaintiffs' claims. The court orders that if the plaintiffs again submit a request to dismiss the action, the clerk may not deny the request based on the absence of a petition or expedited petition to approve a minor's compromise.
