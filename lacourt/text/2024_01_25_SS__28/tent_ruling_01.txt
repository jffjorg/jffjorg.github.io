  Case Number:  20STCV13591    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On April
7, 2020, Plaintiffs Raoul Renfroe (“Plaintiff”) and
Annora Renfroe filed this action against Defendants Golden
Motel, Wang’s Golden Enterprises, Inc., Hui Wang (“Hui Wang”), Joann Doe (“Joann
Doe”), and Does 1-20 for battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, fraudulent concealment, private nuisance, and public nuisance. 
On
August 1, 2023, Defendant Wang’s Golden Enterprises,
Inc. dba Golden Motel (“Defendant”) filed an answer. 
On November
20, 2023, the Court dismissed Hui Wang and Joann Doe without prejudice. 
On
December 11, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to special interrogatories and form interrogatories, to be heard on January 25,
2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
On
January 16, 2024, Defendant filed a
motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to requests for production of
documents, to be heard on January 25, 2024. 
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
Defendant
scheduled an IDC for December 18, 2023. 
Plaintiff did not appear at the IDC. 
The Court found that Defendant had complied with its IDC obligation. 
B.       Timeliness
of motion 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before
any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd, (c).) Failure to file a motion within this time period
constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to requests for
admission. 
On
December 11, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to the special interrogatories and form interrogatories.  On January 16, 2024, Defendant filed a motion
to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to the requests for production of
documents.  Plaintiff does not dispute
the timeliness of the motions. 
C.   Meet and
confer 
“A
motion to compel must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd.
(b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration
must state facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution
of each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Defendant
has provided meet and confer declarations. 
Plaintiff does not dispute the adequacy of Defendant’s meet and confer efforts. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
Defendant
has filed separate statements. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
“(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 provides: 
“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
“(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. 
“(c) If the responding party does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so
state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith
effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or
organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Attorney client privilege and work product doctrine 
“In
response to a motion to compel answers [citation], the burden is on the party
claiming a privilege to establish whatever preliminary facts are essential to
the claim.  [Citations.]  [¶] 
For example, upon asserting the attorney-client privilege, the client,
or the attorney in the client’s absence, must prove that the attorney-client
relationship existed when the communication was made.  Once this showing is made (typically through
declarations), the communications between the lawyer and client are presumed to
have been made in confidence. 
[Citations.] [¶]  Upon such
showing, the burden shifts to the party seeking discovery to disprove those
facts or to prove some applicable statutory exception (e.g., that the privilege
has been waived [citation]).”  (L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2023) ¶ 8:192, p. 8C-61.) 
Plaintiff
has not carried his burden of establishing the preliminary facts essential to
support his assertions of attorney-client and work product protection. 
B.  
Motion to
compel Plaintiff’s further responses to special interrogatories, set one 
Propounded:
August 25, 2023 Responses:   October
27, 2023 Motion filed: December 11, 2023
          Granted:       Numbers
1-19 (all)
          Defendant requests $2,560.00 in sanctions based on ten
hours of attorney time at a billing rate of $250.00 per hour and one $60.00
filing fee.  Defendant’s counsel spent
six hours preparing the motion papers and anticipated spending two hours to
review any opposition and prepare a reply and two hours to attend the hearing. 
          The motion is unopposed. 
The Court grants sanctions of $560.00 based on two hours of attorney
time and one filing fee. 
C.   Motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to form
interrogatories, set one 
          Granted: Numbers 1.0, 2.1-2.13, 4.1-4.2, 6.1-6.7, 7.1-7.3,
8.1-8.8, 9.1-9.2, 10.1-10.3, 11.1-11.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1-13.2, 14.1-14.2 (all) 
Defendant
should have filed separate motions to compel responses to the interrogatories: one motion to compel responses to the special interrogatories and one motion to
compel responses to the form interrogatories. 
The Court orders Defendant to pay the Court an additional $60 filing
fee. 
Defendant
requests $2,560.00 in sanctions based on ten hours of attorney time at a
billing rate of $250.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Defendant’s counsel spent six hours preparing
the motion papers and anticipated spending two hours to review any opposition
and prepare a reply and two hours to attend the hearing. 
The
motion is unopposed.  The Court grants
sanctions of $560.00 based on two hours of attorney time and one filing fee. 
D.   Motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to request
for production of documents 
On
December 11, 2023, Defendant electronically served its motion to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to requests for production of documents.  However, according to the date stamp on the
motion, Defendant did not file the motion until January 16, 2024.  The hearing was scheduled for January 25, 2024.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), requires that “[u]nless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.”  Because the moving papers were served
electronically, the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing was
increased by two court days.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) 
Here,
Defendant filed the motion seven court days before the January 25, 2024 hearing.  The Court therefore denies the motion for
insufficient notice.

Wang’s Golden Enterprises, Inc. dba Golden Motel’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Raoul Renfroe’s further responses to special interrogatories, set one, as set
forth above.  The Court orders Plaintiff
Raoul Renfroe to provide further verified code compliant responses to the
