And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. The City of Santa Monica (City) has moved to compel Plaintiff Daniel Reygosa to attend a mental examination by a neuropsychologist. The City argues that the examination is necessary to counter Plaintiff's assertions that present cognitive impairments are due to the incident of March 2021. Plaintiff opposes the motion, stating that he is not putting at issue or controversy any mental, cognitive, or emotional claim beyond the garden variety emotional distress accompanying his physical injuries, and he will not present expert testimony related to mental and emotional distress at trial.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff has stipulated that he is not making a claim for mental and emotional distress over and above that usually associated with the physical injuries he claims, and he will not present expert testimony at trial regarding this usual mental and emotional distress in support of his claim for damages. The Judge concludes that this stipulation satisfies the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320, subdivisions (b) and (c), and therefore, no exceptional circumstances exist which would support a decision to order a mental examination despite Plaintiff's stipulation. The Judge denies the City's motion to compel Plaintiff's attendance at a mental examination.
