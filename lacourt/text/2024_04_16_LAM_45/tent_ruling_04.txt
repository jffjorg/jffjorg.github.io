Motion to Quash Service of Process 
 
The Court has
considered the moving and opposition papers. No reply papers were filed. 
The motion is DENIED.

Background
            This
action arises from the breach of a month-to-month rental agreement for a
property located at 10523 Selkirk Lane, Los Angeles, CA 90077 (the “Property”).
On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff Thuong Luong (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Veronika Mikhaylova (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 100,
inclusive, alleging a single cause of action for breach of written contract. 
            A
proof of service was filed indicating that Defendant was served with the
summons and complaint by substituted service on September 5, 2023 at 10523
Selkirk Lane. (09/07/23 Proof of Service.) The proof of service is executed by registered
process server Daniel Flores. (09/07/23 Proof of Service.) The summons and
complaint were left with a John Doe, who is an occupant at 10523 Selkirk Lane,
35 years old, a Caucasian male, and who is 5”10 and 185 pounds. (09/07/23 Proof
of Service.) 
            On
October 12, 2023, Defendant filed and served the instant Motion to Quash
Service of Process. Defendant’s motion is made on the grounds that she has
never been served in compliance with the requirements of the California Code of
Civil Procedure and there is no basis for finding that this Court has
jurisdiction over her. 
            On
October 13, 2023, the Court denied Defendant’s request to waive court fees, and
requested that Defendant provide a copy of her most recent tax returns to the
Court. 
            On
November 1, 2023, the Court issued a Clerk’s Notice of Voiding of Filing which
indicates that Defendant’s motion to quash was voided due to: (1) the denial of
Defendant’s request to waive court fees; and (2) Defendant’s failure to make
the payment or request a hearing about court fee waiver order. Where a court
fee waiver application is denied and if the applicant “does not pay on time,
the clerk shall void the papers that were filed without payment of the court
fees and costs.” (Gov. Code, § 68634, subd. (g).) 
            On
March 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Substitution of Attorney form indicating that
she is now representing herself in pro per. 
            On
April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an opposition to Defendant’s motion
to quash. As of April 12, 2024, no reply papers have been filed. 
Legal
Standard
            “A
defendant who takes the position that the service of summons as made upon him
did not bring him within the jurisdiction of the court, may serve and file a
notice of motion to quash the service.” (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) “The effect of such notice is to place upon the plaintiff
the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is
the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Ibid.) “A defendant, on
or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time
that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion
. . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).) “[S]trict
compliance is not required.” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1436.) “In deciding whether service was valid, the
statutory provisions regarding service of process should be liberally construed
to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction of the court if actual notice has
been received by the defendant.” (Ibid.) “Thus, substantial compliance
is sufficient.” (Id. at p. 1437.) 
            In
order for substitute service to be valid, a copy of the summons and complaint
must be mailed “by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served
at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) “A plaintiff may serve individual defendants
through substitute service when they cannot be personally served with
reasonable diligence.” (Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742,
750.) “Two or three attempts to personally serve a defendant at a proper place
ordinarily qualifies as reasonable diligence.” (Ibid., internal
quotations omitted.) 
             “[T]he
filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that . . .
service was proper.” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co., supra,
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441.) “[A] registered process server’s declaration
establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the
facts stated in the declaration.” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) “[A] registered process server’s declaration of
service establishes a presumption that the facts stated in the declaration are
true.” (Rodriguez v. Cho, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th 742,
750.)  A court is “not required to accept . . . self-serving evidence
contradicting the process server’s declaration.” (Id. at p. 751.)  
Discussion 
            The Validity of Defendant’s Motion
to Quash  
            On its own motion, the Court may
“[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)
            As stated above, the Clerk of the
Court voided Defendant’s motion to quash. (11/01/23 Clerk’s Notice of Voiding
of Filing.) As such, the motion to quash is not an operative motion. Thus, the
Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to quash on such grounds. 
            Even if Defendant’s motion were not
void, the Court would have still denied Defendant’s motion to quash. In support
of the motion, Defendant declares that: she has not been contacted by anyone
with an attempt of service of the summons and she resided at the Property on
September 15, 2023. (Mikhaylova Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) Defendant states that she did
not have a toddler at the time of purported service in her household, she did
not have a male member in her household who could receive service on her
behalf, and she did not receive copies of the summons and complaint by mail.
(Mikhaylova Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.)  
            The Court would have found that
Defendant’s declaration was self-serving and was not sufficient to overcome the
presumption of proper service given that the summons and complaint was served
on Defendant by a registered process server. Thus, the Court would have
declined to accept Defendant’s declaration in support of the motion under Rodriguez
v. Cho, supra¸236 Cal.App.4th 742, 751. Plaintiff’s counsel,
Jacob H. Zadeh (“Zadeh”), has attested that Plaintiff was served via substitute
service on September 5, 2023. (Zadeh Decl., ¶ 6.) The proof of service shows
three attempts to personally serve Defendant with the summons and complaint.
(Zadeh Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) As such, the Court would have found that substitute
service was proper had Defendant’s motion been an operative pleading and not
void. 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Process. 
 
             
It is so
ordered.
