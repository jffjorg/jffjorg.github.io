(CCP § 425.16, subd. (b)(1))
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's special motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint, which arises from the defendant's protected activity of providing legal representation in an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, which creates an inference that the motion has merit. The court has disregarded the labeling of the claim and has examined the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff's cause of action to determine whether the anti-SLAPP statute applies. The court has found that the complaint arises from protected activity and that the plaintiff has failed to show a probability of prevailing on the merits. The special motion to strike is granted.
