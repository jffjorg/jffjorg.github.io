Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to quash the service of process is denied. The defendant claims that she was not served with the summons and complaint, but the judge finds that the service was proper. The judge notes that the defendant's declaration is self-serving and is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's counsel has attested that the defendant was served via substituted service on September 5, 2023. The judge finds that the service was valid and that the defendant's motion to quash is denied.
