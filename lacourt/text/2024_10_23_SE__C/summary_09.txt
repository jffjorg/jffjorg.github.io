The Judge, C Martinez, has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant First Class Vending, Inc.'s motion to consolidate five lawsuits brought by five former employees, including Valeria Duarte Martinez, Cyntia Marquez Duarte, Christian Marquez Duarte, Adrianna Guerrero, and Alfonse Marquez Duarte. The lawsuits were filed in March 2024 alleging race and national origin discrimination. The Judge finds that the cases involve common questions of law and fact, including the same operative facts of the Plaintiffs' termination by the Defendant on July 12, 2023, and the same parties and witnesses. The Judge notes that the standard is not identical claims, but common questions of law or fact. The Judge also notes that the Defendant can order a separate trial of any cause of action based on Code of Civil Procedure, section 1048, subdivision (b). The Judge orders that Case No. 24NWCV00917 be consolidated with the other four cases, with Case No. 24NWCV00917 acting as the lead case. The Judge vacates the dates in the other four cases and sets the dates already set in Case No. 24NWCV00917.
