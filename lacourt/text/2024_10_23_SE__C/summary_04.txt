And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On October 23, 2024, the court granted the defendants' ex parte application for an order staying the premises liability action pending determination of their motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The court based its decision on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4, which allows for a stay of the action if an application to arbitrate a controversy has been made and is still pending. The action is stayed until a determination is made on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action.
