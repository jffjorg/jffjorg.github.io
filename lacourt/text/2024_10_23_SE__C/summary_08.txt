And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for immediate relief due to an unlawful arrest. The denial was based on two reasons: first, the application was missing a declaration regarding notice, which is required by California Rule of Court 3.1204(b); and second, the court cannot summarily issue an order deeming the arrest unlawful on an ex parte basis without establishing exigency. The judge noted that the plaintiff is not foreclosed from seeking relief by filing a regularly noticed motion. Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiff had filed an application for leave to file a late claim for damages on October 22, 2024, but no hearing date had been scheduled.
