And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Green World Windows & Doors Corp. to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Whittier Apartment Homes, LLC. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for negligence, finding that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for negligence.

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the First Cause of Action for breach of contract, finding that Plaintiff has failed to allege that it is a third-party beneficiary to the subcontract agreement and that it has not alleged that Defendant breached the contract. The Court has granted leave to amend the First Cause of Action.

The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for declaratory relief, finding that the relief sought is duplicative of the breach of contract cause of action and that there is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved.

The Court has denied the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, finding that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of implied covenant.

The Court has set a hearing date of October 23, 2024, to consider the tentative ruling and to hear any further argument from the parties.
