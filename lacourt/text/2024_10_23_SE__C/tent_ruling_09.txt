Moving Party to
give NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiffs Valeria
Duarte Martinez, Cyntia Marquez Duarte, Christian Marquez Duarte, Adrianna
Guerrero, and Alfonse Marquez Duarte are former employees of Defendant First
Class Vending, Inc. (“Defendant”).  All
are members of the same family, and all were terminated by Defendant on the
same day in July 2023.  All filed suit
against Defendant on the same day in March 2024 alleging race and national
origin discrimination.  Defendant moves
to consolidate Valeria Duarte Martinez v. First Class Vending, Inc.
(24NWCV00917) (“the Subject Action”) with the four other cases for discovery,
pretrial motions, and trial. 
 
California Rule of Court, rule
3.350
states that a notice of motion to consolidate must: 
 
(A)
List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and
the names of their respective attorneys of record; 
 
(B)
Contain the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the
lowest numbered case shown first; and 
 
(C)
Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated. 
 
Defendant has met the above-stated procedural requirements.
Trial
courts may consolidate actions involving common questions of law or fact. (CCP
§1048.) Consolidating actions does not affect the rights of the parties.
Consolidation’s purpose is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid
procedural duplication, particularly in proof or issues common to both actions,
and avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together.
(Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.) Deciding a motion to
consolidate rests in the trial court’s sounds discretion and will not be
reversed except upon a clear abuse of discretion showing. (Feliner v.
Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.) Two types of consolidation are
available: “(a) When actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated
and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay. (b) The court, in furtherance of convenience or to
avoid prejudice, or when separate trial will be conducive to expedition and
economy, may order a sperate trial of any cause of action, including a cause of
action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any number
of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury….” (CCP
§1048.) 
Each
case presents its own facts and circumstances, but trial courts generally
consider the following factors: (1) the timeliness of the motion: whether
granting consolidation would delay the trial of any of the cases involved; (2)
complexity: whether joining the actions involved would make the trial too
confusing or complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice: whether consolidation would
adversely affect the rights of any party (State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d.428, 430-431.) In deciding a motion
consolidate, a court should weigh whether the common issues predominate over
the individual issues and whether any risks of jury confusion or prejudice to
the parties outweigh reducing time and expense that would result from the
consolidation. (Todd-Stenberg v. Shield (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 946, 978.)


In the moving papers, Defendant argues that all five actions should
be consolidated because they are based on the same set of underlying facts and
involve the same defendant and the same witnesses.  For example, the Complaint in the Subject
Action alleges: “On or about July 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s daughter Cintya Duarte,
on behalf of herself and her four family members, reported and complained to
another superior, Alex Zendejas (“Zendejas”), about her supervisor’s pervasive
harassment. Plaintiff was terminated the following day, along with her four
family members.” (Complaint by Valerie Duarte Martinez, ¶19.) This language is
repeated in each of the other four complaints, except for each Plaintiff’s
relation to Cintya Duarte (e.g., daughter, sister, sister-in-law).  
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues the claims are not identical because
Plaintiff Valeria Duarte sues for age discrimination while the other plaintiffs
do not. In addition, Plaintiff Christian Marquez Duarte filed a motion for
leave to amend complaint on September 11, 2024, to allege claims of sexual
harassment and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention against defendant
First Class Vending, Inc, and Yesenia Sanchez. Yesenia Sanchez is only a named
defendant in Plaintiff Christian Marquez Duarte’s case. Also, Plaintiff
Christian Marquez Duarte’s minor brother was subject to similar claims of
sexual harassment and he, too, filed a lawsuit. 
 
In reply, Defendant argues that the standard is not identical
claims, but common questions of law or fact. Defendant acknowledges that there
is a single difference between the five pleadings, i.e. Plaintiff Valeria
Duarte’s age discrimination cause of action. Defendant argues that the Court
can order a separate trial of any cause of action based on Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1048, subdivision (b). Defendant also argues that Plaintiff
Christan Marquez Duarte’s motion for leave to file amended complaint will not
be decided until June 10, 2025; thus, the new claims and new defendant are not
at issue or relevant to the instant motion.  Also, the complaint against Defendant by
Plaintiff Christian Marquez Duarte’s brother is not relevant because it was
filed after the instant motion. 
 
It is undisputed that all five cases involve the same operative
facts — Plaintiffs’ termination by Defendant on or about July 12, 2023. It is
also undisputed that the related cases involve the same parties and will likely
involve some or all of the same witnesses. In the interests of judicial
efficiency, the Court finds that the actions involve common questions of law
and fact, and they should be consolidated. Therefore, the Motion to Consolidate
is GRANTED. Issues of severance, bifurcation and any other related issues may
be raised by the parties at a later time, if necessary.
