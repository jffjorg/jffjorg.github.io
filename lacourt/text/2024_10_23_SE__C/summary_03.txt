And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, striking the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant, MED (DE), LLC, argued that the plaintiff, Briana Wingo, failed to obey the court's order compelling discovery responses issued on April 30, 2024. The plaintiff has delayed responding to discovery requests for more than one year and did not respond to the defendant's request, did not oppose the discovery motions, and did not oppose this motion. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests was willful and preceded by a history of abuse, and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and struck the plaintiff's complaint.
