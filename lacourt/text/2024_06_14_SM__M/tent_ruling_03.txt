Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section
2032.220 states in any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for
personal injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the
plaintiff, if both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive; and (2) The examination is conducted at a location
within 75 miles of the residence of the examinee. 
 
CCP section 2032.250 provides
that, when a plaintiff fails to respond to a demand, or refuses to submit to
the physical examination, the defendant may move for an order compelling a
response to the demand and compelling compliance with the request for an exam.
 
Analysis
 

Defendant Heather Rose Gross moves
to compel Plaintiff Jorie Esposito to submit to a physical examination
conducted by Steven Nagelberg, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon. Defendant
demonstrates proper service of a demand for physical examination of plaintiff.
(Bandhold Decl., Ex. D.) The examination was initially noticed for January 23,
2024. On January 3, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel notified defense counsel that Plaintiff
was not available for the January 23, 2024 examination and requested that the
examination be continued to early March 2024. (Bandhold Decl., ¶6, Ex. E.) Defense
counsel later proposed several dates in March 2024 for rescheduling plaintiff’s
examination, but plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond. (Bandhold Decl., ¶¶7-9,
Exs. F-G.) Defendant therefore unilaterally served a notice of continuance of
the examination for March 14, 2024. (Id., Ex. H.) Plaintiff again objected to
the exam on the grounds that plaintiff would be unavailable. (Ex. I.) Plaintiff
indicated that she was going to be in California in March, but unexpectedly
delayed her return to California “due to personal family reasons.” (Id.)
Following meet and confer efforts, the parties agreed to an examination set for
April 11, 2024. (Id., Ex. J.) Defendant served plaintiff with a notice of
second continuance of the demanded examination, which set the examination for
April 11, 2024. (Id., Ex. K.)
 
On March 7, 2024, plaintiff served
an objection to the April 11, 2024 examination, which contested several terms
and conditions of the examination but “agree[d] to allow a defense medical
examination to go forward on April 11, 2024 . . ..” (Id., Ex. L.) On March 11,
2024, the parties discussed the conditions during meet and confer efforts.
(Id., Ex. M.) On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel requested that the medical
examination be taken off calendar to accommodate their newly filed motion to be
relieved, and that Plaintiff would not be appearing at the exam. (Id., ¶¶ 15-16,
Ex. N.) Defense counsel refused to take the exam off calendar. (Id.) Plaintiff
failed to appear at the noticed exam. (Id. ¶ 17.) 
 
Plaintiff presents no substantive
reason why she failed to appear for her noticed and agreed-upon examination.
Plaintiff suggests that she could not make it to Los Angeles due to unspecified
family matters. The Court does not find this to be a sufficient or recognized
excuse for failing to attend a noticed examination. Even so, Plaintiff fails to
substantiate her purported inability to attend the exam. Plaintiff claims that
a court order is unnecessary, because she will submit to an exam without one. In
fact, Plaintiff’s course of conduct suggests the opposite—that she will
continue to refuse to attend the examination unless ordered.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to attend the examination as noticed in the motion. To
summarize, the examination will be conducted by Steven Nagelberg, M.D., on July
24, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., at 10800 Paramount Blvd. Suite 204A Downey, CA 90241.
 
Sanctions are mandatory, unless the
Court finds that plaintiff acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances which make the imposition of sanctions unjust. The record shows
that Plaintiff willfully failed to appear at her noticed and agreed-upon
examination. Therefore, sanctions are mandatory against Plaintiff. Accordingly,
sanctions are GRANTED in the noticed amount of $1,100.54 against Plaintiff only.
Plaintiff is to pay sanctions to defense counsel within 20 days.
