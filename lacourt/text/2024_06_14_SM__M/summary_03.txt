And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Heather Rose Gross, moves to compel the plaintiff, Jorie Esposito, to submit to a physical examination conducted by Dr. Steven Nagelberg. The defendant demonstrates proper service of the demand for physical examination. The examination was initially noticed for January 23, 2024, but was rescheduled several times due to the plaintiff's unavailability. On April 11, 2024, the plaintiff failed to appear at the noticed examination. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear was unjustified and grants the defendant's motion. The plaintiff is ordered to attend the examination as noticed in the motion, and the examination will be conducted on July 24, 2024. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,100.54 for willfully failing to appear at the noticed examination.
