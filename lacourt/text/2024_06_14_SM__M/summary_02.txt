English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The plaintiff argued that the court erred and abused its discretion by excluding evidence and testimony, including the reason for the police response to the plaintiff's home and arrest, the exclusion of the deposition testimony of Sergeant Chun, and the exclusion of Dr. Young's testimony. The Judge finds no error in allowing the evidence of why the officers were at the plaintiff's home into the record, and did not err by granting the defendants' motions in limine nos. 1 and 2 or excluding Dr. Young's testimony. The Judge also finds no error in excluding Sergeant Chun's deposition testimony. The motion is denied.
