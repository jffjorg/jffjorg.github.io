And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by PR2020, LLC seeking terminating, evidentiary, issue, and/or monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Tieng Uch for failing to comply with a discovery order. The judge noted that the discovery laws in California authorize a range of penalties for conduct amounting to "misuse of the discovery process." The judge concluded that Plaintiff Tieng Uch failed to comply with the discovery order and, since there was no opposition, will enter a terminating sanction, striking Plaintiff Tieng Uch from the Second Amended Complaint and entering default with respect to the Cross-Complaint.
