And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the petition by Country Oaks Partners, LLC and Sun-Mar Management Services, Inc. to compel binding arbitration and stay discovery in a wrongful death action. The petition was filed in response to a complaint filed by Mark Harrod against Country Oaks, Sun-Mar, and others. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement signed by Charles Logan with Harrod as legal representative or agent is not enforceable against Harrod. The judge also finds that Harrod was not effectively a party to the arbitration agreement and therefore cannot be compelled to arbitration. The judge rejects the argument that Harrod was Logan's agent by virtue of language in the arbitration provision and finds the declaration by Country Oaks Care Center's admission coordinator, Sandra Alvarado, to be insufficient.
