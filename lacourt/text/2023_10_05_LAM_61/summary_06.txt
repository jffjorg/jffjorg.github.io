Summary:

The case involves a defamation claim filed by Okorie Okorocha (Plaintiff) against Mary Ellen Attridge (Defendant) over emails exchanged on a listserv maintained by the San Diego Criminal Defense Bar Association. The emails were critical of a state expert witness and may have been perceived as insulting to public defenders. The court granted the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion, finding that the plaintiff's claims lacked legal and factual sufficiency. The court held that the allegedly defamatory statements were non-actionable opinions and that the plaintiff failed to prove special damages.
