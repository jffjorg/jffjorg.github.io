I.                  
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES
 
Parties to litigation must generally bear their own attorney’s fees,
unless they otherwise agree. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.) However, the
Song-Beverly Act provides for the award of attorneys’ fees to prevailing
plaintiffs as follows:
If the buyer prevails in an action under
this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.
(Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)
“It is well established that the determination of what constitutes
reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court,
whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of
discretion.”  (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.)  In exercising its discretion, the court
should consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation,
its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter,
the attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (See id.)  
In determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the
lodestar method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination . . . [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . . in the presentation of
the case.”  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano III).)  A reasonable
hourly rate must reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at p. 49.)  “Prevailing parties are compensated for hours reasonably spent on
fee-related issues.  A fee request that
appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial
court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 (Serrano
IV).)  The Court in Serrano IV also stated that fees
associated with preparing the motion to recover attorneys’ fees are
recoverable.  (See id. at p. 624.)
Plaintiff Andrew Murillo (Plaintiff) seeks $39,674.50 in attorney fees
plus $2,825.25 in costs and expenses, for a total request of $42,499.75. The
lodestar presented by Plaintiff consists of 76.7 hours of attorney work at
rates ranging from $400 to $625 per hour. (Motion at p. 15.) The motion
includes time records of attorney work performed on the case. (Barry Decl. Exh.
6.)
Defendant in opposition identifies the following charges as
objectionable and proposes reductions:
·        
Defendant
identifies 4.3 hours of work performed (and $2,581.80 in fees incurred) prior
to the filing of this Complaint, including 2.5 hours for work expended prior to
the representation of Plaintiff, for tasks including the research of
Plaintiff’s case, drafting the representation agreement, and updating Plaintiff
on the case. Defendant argues that no fees should be awarded for this work
(Opposition at p. 5);
·        
Defendant
notes that Plaintiff seeks fees for 22 hours and $10,462.50 in charges for
discovery work, including 2.1 hours to read Defendant’s discovery requests, 3.1
hours to draft template discovery requests, 3.0 hours to draft deposition
notices and subpoenas to four individuals and entities, 3.6 hours to draft
discovery responses consisting of templated objections, 5.6 hours to review
Defendant’s responses to deposition notices and objections; and 4.6 hours to
prepare templated meet-and-confer correspondence. (Opposition at pp. 6–7.) Defendant
proposes a total lodestar reduction of 17.7 hours and $8,417.30 (Ibid.);
·        
Defendant
argues that a charge of 1.3 hours and $590 for a preparing a “memo to file,”
evidently for the internal use of Plaintiff’s counsel, should not be permitted
(Opposition at p. 7);
·        
Defendant
argues that 5.2 hours and $2890.00 incurred for traveling to a show cause
hearing and the hearing on the present motion should not be compensated, as
traveling expenses are not customarily billed to clients (Opposition at p. 7);
·        
Defendant
argues that the 1.9 hours and $1,172.50 incurred in appearing for the
post-settlement show-cause hearing should be reduced, as the hearing could have
been avoided by timely filing of the present motion (Opposition at p. 7);
·        
Defendant
argues that the 10.9 hours and $5,304.50 charged in connection with the present
motion should be reduced to account for the largely templated nature of the
motion, and proposes a reduction of 6.9 hours and $3,434.50. (Opposition at pp.
7–8.)
Defendant’s proposed fee reductions amount to 37.3 hours and $19,086.10,
leaving a lodestar of $20,588.40 and 39.4 hours. (Opposition at p. 8.)
Defendant’s
objections to the fees identified are largely reasonable and persuasive. The
discovery and motion templates used by Plaintiff’s counsel ought to have
resulted in substantially lower fees than those claimed in the present motion
for discovery tasks and the present motion. And although charges for
pre-litigation activity may be compensable if reasonable (See Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 647, 656),
the court agrees with Defendant that the charge for 1.8 hours and $1,081.80 to
communicate with the client prior to the case filing, considered in conjunction
with the other charges for pre-filing investigation and correspondence, is not
properly compensable. The other pre-litigation costs appear reasonably
incurred, however.
Accordingly, the court adopts
34.8 hours and $17,586.10 of Defendant’s proposed reductions, leaving a fee
lodestar of 41.9 hours and $22,088.40.
Defendant also objects to certain costs and
expenses requests, including (1) a $550 charge for a court reporter fee for the
hearing on the present motion; (2) $150 for jury fees on a case that never went
to trial; and (3) $138.70 for mileage and travel. (Opposition at p. 8.) The
court agrees that these latter two costs can properly be deducted as not
reasonably necessary for the conduct of this litigation. The first may likewise
be reduced at present, but may be compensable if Plaintiff indeed incurs the fee
for a court reporter at the hearing in question.
The motion is therefore GRANTED as to $1,986.55 in
costs, subject to increase to $2,536.55 if a $550 charge is incurred to secure
a court reporter at the fees hearing.
