And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, has moved for summary judgment or adjudication on the plaintiff's first and second causes of action for breach of insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge has denied the motion, finding that there are triable issues of fact that prevent the adjudication of the plaintiff's claims. Specifically, the judge found that the defendant failed to show that the plaintiff failed to cooperate with the investigation and that the defendant's reliance on its expert report was unreasonable. The judge also found that triable issues exist as to whether the defendant acted in bad faith and whether it breached the policy by denying the plaintiff benefits owed.
