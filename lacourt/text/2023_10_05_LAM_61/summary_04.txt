  - "Fundamental to its determination . . . [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . . in the presentation of the case." (Serrano III)
  - "Prevailing parties are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues. A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether." (Serrano IV)
  - "The court agrees with Defendant that the charge for 1.8 hours and $1,081.80 to communicate with the client prior to the case filing, considered in conjunction with the other charges for pre-filing investigation and correspondence, is not properly compensable."
