And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispositive motion in a case brought by Ayrapetian, the plaintiff. The defendant objects to an declaration executed by Ayrapetian under penalty of perjury in Yerevan, Armenia, because it does not comply with California law. However, the judge finds that this procedural infirmity is easily cured and that the declaration is otherwise competent and relevant evidence. Therefore, the judge overrules the objection and will consider the declaration as evidence. The judge also notes that it is appropriate to allow the party to remedy procedural failings before granting dispositive relief.
