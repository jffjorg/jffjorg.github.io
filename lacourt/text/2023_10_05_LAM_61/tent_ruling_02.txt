Plaintiff disputes this fact by stating that Ayrapetian provided other
documents, but does not deny that the documents identified by Defendant were
not produced, or that Ayrapetian did not execute his sworn statement
transcript. (PUMF No. 29.)

Defendant objects to the Ayerpetian declaration as it is executed under penalty
of perjury in Yerevan Armenia, not “under the laws of the State of California,”
as required under Code of Civil Procedure § 2015.5, subd. (b).) This
evidentiary defect, however, is easily cured. When evidence material to a
dispositive motion fails for an easily rectified procedural reason, it is
appropriate for the court to allow the party an opportunity to remedy the
failings before granting dispositive relief. (See Ambriz v. Kelegian (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1519,
1527–28 [“The court should have allowed Ambriz's counsel to attempt to remedy
the perceived failings before ruling against Ambriz on a dispositive motion.”].)
Indeed, the relatively minor procedural infirmity that Defendant identifies
would not prevent this court from considering the declaration, as the testimony
is otherwise “evidence which is competent, relevant and not barred by a
substantive rule.” (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building
Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 947 [discussing evidence considerable in hearing
an anti-SLAPP motion].) The objection is therefore OVERRULED.
