And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Plaintiff Elia Diaz Ruiz's motion to vacate the dismissal entered on May 2, 2023. The dismissal was based on Plaintiff's failure to appear for a case management conference and subsequent OSC re: dismissal. Plaintiff's counsel, Joseph S. Park, has submitted two affidavits of fault explaining his attempts to appear for the hearings, including a technical issue with LA Court Connect and a wrong turn on the way to the courthouse.

However, the Judge finds that the repeated failures of Plaintiff's counsel to appear for hearings, including on Plaintiff's own motion to vacate dismissal, are not excusable. Despite this, the Judge has granted the motion because Plaintiff has demonstrated entitlement to mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 473, subdivision (b).

As a result, Plaintiff's counsel is directed to pay Defendant Victor Castro's fees in the amount of $1,855, which represent three hours of paralegal work and two hours of attorney work related to the prior motion.
