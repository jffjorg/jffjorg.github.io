             Defendant moves for summary
judgment. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Catiuscia
Toppi’s (“Plaintiff”) claim for medical malpractice against Defendant San
Gabriel Valley Medical Center (“Defendant” or “SGVMC”). Plaintiff filed her initial complaint on August 15, 2022.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
             
            Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings
in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact
necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.) “A party may
move for summary judgement in an action or proceeding if it is contented that
the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or
proceeding.” (Code of Civil Procedure section 473c subd. (a)(1).) “The motion for
summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code of Civil Procedures section
473c subd. (c).) 
 
A three-step analysis is employed in
ruling on motions for summary judgment. First, the court identifies the issues
framed by the pleadings. Next, the court determines, when the moving party is
the defendant, whether it has produced evidence showing one or more of the
elements of the cause of action cannot be established or there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. If the defendant does so, the burden shifts to
the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to
that cause of action or defense. (Kline v. Turner (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th
1369, 1373.) The court must “view the evidence in the light most
favorable to the opposing party and accept all inferences reasonably drawn
therefrom.”  (Ibid.; see also Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 384, 389 [Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”].)  
 
“A defendant moving for summary
judgment must show that one or more elements of the plaintiff's cause of action
cannot be established or that there is a complete defense. The defendant can
satisfy its burden by presenting evidence that negates an element of the cause
of action or evidence that the plaintiff does not possess and cannot
reasonably expect to obtain evidence needed to establish an essential element.
(Veera v. Banana Republic, LLC, (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 907, 914.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant moves for summary judgment of Plaintiff’s claim for medical
malpractice. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claim is barred by the statute
of limitations and that Plaintiff is unable to establish an element of her
claim for medical malpractice. 
 
To bring a medical malpractice
action, Plaintiff must establish: “ ‘(1) the duty of the professional to use
such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4)
actual loss or damage resulting from the professional’s negligence.’ ” (Borrayo
v. Avery, (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 304, 310.) 
 
            Plaintiff
alleges she was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease in November of 2020.
(Complaint ¶ 4.) She was referred to
Defendant in May of 2021 for outpatient treatment. (Id. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff
alleges that prior to presenting to Defendant for treatment, she received a
call with instructions. (Id. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff alleges that the staff
failed to mention that she should stop taking a blood thinner or aspirin. (Id.
¶ 9.)
 
            On April 26, 2021, Plaintiff was seen by Andrew Hurwitz,
M.D. (“Dr. Hurwitz”) who created a plan to proceed with an angiogram. (SSUF
I-2, Nos. 9-10.) On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff was seen by Ngoc Nguyen, M.D.
after she experienced palpitations and shortness of breath. (SSUF I-11, No.
11.) On May 7, 2021, Dr. Hurwitz advised Plaintiff to undergo an angiogram with
intervention. (SSUF I-2, No. 12.) On May 13, 2021, Plaintiff was informed a
nurse at SGVMC of her appointment time and that Plaintiff should not before the
procedure. (SSUF I-2, No. 13.) Plaintiff called Defendant between May 10 and
May 14 seeking instructions related to her medication. (SSUF I-2, No. 14.) A
nurse left a message on Plaintiff’s answering machine telling Plaintiff she
needed to stay on her medication. (SSUF I-2, No. 15.) 
 
            Plaintiff was admitted to SGVMC on May 14, 2021, and
Dennis H. Son, M.D. performed various procedures on Plaintiff. (SSUF I-2, No.
17.) Dr. Son performed further procedures on Plaintiff on the same day. (SSUF
I-20, No. 20.) On May 15, 2021, Plaintiff was observed by other doctors and
discharged. (SSUF I-2, Nos. 23-26.) On May 16, 2021, Plaintiff was admitted to
Methodist Hospital of Southern California’s Emergency Department for pain post
angiogram. (SSUF I-2, No. 27.) Magdi Alexander, M.D., saw Plaintiff and
performed a left lower leg fasciotomy. (SSUF I-2, No. 29.) Atia Shah, M.D.,
recommended Plaintiff be transferred to SGVMC for close monitoring, but
Plaintiff refused to be transferred to SGVMC. (SSUF I-2, Nos. 32-35.) 
 
Defendant first argues that
Plaintiff’s claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
340.5 provides, in part: “In an action for injury or death against a health care
provider based upon such person's alleged professional negligence, the time for
the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one
year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence
should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first.” “A plaintiff in a
medical malpractice action must satisfy the requirements of both the one-year
and the three-year limitations periods.” (Drexler v. Petersen (2016) 4
Cal.App.5th 1181, 1190. “The one-year limitations period, however, does not
begin to run until the plaintiff discovers both his or her injury and its
negligent cause.” (Ibid.) “The word ‘injury’ in section
340.5 ‘refer[s] to the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act
and not to the act itself.’ ” (Id. at p. 1189.) 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff discovered
her harm, including the actual injury and its purported negligent cause on May
16, 2021. On May 16, 2021, Plaintiff sought and obtained medical treatment
after her procedure at SGVMC. (SSUF I-2, Nos. 27-29.)
Plaintiff also testified that on May 16, 2021, she was informed at Methodist
Hospital that her injuries were attributed to her failure to cease the use of
blood thinners prior to the surgery. (SSUF I-1, No 2.) Further, Plaintiff
refused to be transferred to SGVMC. (SSUF I-2, Nos. 35.) In this case,
Plaintiff experienced both the purported injury of her operation at SGVMC and
learned of its alleged  negligent cause
on May 16, 2021. Thus, Plaintiff had until May 16, 2022, to bring her claim.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 364, subdivision (a), provides: “No action based
upon the health care provider's professional negligence may be commenced unless
the defendant has been given at least 90 days' prior notice of the intention to
commence the action.” Code of Civil Procedure section 364, subdivision (d), provides:
“If the notice is served within 90 days of the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, the time for the commencement of the action shall be
extended 90 days from the service of the notice.”
 
Plaintiff served her intent to sue
letter on SGVMC on May 12, 2022. (SSUF I-1, No. 3.) Thus, Plaintiff’s deadline
was extended by 90 days until August 10, 2022. However, Plaintiff’s complaint
was not filed until August 15, 2022. Plaintiff’s claim is thus barred by the
statute of limitations. 
 
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff
is unable to establish that it breached the standard of care or caused her
harm.
 
“California courts have
incorporated the expert evidence requirement into their standard for summary
judgment in medical malpractice cases. When a defendant moves for summary
judgment and supports his motion with expert declarations that his conduct fell
within the community standard of care, he is entitled to summary judgment
unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.” (Munro
v. Regents of University of California, (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-85.)
 
“In a medical malpractice action the
element of causation is satisfied when a plaintiff produces sufficient evidence
‘to allow the jury to infer that in the absence of the defendant's
negligence, there was a reasonable medical probability the
plaintiff would have obtained a better result.’” (Espinosa V. Little Co. of
Mary Hospital (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1304, 1314-15.) “[C]ausation must be
proven within a reasonable medical probability based upon competent expert
testimony.” (Dumas v. Cooney, (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1593, 1603.) The
summary judgment standard “is not satisfied by laconic expert declarations
which provide only an ultimate opinion, unsupported by reasoned explanation.”
(Kelley v. Trunk, (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 519, 525.)
 
            Defendant
submits the declaration of Kenneth W. Chin, MD, FACR, FSIR, a licensed
physician who is board certified in interventional radiology and diagnostic
radiology. (SSUF I-2 No. 36.) Dr. Chin opines that SGVMC’s medical care and
treatment of Plaintiff complied with the applicable standard of care. (SSUF
I-2, No. 37.) Dr. Chin opines that the nurse properly communicated with
Plaintiff and that it is ultimately Dr. Son’s role to be aware of Plaintiff’s
medication. (SSUF 1-2, Nos. 38-41.) Dr. Chin opines that Dr. Son complied with
the standard of care in his treatment of Plaintiff. (SSUF I-2, No. 44.) Dr.
Chin opines that allowing a patient taking Plaintiff’s prescribed amount of
blood thinner to undergo surgery is within the standard of care. (SSUF I-2, No.
45.)
 
            Dr.
Chin also opines that Dr. Son’s action did not, to a reasonable medical
probability, cause or contribute to Plaintiff’s injury. (SSUF I-3, Nos. 37-40.)

 
            Defendant
has met its burden of showing that Plaintiff is unable to establish that
Defendant breached the standard of care or caused Plaintiff’s harm. Plaintiff
failed to oppose this motion and has failed to raise a triable issue of fact.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
