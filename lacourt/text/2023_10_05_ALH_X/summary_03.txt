And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Ines L. Cruz. The judge has denied the defendant's motion as to the plaintiff's first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action. However, the judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the plaintiff's third cause of action for interference with expected inheritance. Additionally, the judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages.

The judge has also rejected the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's claims are untimely and that the doctrine of laches applies. The judge has found that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to the timeliness of her claims and that the defendant has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff's claims are untimely.

The judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claim for interference with expected inheritance fails because the plaintiff had no expected inheritance. The judge has found that the plaintiff was named the beneficiary of the Dana Point Property and that the property was sold in 2016, but that the plaintiff does not assert that she expected to inherit any of the Trust's assets other than the Dana Point Property.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a mixed bag, with some claims being dismissed and others being allowed to proceed to trial.
