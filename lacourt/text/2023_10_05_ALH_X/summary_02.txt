And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, San Gabriel Valley Medical Center, has moved for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Catiuscia Toppi, has failed to oppose the motion, and the court has found that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff is unable to establish that the defendant breached the standard of care or caused the plaintiff's harm.

The court has ruled that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations, as the plaintiff did not file her complaint until August 15, 2022, more than a year after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. The court has also ruled that the defendant's expert declarations, submitted by Dr. Kenneth W. Chin, demonstrate that the defendant's medical care and treatment of the plaintiff complied with the applicable standard of care, and that the defendant's actions did not cause the plaintiff's injury to a reasonable medical probability.

Therefore, the court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and the case will not proceed to trial.
