And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, San Gabriel Valley Medical Center, has moved for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Catiuscia Toppi, has failed to oppose the motion, and the court has found that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff is unable to establish that the defendant breached the standard of care or caused the plaintiff's harm.

The court has ruled that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations, as the plaintiff did not file her complaint until August 15, 2022, more than a year after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. The court has also ruled that the defendant's expert declarations, submitted by Dr. Kenneth W. Chin, demonstrate that the defendant's medical care and treatment of the plaintiff complied with the applicable standard of care, and that the defendant's actions did not cause the plaintiff's injury to a reasonable medical probability.

Therefore, the court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and the case will not proceed to trial.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in the case of Catiuscia Toppi v. San Gabriel Valley Medical Center. The plaintiff had filed a claim for medical malpractice against the defendant, alleging that the defendant's staff failed to inform her of the need to stop taking blood thinners before surgery, which led to her injury. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff was unable to establish that the defendant had breached the standard of care or caused her harm.

The judge found that the plaintiff had failed to file her complaint within the applicable statute of limitations, and therefore, her claim was barred. The judge also found that the defendant had met its burden of showing that the plaintiff was unable to establish that the defendant had breached the standard of care or caused her harm. The judge noted that the defendant had submitted expert declarations from a licensed physician who opined that the defendant's medical care and treatment of the plaintiff had complied with the applicable standard of care, and that the plaintiff had failed to raise a triable issue of fact.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case is dismissed.
