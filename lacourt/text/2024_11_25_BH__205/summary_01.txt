And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Paymentus Corporation's request for a default judgment against the City of Santa Monica. Paymentus seeks an injunction preventing the City from disclosing its trade secrets to a competitor who filed a public records request for the information. The City did not oppose Paymentus's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which was granted by the court. Paymentus then filed a Request for Entry of Default by the Clerk, which was served on the City and the competitor. Default was entered by the Clerk on June 4, 2024. The judge finds that Paymentus has complied with the requirements for a default judgment and grants the request for a default judgment.
