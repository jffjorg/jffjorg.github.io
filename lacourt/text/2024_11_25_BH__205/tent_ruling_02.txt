B.)   Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for all rent payable to Landlord from Tenant under the Lease.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶5-6; Ex. B.)   Beginning in February 2024, Tenant and Guarantors failed to pay rent due through March 2024, in violation of the Lease and Guaranty.  Plaintiff thereafter served on Guarantors and Tenant a “Ten (10) – Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit”.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶7; McGarrigle Decl., ¶5, Ex.
