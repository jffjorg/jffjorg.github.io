The initial hearing on the applications was held on November 13, 2024, but was continued to November 26, 2024 due to the Plaintiff's failure to file a reply that had not been properly reflected in the Court docket. As of today, there is still no reply reflected in the Court's docket. Therefore, the Court has adopted the tentative ruling issued on November 13, 2024 as its final ruling.
