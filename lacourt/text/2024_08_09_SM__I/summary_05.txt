And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion to compel further responses from the defendants. The motion is related to discovery requests, specifically form interrogatories 13.1 and 13.2, special interrogatory 12, and RFP 17. The judge finds that the defendants' objections to these requests are without merit, as there is no attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine does not apply. The judge also finds that the requests are narrowly tailored and the plaintiff's interest in the information outweighs any potential rights the defense may have. The judge is also awarding sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $3180, payable within 30 days. Additionally, the judge is awarding sanctions against the plaintiff and their counsel in the amount of $120, payable to the court. The judge is ordering the defendants to provide the discovery requests within 5 court days in the form of verified supplemental responses without objection.
