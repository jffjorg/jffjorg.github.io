And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery served on April 17, 2024, despite the parties agreeing on a due date. The defendant re-sent the discovery and the parties agreed on a new due date, but the plaintiff still failed to respond. The judge finds no justification for the failure to respond and grants the motion to compel. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses without objection (except for privilege) within 20 calendar days. The judge appreciates the defendant's show of good faith and encourages the plaintiff to do the same.
