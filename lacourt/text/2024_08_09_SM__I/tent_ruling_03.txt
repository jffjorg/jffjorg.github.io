 Case Number:  23SMCV05654    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  I The motions to compel are GRANTED.  Discovery was served on April 17, 2024 but no
responses were served.  When defense
counsel contacted plaintiff, plaintiff said that the discovery had not been
received.  Defendant re-sent the
discovery and the parties agreed on a due date. 
But no responses have been served up to the motion date and, to the best
of the court’s knowledge, not even to date. 
(Plaintiff also indicated that plaintiff would change venue, but that
seems neither here nor there.)  These
unopposed motions to compel follow.  The
court sees no justification for the failure to respond.  Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  Verified responses without objection other
than privilege are to be filed within 20 calendar days, including
documents.  Defendant, in a show of good
faith, has not sought sanctions.  The
court appreciates that courtesy; plaintiff should as well.
