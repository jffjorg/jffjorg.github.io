And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses to general form interrogatories and UD form interrogatories. The discovery was served on May 22, 2024, but the defendant failed to respond within the allowed time frame. Since there was no opposition to the motion, the court granted it. The plaintiff must serve verified responses without objection within 10 court days. The court also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1020 for the two motions combined. The sanctions are payable within 30 days and are imposed on the defendant, but not on their counsel. The court notes that some responses have been served, but they are not code compliant and must be replaced with compliant responses. The court also criticizes the defendant for not attempting to resolve the matter informally and suggests that a phone call might have resolved the problem.
