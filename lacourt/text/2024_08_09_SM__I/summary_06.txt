And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is inclined to deny the motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) as the evidence presented could support the jury's verdict, especially when viewed in the light most favorable to Rav-Noy. However, the Judge is more troubled by the new trial motion, which alleges jury misconduct. The Judge finds that there is substantial evidence of jury misconduct, including declarations from four jurors that they were influenced by personal dislike of Illulian and that they discussed how to respond to the court's questions during deliberations. The Judge also finds that some jurors looked up information about Illulian on their phones after the verdict, which is a violation of the court's instructions.

The Judge is reluctant to grant a new trial, but concludes that it is necessary due to the juror misconduct. The Judge orders a new trial, citing the need to ensure a fair and impartial verdict. The Judge also notes that the case may continue to be litigated for some time, and urges the parties to consider settling the case to avoid further expense and delay.
