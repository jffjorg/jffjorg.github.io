 Case Number:  24SMCV00828    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  I The motions to compel are GRANTED.  The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
amount of $1020 for the two motions combined. 
Sanctions are imposed upon defendant, but not counsel, and are payable
within 30 days.
 
This is a UD case. 
Plaintiff has moved to compel initial responses to general form
interrogatories and UD form interrogatories. 
The discovery was served on May 22, 2024, but no responses were received
in the shortened time allowed by law. 
There has been no opposition to the motion.  The court therefore GRANTS the motion.  Verified responses without objection will be
served within 10 court days.  The court
is aware that some responses have been served but plaintiff contends they are
not code compliant.  Defendant must serve
code compliant responses, accordingly, it is likely that what was served will
not suffice.  Plaintiff requests
sanctions of $510 for each motion (1 hour of work plus the filing fee.)  While sanctions are mandatory, the request
must be reasonable and necessary.  Here,
the court is unaware of any attempt to resolve the matter informally.  Indeed, a phone call might have resolved the
problem.  Had defendant served untimely
responses after the motion was filed, the court would have reduced the
sanctions awarded to $10 per motion on the ground that the motion was likely
unnecessary.  However, even with the
motion pending, defendant has done nothing, suggesting that an attempt to
resolve the matter informally would have been futile.  That said, the court would have been inclined
to reduce the request on the theory that these were easy motions and
essentially the same motion but the amount sought is very low.  The total time is two hours, which does not
strike the court as unreasonable.
