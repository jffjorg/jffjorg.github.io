And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff had failed to obtain entry of default within 10 days after the time for service has elapsed and had failed to file a default/default judgment. The court had granted the plaintiff continuances to file the default/default judgment, but the plaintiff failed to attend the April 18 hearing and the case was dismissed. The plaintiff's subsequent motions to vacate the dismissal were denied, including a previous motion on July 9, 2024, and a new motion on October 30, 2024, which was untimely. The court concludes that the plaintiff did not demonstrate any mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect leading to the dismissal and denies the motion accordingly.
