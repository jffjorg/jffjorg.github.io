Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiff's claims for intentional battery, negligent hiring, supervision, and training, and respondeat superior are meritless. The plaintiff had failed to file an opposition to the motion, and the court has deemed the plaintiff's requests for admissions as admitted against her. As a result, the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. The court has determined that the evidence presented by the defendants is sufficient to establish that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support her claims. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case will be dismissed.
