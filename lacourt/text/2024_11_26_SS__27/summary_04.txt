And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff Chloe Sanchez. The Defendant, County of Los Angeles, seeks to conduct a neuropsychological/mental examination with Dr. April Thames to evaluate the cognitive, psychological, and neurological aspects of Plaintiff's alleged damages resulting from a collision with a Sheriff's vehicle. The Judge finds that the Defendant has demonstrated good cause for the examination, as Plaintiff's allegations of ongoing symptoms and traumatic brain injury place her mental condition directly in controversy. The Judge orders Plaintiff to sit for the mental examination within 20 days and sets forth specific requirements for the examination, including the provision of a detailed written report and the allowance of audio recording.
