LASC
Case No. 22STCV19728
On
June 15, 2022, at 2:55 PM, Plaintiff Brandon Espinoza (“Espinoza”) filed Brandon
Espinoza v. Michael David Gottlieb, et al., LASC Case No.
22STCV19728 (the “Espinoza Action”) against Defendants Gottlieb, CLBR, and DOES
1-50, inclusive, alleging a single cause of action for negligence. 
On November 13, 2023, Defendant
Gottlieb filed an answer to the complaint.  

Also,
on November 13, 2023, Defendant and Cross-Complainant Gottlieb filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant Nelson Rojas and ROES 1-20, alleging
causes of action for: (1) Indemnity; and (2) Contribution. 
On November 29, 2023, Defendant CLBR
filed an answer to the complaint. 

On
December 15, 2023, Defendant Gottlieb filed a notice of related case, which
indicated that the Espinoza Action was related to the Rojas Action. 
On
January 23, 2024, the Espinoza Action and the Rojas Action were deemed related,
and the Espinoza Action was deemed the lead case. (See Register of
Actions in Case No. 22STCV19728.) 
On
April 24, 2024, Cross-Defendant Rojas filed an answer to the cross-complaint. 
The Motions to Consolidate and Subsequent Procedural History
On
October 29, 2024, in the Espinoza Action, Plaintiff Espinoza filed and served a
motion to consolidate and seeks an order consolidating the Espinoza Action and
the Rojas Action for all purposes. 
On
November 1, 2024, in the Rojas Action, Plaintiff Espinoza filed a motion to
consolidate. 
The
motions are substantively identical but for the caption of each motion. Both
motions request the same relief of consolidation of the Espinoza Action and the
Rojas Action. 
On
November 5, 2024, the Espinoza Action was reassigned to the Honorable Lee S.
Arian in Department 27 at Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. (11/05/24
Minute Order.) The Rojas Action was deemed the lead case. (11/05/24 Minute
Order.) 
Although
an opposition to the motion to consolidate was not filed in the Espinoza Action,
Defendants Gottlieb and CLBR filed an opposition in the Rojas Action. Thus, the
Court will treat the opposition filed in the Rojas Action as the operative
opposition brief concerning both motions to consolidate. 
Also,
given that Plaintiff Espinoza filed substantively identical motions in the Espinoza
Action and the Rojas Action, the Court will address the motions in this one
ruling. Thus, the Court’s order will apply to the motions to consolidate filed
in the Espinoza Action and the Rojas Action. 
As
of November 21, 2024, no reply brief has been filed in either action. Any reply
brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days prior
to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
“When actions involving a common
question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint
hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may
order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) “The court, in furtherance of convenience or to
avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and
economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause
of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any
number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of a trial by jury
required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United
States.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (b).) 
“Coordination of civil actions sharing
a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing all of the
actions . . . will promote the ends of justice taking into account whether the
common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to the
litigation; the convenience of the parties, witnesses, and counsel; the
relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel; the
efficient utilization; the calendar of the courts; the disadvantages of
duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders, or judgments; and, the likelihood
of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be
denied.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.1.)¿¿ 
There are two types of consolidation. (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.) There is “a
consolidation for purposes of trial only, where the two actions remain
otherwise separate; and a complete consolidation or consolidation for all
purposes, where the two actions are merged into a single proceeding under one
case number and result in only one verdict or set of findings and one
judgment.” (Ibid., citations omitted.)¿¿ 
“The purpose of consolidation is merely
to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure,
particularly in the proof of issues common to both actions.” (Estate of
Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485, citation omitted.) “A consolidation
of actions does not affect the rights of the parties.” (Ibid.)
Consolidation does not require identical causes of action in each case,
absolute identity of the parties, or identical allegations. (Ibid.)
Where common issues are present in two cases then consolidation is appropriate.
(Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
976, 978-79.)¿¿¿

A motion to consolidate “[i]s deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(2)(A).)
Moreover, a motion to consolidate “[m]ust be served on all attorneys of record
and all nonrepresented partes in all of the cases sought to be consolidated.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(2)(B).)¿¿ 
Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule
3.3(g)(1) provides that “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless they are in the
same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and
heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related in a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department.”
III.    DISCUSSION 
Issue No.1: Plaintiff Has Not Shown That Consolidation is
Appropriate   
Initially, the Court notes that neither
of Plaintiff Espinoza’s motions for consolidation were filed with any
declarations or evidence in support thereof.  “In law and motion practice, factual evidence
is supplied to the court by way of declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) Given the lack of
evidence to make a finding that consolidation is appropriate, the Court finds
that Plaintiff Espinoza has not shown that consolidation would prevent
duplication of procedure or promote judicial economy. 
Even more significantly, given the settlement
of the Espinoza Action, no consolidation is necessary.  Accordingly, the Motion is denied.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
The Court will discuss an appropriate
trial date with the parties. 
      Dated this 26th day of November 2024
