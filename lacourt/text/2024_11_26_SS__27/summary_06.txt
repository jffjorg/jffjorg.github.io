And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial for 60 days. The trial was previously scheduled for January 7, 2025, but the judge wants to give the plaintiff more time to comply with the court's discovery orders. The plaintiff had failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, and the judge wants to ensure that the plaintiff has ample time to comply before the new trial date. The new trial date is set for March 7, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The final status conference is continued to February 21, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.
