Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the two cases, 22STCV19728 and 22STCV19553, brought by Plaintiff Brandon Espinoza against Defendant Michael David Gottlieb, CLBR, LLC. The judge found that the Plaintiff has not shown that consolidation is appropriate, as there is no evidence to support the claim that consolidation would prevent duplication of procedure or promote judicial economy. Additionally, the judge noted that the settlement of the Espinoza Action (22STCV19728) makes consolidation unnecessary. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the denial and will discuss an appropriate trial date with the parties.
