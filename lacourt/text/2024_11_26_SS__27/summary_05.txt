As for the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian regarding motions to compel initial responses and requests for sanctions in the case of Walter Moore, et al. vs Enterprise Holdings, Inc., et al. The plaintiff, Walter Moore, failed to serve discovery responses despite multiple extensions granted by the defendant, Todd Karalla. The defendant moved to compel the initial responses and sought sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery requests. The judge found that the motions to compel are now moot since the responses have been served, but sanctions are still warranted due to the plaintiff's failure to meet deadlines and the defendant's incurred attorney fees. The judge granted sanctions in the amount of $2,500 to be paid by the plaintiff and their counsel within 20 days.
