CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV34329 ALEJANDRO CASTRO vs JOSE MORALES et
al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff 
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: DENIED
 
On September 17, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a complaint. On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed the proof of service
of summons. On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff appeared pro per at an Order to
Show Cause (OSC) hearing regarding dismissal for failure to enter
default/default judgment. The Court granted Plaintiff a continuance to file the
default/default judgment and set another OSC for January 18, 2024.
On January 18, 2024,
Plaintiff appeared at an OSC hearing regarding dismissal for failure to enter
default/default judgment. The Court granted Plaintiff another continuance to
file the default/default judgment, setting a subsequent OSC for April 18, 2024.
Plaintiff failed to attend the April 18 hearing. On that date, the Court
dismissed Plaintiff’s entire action, issuing a minute order that stated:
“After adequate notice
was given, no declaration was submitted showing cause why the case should not
be dismissed for failure to enter default and lack of prosecution. Plaintiff
has a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to ensure that a case is brought to
trial or other conclusion within statutory time constraints. (Hughes v.
Kimble (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 59, 70; CCP § 583.420(a)(2)(B).) California
Rules of Court, rule 3.110 requires Plaintiff to obtain entry of default within
10 days after the time for service has elapsed. As this case is over two years
old and no movement has been made to comply with the deadlines and timetable,
as well as the Court's orders, the Court exercises its discretion and dismisses
the complaint with prejudice.” (4/18/24 Minute Order.)
On July 9, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate, alleging that he mistakenly thought the
hearing was scheduled for April 19, 2024, and therefore failed to attend,
leading to the dismissal. On August 9, 2024, the Court denied the motion,
reasoning:
“[H]is failure to
attend is not the reason why the court dismissed the case on April 18, 2024.
The minute order states that the case was dismissed because Plaintiff ‘failed
to act with reasonable diligence.’ A proof of service was filed on March 7,
2023; however, as of April 18, 2024, more than a year later, no request for
default had been filed when Plaintiff is supposed to obtain entry of default
within 10 days after the time for service has elapsed. And, that failure
occurred despite two intervening court appearances to address the failure to
file a default/default judgment.”
The Court concluded
that Plaintiff did not demonstrate any mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect leading to the dismissal and denied the motion accordingly.
On October 30, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a new motion to vacate based on mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. However, the motion is untimely. The case was dismissed on
April 18, 2024, and the motion was filed on October 30, 2024, beyond the
six-month statutory deadline. To gain the statutory benefits of relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), a party or legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.)
Further, Plaintiff had
already filed a motion on July 9, 2024, seeking to vacate the dismissal based
on mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and the Court denied that
motion on August 9, 2024. This prior denial left Plaintiff with ample time to file
a renewed motion to vacate before the six-month deadline. However, no such
motion was filed within the statutory period. Accordingly, the present motion
is untimely and therefore denied.
