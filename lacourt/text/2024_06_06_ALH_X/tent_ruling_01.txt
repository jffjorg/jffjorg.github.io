LEGAL STANDARD
 
Relief from deemed admissions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300
provides in relevant part: “[t]he court may permit withdrawal or amendment of
an admission only if it determines that the admission was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who
obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that
party's action or defense on the merits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300, subd,
(b), emphasis added.) This includes “deemed admissions” ordered by the court
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(b), as well as admissions
expressly made by a party.  (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21
Cal.4th 973, 979.) The trial court’s discretion in ruling on a motion to
withdraw or amend an admission is not unlimited, but must be exercised in
conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner that serves the interests
of justice.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420.)
 
Compel discovery (interrogatories and
requests for production of document)
 
A court is permitted to intervene if a party fails to
timely serve responses to discovery requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290;
2031.300;¿Sinaiko¿Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants¿(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve a
timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the request,
including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a);¿Sinaiko¿Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th (“Sinaiko”), at 404.) The
propounding party may move the court for orders compelling responses to
interrogatories and demands for inspection. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(b),
2031.300(b);¿Sinaiko at 404.) 
  
If a propounding
party moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response, the court
shall impose monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to
interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c);¿Sinaiko at 404.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Relief from deemed admissions
 
On January 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s previous counsel
had a life-threatening health emergency requiring immediate heart surgery and
became unable to represent Plaintiff abruptly. (Declaration of Phillip R.
Geurts (“Geurts Decl.”) ¶¶ 5-7, 11; Declaration of Larry Finch (“Finch Decl.”)
¶ 6.) Plaintiff commenced a diligent search for new counsel, which was difficult
because the case is in the later stages of discovery. (Finch Decl.¶¶ 8-9.)
During the time Plaintiff was seeking new counsel, Defendant served on
Plaintiff’s ex-counsel two sets of discovery. (Geurts Decl.¶ 10; Finch Decl.¶
10.) None of these were served on Plaintiff, and service was rejected by Plaintiff’s
former counsel. (Geurts Decl.¶ 10; Finch Decl.¶ 11.) Plaintiff was not served
with any subsequent motions or other papers related to compelling those requests.
(Geurts Decl.¶ 10; Finch Decl.¶ 13.) Because Plaintiff had no knowledge or understanding
about how to respond to any of the Requests for Admission, Set One, or any of the
other discovery requests for that matter, Plaintiff failed to serve timely
responses. Plaintiff diligently sought new counsel, which he was able to secure
within about three months after abruptly losing its former attorney. (Finch Decl.¶ 17.)
 
Defendant will not be prejudiced by relieving Plaintiff of
the deemed admissions. A trial date has not been set. Allowing Plaintiff to
respond to the admissions serves the public policy in favor of deciding cases
on their merits.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
 
Compel discovery (interrogatories and
requests for production of document)
 
On February 15, 2024, Defendant MAC through the Ryu Law
Firm (Defendant MAC’s
prior
counsel), propounded Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff through the
Geurts Law Firm (Plaintiff’s former counsel) via electronic service. (See,
Porto Decl., Exhibits A, B, C and D.) On March 11, 2024, Defendant MAC through
counsel, Magarian & DiMercurio, APLC, propounded Form Interrogatories, Set
Two and Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, on
Plaintiff through the Geurts Law Firm (Plaintiff’s former counsel) via electronic
service. (See, Porto Decl., Exhibits E and F.) Plaintiff failed to timely
respond, and Defendant filed the instant motions. 
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff’s new
counsel declares that Plaintiff has since served the requested discovery
responses. (Chen Decl., ¶ 13.) Once a party has provided responses to the
discovery sought, the moving party’s motion is moot. (Sinaiko at
408-409.) Defendants did not deny this. If Defendants are unsatisfied with
Plaintiff’s discovery responses, they may file motions to compel further.
 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s five
motions to compel discovery are denied as MOOT.
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
requests sanctions in connection with its motions. The Court finds that the
circumstances rendering Plaintiff’s previous counsel unable to represent Plaintiff
“make the imposition of the sanction unjust” within the meaning of CCP sec.
2031.300(c). Plaintiff’s new counsel only substituted into this case on about
May 8, 2024. (Chen Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to be relieved from deemed admissions is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered
to respond to Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One, within 10 days.
 
            Defendant’s
motion to compel discovery and request for sanctions are DENIED.          
 
            Moving
Party to provide notice.
