And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge grants Plaintiff's motion to relieve itself of deemed admissions and orders Plaintiff to respond to Defendant's Request for Admissions, Set One, within 10 days. The Judge denies Defendant's motions to compel discovery and request for sanctions. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's previous counsel's life-threatening health emergency and Plaintiff's subsequent search for new counsel justify the relief. The Judge also finds that Defendant's motions are moot since Plaintiff has since served the requested discovery responses.
