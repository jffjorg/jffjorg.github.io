## Judge's Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case:** June Vantrimpont v. Blue Cross of California, et al. (Case Number: 22TRCV01329)

**Hearing Date:** September 28, 2023

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute between June Vantrimpont (Plaintiff) and Blue Cross of California (Defendant) regarding the denial of pre-authorization for a transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) procedure. 

**Plaintiff's Claims:**

* Breach of Contract
* Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
* Violation of Business & Professions Code Section 17200

**Judge's Rulings:**

* **Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One):** MOOTED due to Defendant providing supplemental responses.
* **Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demand for Discovery and Production (Set One):** GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. The Court narrowed the scope of discovery to be relevant to the TPVR procedure and a specific time period. 
* **Request for Sanctions:** GRANTED for $750 payable within 30 days.

**Key Points:**

* **Discovery Scope:** The Court limited the scope of discovery to documents specifically related to the TPVR procedure and a defined time period.
* **Sanctions:** Plaintiff's request for $2,000 in sanctions was reduced to $750 due to Defendant's substantial justification for some of their objections.
* **Protective Order:** The Court expects an agreed-upon protective order regarding the production of sensitive medical documents.

**Next Steps:**

* Oral argument will be held on the permissible scope of certain discovery requests. 
* Defendant must provide a verified supplemental response regarding the remaining discovery requests.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of June Vantrimpont v. Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross. The court grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the demand for discovery and production, Set One, in part. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $750.

The court finds that the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses are mooted in part, as the defendant has already served supplemental responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One. The court also finds that the defendant has substantial justification for its objections to the discovery requests, including overbreadth and relevancy objections.

The court orders the defendant to provide a verified supplemental written response to the discovery requests, including a privilege log as to any documents withheld from production on privilege grounds. The court also orders the defendant to produce non-privileged responsive documents in effect as of January 1, 2022, the time period when the defendant made the initial decision to deny the cardiologist's authorization request.

The court will consider oral argument as to the permissible scope of a more narrowly tailored production request at the next hearing. The court also seeks the plaintiff's concurrence in the defendant's request that any documents produced be subject to an agreed protective order.

The court's tentative ruling will be considered at the next hearing on October 14, 2023.
