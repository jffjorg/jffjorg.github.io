Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions filed by the plaintiff, June Vantrimpont, against Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross. The motions are: (1) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, (2) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demand for Discovery and Production, Set One, and (3) Request for Sanctions.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to demand for discovery and production in part, denying it in part. The judge also grants sanctions in the amount of $750, payable within 30 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' briefs and oral argument. The judge notes that the plaintiff has suffered from various cardiac conditions and has undergone several medical procedures. The judge also notes that the defendant has objected to the discovery requests, claiming they are overbroad and irrelevant.

The judge's ruling limits the scope of discovery to specific documents and time periods. The judge also orders the defendant to provide a verified supplemental written response and a privilege log.

The judge's ruling is guided by California Code of Civil Procedure and California Business and Professions Code.
