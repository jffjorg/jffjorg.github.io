**English Summary:**

The judge is considering a motion by Defendant Lehman to amend the judgment in a case involving the ownership of a property called the Longwood Property. The dispute stems from a series of events involving the previous owners, Fannie and Milton Gaines, and a third party, Joshua Tornberg.  

The Court of Appeal previously ordered Plaintiff Gaines (Milton Gaines, inheritor of the property) to pay a minimum amount of $567,955.96 to Defendant Lehman (which acquired a loan against the property). The Court of Appeal also ordered Plaintiff Gaines to pay delinquent taxes on the property. 

The judge is now deciding on the reasonable time for Plaintiff Gaines to pay this amount, given the Court of Appeal's order and the timeline of events. The judge finds that a reasonable time is sixty days from August 21, 2023, the date that the quiet title action (a separate lawsuit impacting the property) was dismissed. The judge will issue a Fifth Amended Judgment reflecting this decision.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to grant the motion to amend the judgment in part. The court orders the plaintiff, Milton Howard Gaines, to pay $557,955.96 plus post-judgment interest, accruing from September 16, 2020, on or before October 10, 2023. The court finds that the plaintiff's request for a 60-day extension is reasonable, given the purpose of the original extension was to provide time for the plaintiff to sell the Longwood Property to generate funds to make the payment. The court also finds that the defendant's suggestion of a one-day deadline is unreasonable. The court adheres to the earlier date of August 21, 2023, as the trigger for the 60-day payment period, as the lis pendens has no legal effect after the conclusion of litigation. The plaintiff must prepare, serve, and submit a proposed Fifth Amended Judgment consistent with the court's order by October 2, 2023.

Summary:
The case involves plaintiff Milton Howard Gaines and defendant Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. regarding the ownership of the Longwood Property. Previously, the Court of Appeal ordered Gaines to pay Lehman $567,955.96 plus post-judgment interest, but the payment deadline was remanded to the discretion of the trial court. The trial court had previously determined that a reasonable time for repayment was 60 days after the resolution of the quiet title action. The present motion is for an order entering a Fifth Amended Judgment that compels Gaines to cure the tax delinquency or pay the entire amount of principal and interest on the judgment. The only unresolved issue is the determination of a reasonable time within which Gaines has to pay the entire amount of the judgment. Defendant Lehman argues that one day is reasonable, while the opposition argues for a reasonable time of 60 days after the resolution of the quiet title action. The Court will adhere to the earlier date of August 21, 2023, and amend the judgment accordingly.
