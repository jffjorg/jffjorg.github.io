  CASE NO.: 19STCV42761
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO TRIFURCATE
  AS MOOT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 23, 2024



 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff
Hyung Koo filed a motion to trifurcate the trial in this action into (1) bench trial
on single enterprise theory, (2) bench trial on joint venture theory, and (3) jury
trial on negligence and other issues.
Plaintiff
asserts that a finding of single enterprise or joint venture (among Defendants Central
Fitness, Central Plaza LLC, Jamison Realty Advisors LLC, and Jamison Services Inc.)
will be binding for liability in Phase Three. 
(Motion at p. 8.)  However, on May
17, 2024, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Central Plaza LLC, Jamison
Realty Advisors LLC, and Jamison Services Inc. 
Accordingly, there is no longer a need for a bench trial on the single enterprise
or joint venture theories for these Defendants as they relate to Central
Fitness.
The
motion to trifurcate is DENIED AS MOOT.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
