And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to seal certain documents filed by Cross-Defendant Stacy Summers. The motion was filed in conjunction with a motion for summary judgment, which is scheduled for hearing on July 9, 2024. The court finds that the motion to seal does not meet the requirements for sealing, as the accompanying declaration does not contain sufficient facts to justify the sealing. Additionally, the documents were not properly lodged with the court, and the unredacted electronic copies were not provided. The court requires that all future motions that rely on confidential and/or lodged filings be accompanied by an unredacted version and lodged with the court.
