Here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, summary adjudication. The plaintiff had sought to establish that the defendant breached a commercial lease and sought to adjudicate certain affirmative defenses. However, the Court found that the plaintiff failed to establish new facts, circumstances, or changes in law supporting the issues reasserted in the summary judgment motion. The Court's previous denial of the plaintiff's prior motion for summary judgment was not addressed by the plaintiff in the present motion.
