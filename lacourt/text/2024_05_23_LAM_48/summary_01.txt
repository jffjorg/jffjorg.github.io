And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to bifurcate the trial, citing that the summary judgment granted in favor of some defendants renders the motion moot. The court notes that the plaintiff's intention was to bifurcate the trial into bench trials on single enterprise and joint venture theories, and a jury trial on negligence and other issues. However, since the court has already granted summary judgment in favor of some defendants, there is no longer a need for a bench trial on these theories. As a result, the motion to trifurcate is denied as moot.
