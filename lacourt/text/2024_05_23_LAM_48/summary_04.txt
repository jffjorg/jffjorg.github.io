And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to tax costs filed by Jennifer Bornooff, the plaintiff, against State Farm General Insurance Company, the defendant. The defendant had filed a section 998 offer, which was rejected by the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to obtain a more favorable judgment, and therefore, the defendant is entitled to its costs, including expert witness fees. The plaintiff challenged the reasonableness of the expert witness fees and the electronic filing fees. The court held that the expert witness fees were reasonable, as the defendant had prepared an expert witness in January 2024 for a March 18, 2024 trial date. The court also held that the electronic filing fees were recoverable, as the court required electronic filing. The motion to tax costs is denied.
