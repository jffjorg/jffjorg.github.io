[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 23, 2024



 
On
April 23, 2024, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant State Farm
General Insurance Company and against Plaintiff Jennifer Bornoff.
On
April 26, 2024, Defendant filed a memorandum of costs.  On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to
tax costs.  The Court entered judgment in
favor of Defendant on May 16, 2024.
If
a plaintiff rejects a defendant’s settlement offer under Code of Civil Procedure
section 998 and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff
may not recover their post-offer costs and must pay the defendant’s costs from the
time of the offer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 998,
subd. (c)(1).)  The court may also award the
defendant their reasonable costs for expert witnesses.  (Ibid.)
On
December 23, 2022, Defendant served a section 998 offer on Plaintiff.  (McKeon Decl., Ex. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond, and she did not obtain
a more favorable judgment.  (McKeon Decl.
¶ 2.)  Accordingly, Defendant is entitled
to its costs, including its expert fees.
Plaintiff
moves to tax the expert witness fees and some electronic filing fees.  “A ‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence of the propriety’ of the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party
challenging these costs to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th
1475, 1486 (Adams).)  “[I]f the correctness
of the memorandum is challenged either in whole or in part by the affidavit or other
evidence of the contesting party, the burden is then on the party claiming the costs
and disbursements to show that the items charged were for matters necessarily
relevant and material to the issues involved in the action.”  (Oak Grove School Dist. of Santa Clara County
v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 699.)
Plaintiff
argues that “Defendant will be unable to show any evidence that the expert was paid
for anything more than a convenient or beneficial purpose to their preparation of
the Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication.”  (Motion at p. 4.)  Plaintiff notes that “Defendant is the party that
served a request for expert disclosure and merely hired an expert in the event the
case went at trial.”  (Ibid.)  On January 22 and 23, 2024, Defendant’s “bad faith”
expert witness reviewed the insurance claim files for the two claims at issue in
this case and the two deposition transcripts of State Farm’s employees in preparation
for the trial, which was then scheduled for March 18, 2024.  (McKeon Decl. ¶ 5.)  On February 7, 2024, the parties stipulated to
a continuance of the trial date.  It was reasonable
for Defendant to prepare an expert witness in January 2024 for a March 18, 2024
trial date, and Defendant is entitled to its costs “actually incurred and reasonably
necessary in . . . preparation for trial.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (c)(1).)
Plaintiff
also argues that the electronic filing fees are “quite frankly excessive.”  (Motion at p. 4.)  In reply, Defendant provides invoices that support
the costs.  (McKeon Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.)  “Fees for the electronic filing or service of
documents through an electronic filing service provider” are recoverable if—as here—the
court requires electronic filing.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(14).)
The
motion to tax costs is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
