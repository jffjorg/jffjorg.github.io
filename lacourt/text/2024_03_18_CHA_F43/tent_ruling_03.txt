MOVING PARTY: Attorney
for Plaintiff William White
RESPONDING
PARTY: No response has been filed
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Attorney for Plaintiff
is requesting to be relieved as counsel
 
RULING: Motion
to be relieved as counsel is granted
 
G. Seth
Mitchell of The Barnes Firm, L.C., counsel of record for Plaintiff William
White, seeks to be relieved as counsel for that party.¿Counsel filed a motion
with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. Counsel’s declarations
states that there is a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which
makes continued representation impossible.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.
 
The Court does
note, however, that the proposed order (Form MC-053) contains outdated
information regarding future hearings. The Court will grant the motion on the
condition that counsel submits an updated proposed order that accurately
reflects any future hearing dates.
