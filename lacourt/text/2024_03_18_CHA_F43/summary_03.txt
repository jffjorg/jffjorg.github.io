In this tentative ruling, Judge [Judge's Name] grants the motion of G. Seth Mitchell, counsel for Plaintiff William White, to be relieved as counsel. Mitchell has filed a motion with the required forms (MC-051, MC-052, MC-053) and has submitted a declaration stating that there is a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making continued representation impossible. The court notes that there is no showing of prejudice and that Mitchell's motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. However, the court does note that the proposed order contains outdated information regarding future hearings and grants the motion on the condition that Mitchell submits an updated proposed order that accurately reflects any future hearing dates.
