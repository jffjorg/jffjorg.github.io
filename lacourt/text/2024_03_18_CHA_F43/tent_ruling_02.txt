SUMMARY OF ACTION 
On October 5, 2023, Petitioner Western Progressive, LLC
(“Petitioner”) filed a Petition and Declaration Regarding Unresolved Claims and
Deposit of Undistributed Surplus Proceeds of Trustee’s Sale (the “Petition”). The
Petition states that Petitioner is the trustee under the Deed of Trust as to
real property located at 11671 Goleta St., Sylmar, CA 91342 (the “Property”). (Petition,
¶¶ 1-2.) 
 
According to the Petition, the Deed of Trust was executed
by Betty Jean Cooper, an unmarried woman (“Cooper”) on February 22, 2006 as
trustor and such Deed of Trust was recorded on March 1, 2006. (Petition, ¶ 3.) The
Property was subject to a trustee’s sale that occurred on March 29, 2023, in
which the total sale price of the Property was $446,000.00. (Petition, ¶¶ 4-6.)
There are surplus proceeds available from the trustee’s sale available to
potential claimants in the amount of $151,637.97. (Petition, ¶ 7.) The Petition
indicates that Petitioner has received two written claims from potential
claimants but, after due diligence, has been unable to determine the priority
of the written claims received by the trustee as to the trustee’s sale surplus
proceeds. (Petition, ¶¶ 9-11.) The Petition states that $143,538.57 will be
deposited with the Court. (Petition, ¶ 16(h).) 
 
On October 6, 2023, the Court signed an order granting
the Petition which indicated that: (1) Petitioner’s request for fees and costs
in the amount of $7,664.40 was granted; and (2) Petitioner was ordered to
deposit the funds in the amount of $143,538.57 with the Court and the Clerk of
the Court shall accept the deposit. (10/06/23 Order.) The Court’s order also
stated that “[u]pon depositing the funds with the Court, [Petitioner] is
discharged of further responsibility for the disbursement of surplus funds in
accordance Civil Code §2924j(c), and is excused from participating in any
further proceedings and hearings in this matter.” (10/06/23 Order.) 
 
On October 31, 2023, the Court issued a Notice of Hearing
on Claims to Determine Disbursement of Surplus Funds on Deposit Pursuant to
Civil Code sections 2924j(c) and (d), and such hearing was set for January 10,
2024. 
 
On November 1, 2023, Claimant Jonathan Barnes (“Claimant”)
filed the instant unopposed Motion for Order of Disbursement of Funds. 
 
December 18, 2023, Claimant filed a Notice of Claim for
Surplus Funds, which is substantially similar to the instant motion. 
 
On January 10, 2024, the Court adopted its tentative
ruling without hearing, and denied Claimant’s Notice of Claim for Surplus Funds
without prejudice. (01/10/24 Minute Order.) The Court noted that Petitioner did
not request a hearing or file any proof of deposit of funds with the Court.
(01/10/24 Minute Order.) The Court ordered Petitioner to deposit the funds with
the Court and stated that “[u]pon the deposit of the funds and proof of receipt
of deposit to the court, Petitioner will be discharged, and the clerk will set the
hearing for disbursement of surplus funds.” (01/10/24 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.)
The Court stated that it acknowledged that the “claim for $175,834 [was] based
on unpaid judgments, but [Claimant] must wait for any and all clams pending the
hearing for disbursement.” (01/10/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court noted
that Claimant’s “ ‘motion’ . . . fail[ed] to address the liens of the other
parties.” (01/10/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On January 11, 2024, Claimant served a Notice of Ruling
as to the Court’s January 10, 2024 Order. Also, on January 11, 2024, this case
was reassigned from the Honorable Stephen P. Pfahler to the Honorable Gary I.
Micon sitting in Department F49 at Chatsworth Courthouse effective January 16,
2024. 
 
On January 18, 2024, Petitioner filed and served a Notice
of Completion of Deposit and Discharge, which indicates that Petitioner
deposited surplus funds in the amount of $143,538.57 with the Court on October
30, 2023. Also, on January 18, 2024, Petitioner filed and served a Notice of
Case Reassignment. 
 
On March 11, 2024, Claimant filed a reply brief as to the
motion and filed a request for judicial notice in support of the motion. 
 
ANALYSIS
Request for Judicial Notice: Claimant requests that the
Court take judicial notice of the Petition filed in this action by Petitioner. A
court may take judicial notice of the court record. (People v. Moore (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 168, 178.) “Although a court cannot take judicial notice of
hearsay allegations in a court record, it can take judicial notice of the truth
of facts asserted in documents such as orders, findings of fact and conclusions
of law, and judgments.” (Starr v. Ashbrook (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 999,
1014.) The request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Claimant submits a claim for $175,834.00 based on two prior
judgments in LASC Case No. 20STCV22826 (the “Underlying Action”). Claimant
argues that Cooper, along with her accomplice Christian Patrick Richards, Jr.
(“Richards”), committed and continues to commit wrongful acts against Claimant.
Claimant argues that Cooper transferred the Property to Richards on May 24,
2022 in order to avoid collection on a judgment involving Claimant and Cooper
in the Underlying Action. Claimant contends that there are only two
claimants—himself and Cooper—and all other liens have been satisfied. 
 
Civil Code § 2924k provides as follows:
 
(a) The trustee, or the clerk of the court upon order to the
clerk pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 2924j, shall distribute the
proceeds, or a portion of the proceeds, as the case may be, of the trustee’s
sale conducted pursuant to Section 2924h in the following order of priority:
 
(1) To the costs and expenses of exercising the power of
sale and of sale, including the payment of the trustee’s fees and attorney’s
fees permitted pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 2924d and subdivision (b)
of this section.
 
(2) To the payment of the obligations secured by the deed of
trust or mortgage which is the subject of the trustee’s sale.
 
(3) To satisfy the outstanding balance of obligations
secured by any junior liens or encumbrances in the order of their priority. 
 
(4) To the trustor or the trustor’s successor in interest.
In the event the property is sold or transferred to another, to the vested
owner of record at the time of the trustee’s sale. 
 
(b) A trustee may charge costs and expenses incurred for
such items as mailing and a reasonable fee for services rendered in connection
with the distribution of proceeds from a trustee’s sale, including, but not
limited to, the investigation of priority and validity of claims and the
disbursement of funds. If the fee charged for services rendered pursuant to
this subdivision does not exceed one hundred dollars ($100), or one hundred
twenty-five dollars ($125) where there are obligations specified in paragraph
(3) of subdivision (a), the fee is conclusively presumed to be reasonable.
 
(Civ. Code, § 2924k.) 
 
In support of the motion, Claimant presents the declaration
of his counsel, Harold Greenberg (“Greenberg”). Greenberg states that, on June
17, 2020, his law firm filed the Underlying Action on behalf of Claimant which
names Cooper as a Defendant. (Greenberg Decl., ¶ 3.) Greenberg declares that,
on July 6, 2022 and August 5, 2022, two Abstracts of Judgment were recorded on
behalf of Claimant in the amount of $25,000.00 and $150,834.00. (Greenberg
Decl., ¶ 4; Exhs. A-B.) 
 
Initially, the Court finds that Claimant’s citations to Estate
of Grigsby (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 611 and Estate of Mitchell (1999)
76 Cal.App.4th 1378 are inapposite as neither case addressed the issue of
disbursement of surplus funds in the context of Civil Code § 2924. 
 
Moreover, the Court finds that the declaration of counsel is
insufficient to warrant disbursement of funds. “In law and motion practice,
factual evidence is supplied to the court by way of declarations.” (Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)
Here, the declaration of Greenberg neither addresses the liens of the other
parties nor articulates that Claimant is entitled to the funds pursuant to
Civil Code § 2924k. Greenberg has not stated whether: (1) the costs and expenses
of exercising the power of sale; or (2) the payment of obligations secured by
the deed of trust have been paid. While the Court has taken judicial notice of
the Petition and its accompanying attachments, the Court does not take judicial
notice of hearsay allegations in its records under Starr v. Ashbrook, supra,
87 Cal.App.5th 999, 1014. The Petition and its attachment are hearsay. Although
his motion is unopposed, Claimant has not presented sufficient evidence to
warrant his request for disbursement of funds. 
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
