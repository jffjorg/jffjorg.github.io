SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Solomon Perkins alleges that on February 13, 2020, he was a seven-year-old
special needs student at Tesoro Del Valle Elementary School (the School), which
was governed by Defendant Saugus Union School District (the District).
According to the complaint, a fellow classmate named Tobin reported to a school
staff member on campus that Plaintiff was carrying a gun in his backpack.
Plaintiff alleges that he instead told Tobin he had a “Nerf-Slingshot gun” with
him, not an actual gun.
 
According
to School Principal Gina Nolte, Tobin and another student claimed that
Plaintiff said he had a gun and planned to kill everyone except the other
student. Although Plaintiff denies making those statements, he does not dispute
that those two students conveyed those remarks to Nolte and other School
employees.
 
Plaintiff
then alleges that his backpack was searched by Nolte, who found neither an
actual nor toy gun. Even so, he alleges, Nolte reported the alleged threat to
defendant Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) and the “mental health
department.” According to the complaint, the mental health department
“attempted to commit Plaintiff.”
 
Plaintiff
also alleges that his mother, Thea Perkins, was contacted by the School and
came to the School campus, but only after sheriff’s deputies, including defendant
Ernest Avila (Avila), had interrogated him. No other adult acting on
Plaintiff’s behalf was present. After his mother arrived, Plaintiff alleges
that they were detained there until armed deputies escorted them off campus.
 
On
November 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed his original complaint with ten causes of
action. On October 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed an eleven cause of action First Amended
Complaint alleging the following: (1) Negligence; (2) Negligent Supervision,
Training and/or Retention; (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;
(4) Violation of California Education Code §§ 200, 201, 220 and 260 –
Discrimination on the Basis of Disability; (5) Violation of Equal Protection
Clause of the California Constitution; (6) False Imprisonment; (7) Violation of
Americans with Disability Act; (8) Violation of California Government Code
section 11135 – Discrimination Based on Disability; (9) Violation of 42 USC
section 1983 – Violation of the Equal Protection Clause; (10) Violation of 42
USC section 1983 – Deprivation of Civil Rights; and (11) Violation of 42 USC
section 1983 –Monell Violations. 
 
On
February 15, 2023, defendants County of Los Angeles and Avila initially filed
their motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication.
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed his opposition. Thereafter, on July 7, 2023, defendants
County of Los Angeles and Avila filed their reply. This matter was initially
set to be heard on July 12, 2023 in Department F51 in the Chatsworth
Courthouse, but it was continued due to the court’s unavailability. On July 26,
2023, Hon. Andrew E. Cooper recused himself from the case. Ultimately, this
action was assigned to Department F49. (See July 26, 2023 Minute Order re:
Assignment.)
 
On
January 24, 2024, defendants County of Los Angeles and Avila filed the instant
motion for summary judgment. It is noted that this filing is identical to the
one submitted on February 15, 2023. In light of this, the court shall consider
the original briefings that had been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants
County of Los Angeles and Avila (hereinafter “Defendants”) move for summary
adjudication on the first, tenth, and eleventh causes of action for negligence,
deprivation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (unlawful detention), and deprivation
of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Monell violations). Defendants
contend that they were permitted to interview Plaintiff without parental
consent or presence, there was no constitutional violation of Plaintiff’s
rights, and are protected by statutory immunity and qualified immunity. In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that he was in Defendants’ custody when they
violated his fourth amendment rights, and that Defendants are not entitled to
any form of immunity.
 
SUMMARY
JUDGMENT STANDARDS
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(CCP § 437c(p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 

 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also CCP § 437c(c).) “An issue of fact can
only be created by a conflict in the evidence. 
It is not created by speculation, conjecture, imagination or guesswork.”
(Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
As
a preliminary matter, Plaintiff has voluntarily agreed to dismiss the eleventh
cause of action against defendant County of Los Angeles. (Opposition at pg. 8.)
Thus, Plaintiff concedes that summary adjudication should granted as to this
cause of action. Accordingly, the court grants summary adjudication as to the
eleventh cause of action.
 
A.   
Whether
there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff fourth
amendment rights were violated.
 
Defendants
first move for summary adjudication on the first and tenth causes of action on
the ground that there is no triable issue of material fact that they violated
Plaintiff’s fourth amendment rights. In support of their position, Defendants
rely on two arguments. First, they assert that Plaintiff was not in the custody
of the LASD, likening the event to a Terry stop.  (Motion at pp. 9-10.) Second, they argue that
Plaintiff was detained by the School, and as a result, Defendants were
permitted to question Plaintiff without the presence of his mother. (Motion at
pp. 10-11.)
 
As
framed by the pleadings, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants were negligent
and violated his civil rights by unlawfully detaining him for a prolonged
period of time without reasonable suspicion and interrogating without his
mother present or another advocate. (FAC ¶¶ 33-35, 89.)
 
“[N]ot
all seizures are unconstitutional: only those that are unreasonable.” (Williams
v. City. of San Diego (2021) 523 F.Supp.3d 1183, 1195.) “[T]he ultimate test of a seizure's reasonableness entails
a balancing of the governmental interest which justifies the intrusion and the
level of intrusion into the privacy of the individual.”  (Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan (9th
Cir. 1996) 92 F.3d 1486, 1496.) “A detention is reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable
facts that, considered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide
some objective manifestation that the person detained may be involved in
criminal activity.” (People v. Souza (1994) 9 Cal.4th 224, 231 (Souza).)
 
In
support of their burden, Defendants present the following evidence. On February
13, 2020, Plaintiff’s teacher reported to Nolte that Plaintiff made a threat to
“shoot up” the school.” (UMF No. 1; RJN, Exh. 3, Nolte Decl. ¶¶ 16-21.) Nolte
spoke with students Tobin Ponec and a classmate named Karen, corroborating the
threat. (UMF No. 2; RJN Exh. 2, Quiller Decl, citing the Deposition of Tobin
Ponec at pp. 15:12-20, 19:17-20:14, 20:25-21:7.) Plaintiff communicated this
threat to school officials as well. (UMF No. 3; RJN Exh. 2, Quiller Decl,
citing the Deposition of Tobin Ponec at pp. 15:12-20, 19:17-20:14, 20:25-21:7;
RNJ, Exh. 3, Nolte Decl. ¶ 18.) LASD was contacted by school officials
regarding the threat conveyed by Plaintiff and arrived at the School to
investigate the threats of gun violence. (UMF Nos. 4-5; RJN Exh. 3, Nolte Decl.
¶¶ 20-21, 25-29; RJN Exh. 2 citing Exhibit E.) 
 
By
the time LASD arrived at the School, Plaintiff had been placed in the custody
of school officials. (UMF Nos. 6, 14; RJN, Exh. 3 Nolte Decl. ¶¶ 25-32.) LASD
requested Plaintiff’s mother to report to the School, but she initially refused
to do so. (UMF Nos. 7, 15, 20; RJN, Exh. 3, Nolte Decl. ¶¶ 25-29.) Defendants
had reasonable suspicion that there was a potential threat of gun violence
because it was reported Plaintiff wanted to cause bodily harm to others and had
possession of a gun. (UMF Nos. 13, 17; RJN Exh. 2, Quiller Decl. citing the
Deposition of Tobin Ponec at pp. 15:12-20, 19:17-20:14, 20:25-21:7; RNJ, Exh.
3, Nolte Decl. ¶¶ 18, 20-21.) It was further reported by school officials that
Plaintiff expressed self-injurious ideations. (UMF No. 18; RJN Exh. 3, Nolte
Decl. ¶¶ 31-32, 34.) Because of Plaintiff’s age, he could not be released and
needed his mother to be present. (UMF No. 19; Nolte Decl. ¶¶ 25-29.) When
Plaintiff’s mother eventually arrived, she refused to submit Plaintiff to a
mental health evaluation and proceeded to take him home. (UMF No. 21; RJN, Exh.
3 Nolte Decl. ¶¶ 31-32, 34.)
 
Based
on this evidence, the Court finds that Defendants have met their burden in
establishing that there are no triable issues of material fact that their
conduct violated Plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights. While Defendants did not
initial seize Plaintiff from his classroom, it is evident that they continued
Defendant’s detention. Thus, Plaintiff was in the custody of the Defendants,
and as a result, it must be shown that the detention was reasonable in light of
the totality of circumstances. (Souza, supra, 9 Cal.4th at 231.)
Furthermore, such reasonableness is determined
by “the
gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the
seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with
individual liberty.” (Bernal v. Sacramento County Sheriff Department
(E.D. Cal. 2022) 598 F.Supp.3d 898, 904 (quoting Brown v. Texas (1979)
443 U.S. 47, 51.) Defendants were presented with a situation where Plaintiff
purportedly made a gun threat while at school, and as a result, a temporary
detention was necessary in order for Defendants to conduct an investigation for
the safety of the School and its students. (See Stokes v. Faber (2021)
522 F.Supp.3d 225, 235 [determining that a warrantless arrest of a potential
school shooter was reasonable].) Furthermore, the evidence shows that the
length of the detention was not unreasonable because Plaintiff could not be
released alone due to his age. (UMF No. 19.) Therefore, because Defendants have
met their burden on summary judgment, the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to
show that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether Defendants’
detention of Plaintiff was unreasonable. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff presents the following evidence. At the time of the
incident Plaintiff was seven years old with special needs and in the second
grade. (PUMF Nos. 1-2; Solomon Perkins Depo at pp. 13:6-10, 31:14-15; Thea
Marie Perkins Depo, Vol. I at pp. 24:18-21, 35:4-12.) Due to Plaintiff’s
special needs, he requires daily assistance with the aid of a paraprofessional,
but during the questioning, his paraprofessional was not present with
Plaintiff. (PUMF Nos. 36-37; Thea Marie Perkins Depo, Vol. I at pp. 24:18-21,
35:4-12, 43:15-23; Exh. 4, February 13, 2020 Letter from Paraprofessional Aide
Lily.) He rejects the notion that he made a threat to shoot anyone at the
School and indicates that he merely told classmates that he received a
Spider-Man themed Nerf gun as a Christmas gift. (PUMF Nos. 4-5, Solomon Perkins
Depo at pp. 30:19-31:7, 34:17-23, 57:13-15.) 
 
Moreover,
Plaintiff asserts that Tobin Ponec spread the rumor that Plaintiff possessed a
gun on campus and that he has a history of bullying Plaintiff and spreading
rumors about him. (PUMF Nos. 6-11; Solomon Perkins Depo at pp. 26:5-20,
30:19-31:7, 37:23-38:12; Thea Marie Perkins, Vol. I, at pp. 25:11-15,
27:28-28:5; Thea Marie Perkins, Vol. II at pp. 135:8-17.) Plaintiff’s mother
repeatedly wrote to school officials regarding the bullying Perkins encountered
from Tobin Ponec, but Nolte did not take any action to address the bullying.
(PUMF Nos. 15-17; Thea Marie Perkins, Vol. I, at pp. 25:16-27:22.) After the
report had been made, Plaintiff’s backpack was searched, and no weapon was
found. (PUMF No. 19; Thea Marie Perkins Depo, Vol. I at pg. 35:21-23.) When
LASD arrived, defendant Avila was aware that no weapon was found, but he
conducted another fruitless search of Plaintiff’s backpack. (PUMF Nos. 24-25;
Exh. 5, LASD’s Incident Report, dated February 13, 2020. Plaintiff was detained
for the remainder of the school day. (PUMF Nos. 27; Thea Marie Perkins, Vol. II
at pg. 99:18-100:9; Exh. 5  LASD’s
Incident Report, dated February 13, 2020.)
 
Under
the circumstances, the court finds that Plaintiff has not presented sufficient
evidence to show that there is a triable issue of material fact that
Defendant’s detention of Plaintiff was not reasonable. The court understands
the general concerns that are raised when there is a threat of gun violence at
a school, and the court reasons that the detention of a suspected individual
must still be reasonable in light of the circumstances that are present.
Plaintiff’s evidence suggests that the purported gun threat was made by another
student who has a history of bullying Plaintiff and starting rumors about him.  However, based on the police report submitted
in the opposition, Plaintiff admitted to making the threat of shooting everyone
in his class except for certain individuals, but he claimed he was not serious.
(Plaintiff’s Compendium of Evidence, Exh. 5.) Moreover, while Plaintiff opposes
the instant motion for summary judgment by disputing having ever made the
alleged threat, he does not dispute that the alleged threats and other
concerning remarks were conveyed to law enforcement by others. In consideration
of these facts, it is not unreasonable for a responding officer to continue to
operate under the impression that the threat of a school shooting is real as it
is not something to joke about. (Stokes, supra, 522 F.Supp.3d at
pg. 235.) Moreover, even though Defendants did not find a gun on Plaintiff’s
person or in his backpack, Defendants were still operating under a belief that
Plaintiff desired to shoot people at the School and had ideations of self-harm,
and it was unclear whether Plaintiff potentially had access to a firearm at
home. As part of the investigation, it was necessary for Defendants to
communicate with Plaintiff’s mother, and because Plaintiff’s mother did not
arrive to school sooner, it became necessary to keep Plaintiff detained until
she arrived. Thus, because Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden, the court
finds that there is no triable issue of material fact as to whether Defendants
violated his Fourth Amendment rights.
 
Accordingly,
the court grants summary adjudication as to the first and tenth causes of
action on this ground.
 
B.    
Whether
Defendants are immune from liability
 
Defendants
first argue that they are immune from liability under Government Code §§ 815.2
and 820.8 because there is no evidence to show that defendant Avila’s conduct
was wrongful or resulted in any injury. (Motion at pg. 12.) However, this
argument is not persuasive because the immunity afforded under Government Code
§ 820.8 only arises when the alleged injury was caused by the act of another
person. In this instance, Plaintiff’s claim of unlawful detention is based
solely on defendant Avila’s conduct. 
 
Second,
Defendants argue that defendant Avila is entitled to qualified immunity.
(Motion at pp. 13-14.) 
 
Government
Code § 820.2 provides that “a public employee is not liable for an injury
resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of
the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be
abused.”  Also, under California Government Code § 820.4, “[a] public
employee is not liable for his act or omission, exercising due care, in the
execution or enforcement of any law.” “Government officials enjoy qualified
immunity from civil damages unless their conduct violates ‘clearly established
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’” (P.B.
v. Koch (9th Cir. 1996) 96 F.3d 1298, 1301.) Under the circumstances,
because defendant Avilia had detained Plaintiff in the course of his duties as
a Sheriff’s deputy and did not violate Plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights, it
follows that he is entitled to qualified immunity under Government Code §§
820.2 and 820.4, defendant County of Los Angeles is also immune under
Government Code § 815.2.
 
Accordingly,
because defendant Avila is entitled to qualified immunity, summary adjudication
is proper as to the first and tenth causes of action. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is granted.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
