[FN1] Beginning in January 1,2020,
defendants charged Plaintiff pay monthly rent of $1,980.00. (Id., ¶ 13.)[FN2] The Court declines to entertain
Defendants’ Statute of Frauds argument at this juncture, on the basis that the
contract or contract(s) have not been identified in the first instance.[FN3] Plaintiff, in opposition,
references Lee’s August 6, 2024 filing of an unlawful detainer (“UD”) action.
Inasmuch as the UD action was instituted after the filing of the instant
action, it is not considered by the Court for the purpose of determining
whether or not Plaintiff sufficiently alleged the elements of the third cause
of action.
