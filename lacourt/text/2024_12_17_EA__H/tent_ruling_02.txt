[FN 1] Defendant Michael Baker
International, Inc. (“MBI”) did not file motions in limine in accordance with
the Department H Case Management Conference Standing Order. To the extent that
MBI intended to renew the motions in limine it had filed back in January 2023 –
well before the case was assigned to this Court and other significant in the
case (such as the settlement reached between Plaintiff and the other
defendants) – MBI needed to re-file its motions in limine or at least alert the
Court to the specific motions in limine at issue in its other trial filings.
The Court will hear further from MBI in this regard at the FSC.
