And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by the plaintiff, H Meritage Homes of California, Inc. The first motion seeks to exclude testimony by three witnesses, Doug Martin, Mark Doty, and Michael Boeck, unless they are disclosed and produced for testimony during the plaintiff's case-in-chief. The court has denied this motion as moot, except for the two witnesses who may provide live testimony.

The second motion seeks to exclude reference to a settlement agreement. The court is inclined to grant this motion in large part, but will permit the defendant, Michael Baker International, Inc., to revisit the issue at trial if employees of settling defendants provide testimony that is inconsistent with previous testimony.

The third motion seeks to exclude argument and evidence referring to the "empty chair" defendants and any alleged proportionate fault of settling defendants. The court has deferred ruling on this motion pending the outcome of the plaintiff's request for declaratory relief.

The fourth motion seeks to exclude reference to statements referencing the term "fraud" in describing any non-settling party's conduct. The court is seeking clarification on this motion and will hear further from the parties at the time of the further settlement conference.

The fifth motion seeks to exclude Tom Card's opinions regarding the design of the lift station. The court is inclined to deny this motion.

The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer further on the issue of witness availability and has set a further settlement conference to address outstanding issues.
