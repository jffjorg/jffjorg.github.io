of the West v. Lindsay, Case No. 20PSCV00155


ORDER ON OSC RE: ORDER FOR SALE OF DWELLING


The Order to Show Cause Re: Order for
Sale of Dwelling is DENIED as untimely.


Background 
Plaintiff
Bank of the West (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
          On September 13, 2017, Defendant
Rodney Michael Lindsay (“Defendant”) entered into a Retail Installment Sale
Contract (the “Contract”) with Plaintiff’s assignor for the purchase of a 2016
Chevrolet Silverado, VIN #1GC1KVE85GF124055. Defendant failed to make payments
due under the Contract. 
On
February 26, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against Defendant and Does 1-60 for (1) breach of retail installment sale
contract, (2) money lent, (3) recovery of personal property (claim and delivery),
and (4) conversion. 
On
May 1, 2020, Defendant’s default was entered. On August 24, 2020, the Court
entered default judgment. 
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Order for Sale of Dwelling is set for October 21, 2024.
Legal
Standard 
“[T]he
interest of a natural person in a dwelling may not be sold under this division
to enforce a money judgment except pursuant to a court order for sale…” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 704.740, subd. (a).) 
“Section
704.740 is part of the homestead laws. ‘Homestead laws are designed to protect
the sanctity of the family home against a loss caused by a forced sale by
creditors. . . The homestead exemption ensures that insolvent debtors and their
families are not rendered homeless by virtue of an involuntary sale of the
residential property they occupy. Thus, the homestead law is not designed to
protect creditors. . . This strong public policy requires courts to adopt a
liberal construction of the law and facts to promote the beneficial purposes of
the homestead legislation to benefit the debtor [and his family].’” (Wells Fargo Financial Leading, Inc. v.
D&M Cabinets (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 59, 67-68, quoting Amin v.
Khazindar (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 582, 585.)
Discussion
Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor applies for an order for sale of the dwelling commonly known as 937 N.
Soldano Avenue, Azusa, CA 91702 (the “Property”) owned by Defendant/Judgment
Debtor.
 
Service Requirements
“Upon the
filing of the application by the judgment creditor, the court shall set a time
and place for hearing and order the judgment debtor to show cause why an order
for sale should not be made in accordance with the application. The time set
for hearing shall be not later than 45 days after the application is filed or
such later time as the court orders upon a showing of good cause.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 704.770, subd. (a).)
“Not later
than 30 days before the time set for hearing, the judgment creditor shall do both of the following:
(1) Serve on
the judgment debtor a copy of the order to show cause, a copy of the
application of the judgment creditor, and a copy of the notice of the hearing
in the form prescribed by the Judicial Council. Service shall be made
personally or by mail. 
(2)
Personally serve a copy of each document listed in paragraph (1) on an occupant
of the dwelling or, if there is no occupant present at the time service is
attempted, post a copy of each document in a conspicuous place at the
dwelling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.770, subd. (b) [emphasis added].)
Here, Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor filed (mail served on April 22, 2024) an “Application for Issuance of
Order for Sale of Dwelling Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §
704.750(a)” on April 25, 2024.
On May 16,
2024, an “Order to Show Cause Why Order for Sale of Dwelling Should Not Issue” (“OSC”)
was entered, wherein an Order to Show Cause was set for September 12, 2024. On
June 12, 2024, Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor filed a “Notice of Hearing[, etc.],”
which was personally served on Defendant/Judgment Debtor that day.
On August
13, 2024, Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor filed a proof of service reflecting that Defendant/Judgment Debtor was served
that day by mail with the
Application, OSC and Notice of Hearing. On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed another proof of
service, reflecting that the Application, OSC, and Notice of Hearing had been
posted on the property on August 13, 2024.
The September 12, 2024
Order to Show Cause was continued to October 21, 2024; the Court provided the
parties with notice of the continued hearing.
On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor filed
a “Notice of Hearing[, etc.],” advising of the new October 21, 2024 hearing
date; this notice was personally served on Defendant/Judgment Debtor that day.
On September
20, 2024, a “First Amended Order to Show Cause Why Order for Sale of Dwelling
Should Not Issue” (“Amended OSC”) was entered, reflecting the October 21, 2024
date.
On September
30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service reflecting that Defendant/Judgment Debtor was served
on September 27, 2024 by mail with the Notice of Hearing and OSC (presumably the
Amended OSC). On September 30, 2024,
Plaintiff filed another proof of service, reflecting that the Amended OSC and
Notice of Hearing had been posted on the property on September 27, 2024. The
aforesaid proofs of service do not reflect service “[n]ot later than 30 days
before” October 21, 2024.
With that said, on October
17, 2024, the Court continued the hearing, at Defendant/Judgment Debtor’s
request, to December 17, 2024; the Court provided notice to the parties.
The Court
determines that notice was adequately provided to Defendant/Judgment Debtor,
based on the circumstances set forth above.
 
Timeliness
of Application
“Promptly after a dwelling
is levied upon…, the levying officer shall serve notice on the judgment
creditor that the levy has been made and that the property will be released
unless the judgment creditor complies with the requirements of this section.
Service shall be made personally or by mail. Within 20 days after service of
the notice, the judgment creditor shall apply to the court for an order
for sale of the dwelling and shall file a copy of the application with the
levying officer. If the judgment creditor does not file the copy of the
application for an order for sale of the dwelling within the allowed time, the
levying officer shall release the dwelling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.750,
subd. (a) [Emphasis added].)
Plaintiff has provided the Court with
a copy of the levying officer’s “Notice to Creditor of Levy on Dwelling” dated
February 6, 2024. (Olson Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. E.) The Application was filed on
April 25, 2024, well in excess of 20 days from the date of the levying
officer’s notice; as such, the court determines that Code of Civil Procedure §
704.750, subdivision (a) has not been satisfied.
The
Court, then, denies the application without prejudice as untimely.
As an aside, the Court notes that Defendant’s
October 11, 2024 filing, styled a “Response to Order to Show Cause Notice [sic]
of Motion and Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer,” is construed as a
response to the Order to Show Cause only and not as an independent motion.
