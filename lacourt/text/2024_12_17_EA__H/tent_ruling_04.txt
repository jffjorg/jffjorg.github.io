v. Lee, et al, Case No. 24PSCV02472
ORDER ON DEMURRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE

          1.
      Defendants Henry Lee and Shu Fang
Li’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED, with 20 days leave
to amend in part (i.e., as to the first through third causes of action) and
OVERRULED in part (i.e., as to the fourth through seventh causes of action).
          2.        Defendants Henry Lee and Shu Fang Li’s
Motion to Strike Portions of [Plaintiff’s] Complaint is DENIED as MOOT in part
(i.e., as to Paragraph 41, 7:12-14) and
otherwise DENIED.
 
I.        Background
Plaintiff Yu Zhi Zhao (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows: 
 
          On
or about March 15, 2014, Plaintiff entered into an oral agreement with Henry
Lee (“Lee”) and Shu Fang Li (“Li”) (together, “Defendants”), wherein Defendants
agreed to lease the property located at 2026E Shamwood Street in West Covina (the
“subject property”) to Plaintiff for a three-year period in exchange for
Plaintiff’s payment of $1,750.00 in monthly rent. After December 2017, the
parties orally renewed the lease on an annual basis; rent was increased to
$1,980.00/month beginning January 1, 2020. 
 
          Beginning
in August 2019, Plaintiff made approximately $70,000.00 in permitted additions
to the subject property, with Defendants’ knowledge and consent. From about
April to August 2021, Defendants promised Plaintiff that after the improvements
were made, Plaintiff would only be responsible for the increased portions of
the real estate tax and homeowner insurance premium and that they would not
charge Plaintiff additional rent for the improvements. Defendants refused to
give Plaintiff a written lease because they wanted Plaintiff to pay rent in
cash. 
 
          In
or about December 2022, the permit for Plaintiff’s improvements was issued and
the improvements were completed. Defendants thereafter asked Plaintiff to pay
$2,900.00 in monthly rent, without any written notice in advance, instead of
paying the increased portion of real estate property taxes or insurance
premiums. Defendants have subsequently raised rent several times without
providing Plaintiff with written notice. Plaintiff has asked Defendants to
reimburse her for the cost of constructing the improvements on the subject
property, but they refuse and are instead attempting to evict her.
 
On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendants and Does 1-25 for (1) Breach
of Contract, (2) Fraud, (3) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (4) Retaliation
in Violation of Civil Code § 1942.5, (5) Violation of 2019 Tenant Protection
Act, (6) Breach of Quasi-Contract/Unjust Enrichment, and (7) Violation of the
Unfair Competition Law—Business & Professions Code § 17200, et seq.
 
Pending before the Court are (1)
Defendants’ demurrer to the complaint and (2) Defendants’ motion to strike
portions of the complaint. 
 
 
II.      Legal
Standards
A demurrer
may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)
“A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or
are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole
v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 436, “the court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.” The grounds for a motion to strike must “appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
III.     Discussion
          A.       Defendants’
Demurrer      
Defendants
demur, per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to
the first through seventh causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint, on the
basis that they each fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and are uncertain. 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice 
The
Court grants Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice (i.e., of the complaint
filed August 6, 2024 in Case No. 24WCUD01628). 
 
Merits
At
the outset, the Court notes that the “Relevant Facts and Procedural History”
section contained in Defendants’ demurrer contains purported facts that are
extrinsic to the face of Plaintiff’s complaint and are not judicially
noticeable. The Court thus declines to consider them as improper at the
demurrer stage.
 
First Cause of Action (i.e., Breach of
Contract)
“The
elements of a breach of oral contract claim are the same as those for a breach
of written contract: a contract; its performance or excuse for nonperformance;
breach; and damages.” (Stockton Mortgage, Inc. v. Tope (2014) 233
Cal.App.4th 437, 453). “It is essential to the
existence of a contract that there should be: 1. Parties capable of
contracting; 2. Their consent; 3. A lawful object; and, 4. A sufficient cause
or consideration.” (Civ. Code § 1550.)
 
Plaintiff has alleged that she has
resided at the premises since 2014 and that she initially leased the premises
pursuant to an oral agreement for a term of three years, which was followed by
oral renewals of the lease on an annual basis. (Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 7, and 10.)
Plaintiff has alleged that she made “additional constructions on the premises,”
“applied [for] permit[s] for constructing these additions from the City and did
all the work relating to the construction” “[b]eginning from August 2019.” (Id.,
¶ 15.) 
 
Plaintiff has alleged that “[f]rom
about April 2021 to about August 2021, during the period when Plaintiff applied
for permit for the improvement on behalf of defendants, defendants promised
Plaintiff that after the improvements were made Plaintiff would only be
responsible for the increased portions of the real estates tax and homeowner
insurance premium, and defendants would not charge additional rents for the
improvements made by Plaintiff” (Id., ¶ 17), that “[i]n or about
December 2022, the permit for the improvements made by Plaintiff was issued by
the City, and, the improvement was finally completed” (Id., ¶ 19), that
“defendants immediately changed their words” and “asked Plaintiff to pay  monthly rent in the amount of $2900[FN1],. .
. instead of paying the increased portion of real estate property taxes or
insurance premium” (Id.), that defendants thereafter raised the monthly
rent to $2,600.00 beginning from January 2023, to $2,700.00 beginning from June
2023 and to $2,835.00 beginning from June 2024 (Id., ¶¶ 20-22), that
“Plaintiff requested that defendants reimburse her for the cost of constructing
additions on the Premises but defendants refused” (Id., ¶ 23), that “the
parties intended Plaintiff to reside at the Premises for the remaining of her
life time” (Id., ¶ 25) and that defendants are now trying to evict her (Id.).
 
The Court agrees that it is unclear,
as currently pled, how many contracts were made between Plaintiff and
Defendants. The first cause of action is labeled, “Breach of Contracts.”
Additionally, Plaintiff has alleged that she entered into oral agreements with
Defendants from about April 2021 to about August 2021. (Complaint, ¶ 25; see
also, ¶ 29, 5:15 [referring to “agreements”].) Plaintiff, however,
subsequently alleges that there was an agreement. (Id.; see also,
¶¶ 28 and 29, 5:16 [referring to “agreement”].) Clarification is needed in this
regard.
 
Further, Plaintiff has alleged that
she made “additional constructions on the premises” “[b]eginning from August
2019” with defendants’ “knowledge and consent.” (Id., ¶ 15.) It is
unclear to the Court, from the facts alleged, whether or not the cited
improvements were already completed by Plaintiff before the parties entered
into any of the alleged oral contracts. It is further unclear to the Court what
the terms of each of the alleged oral contracts were.[FN2]
 
The Court sustains Defendants’
demurrer to the first cause of action on this basis. 
 
Second Cause of Action (i.e., Fraud)
 
“‘Promissory fraud’ is a subspecies of
the action for fraud and deceit.” (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.) “The elements of promissory fraud . . . are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent not to perform at the time the
promise was made; (3) intent to deceive or induce the promisee to enter into a
transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the
party making the promise; and (6) resulting damage to the promise[e].” (Rossberg
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1498.) 
“Fraud
must be pleaded with specificity…[t]o withstand a demurrer, the facts constituting every element of the
fraud must be alleged with particularity, and the claim cannot be salvaged by
references to the general policy favoring the liberal construction of
pleadings.” (Goldrich v. Natural Y
Surgical Specialties, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 772, 782
[emphasis in original].) “This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220
Cal.App.3d 59, 73 [quotations and citations omitted; emphasis in original].)
 
Plaintiff has alleged that “[f]rom about April 2021 to
about September 2022, defendants made numerous false promises to Plaintiff,
including but not limited to: if Plaintiff would make improvements to the
Premises and apply for the city permit on their behalf for the improvement,
Defendants would not seek rent increases from Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff
would only be responsible for the increased portions of the property tax and/or
insurance premium resulting from the improvements. Defendants further represented
to Plaintiff that Plaintiff would be free to use the improvements before
Plaintiff made the improvements.” (Complaint, ¶ 34.)
 
Plaintiff has failed to plead the aforementioned false
promises with particularity (i.e., when they were made, in what form and by
whom). Additionally, Plaintiff previously alleged that she had already made
“additional constructions on the premises” “[b]eginning from August 2019” (Id.,
¶ 15), which is well before Defendants are alleged to have made the alleged
false promises in 2021-2022.
 
The Court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the second cause
of action on this basis.
 
Third Cause of Action (i.e., Breach of
Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)
 
“[E]very lease includes a covenant of
quiet possession and enjoyment.” (Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1299.) “Minor inconveniences
and annoyances are not actionable breaches of the implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment. To be actionable, the landlords act or omission must substantially
interfere with a tenants right to use and enjoy the premises for the
purposes contemplated by the tenancy.” (Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates
(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 589 [emphasis added].) “Breach can take many forms,
including actual or constructive eviction.” (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank
National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 293.)
 
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants breached the covenant
of quiet enjoyment by engaging in the following acts from January 2023-present: “a. Frequent and/or unnecessary visits the [sic] Premises
for the purposes of distances of [sic] Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. b.
Unnecessary inspection or maintenance of the Premises without notifying
Plaintiff. C. Frequently visited the Premises, talked to Plaintiff’s
subtenants, warned the subtenants that subtenants there were illegal and
demanded the subtenants to move out. d. Frequently called Plaintiff asking for
rental increases.” (Complaint, ¶ 44.)
 
The aforementioned acts, without more, do not constitute
“substantial interference” with Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy the premises
for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.[FN3]
 
The Court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause
of action on this basis.
 
Fourth Cause of Action (i.e.,
Retaliation in Violation of Civil Code § 1942.5)
 
Defendants assert that Plaintiff has
not alleged a violation of Civil Code section 1942.5(a), because Plaintiff did
not plead that she made a “complaint to an appropriate agency as to the
tenantability of a dwelling” and that she was “not in default as to the payment
of rent.” 
Plaintiff, in turn,
asserts that her fourth cause of action is predicated on subsection (d), which
provides that “[n]otwithstanding subdivision
(a), it is unlawful for a lessor to increase rent, . . . or threaten to do any
of those acts, for the purpose of retaliating against the lessee because the
lessee . . . has lawfully and peaceably exercised any rights under the law.”
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants increased rents in retaliation for
Plaintiff notifying them that she would pay all future rent by check and would
report her rental payment to the IRS in the future. (Complaint, ¶ 48.)
Defendants have not filed a reply brief addressing subsection (d). 
The
Court overrules Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action. 
 
Fifth
Cause of Action (i.e., Violation of 2019 Tenant Protection Act) 
Under
the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, an owner of residential real property must
not, over the course of any 12-month period, increase the gross rental rate
more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living, or 10%,
whichever is lower, of the lowest gross rental rate charged at any time during
the 12 months prior to the effective date of the increase. (Civ. Code §
1947.12(a)(1).) Notice of any increase must be furnished in compliance with
Civil Code section 827. (Civ. Code § 1947.12(e).) 
Plaintiff
has alleged that she paid $1,750/month in rent from March 2014 through December
2017, $1,850.00 commencing from January 2018, and $1,900.00 commencing from
January 2019. (Complaint, ¶¶ 9, 11, and 12.) Plaintiff has alleged that
“[b]eginning on January 1, 2020, defendants requested Plaintiff to pay monthly
rent in the amount of $1980.00” (Id., ¶ 13), that Plaintiff paid monthly
rent of $1,980.00 from December 2021 to December 15, 2022 (Id., ¶ 58),
that, in or about December 2022, Defendants asked Plaintiff to pay monthly rent
in the amount of $2900, without any advance written notice (Id., ¶ 19),
and that in January 2023, June 2023, and June 2024, Defendants raised rent to $2,600.00/month,
$2,700.00/month and $2,835.00/month, respectively, without any advance written
notice (Id., ¶¶ 20-22). 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff has not pled any facts indicating whether the premises
“is exempt from AB1482.” (Dem., 13:2-3.) As Plaintiff notes, however,
“[w]hether there is an exemption is a possible defense.” (Opp., 10:17-18.) 
Defendants
next assert that Plaintiff’s allegations regarding rent charged are confusing.
The Court disagrees. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants asked Plaintiff
to pay monthly rent of $2,900.00 in December 2022, but apparently began
charging $2,600.00 in rent instead, effective January 2023. Defendants do not
address Plaintiff’s allegations that rent was increased from $1,980.00 as of
December 14, 2022 to $2,600.00 as of January 2023, without any advance written
notice. 
Lastly,
Defendants’ argument regarding emotional distress is more appropriately
reserved for a motion to strike, inasmuch as a demurrer is not utilized to
attack portions of a cause of action. 
The Court overrules Defendants’
demurrer to the fifth cause of action.
 
Sixth Cause of Action (i.e., Breach of
Quasi-Contract/Unjust Enrichment) 
“The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are receipt
of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.” (Lyles
v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 759, 769 [internal quotations and
citation omitted].) 
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants
received a benefit (namely, extensive construction improvements made by
Plaintiff on the premises) at Plaintiff’s expense that they unjustly retained. 
 
The Court overrules Defendants’
demurrer to the sixth cause of action.
 
Seventh Cause of Action (i.e.,
Violation of the Unfair Competition Law—Business & Professions Code §
17200, et seq.)
“Business
and Professions Code section 17200. . . establishes three varieties of unfair
competition-acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.” (Podolsky
v. First Healthcare Corp. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 632, 647.) “Unlawful
business acts or practices within the meaning of the UCL include anything that
can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is
forbidden by law.  A practice is forbidden by law if it violates any law,
civil or criminal, statutory or judicially made, federal, state or local.
By extending to business acts or practices which are unlawful, the UCL permits
violations of other laws to be treated as unfair competition that
is independently actionable. Even if the violation of another law
does not create a private right of action, if the violation constitutes unfair
competition, it is actionable.” (McKell
v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1474-1475
[quotations and citations omitted].)
Plaintiff has alleged
that Defendants violated Civil Code section 1942.5 and the 2019 Tenant
Protection Act. (Complaint, ¶ 74.) Retaliatory eviction is an unfair business
practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200. (Hernandez v.
Stabach (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 309.)
 
The Court overrules Defendants’
demurrer to the seventh cause of action.
Leave to Amend
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained, with 20 days
leave to amend in part (i.e., as to the first through third causes of
action) and overruled in part (i.e., as to the fourth through seventh causes of
action).
 
          B.       Defendants’ Motion to Strike
Defendants move to strike out the following portions
of Plaintiff’s complaint:
          1.       Paragraph
41, 7:12-14 (i.e., “[t]he aforementioned conduct of defendants was done with
malice, fraud and oppression, so as to justify an award of exemplary or
punitive damages”);
          2.       Paragraph
55, 9:23-26 (i.e., “[t]he actions of Defendants were malicious and fraudulent,
and in conscious disregard of the 2019 Tenant Protection Act (AB1482), and
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of exemplary or punitive damages. Plaintiff
is also entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to Civil Code
section 1942.5”);
 
          3.       Paragraph 67, 11:16-18 (i.e., “[t]he
actions of Defendants were malicious and fraudulent,
and in conscious disregard of the 2019 Tenant Protection Act (AB1482), and
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of exemplary or punitive damages. Plaintiff
is also entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees”);
          4.       Prayer,
Paragraph E, 13:11-12 (i.e., “[f]or punitive and exemplary damages in an amount
determined to be just to punish defendants”);
          5.       Prayer,
Paragraph H, 13:16 (i.e., “[f]or Attorney’s fees herein incurred”);        
          6.       Paragraph
55, 9:25-26 (i.e., “Plaintiff is also entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s
fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1942.5”);
          7.       Paragraph
67, 11:16-18 (i.e., “Plaintiff is also entitled to recover reasonable
attorney’s fees”);
          8.       Paragraph
54, 9:20 (i.e., “plus emotional distress from Defendants’ pattern of
intimidating behavior”); and
          9.       Paragraph
66, 11:13 (i.e., “plus emotional distress from Defendants’ pattern of
intimidating behavior”).
 
Punitive
Damages
At
the outset, the motion is summarily denied as moot with respect to Paragraph
41, 7:12-14, based upon the ruling made on the demurrer.
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff fails to allege any facts supporting a request for
punitive damages (i.e., Requests Nos. 2-4 identified above). The Court
disagrees. Plaintiff has alleged, in the fourth and fifth causes of action,
that Defendants increased the rent on the premises dramatically and threatened
to evict Plaintiff after Plaintiff spent $70,000.00 making improvements on the
premises and notified Defendants that she would, inter alia, pay her future
rent via check and report her rental payments to the IRS.
The
Court denies the motion in this regard.
 
Attorney’s
Fees
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees pursuant to Civil Code
section 1942.5 is inappropriate because Plaintiff has failed to allege
retaliatory eviction. The Court disagrees, based on the ruling made on
demurrer. The Court denies the motion in this regard.
 
Emotional
Distress
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts to support her claim for
emotional distress; again, the Court disagrees, for the reasons set forth
above. The Court denies the motion in this regard.
