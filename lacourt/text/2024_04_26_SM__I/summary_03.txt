Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court's tentative ruling addresses two motions to compel further responses. The motions were served outside the 45-day jurisdictional time limit, but the court notes that the deadline was extended by a letter from the plaintiff. The defendant's motion was filed on March 29, 2024, and the plaintiff's unauthorized sur-reply was filed on April 23, 2024.

The court will discuss the matter briefly with the parties and may set a further briefing schedule if the matter is not resolved quickly. On the merits, the court would grant the motion as to some discovery and deny it as to other discovery. The court would order a date certain for production and require production by that date with a declaration under oath stating that production had been completed and all documents promised in the discovery responses had been produced.

The court notes that many requests for production were made without specific thought and follows a boilerplate template. The court also addresses the meet and confer process, requiring parties to engage in a good faith effort to resolve their differences before filing a motion. The court sets forth guidelines for the meet and confer process, including the requirement for correspondence, meetings, and a written agreement on the outcome.
