And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on two motions to compel further responses from defendants. The court granted the motion to compel further responses from Eisner LLP regarding Form Interrogatories, Set One (FI-1) and granted the motion to compel further responses from Michael Eisner regarding Form Interrogatories, Set Two (FI-2). The court denied the motion for sanctions as the parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. The court attached guidelines on discovery responses and meet and confer. The court emphasized the importance of good faith in the meet and confer process and provided guidance on how to approach the process. The court warned that failure to abide by the guidelines may justify denial of the motion or a continuance.
