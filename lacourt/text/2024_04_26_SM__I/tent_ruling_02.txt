 Case Number:  23SMCV01663    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  I There are three motions to compel.  None are opposed and all are GRANTED.  Sanctions are imposed in the total amount of
$430 plus the filing fee against plaintiff. 
The sanctions are payable within 30 days.
Plaintiff Yesenia Corona
(“plaintiff”) filed this dental malpractice action against defendants Chirag
Patel, D.M.D. (“Patel”) and Chirag N. Patel, DMD, a professional corporation
(“DMD”).  DMD served the discovery on
November 6, 2023 to plaintiff. (Gonzalez Decl., ¶5.) No responses were received
by the responsive deadline of December 20, 2023, and DMD’s meet and confer
efforts thereafter were ignored. (Id. at ¶¶5-8.)  Because there is no justification for
ignoring discovery, the motion is GRANTED. 
Sanctions are, in this case, mandatory. 
Because the motions are essentially identical, the court has not awarded
a huge number.  The court addressed
plaintiff directly at the hearing on April 19, 2024, and plaintiff appeared to
understand and take the court’s statements to heart.  The court therefore trusts that there will
not be further problems similar to this one going forward.
