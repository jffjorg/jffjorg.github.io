Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On August 23, 2021, Plaintiff Anthony Brooks filed a
complaint for Disability Discrimination; Failure to Provide a Reasonable
Accommodation; Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process; and, Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy against Defendant California
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. On May 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
first amended complaint for Disability Discrimination; Failure to Provide a
Reasonable Accommodation; and, Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process.
Defendant answered the first amended complaint on June 9, 2022. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for plaintiff Anthony
Brooks moves to be relieved as counsel of record, due to a breach of the
parties’ fee agreement. 
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the necessity of client confidentiality, and will meet counsel in
chambers, if requested. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves
v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.) The motion
otherwise complies with all procedural requirements. The motion is therefore
granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client.
 
Trial remains set for May 28, 2024.
 
Moving
