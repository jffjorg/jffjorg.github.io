Background
 
This is an
open book account case. Plaintiff Anderco Carpet Co. Inc. (which is in the
business of flooring, carpets, titles, woods, turfs and other related services
and products) alleges the following against Defendants Jay Hooper; Crown Estate
Holding LLC (“Crown”); UW International Corp. (“UW”); Losalini Lutuiwasa;
United Liquidators West Coast LLC: Hooper ordered more than $2,000,000 in
merchandise from 2017 to 2018, and left $315,539.91 in unpaid invoices.
Plaintiff seeks to recover this amount, plus prejudgment interest and lost
potential profits from the use of its money, for a total of $418,933.26. 
 
On September
22, 2020, Plaintiff filed suit for: 
 
1.     Breach of Contract
2.     Breach of Implied Contract 
3.     Open Book Account
4.     Account Stated
5.     Goods and Services Rendered
6.     Quantum Merit
7.     Unjust Enrichment
 
On November
13, 2020, default was entered against Hooper.
 
On November
20, 2020, United Liquidators West Coast LLC and Losalini Lutuiwasa were
dismissed from the complaint without prejudice. 
 
On December
1, 2020, a clerk’s judgment was entered as to Jay Hooper, UW, and Crown (“Defendants”)
for the total amount of $362,410.62. 
 
On February
10, 2021 and April 16, 2021, an abstract of judgment was filed. 
 
On June 1,
2021, Defendants filed a motion to vacate the default judgment and entry of
defaults.
 
On July 12,
2021, the court granted the motion to vacate the default judgment and entry of
defaults. That same day, Defendants Hooper, Crown, and UW filed their answer. 
 
On September
22, 2021, the court had its hearing on Plaintiff’s application for a ‘TRO and
Appointment of a Receiver or in the Alternative for Asset Freeze’ and
Plaintiff’s ‘Motion to Vacate Void Order Dated July 12, 2021.’ According to the
court’s tentative ruling (adopted as final), the motion to vacate the order was
taken off calendar because the “court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to
consider the [] motion inasmuch as it seeks reconsideration of a ruling by a
different judgment” and there was no showing of the ruling Judge’s
unavailability. (See 9/22/21 Ruling pp. 2-3 of 5 of PDF.) As for the TRO, that
was denied because considering Judge White-Brown’s order granting Defendants’
motion to vacate the default and default judgments, “[t]here is no enforceable
judgment in this case. Plaintiff’s authorities in reply overlook the fact that
Plaintiff is not a judgment creditor at this juncture.” (See 9/22/21 Ruling, p.
4 of 5 of PDF.) 
 
On July 13,
2022, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney (replacing Counsel Gerges with
Counsel Berke).
 
On May 9,
2023, the appellate court’s opinion (affirming trial court’s ruling to vacate
the default/default judgments) was filed.
 
On November
13, 2023, Defendants filed a substitution of attorney (from pro per to naming
James L. Reynolds).[1]

 
On July 15,
2024, the parties attended a CMC and Status Conference Re: Mediation indicating
that “discovery will be completed in early 2025.” (See Minute Order.) 
 
On August 12,
2024, the three instant motions were filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel
Reynolds (substituted in on 11/13/23) seeks to be relieved as counsel because
all three clients are in material breach of representation. (See MC-052 form.)
According to Counsel’s declaration(s), he has attempted to cure the current
situation on several occasion, but Defendants have made no reasonable effort to
cure the material breach. Though Counsel has not provided specific details that
prevent him from representing Defendants, he need not. (See MC-052 Form, p. 3
of 7 of PDF citing Aceves v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584,
591 [“Whereas here the duty not to reveal
confidences prevented counsel from further disclosure and the court accepted
the good faith of counsel's representations, the court should find the conflict
sufficiently established and permit withdrawal.”].) Should there be any
prejudice by granting of the motions, Defendants have not filed an opposition.
Additionally, should there be prejudice, it is minimal as there are no pending
motions on calendar; the next hearing date is a CMC date set for 1/14/25. 
 
Therefore, as all parties have been served with notice of the motion and
there are otherwise no defects (MC-051, 052, and 053 forms have been
submitted), the court grants all three motions to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motions are granted effective upon service of motion and the
court’s order upon all Plaintiff, Defendants, and all other parties who have
appeared.
