And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions of Jay Hooper, Crown Estate Holdings, LLC, and UW International Corp. to be relieved as counsel. The motions were filed on August 12, 2024, and the parties have been served with notice. The judge finds that the motions are granted because all three clients are in material breach of representation, and the counsel has attempted to cure the situation but has been unsuccessful. The judge also notes that there is no pending motion on calendar, and the next hearing date is a CMC date set for January 14, 2025, so any potential prejudice is minimal. The judge orders that the motions are granted effective upon service of the motion and the court's order upon all parties who have appeared.
