UIG INVESTMENT INC., OPTIMUS PRICE INC., DECHO DEVELOP INC., LIMAN KIANG  a/k/a CECILIA JIANG AND JIE SHA.    CASE NO.:                 23AHCV011667       DEMURRER    MOVING PARTY:               Defendants Optimus Price, Inc.,  Decho Develop Inc., and Jie Sha; UIG Investment, Inc. and Liman Jiang   RESPONDING PARTY:      Plaintiff  Caner Li   SERVICE:                              Filed November 14, 2023 and December 5,  2023    OPPOSITION:                       Filed February 7, 2024   REPLY:                                   Filed February 13 and 14, 2024    RELIEF  REQUESTED                 Defendants separately demurrer to  each of Plaintiff’s causes of action.    BACKGROUND                This case arises out of Plaintiff Caner Li’s  (“Plaintiff”) claim that he was misled into investing $432,955 into a  fraudulent E-2 visa sponsorship investment scheme. Plaintiff filed a first  amended complaint on October 18, 2023, alleging seven causes of action for (1)  fraud, (2) conversion, (3) breach of contract, (4) breach of fiduciary duty,  (5) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, (6) breach o0f statutory  books-and-records obligation, and (7) unjust enrichment.    TENTATIVE RULING               Defendants’ demurrers are OVERRULED.    LEGAL STANDARD   A general  demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to  constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the  complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the  defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial  notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section  430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or  other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153  Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is  whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.  Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)   Additionally, a  special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is  uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of  San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based  on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the  pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14  Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if  the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably  respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208  Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)    DISCUSSION               The present case involves two separate demurrers filed by Optimus Price,  Inc., Decho Develop Inc., and Jie Sha (“Optimus Defendants”) and UIG  Investment, Inc. and Liman Jiang (“UIG Defendants”).                First  Cause of Action for Fraud                All Defendants demurrer to  Plaintiff’s first cause of action for fraud. Defendants primarily argue that  Plaintiff failed to allege facts with the required specificity.    “The elements of fraud, which give  rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false  representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or  ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable  reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205  Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060, citations omitted.               “Each element of a fraud claim must be pleaded with  specificity. [Citation.] ‘The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must  allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the  representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the  plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,  their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what  they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.’ ” (Orcilla v. Big  Sur, Inc. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 982, 1008.)                Plaintiff  alleges that he was solicited to invest in a joint venture entity but was  provided false documents and information. (FAC ¶¶ 92-93.) Plaintiff alleges that Jiangxia Hu  (“Hu”), a representative of UIG, recommended Plaintiff invest in a “Decho”  project. (Id. ¶¶28-30.) Plaintiff alleges that he was  provided with various information regarding the project’s financial documents,  fleet of vehicles, experience, and profits but that the documents were false or  misleading. (Id. ¶¶ 33-41.) Plaintiff alleges  that after he made his capital investments, Jie Sha stated that she received  less than the full amount provided by Plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶52-55.)  Plaintiff alleges that Hu sent Plaintiff photos of “Decho’s logistic fleet” but  alleges that the vehicles were not owned by Decho or Optimus. (Id. ¶¶  58-60.)                Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to allege that  Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct to state a claim. Defendants’  demurrers to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for fraud are overruled.                Second  Cause of Action for Conversion               The  UIG Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s second cause of action for conversion.   “The elements of a  conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession  of the property; (2) the defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or  disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.” (Welco Electronics , Inc.  v. Mora (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 202, 208.) “Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless  there is a specific, identifiable sum involved, such as where an agent accepts  a sum of money to be paid to another and fails to make the payment.” (PCO,  Inc. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP (2007)  150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395.)   Plaintiff alleges he has a property  interest in his $432,955 invest funds transferred to UIG. (FAC ¶ 107.) Plaintiff alleges that UIG refused to  return the funds after Plaintiff’s demand. (Id. ¶ 108.) Plaintiff also  alleges damages. (Id. ¶ 112.) Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to  state a claim for conversion. UIG Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s second  cause of action is overruled.                Fourth  Cause of Action for Breach of Contract               The Optimus Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s “third” cause of  action for breach of contract. As a preliminary note, although Plaintiff’s  caption and Defendants’ demurrer states that Plaintiff’s third cause of action  is for breach of contract, the body of Plaintiff’s FAC provides that both  Plaintiff’s third and fourth causes of action seek to allege a claim for breach  of contract. The demurrer objects to Plaintiff's fourth cause of action.               The  essential elements of a breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2)  plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s  breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (Green Valley  Landowners Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th. 425, 433.)               Plaintiff alleges that he entered into an agreement with Decho for  an E2 Sponsorship Agreement. (FAC ¶ 131.)  Plaintiff alleges that Decho breached the agreement by failing to distribute  first-year dividends as required by the agreement. (Id. ¶¶ 132-133.)  Plaintiff alleges he performed under the contract and was harmed by Defendants’  breach. (Id. ¶¶ 134-135.) Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to  state a claim for breach of contract. Dechos’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s fourth  cause of action is overruled.               Fifth  Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty   The Optimus Defendants demurrer  to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.   The elements of a cause of action  for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty; (2)  the breach of that duty; (3) damage proximately caused by that breach.” (IIG  Wireless, Inc. v. Yi (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 630, 646.) “[A] fiduciary  relationship is ‘ “any relation existing between parties to a transaction  wherein one of the parties is in duty bound to act with the utmost good faith  for the benefit of the other party.” ’ " (Cleveland v. Johnson (2012)  209 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1338.)    Plaintiff alleges that Liman Jiang and Jie Sha breached a  fiduciary duty owed to him by failing to allocate and invest Plaintiff’s  investment funds according to the investment agreement, failing to provide any  information as to unaccounted funds, and failing to provide documentations.  (FAC ¶¶ 148-149.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege facts  sufficient to state that Jie Sha owes Plaintiff a fiduciary duty. However,  Plaintiff allege that Jie Sha is the Chief Executive Officer of Optimus and Decho  and that Plaintiff is a shareholder of Optimus. (FAC ¶¶ 18 and 52.) At the  pleading stage, Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to allege that Sha owed  him a fiduciary duty. Defendants’ demurrer is overruled.               Sixth  Cause of Action for Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty               The Optimus Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of  action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.    “The elements of a claim for aiding  and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) a third party's breach of  fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff; (2) defendant's actual knowledge of that  breach of fiduciary duties; (3) substantial assistance or encouragement by  defendant to the third party's breach; and (4) defendant's conduct was a  substantial factor in causing harm to plaintiff.” (Nasrawi v. Buck  Consultants LLC (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 328, 343.)   Plaintiff alleges that Hie Sha  assisted Defendant Liman Jiang breach a fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (FAC ¶ 149.) Plaintiff also alleges that Jiang  assisted Sha breach a fiduciary duty owed to Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 150.)  Plaintiff specifically alleges that Sha assisted Jiang by stating that only  $200,000 was received from Plaintiff’s investment despite initially stating  that the full amount was received. (Id. ¶¶ 54-55.) At the pleading  stage, Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to state a claim. Defendants’  demurrer to Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action is overruled.                Seventh  Cause of Action for  Breach of Statutory  Books-And-Records Obligations                The Optimus Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s sixth cause of  action for breach of statutory books-and-records obligations. Plaintiff alleges  that Optimus failed to provide access to its records pursuant to Corporations  Code section 1600 and 1601, subdivision (a). (FAC ¶  155.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff is not a shareholder of Optimus. However,  Plaintiff alleges that he is a holder of 510 shares. (Id. ¶ 52.) At the  pleading stage, Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient. Defendants’ demurrer to  Plaintiff’s seventh cause of action is overruled.                Eighth  Unjust Enrichment/Restitution    The UIG Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s seventh cause of action  for unjust enrichment and restitution. “The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are ‘receipt of a benefit  and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.’ ” (Lyles v.  Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 759, 769.) Plaintiff alleges that UIG  was unjust enriched when it received Plaintiff’s $432,955 and failed to  allocate the money according to the agreement. (FAC ¶¶ 161-162.) UIG’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s  eighth cause of action is overruled.    CONCLUSION   Defendants’ demurrers are OVERRULED.   Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Caner Li aka Jun Li’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint (0821) is taken off calendar as MOOT.
