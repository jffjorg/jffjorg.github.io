And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the defendants. The defendants have filed demurrers to each of the plaintiff's causes of action, alleging that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge has overruled the demurrers, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for fraud, conversion, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, breach of statutory books-and-records obligations, and unjust enrichment and restitution.

The judge has also taken off calendar the plaintiff's demurrer to the cross-complaint and the defendants' demurrer to the cross-complaint, finding that they are moot.

The defendants are required to give notice of the judge's tentative ruling. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
