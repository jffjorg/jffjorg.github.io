Defendants

On
January 29, 2024, Defendant Pest Innovation’s doctor, Dr. Tony Feuerman (“Dr.
Feuerman”), examined Plaintiff. (Declaration of Greg A. Jackson (“Jackson
Decl.”) ¶ 5.) On February 20, 2024,
Defense counsel provided a copy of Dr. Feuerman’s report regarding the medical
examination. (Id. at ¶ 6; Ex. “C.”) On
March 1, 2024, Defense counsel provided a copy of Dr. Feuerman’s supplemental
record review. (Id.) Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to meet and confer
with Defense counsel seeking a code compliant report from Dr. Feuerman. (Id.
at ¶¶ 7-9; Ex. “D.”)
 
On
March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel Defendant Pest
Innovation to produce the medical examination report of Plaintiff. Plaintiff
requests sanctions in connection with the motion. No opposition has been filed.

provide a code compliant medical examination report regarding the examination
of Plaintiff on January 29, 2024 within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel of record is GRANTED in the sum of $1,560.
Defendant and its counsel of record are ordered to pay this amount within 30
days of this order. 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENSE MEDICAL
EXAMINATION REPORT
 
A.    
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion for an order compelling delivery of medical reports shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2032.650.) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) 
 
B.    
Legal Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2032.610 provides: 
 
(a) If a party
submits to, or produces another for, a physical or mental examination in
compliance with a demand under Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), an
order of court under Article 3 (commencing with Section 2032.310), or an
agreement under Section 2016.030, that party has the option of making a written
demand that the party at whose instance the examination was made deliver both
of the following to the demanding party: 
(1) A copy of a
detailed written report setting out the history, examinations, findings,
including the results of all tests made, diagnoses, prognoses, and conclusions
of the examiner. 
(2) A copy of
reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition of the examinee made
by that or any other examiner. 
(b) If the option
under subdivision (a) is exercised, a copy of the requested reports shall be
delivered within 30 days after service of the demand, or within 15 days of
trial, whichever is earlier. 
 
“If the party at whose instance an examination was made fails to make a
timely delivery of the reports demanded under Section 2032.610, the demanding
party may move for an order compelling their delivery. This motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2032.620(a).)   
 
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel delivery of medical reports under this section, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2032.620(b).) Sanctions
may be awarded even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition
to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the
moving party after the motion was filed. (CRC Rule 3.1348(a).)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds Plaintiff has met his meet
and confer obligations. (Jackson Decl., ¶¶ 7-9; Ex. “D.”)
 
Plaintiff argues the motion should be
granted because neither the initial report nor the supplemental report provided
by Dr. Feuerman complies with Code of Civil procedure § 2032.610(a)(1)
because neither reports contains “diagnoses, prognoses, or conclusions.” Upon
review of the subject reports attached as Exhibit C to the Declaration of
Jackson, the Court agrees. The reports set forth Dr. Feuerman’s review
of Plaintiff’s current symptoms, his review of Plaintiff’s medical records, and
a history of Plaintiff’s symptoms and treatment from the subject incident. The
reports do not contain any diagnoses, prognoses, or conclusion. If Dr. Feuerman
had none, then such should be clearly reflected. Therefore, the unopposed motion
is granted.
 
In
connection with the motion, Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant
and/or the attorney in the sum of $2,060, representing 4 hours incurred at the
hourly rate of $500, plus $60 filing fee. (Jackson Decl., ¶ 11.) Because the motion is unopposed
and therefore no reply was necessary, the request for sanctions is granted in
the reduced amount of $1,560 for 3 hours incurred at the hourly rate of $500,
plus $60 filing fee. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel is
GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide a code compliant medical examination
report regarding the examination of Plaintiff on January 29, 2024 within 30
days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against
Defendant and its counsel of record is GRANTED in the sum of $1,560. Defendant
and its counsel of record are ordered to pay this amount within 30 days of this
order.
