  Case Number:  20STCV03322    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  57 The Court is denying the Motion of Plaintiff Jack Moy for Relief from the Waiver of His Failure to File an Opposition to the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication as to Moy's claims.  The Motion for Relief was filed under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b).   It is based on the proposition that Moy's failure to file an opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication was attributable to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect of Moy's counsel  -- all of which are permissible bases for relief under Section 473(b). Moy's counsel and the paralegal for counsel submitted declarations that seek to establish the presence of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect to explain the failure of counsel to file an opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication.   In the Court's view, however, those declarations fall short of the mark to show  mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect set forth in  Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 229-230 and Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1206.  Because the Court is denying Moy's Motion for Relief, the Court's ruling on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication as to Moy's claims stands.   The Court is denying the Defendants' request that sanctions be imposed on Moy and his counsel for filing the Motion for Relief.
