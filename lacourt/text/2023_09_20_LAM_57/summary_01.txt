And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of plaintiff Jack Moy for relief from the waiver of his failure to file an opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b), which allows relief from a waiver if the failure was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The declarations submitted by Moy's counsel and paralegal failed to meet the standard set forth in two California Court of Appeal cases, and therefore the judge is denying the motion. As a result, the court's ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication stands. The court is also denying the defendants' request for sanctions against Moy and his counsel for filing the motion for relief.

## English Text Summary

The Judge is denying Plaintiff Jack Moy's request for relief from the consequence of missing the deadline to oppose Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. 

Moy's lawyer and paralegal argued that the missed deadline was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the Judge found their explanations insufficient according to legal precedent set by Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. and Hearn v. Howard.  

As a result, the Court's previous ruling on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment stands. Additionally, the Judge denied Defendants' request to impose sanctions on Moy and his lawyer for filing the Motion for Relief.
