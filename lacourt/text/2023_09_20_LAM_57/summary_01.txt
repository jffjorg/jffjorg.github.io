And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of plaintiff Jack Moy for relief from the waiver of his failure to file an opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b), which allows relief from a waiver if the failure was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The declarations submitted by Moy's counsel and paralegal failed to meet the standard set forth in two California Court of Appeal cases, and therefore the judge is denying the motion. As a result, the court's ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication stands. The court is also denying the defendants' request for sanctions against Moy and his counsel for filing the motion for relief.

The judge denied Plaintiff Jack Moy's request to overturn the previous ruling that dismissed his case. Moy's attorney had argued that their failure to respond to the defendant's motion for summary judgment was due to a mistake or oversight. However, the judge found that the attorney's explanations were not convincing enough to warrant overturning the initial ruling. The judge also rejected the defendant's request to impose penalties on Moy and his attorney for filing the request.
