And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition without prejudice due to the lack of a properly filed birth certificate by the Petitioner. Without this documentation, the court is unable to confirm the Petitioner's age or identify their parents for service. The Petitioner is allowed to file a new petition with a birth certificate and may also file proof of service on the other parent or a declaration explaining why such service could not be made. The court clerk will give notice of this decision.
