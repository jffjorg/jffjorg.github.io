And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a petition for a name change. The petition is currently on hold pending further information. The Judge has ordered the petitioner to file a declaration by January 27, 2025, explaining the circumstances surrounding the issuance of an active protective order that restrains them, and why the Court should not require them to notify the court that issued the protective order of their name change request. Alternatively, the petitioner can file evidence that they have already notified the court of their name change request. The petitioner is also required to appear at the continued hearing on February 10, 2025, to answer any further questions the Court may have.
