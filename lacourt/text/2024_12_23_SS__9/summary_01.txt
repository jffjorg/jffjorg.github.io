And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to change name and has granted it. The Petitioner is required to review the proposed decree for spelling and legibility. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name on the proposed decree, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
