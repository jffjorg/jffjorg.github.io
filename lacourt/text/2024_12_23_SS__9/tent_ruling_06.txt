The Criminal History assessment
reflects an active protective order restraining Petitioner.
Petitioner is ordered to file a
declaration no later than February 10, 2025 explaining (1) the circumstances of
the issuance of the protective order against Petitioner and (2) why the Court
should not require Petitioner to alert the Court that issued the protective
order of Petitioner’s request for name change so that the protective order can
be updated to reflect Petitioner’s new name. 
Alternatively, Petitioner may file no later than February 10, 2025 evidence
that Petitioner has already alerted the Court that issued the protective order
of the instant petition for name change so that the protective order can be
updated to reflect Petitioner’s new name. 

Petitioner is also ordered to appear
(either in person or remotely via LACourtConnect) at the continued OSC hearing
to answer any further questions the Court may have after reviewing Petitioner’s
declaration. Court Clerk to give notice.
