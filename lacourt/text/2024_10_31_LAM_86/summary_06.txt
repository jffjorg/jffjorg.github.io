And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession. The application with respect to defendant Lee Justrich is denied because there is no proof of service that the application and supporting documents were served. In contrast, the application with respect to defendant LJ Logistics, Inc is granted because the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property, namely three 2022 Wabash DVLSHPC Dry Van Trailers.

The judge also strikes a portion of the proposed order that stated there was probable cause to believe that the trailers are located at a different address. The plaintiff has not demonstrated probable cause that the trailers are at any location other than the address specified in the Loan and Security Agreement.

The judge orders a redelivery bond in the amount of $25,000 for each trailer, based on the current fair market value of each trailer. The plaintiff's request to include its litigation costs in the redelivery bond is denied.
