And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Counsel Corin L. Kahn is continued to November 14, 2024. The motion does not include proof of service on the client or other parties, and there is a discrepancy between the email addresses for Jessica McLean. The judge has ordered counsel to serve and file supplemental papers to remedy these defects and has continued the trial setting conference to December 19, 2024.
