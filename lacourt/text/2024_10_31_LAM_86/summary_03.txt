And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the petition for writ of administrative mandamus filed by the City of Riverside (Real Party in Interest) is sustained. The petitioner, Bryant Farnham, is challenging the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board's denial of a request for a status conference. The judge finds that the petition is defective because the Superior Court of California lacks jurisdiction to review the order of the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, as granted by Labor Code § 5955. The judge will hear from the petitioner on how to cure the jurisdictional defects before denying leave to amend.
