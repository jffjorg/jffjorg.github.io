And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Ontario's motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to enjoin the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA) from reducing the quantity of water available to be purchased by the City of Ontario. The City of Ontario contends that it still has the right to first purchase under the Regional Contract, which expired on January 2, 2023. However, the judge found that the City of Ontario failed to show a "real threat of immediate and irreparable injury due to the inadequacy of legal remedies." The judge also found that the IEUA has no plans to refuse to honor the City of Ontario's right of first purchase in the future and that the IEUA needs the revenue from the sale of recycled water to pay for its operations and debt. As a result, the judge did not consider the likelihood that the City of Ontario would prevail on the merits or the balance of harms that would result from the proposed preliminary injunction.
