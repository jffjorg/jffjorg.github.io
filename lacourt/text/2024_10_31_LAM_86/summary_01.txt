Laws and Statutes:
  - Welfare and Institutions Code sections 12300, et seq.

Agreements:

Roles:
  - Petitioner: Rosalia Discoe

Significant Statements:
  - "The weight of the evidence shows that the recipient engages in dangerous behaviors, cannot remember or understand the dangers that he encounters and does not retain sufficient judgment to avoid or stop them from occurring."
  - "It is determined that the level of supervision typically expected to be necessary for caring for unimpaired children of that age would involve either preventing or closely supervising the above activities so as to ensure the child's safety."
  - "The additional supervision required must be significantly more than routine child care, and not only be related to the functional limitations of the child, but also allow the child to remain safely in their own home with this assistance."
  - "It is not unusual for an unimpaired child of the same age as the [minor] to test his physical limits by holding his hand close to a hot stove surface, even when warned by a loving parent not to do so."
