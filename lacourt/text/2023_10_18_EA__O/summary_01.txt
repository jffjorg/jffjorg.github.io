```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment against the Defendants. The Judge finds that default was improperly entered against the Defendants because they were not properly served with summons and complaint. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs are the judgment creditors in the underlying action, and that Defendant Chen transferred his assets to his daughters, Irene and Winnie Chen, who then transferred the real property to the Trustee. The Judge also finds that the substituted service of summons and complaint does not meet the required standards, as it lacks a declaration of diligence that personal service upon the Defendants was attempted, and does not provide sufficient information about the address and the person served. Therefore, the application for default judgment is denied.
