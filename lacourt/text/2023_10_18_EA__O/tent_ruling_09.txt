[1] Except as to the 5th
COA as it fails as a matter of law.
 


[2] The complaint
interchanges between classroom assistant and teacher; it is unclear whether the
individual who first gave permission was a teacher or classroom assistant. The
court will use the terminology as used in the specific allegation.  


[3] For this reason, as
the complaint does not disclose the fact, the School District improperly
discusses Plaintiff’s placement in an Individualized Education Program (I.E.P.)
as a Special Education student (“SPED”) with a disability. (Motion p. 3.) Thus,
even if an I.E.P. affords consent to use hands on care for a student including
restraints (Motion p. 3), that argument will not be used in the court’s
analysis. 


[4] This would be
another reason to grant the MJOP as since the duty of a government agency can
only be created under statute or ‘enactment,’ the statute or enactment claimed
to establish the duty must at the very least be identified in the complaint.
(Motion p. 6, quoting Searcy v. Hemet Unified Sch. Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.
App. 3d 792, 802.) 
 


[5] The Unruh Civil
Rights Act, California Civil Code sections 51 through 52, provides protection
from discrimination by all business establishments in California. The Brennan
court held that a school district is not a "business
establishment" and therefore cannot be liable for disability
discrimination under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. Therefore, this COA
fails as a matter of law. 
 


[6] The School District
also argues that the 7th COA fails because “Ms. [sic] Franco was a
bit overzealous in his efforts” in controlling Plaintiff (Motion p. 11-12), but
whether Franco was reasonable with his conduct exceeds the scope of an MJOP
wherein the factual allegations are taken as true.
