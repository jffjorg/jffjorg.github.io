Summary:

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and enter a stipulated judgment, as the default against the Defendants has not been set aside. The Plaintiff seeks to enforce a settlement agreement and enter a stipulated judgment against the Defendants, but the Judge finds that the default entered against the Defendants on December 15, 2022, remains and has not been set aside. The Judge concludes that the entry of the stipulated judgment would be improper, as the Defendants are precluded from opposing the motion and the default has not been set aside.
