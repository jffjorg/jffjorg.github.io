And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a pending court case involving the School District and a plaintiff whose identity is not specified. The plaintiff has made several claims, including allegations of discrimination and the use of restraints in a classroom setting. The School District has argued that the plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because the plaintiff did not properly identify the legal basis for the claims and because the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not apply to a school district. The judge agrees that the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not apply, and has also ruled that the School District's discussion of the plaintiff's placement in an Individualized Education Program (I.E.P.) was improper. The judge has also declined to consider the School District's argument that a school staff member, Ms. Franco, was reasonable in her conduct. The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after further consideration and argument by the parties.
