[1] Plaintiff contends that the heightened pleading
standard for a fraud-based cause of action does not apply because this is fraud
based upon nondisclosure or concealment. (Opp. pp. 1-2, citing Alfaro v.
Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384-85.) (The Reply does not address this contention.) Indeed,
less particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the
opposing party, but facts are still required. Unlike Alfaro, for
example, which involved a statutory duty to disclose deed restrictions in a
real estate transfer disclosure statement, the plaintiffs at the very least
pled facts about discussions with defendants. With that, the appellate
court held that the plaintiffs were not required to plead the discussions as to
each of the 38 defendants because the defendants likely had records of their
dealings with plaintiffs. (Id.). Here, however, Plaintiff has not pled
facts as to the specific transmission defect nor how the non-publicly available
information pertained to that specific transmission defect. Therefore,
absent basic facts as to fraud, the court need not distinguish between less or
more facts. Â
