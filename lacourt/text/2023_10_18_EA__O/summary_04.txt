And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the situation of Amaro, who may or may not still be employed with the City of San Dimas. Although the parties sometimes use the past tense to discuss Amaro's job, it is unclear whether she is currently working for the City. However, since the motion indicates that Amaro has been working at the City "the entire time this litigation has been pending", the Judge will presume that she is still an employee. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff joined the City in 2019 and Amaro has worked at the City for about eleven years. The ruling does not specify any financial amounts or legal statutes, but does mention that counsel Vera has been involved in various civic and legal matters involving the City and its residents.
