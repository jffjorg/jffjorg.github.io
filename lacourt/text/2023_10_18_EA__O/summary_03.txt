```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the City of San Dimas's motion to disqualify counsel Ronald T. Vera and The Vera Law Group from representing Plaintiff Hector Kistemann. The City alleged that a conflict of interest exists because Genevieve Amaro, a niece of Ronald T. Vera, works at the City of San Dimas and was Plaintiff's direct supervisor. However, the court finds that the mere hypothetical possibility that Amaro could divulge information is insufficient to create a conflict of interest, particularly when there is no evidence that Amaro has any information. The court concludes that disqualification would serve no legitimate purpose and would unfairly deprive Plaintiff of trial counsel of his choice.
