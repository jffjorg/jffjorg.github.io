And here is the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Judge is considering the Plaintiff's contention that the heightened pleading standard for a fraud-based cause of action does not apply because the fraud is based on nondisclosure or concealment. The Judge notes that less particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposing party, but still requires facts. The Judge references a previous case, Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc., which involved a statutory duty to disclose deed restrictions in a real estate transfer disclosure statement. Unlike that case, the Plaintiff has not pled facts about specific discussions with defendants, nor how non-publicly available information pertains to the specific transmission defect. Therefore, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not met the basic requirements for pleading fraud and does not need to distinguish between less or more facts.
