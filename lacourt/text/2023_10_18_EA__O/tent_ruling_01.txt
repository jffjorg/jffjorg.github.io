  Case Number:  20PSCV00186    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative
Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’ APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT is DENIED because
default against Defendants was improperly entered. Plaintiffs are to re-serve
Defendants with service of summons and complaint. 
 
Background
 
This case pertains to an unpaid judgment. Plaintiffs JINGLANG SUN and
LINJIA QIU (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege the following against Defendants
ZHI ANG CHEN aka MICHAEL CHEN, individual (“Defendant Chen”); IRENE CHEN, an
individual; WINNIE CHEN, an individual; CHIH WEI LEE (“Trustee”), individually
and trustee of the CHIH WEI LEE RETIREMENT TRUST dated January 01, 2009; and
Doe Defendants: Plaintiffs are the judgment creditors in Jinglang San, et
al. v. Zhi Ang Chen, LASC Case Number 18PSCV00009 (the Underlying Action)
filed October 26, 2018 against defendant Chen to collect an unrepaid loan.
Judgment in the Underlying Action was entered on January 28, 2020 against Chen
in the amount of $153,348.47. However, after demanding repayment of the loan,
Defendant Chen transferred his assets (including real property) to his
daughters, Irene and Winnie Chen, who then transferred the real property to the
Trustee. 
 
On March 6, 2020, Plaintiffs filed suit. 
 
On March 16, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint for: 1.     
Uniform Voidable Transactions Act 2.     
Declaratory Relief 3.     
Aiding And Abetting
 
On May 8, 2020, Plaintiffs filed proof of substituted service (POS) as
to each four Defendant. 
 
On August 3, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Settlement. 
 
From September 17, 2020 to September 28, 2021, a few OSCs re dismissal
were filed. 
 
On September 28, 2021, the court issued the following minute order:
Plaintiff's counsel indicates payments pursuant to the settlement are still
ongoing. Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Order to Show Cause Re:
Dismissal (Settlement) Pursuant to CCP Section 664.6 scheduled for 09/28/2021
is continued to 03/02/2022 at 08:30 AM in Department R at Pomona Courthouse
South.
 
On December 20, 2021, the court clerk entered default as to all
Defendants. 
 
On January 19, 2022, Plaintiffs dismissed Chih Wei Lee, individually and
trustee of the Chih Wei Lee Retirement Trust Dated January 01, 2009. Doe
Defendants were not dismissed in this request for dismissal. (Thus, the
remaining Defendants are Defendant Chen and his two daughters, Irene and
Winnie.) 
 
Between March 2, 2022 and August 16, 2023, various minute orders were
filed, namely regarding the settlement. On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel
informed the court that default judgment material had been filed but rejected
due to clerical errors. 
 
On August 18, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant application for entry
of default judgment. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs seek default judgment against Defendant Chen, Irene Chen, and
Winnie Chen in the amount of $144,123.47, including $143.348.47 of damages. 
 
The only defect with the application is that Doe Defendants have
not yet been dismissed, which is mandatory for default judgment. (See Cal.
Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.) 
 
That said, default is
denied for a reason aside from the application: default was improperly entered
against Defendants because they were not properly served.[1]

 
CCP section 415.20 provides that “[i]f a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered
to the person to be served  . . . a summons may be served by leaving a
copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house, usual
place of abode, usual place of business . . . in the presence of a competent
member of the household . . . at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed
of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of
the complaint by first-class mail . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20(b).) When
using substituted service as to an individual defendant, a good faith effort at
personal service must first be attempted. I.e., there must be a showing
that summons “cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered” to the
individual defendant. (See Rutter Group, D. Service of Summons, Cal. Prac.
Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 4-D, citing Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) Two or
three attempts to personally serve defendant at a “proper place” ordinarily
qualifies as “reasonable diligence.” (Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) 
 
Here, the only filings related to POS are the 5/08/23 filings. As to
each, service is explained as follows: a registered California process server
(Rod Collins) served each Defendant with a first amended complaint (and other
documents) by substituted service on 4/10/2020 at 3 PM at 1313 Grand Ave. II348
Walnut, Ca. 91789 by leaving the aforementioned
documents with “Kevin Jin—Owner CPA Mail Service” and thereafter mailing the
documents via first-class, postage prepaid. But the POS’ do not (1) provide a
declaration of diligence that personal service upon Defendants was
attempted, (2) whether the address is Defendants’ abode, and (3) whether Kevin
Jin is a competent member of the household. 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the application for default judgment is denied
because Defendants have not been properly served with summons and complaint.[2]
