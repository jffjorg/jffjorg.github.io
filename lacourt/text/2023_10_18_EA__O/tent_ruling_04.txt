it is unclear whether Amaro is
currently employed with the City because the parties occasionally use the past
tense to discuss Amaro’s job. (E.g., Motion p. 3: 24-25 [Amaro “worked at the
City of San Dimas]; see Opp., Vera Decl., ¶6 [“I know she enjoyed

at the City for about eleven years. (Motion p. 4:6-9.)
 


[3] According to his declaration, counsel Vera has been
involved in various civic and legal matters which involve the City of San Dimas
and its residents.
