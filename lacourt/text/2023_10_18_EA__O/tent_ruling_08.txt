DEFENDANT HACIENDA LA PUENTE
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT’S 
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE
PLEADINGS (MJOP) is GRANTED. The court will hear from Plaintiff
as to whether leave to amend should be granted.[1]
 
Background
 
This case arises from a minor’s alleged injuries incurred in
school. Plaintiff MASEN MEDINA, a minor, y and through his Guardian ad Litem
Wendy Olivas (“Plaintiff”) alleges the following against Defendants HACIENDA LA
PUENTE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“School District”) and LUIS FRANCO (“Franco”):
One day in elementary school, Plaintiff asked for permission to “take a few
moments to himself.” (Complaint ¶8.) The classroom assistant agreed, and
Plaintiff “walked to the classroom exit to sit near the door.” (¶9.) But the
teacher[2]
mistakenly though Plaintiff was attempting to leave, so called a second
classroom assistant, Mr. Franco, who then grabbed Plaintiff by both arms,
pulled Plaintiff, became angry, twisted both of Plaintiff’s hands and arms, and
broke Plaintiff’s left radius. (¶10-14.) Plaintiff sustained bodily injuries. 
 
On November 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit for: 1.    
Assault 2.    
Battery 3.    
Intentional Infliction Of Emotional Distress (IIED) 4.    
Negligence (Including Neglient Infliction Of Emotional
Distress (Nied)) 5.    
Violation Of The Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civil Code§§
51, 51.5, 51.7, 52) 6.    
Violation Of The Bane Act (Cnil Code §52.2) 7.    
Negligent Hiring, Retention And Supervision
 
On March 20, 2023, the School District filed the instant
MJOP.
 
On August 31, 2023, during the hearing on the MJOP, Defense
Counsel informed the Court that the parties are working towards a Settlement
Agreement. Thus, the parties stipulated to continue the hearing to 10/18/23. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
It is well established in California
that either prior to trial or at the trial the plaintiff or the defendant may
move for judgment on the pleadings and that the appropriate ground for such a
motion is the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the failure to
state a cause of action or defense.  (Dobbins v. Hardister (1966)
242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791; see also Sofias v. Bank of America (1985)
172 Cal.App.3d 583, 586 [The non statutory motion for judgment on the
pleadings can be made at any time, even during trial, since the grounds for a general
demurrer are never waived.]; Code Civ. Proc., § 438.) 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can
be judicially noticed. (Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198) (emphasis added).
Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Id.; Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)[3] 
Both a demurrer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings accept as true all
material factual allegations of the challenged pleading, unless contrary to law
or to facts of which a court may take judicial notice.  (Mechanical
Contractors Assn. v. Greater Bay Area Assn. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672,
677; Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp, (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15,
27.)  On a motion for judgment on the pleadings a court may take judicial
notice of something that cannot reasonably be controverted, even if it negates
an express allegation of the pleading.  (See Columbia Casualty Co.
v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457,
468-469; Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 540, 549.) 
 
“Matters which are subject to mandatory judicial notice may be treated
as part of the complaint and may be considered without notice to the
parties.¿¿[Citation.]¿¿Matters which are subject to permissive judicial notice
must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits.”¿ (Schabarum¿v. California
Legislature¿(1998)¿60 Cal.App.4th¿1205, 1216, fn. 5.)¿¿“Judgment on the
pleadings does¿not depend upon a resolution of questions of witness credibility
or¿evidentiary conflicts.¿¿In fact, judgment on the pleadings must be denied
where there are material factual issues that require evidentiary
resolution.”¿¿(Id.¿at¿1216.)¿ In ruling on a [motion for a judgment on
the pleadings], the court must “liberally construe[]” the allegations of the
complaint. ¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the
plaintiff, not the defendant.” ¿(Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
 
Leave to amend should be granted
if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good
cause of action.  (Virginia G. v. ABC Unified School Dist. (1993)
15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852.)  
 
Discussion
 
The School District moves for judgment as to all causes of
action (COAs) on various grounds including, inter alia, (i) the COAs fail to a
statutory basis,[4] (ii)
fail to plead specific, factual allegations, and (iii) the 5th COA
for violation of the Unruh Act is an impermissible COA as recently held the by
the court in Brennon B. v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2020)
57 Cal.App.5th 367.[5] 
 
Here, the court grants the motion because each COA is
conclusory pled. In actions against public entities and their employees,
California law requires a plaintiff to meet a heightened pleading standard and
requires a complaint to allege specific factual allegations to establish the
elements of each and every claim in the complaint. (Motion p. 5, citing Searcy,
supra, 177 Cal. App. 3d at p. 802 [“[T]o state a cause of action every fact essential to the existence of
statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity.”].) For example, as to
1st COA (assault) and 2nd COA (battery), Plaintiff pled
the conclusory elements of an assault and battery claim. (See Complaint
¶17 [“committed acts which resulted in imminent apprehension of harmful and/or
offensive contact with Plaintiff’s person”]; see ¶22 [“committed acts which
resulted in imminent apprehension of harmful and/or offensive contact with
Plaintiff’s person.”].) As for the IIED COA, Plaintiff conclusively pleads
“[d]efendants engaged in outrageous conduct” (¶27) without pleading specific
allegations as to what conduct of the School District was extreme and
outrageous. Or as to the 6th COA for violation of the Bane
Act—wherein a defendant is liable if he or she interfered with or attempted to
interfere with a plaintiff’s constitutional rights by the requisite threats,
intimidation, or coercion—Plaintiff regurgitates the elements of the COA.
(¶47.) And as to the 7th COA, Plaintiff conclusively pleads the
School District had a “duty to hire, train, and supervise an adequate number of
competent and fit employees” without articulate what if anything the classroom
teacher failed to do to supervise his conduct or safety on the date of
Plaintiff’s incident.[6]
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, absent specific, factual allegations
(and lack of alleged statutory liability), the court grants the MJOP.
