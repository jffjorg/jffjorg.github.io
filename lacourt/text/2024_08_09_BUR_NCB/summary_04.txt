Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the motion for protective order filed by Ford Motor Company. Ford sought to modify the model protective order to protect its confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information. The court allows Ford to modify paragraph 7 to clarify the term "affiliated attorneys" and to add language requiring non-lawyer individuals to sign Exhibit A. The court also allows Ford to modify paragraph 8 to prohibit the use of confidential materials on websites or document repositories. However, the court strikes paragraph 7(f) which permits mock jury participants to access the documents.

The court also allows Ford to modify paragraph 21 to clarify the process for returning or destroying confidential documents at the conclusion of the case. The court requires Ford to make a written request before returning the documents, so that Plaintiffs are aware of when the clock starts to run on their obligation to return documents.

The court orders the parties to cooperate in drafting the finalized version of the protective order and to provide a copy for the court's signing.
