Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended answer by United Aeronautical Corporation (UAC). The motion seeks to assert two new affirmative defenses, the Privette defense and the Witt-Jackson offset defense. The Court has granted the motion, allowing UAC to file the amended answer.

The case involves a wrongful death lawsuit filed by several plaintiffs against UAC and other defendants, alleging that UAC was responsible for a fatal explosion at a facility operated by National Technical Systems, Inc. (NTS) in Fullerton. The explosion occurred on May 27, 2021, and killed an employee of NTS, Jesse Siordia.

UAC filed its answer to the complaint on October 20, 2023, but has now moved to amend its answer to assert the two new affirmative defenses. The Privette defense is an exception to the peculiar-risk doctrine, which shields a hirer of an independent contractor from liability for the death or injury of the contractor's employee. The Witt-Jackson offset defense is a doctrine that limits the ability of an employer or its insurer to obtain reimbursement out of an injured worker's recovery against a third party, such as UAC, where the employer's own negligence contributed to the worker's injuries.

The Court has granted the motion, finding that the liberal policy favoring amendments to the pleadings is strong and that the new affirmative defenses are properly supported by the moving papers. The Court has ordered UAC to file a separate copy of the first amended answer electronically following the hearing on this matter.

The parties are also ordered to meet and confer to determine whether they need to continue the November 12, 2024 trial date to conduct discovery on the new affirmative defenses or to file a motion for summary judgment.
