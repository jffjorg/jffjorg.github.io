And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Marisol Holguin Pina, alleges that she slipped and fell on an external staircase at an apartment complex owned/leased/occupied by the defendant, J.K. Residential Services, Inc., and that the defendant was negligent in maintaining the premises. The defendant argues that service of the summons and complaint was improper because it was not done in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45 and 415.46, which govern service of summons in actions for unlawful detainer. The judge agrees with the defendant, finding that the service was improper and granting the motion to quash. The judge notes that the service was attempted by posting and mailing the documents, but that this is not a valid method of service for a non-unlawful detainer action. The judge also finds that the agent for service of process, Ritesh Desai, did not personally receive the summons and complaint, which further supports the defendant's argument. The judge's ruling is pending until the next court hearing.
