[1] The Court notes
that the complaint fails to allege what specific statements were made in the
marketing material (brochures, television commercials, and radio
commercials).  Plaintiffs also do not
allege the identity of the agent they spoke to at the time of purchasing the
vehicle, what statements were made, how they were made, etc.  The 3rd cause of action is for
fraudulent concealment.  To the extent
Plaintiffs were attempting to allege fraud based on an affirmative
misrepresentation, they have not pled the elements of fraud with the requisite
specificity.
