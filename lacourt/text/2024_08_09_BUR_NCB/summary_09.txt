And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The plaintiffs, Benedict Fernandes, Christina Fernandes, and Lily Fernandes, allege that the defendant concealed a transmission defect in a new 2021 Honda Pilot that they purchased. The defendant demurred to the third cause of action, arguing that it fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against it.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, finding that the fraudulent inducement – concealment cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule. The judge has also declined to discuss whether the fraud cause of action was adequately pled with specific facts.

In addition, the judge has taken the motion to strike off-calendar as moot, as the demurrer to the third cause of action has been sustained. The defendant shall provide notice of this order.
