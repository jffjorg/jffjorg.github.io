And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of West Hollywood's motion to bifurcate the issues of liability and damages in this personal injury case. The City argued that bifurcation would promote judicial efficiency and reduce the likelihood of inflaming or misleading the jury. However, the judge found that the case does not present complicated issues and that bifurcation would actually increase the time for trial and cause unnecessary complexity. The judge also found that the City has not shown how the convenience of witnesses would be promoted by granting this motion, and that the possibility of prejudice is not sufficiently probable to justify the inherent inefficiency of consolidation. As a result, the judge has denied the City's motion and the case will proceed to trial without bifurcation.
