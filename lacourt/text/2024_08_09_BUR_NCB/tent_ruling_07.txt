 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
On July 8, 2024,
Defendant Ihab N. Aziz, M.D. (“Defendant”) filed 3 motions to compel initial responses
from Plaintiff Warda Dagher (“Plaintiff”) for: (1) Form Interrogatories
(“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set one; and (3) Request
for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  
On April 2, 2024,
Defendant served on Plaintiff the discovery requests.  Plaintiff requested and Defendant granted an extension.  As of the filing of the motions, Defendant states
that he has not received responses from Plaintiff.  
Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Plaintiff
is ordered to provide verified responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.    
Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney in the amount of
$1,311.65 per motion (= [1.5 hours to prepare the motion + 1.5 anticipated
hours to review the opposition + 2 anticipated hours for the hearing at
$250/hour] + $61.65 for filing fees).  The
requests are granted but in the total, reasonable sum of $750 in attorney’s
fees for these relatively simple, identical motions and $184.95 in filing fees.  Plaintiff and his/her counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $934.95 to Defendant, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
