[TENTATIVE] order
  RE: 
motion to quash
  service of summons and complaint



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff SMK Diversified
Investments LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed an unlawful detainer complaint against
Defendant Annie Mae, LLC regarding the property located at 9074 De Garmo Ave,
Unit C, Sun Valley, CA 91352.  Plaintiff is alleged to be the owner of the
premises.  Plaintiff alleges that on September
1, 2023, it entered into a written Commercial Lease Agreement with Defendant.  (Compl., Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was served
with a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit on April 27, 2024 and the period for
Defendant to comply expired on April 27, 2024. 
Plaintiff seeks possession of the premises, costs incurred in this
proceeding, past due rent of $39,000, reasonable attorney’s fees, and forfeiture
of the agreement.      
B.    
Motion
on Calendar 
On July 26, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to quash service of the
summons and complaint.    
The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant moves to quash Plaintiff’s service of the summons and
complaint.  Defendant argues that service
was not properly effectuated on its agent for service of process, Eric E.
Hughes.  
            The proof of service of the summons
and complaint (filed July 15, 2024) states that Defendant was served by
substituted service on July 12, 2024 at 11:06 a.m. by leaving the documents
with Domineque McCall (front desk security) at Defendant’s place of business
located at 9074 De Garmo Ave C, Los Angeles, CA 91352.  The authorized agent for service of process
is identified as Eric E. Hughes.  The
documents were thereafter mailed on July 12, 2024 to Defendant through Eric
Hughes at the aforementioned address.  Service
was effectuated by Pablo Lopez, a registered process server.  
Defendant provides a copy of the Statement of Information of Defendant
filed with the State of California, Secretary of State on December 12, 2023,
which shows that Mr. Hughes’ address for service of process is located at 27847
Conestoga Dr., Rolling Hills Est., CA 90274. 
(Mot., Ex. B.)  In contrast, as
summarized above, the process server served Defendant at 9074 De Garmo Ave C by
leaving the documents with a front desk security guard.  Here, service was not properly effectuated on
Defendant by serving its authorized agent for service of process.   
The motion to quash service of the summons and complaint is
granted.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Defendant Annie Mae, LLC’s motion to quash
service of the summons and complaint is granted.  Defendant shall provide notice of this order.
