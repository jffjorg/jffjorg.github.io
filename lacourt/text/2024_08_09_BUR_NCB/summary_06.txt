Summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Mariano Meza Servin Jr.'s motion to compel Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s further responses to Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs) Nos. 15, 17, and 22-31. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant breached its warranty contract and seeks further responses to RPDs related to the Defendant's policies and procedures for handling warranty claims. The Defendant objected to the RPDs and argued that it has no written policies or procedures for handling warranty claims, and that it would provide different documents in the spirit of cooperation. The Court notes that the motion is not accompanied by a separate statement and advises the Plaintiff to file a separate statement or a concise outline detailing what discovery requests and objections are at issue for future motions. The Court also orders the parties to meet and confer about limiting and precisely defining the specific defect at issue in RPD No. 30.
