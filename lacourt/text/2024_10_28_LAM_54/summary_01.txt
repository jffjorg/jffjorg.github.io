And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors, James Chen and Eugenia Hsu, in their motions for an Assignment Order and a Charging Order. The motions are granted.

The Judge finds that the Debtors, Yi Hu, Qiushi Liang, and Agape Home Health Services, Inc., have made no payments towards the over $1 million judgment awarded in this action. The Judge orders an accounting to determine the appropriate amount of any assignments.

The Assignment Order will require the Debtors to assign payments from Julie Lili, LLC, Agape Home Health Services, Inc., Medicare, Medi-Cal, and other entities to the Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors. The Judge also grants a charging order to apply the judgment debtor's interest in Julie Lili, LLC towards the satisfaction of the judgment.

The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.510 and 708.310, which provide for the assignment of payments and the charging of a judgment debtor's interest in a limited liability company. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors are entitled to these relief based on the facts of the case.
