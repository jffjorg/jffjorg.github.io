Roles:

  - Plaintiffs: Filing the complaint and failing to provide timely and adequate responses to discovery requests
  - Defendant: Filing the motion to compel further responses and seeking to impose sanctions on Plaintiffs' counsel

Significant Statements:

  - "The non-privileged objections lack support."
  - "The form of question objections lack merit."
  - "The burden of proof to establish the communication was not confidential or that the privilege does not for other reasons apply lies with the opponent of the claim of privilege."
  - "A party is entitled to physician patient privilege."
  - "The court lacks the resources to address the sheer volume of Plaintiffs and number of objections presented."
