SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 1, 2022, plaintiffs Jonatan Lopez, et al. filed a complaint for Negligence,
and Premises Liability, due to a fire occurring on July 4, 2020, which was exacerbated
by alleged substandard conditions and maintenance of the premises identified as
8651 N. Wilbur Ave., Northridge. March 30, 2023, FCA US LLC answered the
complaint.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant Excel Residential Services, Inc. moves to compel further
responses to request for production of documents, numbers 1-43 from plaintiffs

by and through her guardian ad litem Erika Rivera, Reigna Segovia, Oscar
Segovia, by and through his guardian ad litem Reigna Segovia, Luis Mejia, by
and through his guardian ad litem Reigna Segovia, and Raul Escobar Hernandez. The
dispute involves the request for general categories of documents to which
Plaintiff alleges numerous unmeritorious objections. 
 
Plaintiffs in a one day late opposition decries the volume
of propounded discovery and the difficulty in coordinating and obtaining
responses from each individual Plaintiff. Even with acknowledged discovery
extensions, Plaintiff was unable to present responses, thereby leading to
service of objections without any supporting argument for said objections other
than perhaps an effort to avoid a motion and order to compel initial responses
without objections. Notwithstanding several months of extensions and delays,
Plaintiffs now provided limited responses, with certain responses still
outstanding, but completed by Christmas. [See partially incorporated
Declaration of Mary Keshihysan.] Plaintiffs request the court refrain from
imposing sanctions. 
 
The court electronic filing system shows no reply at the
time of the tentative ruling publication date.
 
The non-privileged objections lack
support. The court addresses the general standards.
 
The form of question objections lack merit. Defendant may
not intentionally misconstrue a work for obstreperous purposes. “Indeed, where the question is somewhat
ambiguous, but the nature of the information sought is apparent, the proper
solution is to provide an appropriate response.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783 superseded by
statute on unrelated ground as stated in Guzman
v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.) Defendant
lacks support for the objections on vague and ambiguous to Judicial Council
drafted form interrogatories.
 
“But ‘[f]or discovery purposes,
information is relevant if it “might reasonably assist a party in evaluating
the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement….” [Citation.] Admissibility is not the test and
information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead to
admissible evidence. [Citation.] These rules are applied liberally in favor of
discovery [citation], and (contrary to popular belief), fishing expeditions are
permissible in some cases. [Citation.]’ (Citations.)” (Cruz
v. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 646, 653–654.) The
subject Judicial Council drafted interrogatories seek relevant information
regarding the information relevant to the case brought by Plaintiff. Plaintiff
cannot pick and chose how much information will be disclosed based on
unsupported parameters.
 
The
burdensome and oppressive objections also lack merit. Objecting parties must
file evidence detailing the amount of work involved, in order to support
objections based upon burden and oppression. (West Pico Furniture Co. v.
Sup. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) “[S]ome burden is inherent in
all demands for discovery. The objection of burden is valid only when that
burden is demonstrated to result in injustice.” (Id. at p. 418.) Plaintiff
otherwise failed to file a protective order.
 
The equally available objection lack support. (Bunnell v. Sup.Ct. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d
720, 723–724.) The
premature expert testimony objection also lacks support. Plaintiff can
respond to the request without relying exclusively on expert witness
disclosure. (See Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729, 751.) 
 
The court also reviews the privilege
objection standards.
 
The attorney-client privilege attaches to a confidential
communication between the attorney and the client and bars discovery of the communication
irrespective of whether it includes unprivileged material.” (Costco Wholesale
Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 734.) The transmission
of information between third parties and counsel also maintain attorney client
privilege protection, if the communication is in further interest of the
client. (Evid. Code, § 952.) “Once that party establishes facts necessary to
support a prima facie claim of privilege, the communication is presumed to have
been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the
burden of proof to establish the communication was not confidential or that the
privilege does not for other reasons apply.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 733.) 
 
The work product privilege applies where the sought after
documents contains Defendant’s “impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal
research or theories,” the information is protected by the work product
doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030(c).) “An
objecting party may be entitled to protection if it can make a preliminary or
foundational showing that answering the interrogatory would reveal the
attorney's tactics, impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in
opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or
efforts”].) (Coito v.
Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th
480, 502.) Notes, statements, and impressions of the case are protected
by the work product doctrine. A list of potential witnesses is not work
product. (Id. at p. 495; Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217–218.)
 
Plaintiff references a privacy objection, but no actual
objection appears in any of the responses. [Declaration of Kelly Chan.]
Regardless, the court addresses the standard. “Privacy interests generally fall
into one of two categories: (1) an interest in making intimate personal
decisions or conducting personal activities without observation, intrusion, or
interference (‘autonomy privacy’); and (2) an interest in precluding the
dissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information (‘informational
privacy’).” (Ortiz v. Los Angeles Police
Relief Assn. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1301.) “[I]ndividuals have a
legally recognized privacy interest in their personal financial information.” (International
Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Sup.
Ct. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 330.) The objecting party has the burden to file
evidence of the preliminary facts establishing a privilege exists. (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
557; HLC
Properties, Limited v. Sup. Ct. (2005) 35
Cal.4th 54, 59.) 
 
Tax returns are privileged, but the privilege is not
absolute. (Schnabel v. Superior Court
(1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 720; Deary
v. Superior Court (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1080.) The privilege protects
all entries made on tax returns such as amounts of income reported, deductions
claimed, etc. In other words, the content of the return, as well as production
of the returns themselves, is privileged. 
(Sav-On Drugs, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 1, 7 [“Assuming
Revenue and Taxation Code section 7056 protects the returns themselves, it is
reasonable to conclude that it must also protect the information contained in
the returns”].) A compelling reason for discovery must be presented. (Fortunato v. Superior Court (2003) 114
Cal.App.4th 475, 483.)
 
A party is
entitled to physician patient privilege. A
patient may continue to exercise a reasonable expectation of privacy of their
medical information if the information is not directly relevant to a particular
condition the patient placed in issue. (California
Consumer Health Care Council v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 21, 31.) “‘The patient thus is not obligated to sacrifice all
privacy to seek redress for a specific mental or emotional injury; the scope of
the inquiry permitted depends upon the nature of the injuries which the
patient-litigant himself has brought before the court.’” (Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 864.) “‘The party
seeking the constitutionally protected information has the burden of
establishing that the information sought is directly relevant to the claims.
[Citation.]’ [Citation.]”  (See Barrenda L. v. Superior Court (1998) 65
Cal. App. 4th 794, 801-802.) The standard for good cause requires the moving
party to produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be
relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence. (Vinson
v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) “[A]n implicit waiver of a party's constitutional rights
encompasses only discovery directly relevant to the plaintiff's claim and
essential to the fair resolution of the lawsuit… [¶] … On occasion her privacy
interests may have to give way to her opponent's right to a fair trial. Thus
courts must balance the right of civil litigants to discover relevant facts
against the privacy interests of persons subject to discovery.” (Id. at p. 842.) 
 
The court declines to address each and
every privilege objection given the summary objections and conclusive arguments
seeking to compel further responses. The non-privileged objections are
overruled. Plaintiffs are ordered provided verified responses to all
non-privileged responses, and produce a privilege log for each and every
plaintiff regarding each and every objection applicable to said party and the
documents withheld. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.240, sub.
(c), 2031.250, 2031.310, subd. (a).) Sanctions against Plaintiffs’ counsel for
$250 payable within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, sub. (h).) Failure
to comply with the order may lead to a motion for evidentiary, issue, or even
terminating sanctions if Plaintiffs withhold information. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, sub. (i).)
 
The court lacks the resources to address
the sheer volume of Plaintiffs and number of objections presented. Continued
blanket objections requiring individual, voluminous consideration may be referred
to a discovery referee at the cost of both parties.

courts must balance the right of civil litigants to discover relevant facts

particular response does resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by
a motion is a matter best determined by the trial court in the exercise of its
discretion, based on the circumstances of the case. In many cases involving
untimely responses, the propounding party will take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions. If the propounding
party proceeds with the motion, however, the trial court has the discretion to
rule on the motion. The trial court might compel responses without
objection if it finds no legally valid responses have been provided
to one or more interrogatories; it might deny
the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions; it might
treat the motion as one under section 2030.300 and either determine that
further answers are required, or order the propounding party to “meet and
confer” (citation) and file a separate statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it might take the motion off calendar, thereby requiring
the propounding party to file a motion under [citation].” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.)  The court lacks any copies of the
purported responses, and therefore grants the motion. The court also declines
to address each and every privilege objection given the summary objections, conclusive
arguments seeking to compel further responses, and lack of any
address/admission to the objections as a form of extending the response
deadline. The non-privileged objections are overruled. Plaintiffs are ordered provided
verified responses to all non-privileged responses. The court declines to make
a finding of a compelling response to any potentially privileged items, and
orders production of a privilege log with regards to the document production. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.210, subd. (a)(1-2), 2031.220, 2031.240, 2030.300, subd.
(a).) Continued privileged objections may be addressed as part of any potential
motion following supplemental responses, if applicable.  Plaintiffs brought this action, and must
comply with the requirements of discovery, especially given the several months
of extensions and cooperation by Defendant. Because the motion was the only way
to compel any factual responses, as a matter of court policy, the court imposes
sanctions against Plaintiffs’ counsel for $250 payable within 30 days. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, sub. (h).) Failure to comply with
the order may lead to a motion for evidentiary, issue, or even terminating
sanctions if Plaintiffs withhold information. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (e), 2031.310, sub. (i).) The court lacks the resources to address
the sheer volume of Plaintiffs and number of objections presented. Continued
blanket objections requiring individual, voluminous consideration may be
referred to a discovery referee at the cost of both parties. Insufficient
factual responses thereby compelling a second set of motions to compel further
responses and/or further excuses for failing to gather information will also be
subject to a referee referral. Trial
remains set for June 3, 2024. Defendant
to give notice.
