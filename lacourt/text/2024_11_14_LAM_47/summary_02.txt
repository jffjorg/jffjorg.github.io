And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The defendants had moved to dismiss the plaintiff's PAGA claim, alleging that the plaintiff's claims lacked merit. The judge found that the defendants had failed to properly apply the relevant facts and evidence to each theory asserted in the complaint, and therefore had not carried their burden to demonstrate that the plaintiff's claims lacked merit. The judge noted that the defendants' moving papers did not properly marshal the evidence and did not provide adequate citations to support their claims. The judge's ruling is without prejudice to a future motion for summary judgment that complies with all procedural and statutory requirements.
