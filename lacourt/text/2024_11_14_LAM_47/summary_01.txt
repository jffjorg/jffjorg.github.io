And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal the entire record. The plaintiff claimed that if the record were not sealed, she would be "blacklisted" as a tenant and this would irreparably prejudice her ability to rent in the future. However, the judge found that the plaintiff offered no evidence to support this claim beyond her bare conclusions. Additionally, the judge noted that the record is not an action for unlawful detainer, and therefore, the interest that the plaintiff articulates does not support sealing the record. The judge also found that the proposed sealing of the entire record is not narrowly tailored to the claimed interest.
