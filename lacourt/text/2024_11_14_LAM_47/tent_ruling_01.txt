STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a tort action for battery, trespass, and negligence. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Hyland was employed by the other Defendants as a
property manager, and, while so employed, sexually harassed and physically
attacked Plaintiff, who was a tenant at a property owned by Defendants.
 
Plaintiff moves to seal the entire
record. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to seal the entire
record. 
 
            The sealing
of court records is governed by California Rules of Court rules 2.550 and
2.551.  (Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 60, 68.)  The presumption of open access to court records
does not apply to “records that are required to be kept confidential by
law.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(a)(3).) A party seeking to
seal a court record or seeking to file a record under seal must do so by motion
or application supported by a declaration showing facts justifying the record’s
sealing.  (Id., rule 2.551(b)(1).)  
California Rules of Court rule
2.550(d) states: “The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
(1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes
the right of public access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the
record; 
(3) A substantial probability exists that the
overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; 
(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored;
and 
(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the
overriding interest.”  
            Once sealed, a record can only be unsealed by order of
court.  (Id., rule 2.551(h)(1).)  So long as it
remains under seal, all parties must refrain from filing anything not under
seal that would disclose the sealed matter.  (Id., rule
2.551(c).)  If a party files a new document referring to sealed
matter, it must submit an unredacted version of the document under seal and a
redacted one for the public record.  (Id., rule
2.551(b)(5); H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th
879, 889.) 
Plaintiff contends that it is
necessary to seal the entire record because, if the record were not sealed,
Plaintiff would be “blacklisted” as a tenant who was subject to an unlawful
detainer action, thereby irreparably prejudicing her ability to rent in the
future. Plaintiff offers no evidence of this risk beyond her bare, unsupported
conclusions in her supporting affidavit. (See Declaration of Olenna Taskey ISO
Mot.)  Moreover, contrary to Plaintiff’s
assertions, this is not an action for unlawful detainer. Thus, the interest
which Plaintiff articulates, whether overriding or not, does not support
sealing the record and will not be prejudiced by the record remaining unsealed.
Further still, Plaintiff’s proposed sealing of the entire record is, on its
face, not narrowly tailored to the claimed interest. For these reasons,
Plaintiff’s motion to seal is fatally deficient.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Seal is DENIED.
 
            Moving Party
to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
