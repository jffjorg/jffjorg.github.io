And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering an application by defendant Haresh Jogani to set the amount of the receiver's undertaking. The receiver, Aaron J. Kudla, has already posted an initial undertaking of $10,000. The plaintiff, Shashikant Jogani, argues that this application is an improper motion for reconsideration, as the court did not consider or decide the issue of the amount of the undertaking. However, the judge finds that this application is not an improper motion for reconsideration, and that the court has the inherent authority to reconsider the issue of the amount of the undertaking.

The judge notes that the statutory scheme provides for two different types of undertakings: one by a party who applies ex parte to appoint a receiver, and one by the receiver himself or herself before becoming receiver. The judge finds that the receiver was required to give an undertaking in a sum set by the court, and that the amount of the undertaking should be determined based on the nature and value of the assets to be controlled by the receiver, the likelihood that these assets would be dissipated, the risk of any action having a negative impact on the assets, and the length of time the receivership might be in place.

After considering the totality of the circumstances, the judge sets the amount of the receiver's undertaking at $100,000. The judge finds that this amount is reasonable, given the value of the assets controlled by the receiver ($8 billion) and the likelihood that some actions could have a negative impact on the assets. The judge also notes that the receiver could not feasibly obtain an amount anywhere near the size of the receivership estate, and that setting a prohibitively large undertaking would not serve the interests of justice.
