And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a petition filed by Rich Horizons, LLC to approve the transfer of structured settlement payment rights by payee R.M. The petition is procedurally defective for two reasons. First, the petitioner did not provide the required information about the payee, including their name, address, and age, as required by Insurance Code §10139.5(c). Second, the petitioner did not provide sufficient information for the court to determine whether the transfer is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, including the financial terms of the transaction. The court also denies the petition on the merits, finding that payee R.M. waived the right to independent legal or financial advice and did not properly ensure that the transfer was fair, reasonable, and in their best interest.
