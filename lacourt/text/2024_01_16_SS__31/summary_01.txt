And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the California Highway Patrol's (CHP) unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Answer (FAA) to the plaintiff's complaint. The FAA seeks to add an affirmative defense regarding the liability of the plaintiff and his parents for allegedly violating several Vehicle Code statutes. The judge found that the proposed amendment is properly formed and does not cause undue prejudice to the opposing party. The judge also noted that the CHP's counsel became the handling attorney in this matter on August 22, 2023, and discovered grounds for affirmative defenses for a counterclaim based on evidence provided in discovery. The motion was filed on October 18, 2023, and the judge granted the motion due to the lack of opposition. The CHP is ordered to file a separate copy of the proposed FAA within ten days of the date of this order.
