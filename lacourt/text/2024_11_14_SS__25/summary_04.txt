**Summary**

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Petitioner's Amended Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award. The Petitioner failed to properly serve the Respondents with the Petition and Notice of Hearing, and the Court continued the matter for further service. The Award amount is corrected to $29,707.95. The Judge notes that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1283.6, 1285, 1285.4, 1288, 1288.4, and 1290.4 are satisfied, but the service requirements are not.
