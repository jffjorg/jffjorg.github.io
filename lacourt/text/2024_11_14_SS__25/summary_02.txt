And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for December 26, 2024. The new trial date is set for July 1, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The judge found that good cause exists for the continuance due to the unanticipated circumstances in the status of the case, including the delay in serving the defendant with the complaint and the lack of progress in the case since the complaint was filed. The judge also took into account the proximity of the original trial date and the lack of prejudice to the parties.
