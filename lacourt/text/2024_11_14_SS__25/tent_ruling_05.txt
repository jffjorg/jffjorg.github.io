ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On May 21, 2024, Arbitrator Anita Rae
Shapiro (the “Arbitrator”) with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
Dispute Resolution Services, issued an Arbitration Award in favor of Petitioner
Zhen Liu (“Petitioner”) and against Respondent Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith (“Respondent”). (Petn., ¶¶ 3-5, Exh. 2.) The Award requires
expungement of all references to Occurrence Number 2191837 from the
registration records maintained by the CRD for Petitioner. (Petn., Exh. 2.) The
CRD is a database maintained for FINRA for firms and individuals that
participate in the U.S. Securities industry.
 
On June 14, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Verified Petition to Confirm FINRA Dispute Resolution Arbitration Award
(the “Petition”) against Respondent and FINRA. FINRA was named as a respondent
as required by FINRA Rule 2080 (Petn., ¶ 4, Exh. 1), and Petitioner filed proof
of personal service on FINRA of the Verified Petition, Notice of Hearing, and
associated papers. (6/24/24 Proof of Service.) However, Petitioner did not name
Respondent as a party to the action.
 
On July 30, 2024, FINRA filed a
response stating it does not oppose confirmation of the Arbitration Award or
the expungement relief therein. However, FINRA noted that the “other party to
the underlying action (Respondent Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated (‘Merrill Lynch’) is not named in this action and the time for it
to seek vacatur has not lapsed.” (Response, p. 2.) 
 
On September 18, 2024, Petitioner
served Respondent with Proof of Service of the Verified Petition, Notice of
Hearing, and associated papers via mail. (9/18/24 Proof of Service.)
 
On October 1, 2024, the Court
continued the Petition hearing to November 14, 2024 due to the Court’s
unavailability and calendar congestion.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
As an initial matter and as noted by
FINRA in its Response to the Petition, Petitioner has failed to name Respondent
as a party to this action. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard 
 
“Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.”  (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource
Consultants¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)  “Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior court must select one of only four
courses of action: it may confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc.¿(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled
that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely
narrow.”  (California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  
 
“Neither the trial court, nor the
appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the
evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award
because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the
award’s face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, 21 Cal.App.5th at pp.
1063-64.) 
 
 
IV.             
Discussion

 
A. Filing Requirements (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4
states: “A petition under this chapter shall: 
 
(a)   Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement. 
(b)   Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy
of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
            Here,
Petitioner sets forth in the Petition, and files a copy of, the agreement between
the parties to arbitrate their dispute with FINRA (“Arbitration Agreement”) as
well as a copy of the Arbitration Award. (Pet. ¶¶ 1-5, Exh. 2.)  Petitioner also sets forth the name of the
Arbitrator, Anita Rae Shapiro, with FINRA Dispute Resolution Services and
submits a copy of the Arbitration Award, titled “Award,” which was written and
signed by the Arbitrator Anita Rae Shapiro and awarded in favor of Petitioner
and against Respondent. (Pet., ¶¶ 1, 4-5, Exh. 2). 
 
            Thus,
Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4.
 
B. Service of the Petition, and
Notice of Hearing (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4)
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4
states, in pertinent part:  
 
(a)   “A copy of the petition and a written
notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon
which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice. 
(b)   If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” 
 
Here, the Arbitration Agreement does
not provide the manner in which service shall be made, and Respondent has not
previously appeared in the proceeding. Thus, Respondent must be served in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action within this
state. On June 24, 2024, Petitioner filed proof of service that on June 21,
2024, FINRA was properly served with the Petition, Notice of Hearing, and
accompanying papers by personal service. On September 18, 2024, Petitioner
filed proof of service that on June 24, 2024, Respondent was served with the
Petition, Notice of Hearing, and accompanying papers by electronic service.
However, electronic service is not a valid manner of service of summons in California.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 415.10-415.95.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the service
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 are not satisfied.
 
C. Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the
award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified
mail or as provided in the agreement.”¿ 
 
“A petition to confirm an award shall
be served and filed not later than four years after the date of service of a
signed copy of the award on the petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to
correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the
date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.” (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 1288.) 
 
“No petition [to confirm arbitration
award] may be served and filed … until at least 10 days after service of the
signed copy of the award upon the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) 
 
“[B]efore a court can enter an
arbitrator’s award as its judgment, the parties must have the notice of the
award. … ‘[T]he superior court is without jurisdiction to act further in the
matter until the parties are served or otherwise obtain actual notice of the
award.’ ” (Domingo v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transp. Auth.
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 550, 554.) 
 
Here, the Arbitration Award states
that it was served on the parties on May 21, 2024 but does not include a proof
of service. (Pet., Exh. 2.) Thus, Section 1283.6 is not satisfied.
 
In addition, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by serving and filing a petition no
more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award was
served.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1288,
1288.4.) Here, the Arbitration Award was served on May 21, 2024, and the
Petition was filed more than 10 days and less than four years later, on June
14, 2024. Thus, the Court finds the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections
1288 and 1288.4 are satisfied.

Based on the foregoing, Petitioner
Zhen Liu’s Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award is DENIED
