Margaha and Jackie T. Hashimoto (“Respondents”) and Does  1-10.  (Petn., p. 1.) Pursuant to Civil  Code section 798.61, Petitioner seeks an order deeming Respondents’ Mobilehome,  described as 22325 S. Main St., Space 124, Carson, CA 90745, Decal/License No. LAB3698,  Serial Nos. S15224 and S15224X (the “Mobilehome”) at Petitioner’s Mobilehome park,  Laco Mobile Home Park, 22325 S. Main St. (the “Park”) to be abandoned and for  an award of rent/storage fees, costs, and attorney’s fees. (Pet., Prayer.)    Following Respondents’ failure to  respond, default was entered against them on August 19, 2024. That same day, Does  1-10 were dismissed without prejudice. (8/19/24 Request for Dismissal.)    II.                  Legal  Standard & Discussion    Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”— Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)               Pursuant  to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “‘abandoned mobilehome’  means a mobilehome about which all of the following are true:   (A) It is located in a mobilehome park  on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for the preceding  60 days. (B) It is unoccupied. (C) A reasonable person would believe  it to be abandoned. (D) It is not permanently affixed to  the land.”   Regarding the above requirements,  Petitioner submits the declaration of Hector Ceja, the on-site manager for  Petitioner and the Mobilehome Park. (Ceja Decl., ¶ 1.) Therein, Ceja states  that the Mobilehome is located in a mobilehome park, no rent has been paid for  the Mobilehome in the preceding 60 days, the Mobilehome has been unoccupied since  April 1, 2024, and there is no indication that a person has entered the  Mobilehome since April 1, 2024. (Ceja Decl., ¶¶ 2, 7, 9.) Further, Ceja states the  Mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the land. (Ceja Decl., ¶ 18.)   Thus, Petitioner has demonstrated the Mobilehome  falls within the Section 798.61, subdivision (a), definition of  “abandoned.”    Notice of Belief of Abandonment — Civ. Code § 798.61(b) Civil  Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b) requires:    “After  determining a mobilehome in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome,  the management shall post a notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome  for not less than 30 days, and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United  States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known  address and to any known registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and  to any known holder of a security interest in the abandoned mobilehome.  This notice shall be mailed by registered or  certified mail with a return receipt requested.”   Petitioner submits a copy of a Notice  of Belief of Abandonment dated May 28, 2024. (Petn., Exh. 2; Ceja Decl., ¶ 12,  Exh. 3.) However, the Court notes a discrepancy – the Notice of Belief of  Abandonment is dated May 28, 2024, but Ceja states he posted the notice on May  22, 2024. (Ceja Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.)    Respondents are the only registered  owners of the Mobilehome according to a California Title Search run by Ceja. (Ceja  Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 13, 15, Exh. 1.)    The Notice of Belief of Abandonment  was posted on the Mobilehome and mailed, via certified mail, prepaid, on May  22, 2024 to Respondents at the Mobilehome address. (Ceja Decl., ¶¶ 13-14, Exh. 4.)  However, the notice was not mailed with return receipt requested. (Ceja Decl., ¶¶  13-14, Exh. 4; Petn., Exh. 3.)   Thus, the requirements of Section  798.61, subdivision (b), have not been satisfied.    Petition for Judicial Declaration — Civ. Code § 798.61(c) Civil Code  section 798.61, subdivision (c)(1) states:   “Thirty or more days following posting  pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior  court in the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial  declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this  subdivision is a limited civil case. Copies of the petition shall be served  upon the homeowner, any known registered owner, and any known person having a  lien or security interest of record in the mobilehome by posting a copy on the  mobilehome and mailing copies to those persons at their last known addresses by  registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested in the United  States mail, postage prepaid.”                 Petitioner  filed a proof of service demonstrating Respondents were served with the Summons,  Petition, Civil Case Cover Sheet Adddendum and Statement of Location, and  Alternative Dispute Resolution on January 23, 2024 via certified mail, and by  posting a copy of it on the Mobilehome. (7/30/24 Proofs of Service.) However, the  certified mail receipts do not indicate return receipt requested, and there is  no proof of service indicating the Notice of Hearing, Judgment, and Ceja  Declaration were served upon Respondents. (7/30/24 Proofs of Service.)    Thus, the service  requirements of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (c)(1), are not satisfied.     A.     Charges,  Attorney’s Fees, and Costs   Civil Code  section 798.61, subdivision (d)(2) states:   “If, at the hearing, the petitioner  shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned  mobilehome has been satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at  the hearing and tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall  enter a judgment of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the  petitioner is entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.”               While  Ceja states Petitioner does not seek storage fees or any monetary damages at  this time (Ceja Decl., ¶ 19), the Petition states the opposite. (Petn., Prayer.)  The Court finds the petition governing and addresses the storage fees request at  this time. Petitioner seeks monthly rental charges of $15.97 per day, which have  accrued from April 1, 2024. (Petn., ¶ 26, Prayer.) As to the request for attorney’s  fees and costs, Petitioner did not submit any evidence of the fees and costs,  such as a declaration from counsel discussing the hourly rate, time spent on  the matter, or total time billed. Thus, Petitioner is ordered to file  supplemental papers providing this information.    III.               Conclusion  & Order   The Petition to Declare  Mobilehome Abandoned filed by Petitioner Carson GP, LLC dba Laco Mobile Home  Park is CONTINUED TO JANUARY 14, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the  SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.    At least 16 court days  before the next scheduled hearing, Petitioner must file and serve supplemental  papers addressing the deficiencies noted herein. Failure to do so may result in  the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.     Moving party is ordered to  give notice.
