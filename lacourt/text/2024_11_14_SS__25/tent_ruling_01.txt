ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff Ofelia
Capristo (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Gerardo
Ayala Lopez (“Lopez”) and Cecilia Resendez (“Resendez”) (“Defendants”) and Does
1-20, alleging a Motor Vehicle cause of action. (Compl., pp. 1, 4.) The
underlying facts of this dispute involve Plaintiff sustaining injuries and
incurring damages from a motor vehicle collision between the parties at or near
West 11th Street and South Grand View Street. (Compl., p. 4, ¶ MV-1.) 
 
On September 14, 2023, default was
entered against Defendant Lopez. On January 24, 2024, the parties stipulated to
set aside the default. 
 
On January 29, 2024, Defendants filed
an Answer.
 
On August 27, 2024, the Court granted
the parties’ stipulation to continue trial from October 17, 2024 to February
19, 2025. (8/27/24 Order.)
 
On October 17, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition with Document Production
(the “Motion”) and Request for Sanctions. 
 
No Opposition was filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a)
provides:  
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” 
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  
            A motion under Section 2025.450,
subdivision (a), must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying
the production of the requested documents in the deposition notice. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).) Good cause is construed liberally and has
been found where documents are necessary for trial preparation. (See
Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 587.)
The motion must also “be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and
produce documents…by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).)
III.             
Discussion
 
Defendants seek to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff to determine the nature, extent, and causation of Plaintiff’s
claimed damages. (Motion, p. 5.)  Defendants seek to compel document
production to prepare for and conduct the deposition, verify whether Plaintiff
had a valid driver’s license to operate a motor vehicle, and verify whether
Plaintiff has needed and/or received additional medical treatment since Plaintiff
last provided her medical records to Defendants. (Motion, p. 7.) 
 
On January 22, 2024, Defendants’
counsel served Plaintiff’s counsel with a Notice Taking the Virtual Deposition
and Demand for Production of Documents for May 30, 2024 (the “Notice of
Deposition”) via email. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A.) Defendants’ counsel
served Plaintiff’s counsel with an Amended Notice of Deposition. (Yen-Yu Liu
Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel advised he was not available on that
date, suggested June 19, 2024 as an alternative, and stated a Spanish
interpreter would be necessary. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. C.) On May 17,
2024, Defendants’ counsel served Plaintiff’s counsel with an Amended Notice of
Deposition for June 19, 2024. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 8; Exh., D.) 
 
On the day before the scheduled
deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel to inform that
Plaintiff was no longer available for the deposition due to a health issue. (Yen-Yu
Liu Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. E.) Due to the late cancellation, Defendants incurred a
late cancellation fee. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 10.) Defendants’ counsel requested
that Plaintiff’s counsel provide Plaintiff’s July availability by June 24,
2024. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 11, Exh. G.) Defendants’ counsel received no
response from Plaintiff. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 13.) On July 11, 2024, Defendants’
counsel sent another Amended Notice of Deposition for July 25, 2024. (Yen-Yu
Liu Decl., ¶ 13, Exh. H.) On July 24, 2024, Defendants’ counsel emailed
Plaintiff’s Counsel to confirm the deposition set for the next day, received no
response, and sent the deposition link. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 14, Exh. I.) 
 
On July 25, 2024, neither Plaintiff
nor Plaintiff’s counsel appeared at the deposition. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 15;
Exh. J.) Defendants’ counsel emailed Plaintiff’s Counsel to inquire about the
nonappearance but received no response. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶¶ 15-16, Exhs. J,
K.) Defendants’ counsel received no response, and a Certificate of Non-Appearance
was taken. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 16, Exh., K.) Defendants incurred additional
costs. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl., ¶ 17.) 
 
Each of the Notices of Depositions
contained three Requests to Produce Documents: (1) a copy of Plaintiff’s
driver’s license or photo identification; (2) “[a]ny and all documents not
previously produced regarding the injuries or claims sustained in the accident
which is the subject of this lawsuit”; and (3) “[a]ny and all documents [Plaintiff]
reviewed in preparation for this deposition.” (Motion, p. 6, Exhs. A, B, D, H.)

 
Here, Defendants demonstrated they
served multiple notices of deposition upon Plaintiff, but Plaintiff repeatedly
failed to appear for deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) Further, Defendants’ counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel to inquire
about Plaintiff’s nonappearance at the July 25, 2024 deposition, and Defendants
alleged specific facts to demonstrate good cause exists for the document
production requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2); Motion,
p. 7.) Notably, Plaintiff did not file an opposition
demonstrating any reasons why this Motion should be denied. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants are entitled
to an order compelling Plaintiff to appear at the previously noticed July 25,
2024 remote deposition, and good cause exists to require the production of the
requested documents identified in the most recent Amended Notice. 
 
Thus, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED.
 
Sanctions
 
The Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450 provides that the court must impose monetary sanctions if a motion to
compel is granted under this section unless the one subject to sanctions acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances exist that would make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)

 
            Here,
Defendants’ Motion is granted. Accordingly, the Court must impose mandatory
sanctions. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
Defendants seek sanctions of $2,890.00,
reflecting 4 hours incurred on bringing the Motion at an hourly rate of $150.00,
plus 4 hours to review Plaintiff’s Opposition and prepare a Reply, 1 hour to
attend the motion hearing, and $1,690 on Spanish Interpreter fees. (Yen-Yu Liu
Decl., ¶ 18.) Plaintiff has not filed an Opposition demonstrating that
imposition of sanctions would be unjust or that she was justified in failing to
comply with discovery obligations. 
 
However, the amount sought is
excessive given the simplicity of this motion and the lack of Opposition and
Reply briefs. The Court finds $375.00 in attorney fees, based on 2 hours to
bring the Motion and .5 hours to attend the hearing at an hourly rate of $150.00,
to be reasonable. 
 
Defendants also request Spanish
Interpreter fees of $1,690 be included in the sanctions award. (Yen-Yu Liu Decl.,
¶ 18.) However, proof of cancellation fees have not been produced to the Court
as Exhibit “L” was omitted from the Motion. 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendants’ request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $375.00 in attorney
fees. The Court GRANTS Defendants’ request for sanctions for Spanish
Interpreter fees not to exceed $1,690 once Moving Party has produced proof of
invoice of cancellation to Defense counsel.
