And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and production of documents. The defendants had previously served multiple notices of deposition on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff repeatedly failed to appear for the deposition. The judge found that the defendants demonstrated good cause for the document production requests and that the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to appear for her deposition within 30 days of the order and to produce all documents contained in the notice of deposition no later than 3 court days prior to the deposition. Additionally, the judge has ordered the plaintiff and her counsel to pay sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,065 to the defense counsel within 30 days of the order.

The judge has also granted the defendants' request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $375.00 in attorney fees and has granted their request for sanctions for Spanish Interpreter fees not to exceed $1,690, pending the production of proof of invoice of cancellation to defense counsel.
