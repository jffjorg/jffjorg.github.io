ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff David Castillo
(“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, initiated this action against Defendants Miguel
Aguirre Reyes and Corona Millworks (“Defendants”). 
 
On June 21, 2024, Defendants each
filed a demurrer. No opposition was filed. 
 
On August 5, 2024, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrers with leave to amend; the Court ordered Plaintiff to file
a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) within 30 days of the order. (8/5/24 Order.)
In sustaining the demurrer, the Court found Plaintiff’s form complaint lacked
the cause of action form for negligence (PLD-PI-001(2)). While the Court noted
the traffic collision report attached to the Complaint may provide some
requisite facts, the Court found “none of the elements have been pled for a
cause of action for negligence, such as what acts or omissions Plaintiff
alleges Defendants performed negligently, because the cause of action form is
missing from the complaint.”  (8/5/24
Order.)
 
On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
FAC. 
 
On September 12, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Demurrers to Plaintiff’s FAC (“Demurrers”). Plaintiff did not
file an Opposition.
 
On October 1, 2024, the Court continued
the hearing on the Demurrers to November 7 due to the Court’s unavailability
and calendar congestion. (10/1/24 Order.) On November 4, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Demurrers to November 14 due to the Court’s
unavailability and calendar congestion. (11/4/24 Order.) 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
“As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
A general demurrer may be
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under
section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) 
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
Meet and Confer
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five
days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
The Demurrers are accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a). (Demurrers, Spelder Decl.) However, there is a
discrepancy in the meet and confer statement – Robert de Spelder, attorney for
Defendants, declares that he spoke to Plaintiff “[o]n October 11, 2024, at 4:20
p.m.” regarding the FAC and Demurrers. (Demurrers, Spelder Decl. ¶ 5.) But the
declaration is dated one month earlier on September 12, 2024, which is also the
same day the Demurrers were served and filed. (Demurrers, Spelder Decl.; Demurrers,
Proof of Service.)
 
Demurrers 
 
Defendants demur to the FAC on the
basis it does not “state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”
(Demurrers, p. 3.) 
 
The elements for negligence are: (1) a
legal duty owed to the plaintiff to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3)
causation; and (4) damage to the plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) 
“Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms, without
specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are ‘limits to the
generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of action,
and ... the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are said to
have been negligently performed. He may not recover upon the bare statement
that the defendant’s negligence has caused him injury.’ [Citation].” (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.)  

 
A review of the FAC reveals that,
despite this Court’s prior order, Plaintiff has still failed to attach the
cause of action form for negligence (PLD-PI-001(2)). While Plaintiff attaches
additional documents from the traffic crash report that provide potentially
more of the requisite facts, the Court finds the same deficiencies exist as
were present with the original Complaint – namely, “none of the elements have
been pled for a cause of action for negligence, such as what acts or omissions
Plaintiff alleges Defendants performed negligently, because the cause of action
form is missing from the [FAC].”  (8/5/24
Order.) 
 
Accordingly, the unopposed Demurrers
are SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
IV.

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants Miguel
Aguirre Reyes and Corona Millworks’ Demurrers to the FAC is SUSTAINED WITH 20
DAYS’ LEAVE TO AMEND.

Amended Complaint within 20 days of this Court’s order.
