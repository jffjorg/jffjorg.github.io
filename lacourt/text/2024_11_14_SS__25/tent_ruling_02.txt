ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On June 29, 2023,
Plaintiffs Walter Linares and Nicholas Linares (“Plaintiffs”) filed an action
against Defendant Kenneth Bernard Wheeler, Jr. (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20
alleging Motor Vehicle and General Negligence causes of action. (Compl., pp. 1,
4, 5.) Service of the Complaint on Defendant occurred nearly a year later on
May 16, 2024. (6/6/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On June 17,
2024, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On October 22,
2024 Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Continue Trial (the “Motion”). 
No Opposition
was filed. 
 
II.                
Legal Standard & Discussion 
 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332, subdivision (c) states: “Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” Circumstances that may indicate good
cause include: the excused unavailability of a party, trial counsel, or
witness; the substitution of trial counsel if the substitution is required in
the interests of justice; the addition of a new party in certain circumstances;
a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts; or a significant, unanticipated
change in the status of the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, subd. (c)(1)-(7).)
 
The Court may also look to the
following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1)
proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,
extension, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the
continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the
problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) if the case is
entitled to preferential trial setting; (7) the court’s calendar; (8) whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) whether all parties have
stipulated to the continuance; (10) whether the interests of justice are best
served by the continuance; and (11) any other fact or circumstance relevant to
the fair determination of the motion or application.  (See generally Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(d)(1)-(11).)  
 
Here, the Court finds good cause
exists for a trial continuance. Defendant was not served with the Complaint
until nearly a year after the Complaint was filed. (Motion, p. 4; Bisnar Decl.,
¶ 3.) Even with the steep delay, Defendant promptly served an Answer and
written discovery on Plaintiffs in June 2024. (Motion, p. 4; Bisnar Decl., ¶
5.) However, Plaintiffs have failed to take any further action since the
Complaint, and Plaintiffs’ counsel has failed to provide Defendant’s counsel with
a status update since August 21, 2024, despite Defendant’s repeated attempts to
meet and confer. (Motion, pp. 4-6; Bisnar Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.) As a result,
Defendant has not been able to complete discovery, and the trial date is in
just a little over a month’s time. 
 
Given these unanticipated
circumstances in the status of the case, the proximity of the trial date, the
lack of prior continuances, and the lack of prejudice, the Court finds the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332.)    
 
Defendant requests a continuance
until at least July 1, 2025. (Motion, p. 7.) To ensure the parties have
sufficient time to complete all discovery, Defendant’s request is GRANTED. Trial
is CONTINUED TO JULY 1ST, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.. 
 
 
III.
