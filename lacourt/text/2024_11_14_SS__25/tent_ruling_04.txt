ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On August 22, 2023, Arbitrator John A.
Bonello (the “Arbitrator”) from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
issued an Award of Arbitrator in favor of Petitioner Forward Financing, LLC
(“Petitioner”) and against Respondents Fusion Exotics Inc., dba Fusion Exotics
(“Fusion Exotics”) and Gaston Gutierrez (“Gutierrez”) (“Respondents”) in the
sum of $29,755.20. (Pet. ¶¶ 6-8, pp. 18-19.) 
 
On April 22, 2024, Petitioner filed
the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“Petition”) as to
Respondents. 
 
On August 26, 2024, the Court noted
the Petition was filed timely, Petitioner had complied with nearly all
requirements. However, the Court noted that Respondents were not properly
served with the Petition and Notice of Hearing and thus continued the hearing
on the Petition. The Court ordered Petitioner to serve Respondents with the Petition
and Notice of Hearing at least 16 court days prior to the next scheduled
hearing and to file proof of service with the Court. (8/26/24 Order.)
 
On August 27, 2024, Petitioner filed
proof that the Petition was personally served on Respondents. No Opposition was
filed.
 
On August 28, 2024, Petitioner filed a
Declaration regarding Compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1286.
 
On September 5, 2024, Petitioner filed
a Notice of Hearing and proof of service by mail on Respondents.
 
On September 26, 2024, the Court found
the proof of service as to Fusion Exotics was incomplete and Petitioner failed
to provide proper notice of the hearing date as to both Respondents. Thus, the
Court continued the matter to allow Petitioner “one final opportunity to
properly serve Respondents with a Notice of Hearing that lists the correct time
and location of the hearing and to complete the Proof of Service as to
Respondent Fusion Exotics.” (9/26/24 Order.)
 
On October 1, 2024, Petitioner filed
proof of service of a new Notice of Hearing. 
 
No Opposition was filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
“Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.”  (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource
Consultants¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)  “Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior court must select one of only four
courses of action: it may confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc.¿(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled
that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely
narrow.”  (California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  
 
“Neither the trial court, nor the
appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the
evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award
because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the
award’s face.” (EHM Productions, supra, 21 Cal.App.5th at pp.
1063-64.) 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
A. Filing Requirements (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4
states: “A petition under this chapter shall: 
 
(a)   Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement. 
(b)   Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy
of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
            Here,
Petitioner sets forth in the Petition, and files a copy of, the Future Receipts
Sale Agreement containing an arbitration provision governing disputes between
the parties arising out of the agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). (Pet. ¶ 4,
Attach. 4(b), p. 6.)  Petitioner also
sets forth the name of the Arbitrator, John A. Bonello, from the AAA and
submits a copy of the Arbitration Award, titled “Award of Arbitrator,” which
was written and signed by the Arbitrator John A. Bonello and awarded in favor
of Petitioner and against Respondents in the sum of $29,707.95. (Pet., ¶¶ 5-8,
Attach. Exh. 8(c).) 
 
            The
Court notes an error in the Petition – ¶ 8(c) states the total award amount is $29,755.20;
however, the award total in the Arbitration Award is $29,707.95.
 
            Thus,
Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4. However, the award sum must be corrected to $29,707.95.
 
B. Service of the Petition, and
Notice of Hearing (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4)
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4
states, in pertinent part:  
 
(a)   “A copy of the petition and a written
notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon
which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice. 
(b)   If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” 
 
Here, the Arbitration Agreement does
not provide the manner in which service shall be made, and Respondents have not
previously appeared in the proceeding. Thus, they must be served in the manner
provided by law for the service of summons in an action within this state. On August
27, 2024, Petitioner filed proof that on May 23, 2024, Respondents were served
with the Petition by personal service. However, proof of service as to Fusion
Exotics was incomplete as it did not list the required details regarding the
person or authorized agent served on behalf of the corporation. (9/26/24
Order.) Further, Petitioner failed to properly serve Respondents with the
Notice of Hearing. (9/26/24 Order.) 
 
This is Petitioner’s third attempt to
effect proper service. On October 1, 2024, Petitioner filed a new Notice of
Hearing and proof of service that Respondents were served with a “Notice of
Notice of Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award” on September 27, 2024. While
the Notice of Hearing is proper, service by mail without a return envelope,
postage prepaid is not proper service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.30.)
Further, Petitioner failed to correct and file new proof of service of the Petition
as to Fusion Exotics as ordered by the Court on September 26, 2024. (9/26/24
Order.)  
 
Based on the foregoing, the service
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 are not satisfied.
 
C. Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the
award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified
mail or as provided in the agreement.”¿ 
 
“A petition to confirm an award shall
be served and filed not later than four years after the date of service of a
signed copy of the award on the petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to
correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the
date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.” (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 1288.) 
 
“No petition [to confirm arbitration
award] may be served and filed … until at least 10 days after service of the
signed copy of the award upon the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) 
 
“[B]efore a court can enter an
arbitrator’s award as its judgment, the parties must have the notice of the
award. … ‘[T]he superior court is without jurisdiction to act further in the
matter until the parties are served or otherwise obtain actual notice of the
award.’ ”(Domingo v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transp. Auth.
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 550, 554.) 
 
Here, the arbitration award includes
proof of service that the AAA served a copy of the arbitration award on
Petitioner and Respondents via first class mail and email on August 22, 2023.
(Petn., Attach. Exh. 8(c).) 
 
In addition, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by serving and filing a petition no
more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award was
served.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1288,
1288.4.) Here, the arbitration award was served on August 22, 2023, and the
original Petition was filed more than 10 days and less than four years later,
on April 22, 2024. 
 
Thus, the Court finds the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4 are satisfied.
