Background
 
In this employment action, Plaintiff
Elia Herrera (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint on February 7, 2024, alleging
disability discrimination, failure to provide reasonable accommodations,
failure to engage in the interactive process, and retaliation, as well as
wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and other claims against
her former employers, Defendants WePackItAll, LLC (“WPIA”) and Partners
Personnel-Management Services, LLC (“PPMS”). 
 
On April 2, 2024, Defendant PPMS
moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the parties’ arbitration agreement. On
April 4, 2024, Defendant WPIA joined the motion to compel arbitration.
Plaintiff opposed the motion to compel arbitration. 
 
On May 9, 2024, after hearing oral
argument, the Court granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed this
action pending the outcome of arbitration. (05/09/24 Minute Order at pp.
11-12.)  
 
On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to lift the arbitration stay pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1281.97 and 1281.99, on the grounds that Defendants “failed to timely
pay the arbitration filing fee in this matter . . . .” (Not. of Mot. at p. ii:
10-13.) Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant PPMS and its
counsel of record in the amount of $9,510.00. 
 
On September 4, 2024, Defendant PPMS
filed an opposition to the motion. On September 4, 2024, Defendant WPIA joined
the opposition. 
 
As of September 12, 2024, no reply
brief has been filed. Any reply brief was required to have been filed and
served at least five court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).) 
 
Legal Standard 
 
“Sections 1281.97 and 1281.98 each
prescribe procedures for payment and remedies for nonpayment of arbitration
fees and costs by the drafting party, i.e., the company or business that
included a predispute arbitration provision in a contract with a consumer or
employee.” (Williams v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th
1054, 1065.) “Both sections provide that a drafting party who fails in its
obligation to pay fees and costs required to initiate or continue the
arbitration within 30 days after the due date is in material breach of the
arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right
to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result
of the material breach.” (Id. at p. 1066.) “Consequently, even where an
arbitration has commenced, the employee or consumer may unilaterally elect[,]
among other alternatives, to [w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed
in a court or appropriate jurisdiction.” (Ibid., emphasis in original.)
“If the consumer elects to proceed in court to commence or resume litigation,
the consumer must . . . seek vacatur of a prior order compelling arbitration
and staying the litigation.” (Ibid.)  
 
“After an employee or consumer meets
the filing requirements necessary to initiate an arbitration, the arbitration
provider shall immediately provide an invoice for any fees and costs required
before the arbitration can proceed to all of the parties to the arbitration.
The invoice shall be provided in its entirety, shall state the full amount owed
and the date that payment is due, and shall be sent to all parties by the same
means on the same day.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.97(a)(2).) “To avoid delay,
absent an express provision in the arbitration agreement stating the number of
days in which the parties to the arbitration must pay the required fees or
costs, the arbitration provider shall issue all invoices to the parties as due
upon receipt.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.97(a)(2).) Section 1281.97 contains no
exceptions for a party’s delay to timely pay fees and “requires strict
enforcement.” (Espinoza v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761,
775.)
 
Should an employee move to vacate an
order compelling arbitration and succeeds on such motion, “the court shall
impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.” (Espinoza
v. Superior Court, supra, 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 774-75.)
“Section 1281.99, in turn, states that the court shall impose a monetary
sanction against a drafting party in the form of the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the employee or consumer as a
result of the material breach.” (Ibid.)  
 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendants
failed to timely pay the arbitration filing fee to the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) and, as such, Defendants are therefore in material breach
of the arbitration agreement. Defendant PPMS argues that it timely paid fees
and did not waive its right to compel arbitration. 
 
Plaintiff’s Evidence 
 
Plaintiff presents the declaration of
her counsel, Jackson Scalia (“Scalia”), in support of the motion. Attorney
Scalia relevantly states the following: On February 7, 2024, this action was
filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and Defendant PPMS filed a motion to compel
arbitration, to which Defendant WPIA joined. (Scalia Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) On May 9,
2024, this case was ordered to arbitration. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 9.) On or about
May 31, 2024, Plaintiff made a demand for arbitration with the AAA. (Scalia
Decl., ¶ 7.) On June 14, 2024, the AAA sent Defendant PPMS and its counsel an
invoice for the cost to initiate arbitration. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. 1.) 
 
The invoice has an “Invoice Due Date”
of June 14, 2024. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. 2.) The invoice provides that
“[u]nless instructed otherwise, invoice balance due upon receipt.” (Scalia
Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. 2.) The invoice also contains a section stating that the
“arbitration is subject to California Code of Civil Procedure 1281.97, and
payment must be paid within 30 days of the initial notice or the AAA will close
the parties’ case. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1281.97, the AAA is
unable to extend the payment deadline.” (Scalia Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. 2.) Attorney
Scalia states that thirty days from the date of the initial invoice is July 14,
2024. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 10.) On July 15, 2024, Attorney Scalia contacted the AAA
to inquire about the payment of fees and the AAA confirmed that Defendants had
not paid their filing fees. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. 3 at p. 5.) Attorney
Scalia informed the AAA that Plaintiff would be withdrawing the case from
arbitration due to the untimely payment of fees. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 12; Ex. 3 at
p. 4.) On July 16, 2024, Attorney Scalia states that a closure letter was
requested from the AAA and “Amie Chalie of [the] AAA responded that the matter
is proceeding and being assigned to a manager.” (Scalia Decl., ¶ 14; Ex. 3 at
p. 2.) 
 
Although not referenced in the
declaration of Attorney Scalia, on July 17, 2024, Attorney Scalia received
e-mail correspondence from Daphne Crayne, Manager of ADR Services at the AAA,
indicating that “[p]ayment for the administrative fee was made on July 15,
2024.” (Scalia Decl., Ex. 3 at p. 1.)  
 
 
Evidence Presented by Defendant PPMS 
 
In opposition to the motion, counsel
for Defendant PPMS, Kyla H. Buenaventura (“Buenaventura”), provides a
declaration. Ms. Buenaventura states the following: On June 14, 2024, the AAA
sent a letter via email addressed only to Brent Marlis and Linh T. Hua
requesting that the employer pay arbitration filing fees by July 15, 2024.
(Buenaventura Decl., ¶ 10; Ex. C.) On July 8, 2024, the AAA sent a letter to
Brent Marlis and Linh T. Hua stating that the AAA had not received payment from
the employer yet. (Buenaventura Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. D.) According to Ms.
Buenaventura, “[t]he letter again stated that the final date for payment was
July 15, 2024 and if payment was not made, the case would be closed.”
(Buenaventura Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. D.) On July 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel asked
the AAA whether the invoice for the arbitration been paid, to which Plaintiff’s
counsel was informed that it had not received payment, but that the case would
be closed if payment was not received by the close of business. (Buenaventura
Decl., ¶ 12; Ex. E.) Plaintiff’s counsel informed the AAA that he would
withdraw the case from arbitration. (Buenaventura Decl., ¶ 12; Ex. E.) In
response, the AAA provided copies of the two letters and informed Plaintiff’s
counsel that the final due date for the payment was July 15, 2024.
(Buenaventura Decl., ¶ 12: Ex. E.) On July 15, 2024, Defendant PPMS paid the
fee to the AAA by 2:56 p.m. on July 15, 2024. (Buenaventura Decl., ¶ 13; Ex.
F.) 
 
Defendants Failed to Timely Pay
Arbitration Filing Fees 
 
Initially, the Court finds that Ms.
Buenaventura does not accurately describe the letters sent to the parties’
counsel concerning the due date for the payment of fees. The June 14, 2024
letter states “[p]er the agreement submitted with this filing, the employer is
responsible for payment of the full filing fee, $2,450.00. Accordingly, we
request that the employer submit payment in the amount of $2,450.00 on July 15,
2024. Upon receipt of the balance of the filing fee, the AAA will proceed with
administration.” (Buenaventura Decl., Ex. C at p. 2.) However, the letter also
states that the arbitration is subject to Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.97 and the invoice was provided “in accordance with the statute.”
(Buenaventura Decl., Ex. C at p. 2.) Critically, the letter indicates that “[p]ayment
is due upon receipt and must be paid by 30 days from the Due Date provided on
the attached invoice or the AAA will close the parties’ case” and that section
1281.97 does not allow the AAA “to extend [the] payment deadline.”
(Buenaventura Decl., Ex. C at p. 2.) The June 14, 2024 letter states that “[i]f
the payment deadline falls on a weekend or a holiday, payment must be made by
the following business day under CCCP [sic] Section 12a.” (Buenaventura Decl.,
Ex. C. at p. 2.) 
 
The Court has reviewed the July 8,
2024 letter sent to the parties’ counsel and finds that Ms. Buenaventura’s
description of such letter is not accurate concerning the payment date being
July 15, 2024. Rather, the July 8, 2024 letter provides that the AAA had “not
yet received payment from the employer to cover the portion of the filing fee,
as described in [the] letter dated June 14, 2024. Please note in accordance
with California Code of Civil Procedure 1281.97 and 1281.98, the AAA will close
its case on July 15, 2024 if payment is not paid.” (Buenaventura Decl., Ex. D.
at p. 1.) Thus, it appears Ms. Buenaventura is conflating the statement that
the case would be closed on July 15, 2024 if payment was not made with a
definite due date articulated in such letter. The July 15, 2024 letter did not
articulate an explicit deadline of July 15, 2024 for Defendants to pay
arbitration fees. 
 
Taken together, neither the June 14,
2024 nor July 8, 2024 letters expressed a July 15, 2024 deadline for payment.
The June 14, 2024 letter clearly informed the parties that payment must be made
“by 30 days from the [d]ue [d]ate provided on the . . . invoice.” (Buenaventura
Decl., Ex. C at p. 1.) Thus, the invoice controls for purposes of ascertaining
the due date of payment. The invoice has a due date of June 14, 2024. (Scalia
Decl., Ex. 2.) It follows that Defendants were required to make payment within
30 days of that date, which would have required for payment to be effectuated
by July 14, 2024. The fact that July 14, 2024 was a Sunday also does not allow
the payment date to be extended to Monday, July 15, 2024.[1]
There is “no authority to alter the due date absent the parties’ agreement.” (Doe
v. Superior Court (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 346, 361.) Thus, Defendants were
required to pay the arbitration fees within 30 days of receipt of the invoice.
(Ibid.) 
 
The invoice controls in determining the
due date for the payment of fees and not the letters as Defendant PPMS argues.
Even if the letters created some confusion as to when payment was due, such
confusion is negated by the statement in the June 14, 2024 letter that payment
must be made by 30 days from the due date of the invoice. (Doe v. Superior
Court, supra, 95 Cal.App.5th 346, 361.) This is because such an
explicit instruction “clearly notified [defendants] payment needed to be
received” by a date certain. (Ibid.) 
 
There is no dispute that Defendants
did not pay the arbitration fees until July 15, 2024. As such, the Court finds
that the payment of such fees on July 15, 2024 was untimely pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.97. 
 
            Defendant
PPMS argues that the motion should be denied because Plaintiff has not been
prejudiced by the alleged delay in payment of arbitration fees and that any
delay in paying the fees was caused by Plaintiff’s failure to submit to binding
arbitration. (Opp’n at pp. 4-5.) Any analysis of prejudice fails because section
1281.97 “specifies no other required findings, such as . . . whether the delay
prejudiced the nondrafting party” and the material breach analysis focuses
solely on whether there was a “nonpayment of fees within the 30-day period . .
. .” (Espinoza, supra, 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 776.) 
 
            The Court
also rejects the argument of Defendant PPMS that Plaintiff’s failure to submit
to arbitration caused the delay of payment. The Court notes that Plaintiff
opposed the motion to compel arbitration. (Buenaventura Decl., ¶¶ 4-8.)
However, that is irrelevant in determining whether Defendants materially
breached the arbitration agreement, as section 1281.97 is “to be strictly
applied whenever a drafting party [fails] to pay by the statutory deadline.” (Espinoza,
supra, 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 776.) A court has no “discretion on the issue[]
of material breach.” (Ibid.) The “Legislature sought a clear and
unambiguous rule for courts to apply in determining whether late payment of
arbitration fees by a drafting party constituted a material breach of an
arbitration agreement.” (De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 740, 756.) 
 
            The Court
further finds that the argument of Defendant PPMS that it acted consistently
with its right to arbitrate is irrelevant. Defendant PPMS’ citation to Belyea
v. GreenSky, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2022) 637 F.Supp.3d 745 is inapposite because,
in such case, the court found that “9 U.S.C. § 2 [preempted] application of CCP
§ 1281.97” and that waiver principles did not apply. (Belyea v. GreenSky,
Inc., supra, 637 F.Supp.3d 745, 761.) Here, Defendant PPMS does not
make any argument concerning preemption. 
 
            The Court
also finds that Defendant PPMS’ citation to McLellan v. Fitbit, Inc. (N.D.
Cal. 2018) 2018 WL 3549042 is inapposite to support the argument that it acted
consistently with the right to arbitrate. McLellan did not even address section
1281.97. (McLellan v. Fitbit, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2018) 2018 WL 3549042. “A
case is not authority for a proposition not considered therein or an issue not
presented by its own particular facts.” (McConnell v. Advantest America,
Inc. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 596, 611.) 
 
            Here,
Defendants did not timely pay the required arbitration fees and are therefore
in material breach of the arbitration agreement under Code of Civil Procedure
1281.97. The Court will now address Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant PPMS and its counsel of record in
the sum of $9,510.00. Attorney Scalia’s hourly rate is $450.00 per hour and
Attorney Scalia spent nine (9) hours pertaining to the motion to compel
arbitration. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 16.) As to the instant motion, Attorney Scalia
spent five (5) hours researching and drafting the motion; spent one (1) hour on
the declaration in support of the motion; anticipates spending one (1) hour
reviewing the opposition and supporting papers; and anticipates spending three (3)
hours drafting the reply brief and supporting papers. (Scalia Decl., ¶¶ 18-21.)
Counsel anticipates spending one (1) hour preparing for and attending the
hearing on the instant motion. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 22.) In total, Attorney Scalia
has spent 21 hours in conjunction with the motion to compel arbitration and the
instant motion to lift stay. (Scalia Decl., ¶ 23.) Plaintiff will incur
attorneys’ fees of $9,450.00 due to Attorney Scalia’s time and efforts. (Scalia
Decl., ¶ 24.) A $60.00 filing fee was incurred for the instant motion. (Scalia
Decl., ¶ 25.) 
 
            Exercising
its discretion, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,460.00,
which represents twelve (12) hours of work on the instant motion plus the
$60.00 filing fee. The Court reduces the total hours given the relative brevity
of the motion and its lack of complexity. The Court will only impose sanctions
against Defendant PPMS and not its counsel as sanctions can only be imposed on
the drafting party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97, 1281.99.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to lift the
arbitration stay and reinstating the matter on calendar. Plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Defendant PPMS is ordered to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $5,460.00 within 30 days of the
date of notice of this order.
