  Case Number:  23PSCV03059    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff  Javier Alberto Mejia’s Motion to Stay Proceedings is GRANTED for a period of 45  days. An Order to Show Cause Re: Lifting of Stay is set for September 26, 2024.  Background Plaintiff  Javier Alberto Mejia (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he sustained injuries after he  was attacked by a pit bull.  On  October 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action  against Covina 023 Wood 026 LP (“Covina 026”), Covina 023 Woods 206, LP (“Covina  206”), Madelyn Vasquez (“Vasquez”), John Doe and Does 1-50 for (1) negligence;  (2) statutory liability—dog bite statute; (3) strict liability; and (4) premises  liability.  On  January 12, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the second and third causes of action  against Covina 026, without prejudice.  On  February 1, 2024, Covina 206 filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes of  action against Vasquez and Roes 1-25 for (1) equitable indemnification and  contribution; (2) declaratory relief; and (3) apportionment of fault.  Plaintiff’s  counsel is not in contact with Plaintiff and has filed a motion to stay the proceedings.  The hearing on the motion is scheduled for  August 12, 2024—the same day as the Case Management Conference.    Legal Standard  “Every  court shall have the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make  them conform to law and justice. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd.  (a)(8).)  “[F]or  good cause shown, [the Court] may make any order that justice requires to  protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or organization from  unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and  expense,” including a protective order “[t]hat the deposition not be taken at  all”; “[t]hat the deposition be taken at a different time”; or “[t]hat the  deposition be taken only on certain specified terms and conditions.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).)  The Court  also “may shorten or extend the time for scheduling a deposition, or may stay  its taking until the determination of a motion for a protective order under  Section 2025.420.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (d).)   Discussion Plaintiff  moves the Court, pursuant to its inherent authority and Code of Civil Procedure  §§ 128(a)(8) and 187, for a stay of the proceedings; in the alternative,  Plaintiff moves for a protective order, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§  2025.420(b) and 2025.270(d), staying his deposition.  Plaintiff’s  counsel Julie Lu (“Lu”) represents as follows:  On  May 20, 2024, Lu’s office received a “Third notice of Plaintiff’s Deposition”  from Covina 206. (Lu Decl., ¶ 3). Lu’s office subsequently tried to contact Plaintiff  via email and telephone, but was unable to reach him until May 30, 2024, when  Lu personally spoke with him and informed him of his noticed deposition. (Id.,  ¶ 4). Plaintiff informed Lu at that time that he was homeless and did not have  regular access to a telephone or Internet connection. (Id.) Plaintiff  then provided Lu’s office with the telephone number of a relative with whom he  checks in from time to time. (Id.) Lu asked Plaintiff to try to check in  with her office on a weekly basis. (Id.) Since then, Lu’s office has  left numerous voice messages for Plaintiff at his last telephone number and Lu  has sent Plaintiff multiple emails asking him to contact Lu’s office. (Id.,  ¶ 5). Lu’s office has yet to hear back from Plaintiff. (Id.) On June 19,  2024, Lu’s office hired an investigator to try to locate Plaintiff, without  success. (Id., ¶¶ 6-7). On June 25, 2024, Lu emailed counsel for Covina  206 and Vasquez to let them know that she has lost contact with Plaintiff and  would be filing the instant motion. (Id., ¶ 10, Exh. A.)  The  motion is unopposed. The Court grants the motion and stays the proceedings for  a period of 45 days.  The Court  sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Lifting of Stay for September 26, 2024, at 8:30  a.m., in Department H.
