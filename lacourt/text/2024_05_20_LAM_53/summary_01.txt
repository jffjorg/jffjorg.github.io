And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's first amended complaint and answer to cross-complaint. The plaintiff, Regency Plastering, Inc., is a corporation and must be represented by counsel. Counsel was relieved as counsel for the plaintiff on February 5, 2024, but the plaintiff has not appointed new counsel or filed a substitution of attorney form. The court finds that the plaintiff is improperly representing itself and grants the defendant's motion. The court orders that the plaintiff's first amended complaint and answer to cross-complaint be stricken, and sets a hearing for an order to show cause for entry of default and default judgment.
