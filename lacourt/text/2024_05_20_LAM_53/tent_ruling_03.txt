motion to be relieved as counsel for
  plaintiff
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Ronald K. Sittler        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Ronald K. Sittler (“Plaintiff’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for plaintiff Anthony Brown (“Plaintiff”) in this action. 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
The court
finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has served Plaintiff with (1) the moving papers
filed in connection with this motion by mail at Plaintiff’s last known address,
which Plaintiff’s Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days is current, and
(2) a notice of the court’s April 12, 2024 order continuing the hearing on this
motion to May 20, 2024, by mail. 
(MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(d); Apr. 18, 2024 Notice of
Ruling, pp. 2, 4.)  The court also finds
that Plaintiff’s Counsel has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be
granted, and why counsel brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under section 284,
subdivision (1).  (MC-052, ¶ 2.) 
The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. 
Ronald K. Sittler will be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Anthony
Brown effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on the client. 
 
 
 
 
The court orders Ronald K. Sittler to give notice of this ruling and the
signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” to plaintiff
Anthony Brown and to all other parties who have appeared in this action. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 20, 2024
