  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to deem truth of matters
  specified in requests for admission admitted
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Orlando Garcia         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Deem Truth of Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
Admitted
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Orlando Garcia (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for
Admission, Set One, served on defendants Burton Steiger (“B. Steiger”) and
Adrianne Steiger (“A. Steiger”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount
of $1,660.
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order that the
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, unless the court finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response that is in
substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff
served Defendants, separately, with the Requests for Admission, Set One, on May
2, 2023, by mail.  (Ramos Decl., Exs. A
[Requests for Admission as to Defendants], B, p. 1 [Proof of Service of
Requests for Admission “Propounded on Defendants Burton Steiger; Adrianne
Steiger” by mail on May 2, 2023].) 
Defendants had not served responses to this discovery as of the date
that Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Mot.,
p. 3:8-9; Ramos Decl., ¶ 5 [“As a result of Defendant’s willful refusal to
serve answers to these Requests for Admissions,” Plaintiff is unable to proceed
with discovery].)  Defendants did not
file opposition papers or other evidence with the court establishing that
responses have since been served. 
Thus, the
court finds that Defendants have not served responses to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Admission, Set One that are in substantial compliance with section 2033.220
before the hearing on this motion, and therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).) 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $860 ((2
hours x $400 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions
to impose against Defendants in connection with this motion.  (Ramos Decl., ¶ 6.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Orlando
Garcia’s motion to deem truth of matters specified in requests for admission
admitted. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (b), the court orders that the truth of the
matters specified in plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Requests for Admission, Set
One, served on defendant Burton Steiger on May 2, 2023, is deemed admitted. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (b), the court orders that the truth of the
matters specified in plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Requests for Admission, Set
One, served on defendant Adrianne Steiger on May 2, 2023, is deemed admitted. 
            The court orders defendants Burton
Steiger and Adrianne Steiger to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Orlando
Garcia in the amount of $860 within 30 days of the date of service of this
order.
            The court orders plaintiff Orlando
Garcia to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 20, 2024
