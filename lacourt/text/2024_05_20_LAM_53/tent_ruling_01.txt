  Order RE:
 
defendant and cross-complainant’s motion to

MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant and cross-complainant
Westside Contractors            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint and Answer to
Cross-Complaint
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-complainant Westside Contractors (“Westside”)
moves the court for an order (1) striking the First Amended Complaint filed by
plaintiff Regency Plastering, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) on April 14, 2022, (2)
striking the General Denial to Westside’s Cross-Complaint filed by Plaintiff on
November 18, 2022, and (3) entering Plaintiff’s default on Westside’s
Cross-Complaint.  Westside moves for this
relief on the ground that Plaintiff is a corporation unrepresented by counsel. 
“[U]nder
a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney.¿ It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.”¿ (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of
San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff is a corporation and therefore is required to be represented
by counsel in this action.  (Mot. to be
Relieved as Counsel filed Dec. 8, 2023, ¶ 4, subd. (b).)  On January 12, 2024, the court issued an
order granting the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff filed by Law
Offices of Gerald N. Silver and Gerald N. Silver (“Counsel”), relieving Counsel
as Plaintiff’s counsel of record effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved – Civil”
on Plaintiff.  (Jan. 12, 2024 Order, p.
2:22-24; MC-053, ¶ 5.)  On February
5, 2024, Counsel filed two proofs of service establishing that Counsel served
Plaintiff with the court’s order granting Counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel and the “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved – Civil” by
personal service on January 25, 2024, and by mail on January 26, 2024.  (Feb. 5, 2024 POS-020, ¶¶ 2, 3; Feb. 5, 2024
POS-030, ¶¶ 3, 4.)  Thus, Counsel was
relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff on February 5, 2024. 
            Plaintiff has not filed (1) a
Substitution of Attorney form stating that it is now represented by counsel, or
(2) an opposition to this motion or other evidence establishing that Plaintiff
has since retained counsel.  Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff is improperly representing itself in propria
persona.  The court therefore grants Westside’s
motion to strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint and Plaintiff’s answer to Westside’s
Cross-Complaint.  (CLD
Construction, Inc., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145; Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (b) [court may strike any pleadings “not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state”].)
ORDER
            The court grants defendant
and cross-complainant Westside Contractors’ motion to strike plaintiff’s first
amended complaint and answer to cross-complaint.
            The court orders the First Amended
Complaint, filed by plaintiff Regency Plastering, Inc. on April 18, 2022, is
stricken.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (b).) 
            The court orders the General Denial,
filed by plaintiff Regency Plastering, Inc. on November 18, 2022 to defendant
and cross-complainant Westside Contractors’ Cross-Complaint, is stricken.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) 
            The court orders defendant and
cross-complainant Westside Contractors to file a Request for Entry of Default
(Judicial Council form CIV-100) on the Cross-Complaint, filed October 21, 2022,
as to cross-defendant Regency Plastering, Inc. no later than 10 days from the
date of this order. 
            The court orders that the following
hearings are vacated: (1) the July 12, 2024 hearing on the motion to compel
further discovery responses; (2) the September 6, 2024 hearing on the motion to
compel further discovery responses; and (3) the April 11, 2025 hearing on the
motion to compel further discovery responses. 

            The court orders that the Final Status
Conference, set for October 18, 2024, is vacated. 
            The court orders that trial, set for
October 30, 2024, is vacated. 
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re entry of default and default judgment (on Westside Contractors’
Cross-Complaint) for hearing on July 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders cross-complainant Westside
Contractors to file with the court the default judgment documents required by
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800 (including a proposed judgment on
Judicial Council Form JUD-100) no later than June 28, 2024. 
            The court orders defendants Gelt
Brian Nichols, Orange Grove Property Investors, LLC, Orange Grove Property
Holdings, LLC, and American Contractors Indemnity Company to lodge a proposed
judgment of dismissal as those defendants within 10 days from the date of this
order.    
            The court orders defendant and
cross-complainant Westside Contractors to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  May 20, 2024
