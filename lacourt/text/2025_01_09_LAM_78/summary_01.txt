And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion by Santa Paula Post Acute, LLC dba Santa Paula Post Center to be relieved of its current counsel, Rachel C. Bekerman/Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, is granted. The motion was filed due to irreconcilable differences between the defendant and its counsel. The judge has ordered counsel to file proof of service of the final order within 10 days. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order, and no trial date has been set in this matter, so there is sufficient time for the defendant to seek other counsel or prepare prior to trial.
