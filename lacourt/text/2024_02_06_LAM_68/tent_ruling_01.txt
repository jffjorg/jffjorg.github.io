Motion for Approval of PAGA
Settlement
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Rodrigo “Kristy” Ramirez Lopez
(“Lopez”) alleges that she was employed by Defendants W.K.S Restaurant Corporation
and W.K.S. LA Restaurant Corporation, and that  
Defendants violated multiple provisions of the Labor Code and Industrial
Welfare Commission 
 
On October 18, 2021, Plaintiff provided written notice to
the Labor & Workforce Development Agency, and Defendants, stating her intent
to seek civil penalties pursuant to Labor Law Private Attorney General Act.
 
On February 16, 2022, after fully exhausting the
statutory 65-day notice period by PAGA, Plaintiff filed a single cause of
action complaint for violation of PAGA. The Complaint allege Defendants are
liable for civil penalties due to violations of Labor Code sections 201, 202,
203, 204, 226, 226.7, 510, 512, 1174, 1194, 1197, 1198, and 2808 and IWC Wage
Order No. 5. On April 11, 2022, Defendants answered the Complaint.
 
On March 14, 2023, the Parties participated in a private
mediation session, which ultimately culminated in the issuance of a mediator’s
proposal. This proposal was subsequently accepted by the Parties on November
16, 2023. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Rodrigo “Kristy”
Ramirez Lopez, individually and on behalf of aggrieved parties seeks approval
of a settlement of claims under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004
(PAGA). “The superior court
shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to
[the Private Attorneys General Act].  The
proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it
is submitted to the court.”  (Lab. Code,
§ 2699, subd. (l-2).) [Declaration of
Julia Wells, ¶ 15, Ex. 2.]
 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (i)
requires that in an action brought under the Private Attorneys General Act,
“civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as
follows: ¿75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for
enforcement of labor laws, . . . and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.” 
 
The parties settled all claims
for a gross settlement amount of $807,600.00. [Wells Decl., Ex. 1.] The
Stipulation and Agreement for PAGA Representative Action Settlement stipulates
the following allocation: Attorney costs of $17,426.32; settlement
administration costs of $17,000; attorney fees of $269,200 based on a one third
contingency recovery plus maximum agreed upon recovery cap; $123,493.42 in net
settlement amount distributed to employees (25%); and, $370,480.26 payment to
LWDA (75%); and, $10,000 payment to individual employee. The agreement also
references a $10,000 agreed upon enhancement award, but adding in this amount
would raise the total settlement to $817,600. The court therefore assumes said
amount is NOT part of the settlement agreement. Plaintiff represents a potential of 3,871
impacted employees. [Wells Decl., ¶ 17.] 
 
The agreement provides for two installment
payments of $500,000 and $307,600. The first payment within 21 days of the
“Effective Date” (61st day after service of notice of entry of final order and
judgment, assuming no appeal or writ, and extended in case of appeal or writ),
and the second within six (6) months of the first payment. Funds will be
delivered within 20 days of receipt by the administrator. 
 
The parties reached this agreement
following mediation and negotiations. The release of claims occurs upon the
approval of the settlement, The court acknowledges the request for retention or
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
The unopposed motion is granted.
