And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to attend an Independent Medical Examination (IME) to evaluate the plaintiff's mental condition. The plaintiff has placed her mental condition in controversy by claiming cognitive impairments due to a physical injury. The court finds that the defendant is entitled to examine the plaintiff's mental condition, as it is in controversy. The court limits the time of the examination to ensure that the medical provider does not duplicate earlier efforts. The plaintiff is ordered to attend the IME within 30 days, or a date agreed to by the parties in writing, and the examination must begin within 30 minutes of the scheduled time and conclude within two hours.
