And here is the English text summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the Demurrer filed by HBIC against the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Andrew Flores. The Judge is considering whether the FAC is legally sufficient to state a claim against HBIC.

The Judge rejects HBIC's argument that the FAC contains contradictory pleadings, finding that the allegations are not antagonistic to each other. The Judge also rejects HBIC's argument that they never employed Doe-1, finding that this is a fact that cannot be decided upon Demurrer.

The Judge finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges the elements of assault and battery, and that the first and second causes of action survive demurrer. The Judge also finds that the fourth cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, or supervision survives demurrer, as the FAC alleges the necessary elements.

Based on these findings, the Judge rules that HBIC's Demurrer to the FAC is overruled.
