 Case Number:  22STCV30628    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  30 PEDRO SERRANO-TRUJILLO, et al. vs SYSTEMS SOURCE, INC., et al.Motion to Deem Request for Admissions (Set One) Admitted TENTATIVEPlaintiff Pedro Serrano-Trujillo’s Motion to Have Requests for Admission (Set One) Admitted Against Defendant Alejandro Cadena is DENIED. However, the request for sanctions is granted and sanctions will be imposed against Defendant and his attorneys of record, in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $1260, payable to Defendant within 30 days.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONPlaintiffs provide the Declaration of Benny Khorsandi (“Khorsandi Dec.”) which states that the initial discovery request of Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, was served on January 26, 2023. (Khorsandi Dec., ¶ 6.) The deadline for responses was February 27, 2023. (Khorsandi Dec., ¶ 7.) The instant Motion was filed on March 15, 2023. Responses were not received until April 11, 2023. (Opposition Papers, 4:3-4.) Because the record reflects that responses to the requests have been served prior to the hearing, this motion to deem admissions admitted is denied. Sanctions, however, are imposed. CCP 2033.280(c); (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407.)  The Court awards sanctions at the reduced amount of $1260.
