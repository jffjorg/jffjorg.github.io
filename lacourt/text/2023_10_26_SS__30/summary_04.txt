And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Count Three of the First Cause of Action without leave to amend. The judge finds that the count is insufficiently alleged, as the defendant is a corporation and not a public entity, and therefore common law tort liability cannot be imposed. The plaintiff has failed to oppose the motion, which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. As a result, the judge grants the motion without leave to amend, citing relevant case law.
