Assaad vs. Zenith
Insurance Co., et. al., Case
No. 22STCV35064
 
Tentative Ruling
re:  Plaintiff’s Motion to Withdraw Case
from Arbitration
 
Essam Assaad (Plaintiff) moves for
an order withdrawing his case against Zenith Insurance Co., Linda Carmody,
Guillermo Gabriel, and Julie Venia (Defendants) from arbitration. The motion is
denied. 
 
“In an employment or consumer
arbitration that requires . . . that the drafting party pay certain fees and
costs during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs
required to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days
after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration
agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the
employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the
material breach.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (a)(1).) Any extension of
time for the payment due date must be agreed upon by all parties. (Id.,
§ 1281.98, subd. (a)(2); Hohenshelt v.
Superior Court (2024) 99
Cal.App.5th 1319, 1325.) If the drafting party is in default under
subdivision (a), the employee may “[w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and
proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98,
subd. (b)(1).)
 
Plaintiff commenced the present suit against Defendants on November 3,
2022. Defendants compelled Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims pursuant to the
arbitration provision in his employment contract on April 7, 2023. (Rand-Lewis
Decl. ¶ 4.) On April 10, 2024, Defendants were issued an invoice from the
arbitrator for $40,000, due in 30 days. (Id. ¶ 9.) The arbitrator
then continued the next arbitration hearing from July 8, 2024, to December 9,
2024, extending the due dates of Defendants’ fees as well. (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff did not agree to any extension of the due date. (Id. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff was notified of Defendant’s failure to pay on
September 10, 2024, when the arbitrator issued a new invoice to Defendants. (Id. ¶ 17–18.)
 
Section 1281.98 is not preempted by the FAA.
Defendants assert that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the
present arbitration agreement, and that it preempts Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.98. “The FAA preempts state laws that prohibit or discourage the
formation or enforcement of arbitration agreements, or that interfere with
fundamental attributes of arbitration.” (Espinoza v. Superior Court
(2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 771.) In Espinoza, the court held that the FAA did not preempt
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97 because that section merely “set forth
procedural requirements to ensure timely payment of arbitration fees,” still in
keeping with the objectives of the FAA to “preserve arbitration as a speedy and
effective alternative forum.” (Ibid.) More recently, the court held that the FAA
does not preempt section 1281.98 either. (Keeton v. Tesla, Inc.
(2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 26, 37.)
 
Here, Defendants make no attempt to distinguish section 1281.98 from
section 1281.97 and fail to address the definitive ruling in Keeton. The two statutes are nearly identical, the only difference being that
section 1281.98 pertains to payments during an active arbitration proceeding,
while 1281.97 instead addresses payments meant to initiate an arbitration
proceeding. (See Cvejic v. Skyview
Capital, LLC (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th
1073, 1077.) The reasoning in Espinoza holds just as strongly here, where 1281.98 provides
more procedural requirements which ensure the timely payment of fees, while
still in keeping with the objectives of the FAA. Accordingly, following Keeton, the Court finds that the FAA does not preempt section 1281.98.
 
The arbitrator’s continuance of the arbitration hearing does not affect
the outcome.
Defendants argue that they were justified in failing to pay arbitration
fees within 30 days of the April 10, 2024, invoice. The arbitrator issued that
invoice as advance payment for the upcoming July 8 arbitration hearing.
(Rand-Lewis Decl. ¶ 9.) The email accompanying the invoice made clear that the
arbitrator would not extend the payment due date unless agreed to by all
parties. (Ibid.) At Defendants’ request, the arbitrator
later continued the hearing to December 9, 2024, along with the payment
deadline. (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff did not agree to extend
the due date. (Id. ¶ 13.) Yet Defendants contend that the
arbitrator’s extension renders their late payment timely.
 
Section 1281.98 does not empower the arbitrator to cure a party’s
missed payment. (Cvejic, supra, at p. 1078.) Specifically, “If . . . the
drafting party were permitted numerous continuances for failure to pay
arbitration fees, therefore delaying the proceedings, C.C.P. section 1281.98
would have no meaning, force, or effect.” (Ibid.) Under section
1281.98, a late payment “constitutes a ‘material breach’ without regard to any
additional considerations.” (De
Leon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 740, 749.) The statute is meant to ensure the efficient resolution
of cases by imposing a grave penalty for failing to pay arbitration fees. (Cvejic, supra, at p. 1079.) “The point was to take this
issue away from arbitrators, who may be financially interested in continuing
the arbitration and in pleasing regular clients.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the arbitrator continued the upcoming hearing before payment
became due and extended the due date of the payment as well. Defendants did not
cause this delay by being delinquent on payments, nor does Plaintiff present
any evidence that Defendants asked for the hearing to be continued so that the
payment deadline would be extended. Rather, Plaintiff is partly at fault for
the delay by failing to timely serve initial disclosures, being compelled to
provide further responses, and delaying his own deposition. (Becerra Decl. ¶
4.) 
 
Nevertheless, the language of section 1281.98 is explicit. Any
extension of time for a payment due date shall be agreed upon by all parties. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subdivision (a)(2).) While Plaintiff’s delays may have
caused the continuance of the arbitration hearing, that did not necessitate a
concurrent change in payment due date. (Rand-Lewis Decl. ¶ 14, 33.) Assurances
from the arbitrator that the section would not apply are inapposite. (Id. ¶ 38; see Cvejic, supra, at pp. 1078–1079 [noting that rulings on
the applicability of section 1281.98 are to be made by the trial court].) Further,
the Court of Appeal recently held that a payment due date extension by the
arbitrator without the consent of all parties does not fix a violation of
section 1281.98. (Hohenshelt, supra, at p. 1325.) Thus, Defendants were still
required to make a payment by May 10, 2024, because Plaintiff did not agree to
extend the due date.
 
Withdrawal from arbitration is not a question for the arbitrator.
 
Defendants argue that the delegation clause within the arbitration
agreement prohibits the Court from ruling on Plaintiff’s motion. However, “employees
and consumers may make their ‘unilateral’ election of relief under section
1281.98, subdivision (b) upon learning of the default, without first seeking
approval from the arbitrator.” (Williams
v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc.
(2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1054, 1067–1068.) Indeed, requiring employees to remain
in arbitration to secure a default from an arbitrator who did not receive
timely payment “invites the very abuse that the statute is intended to
eradicate.” (Id. at p. 1068.) The Court need not respect any
decisions made by arbitrators regarding the applicability of section 1281.98. (Cvejic, supra, at p. 1078–1079.) Thus, delegation
provisions in an arbitration agreement do not apply to parties seeking
withdrawal under section 1281.98, subdivision (b).
 
Plaintiff waived relief pursuant to section 1281.98.
Defendants argue that even if they materially breached the arbitration
agreement by failing to pay on time, Plaintiff waived any relief under section
1281.98. The essential elements of waiver include the relinquishment or
abandonment of a known right with knowledge of the facts. (Lynch v.
California Coastal Commission (2017) 3 Cal.5th 470, 475.) “Waiver always
rests upon intent . . . express, based on the waiving party’s words, or
implied, based on conduct that is so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the
right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.”
(Ibid.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff first learned of
the changed payment deadline on May 3, 2024, when the arbitrator notified both
parties of the changed due date. (Becerra Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. K.) At this point, Plaintiff became aware that a
payment deadline was being changed without both parties’ consent, in violation
of section 1281.98, subdivision (a)(2). Plaintiff did not object to the
extended deadline until September 10, 2024, long after Defendants lost their
chance to cure this violation. Plaintiff’s conduct is not consistent with an
intent to enforce section 1281.98. The Court also notes that Plaintiff only
raised his objection after Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment in
the arbitration proceeding.  This appears
to the Court to demonstrate gamesmanship designed to prevent the motion for
summary judgment from being heard. 
According to Defendant, Plaintiff had not conducted any discovery prior
to the filing of the motion making it likely that the motion would be
granted.  This Court will not countenance
such gamesmanship.
