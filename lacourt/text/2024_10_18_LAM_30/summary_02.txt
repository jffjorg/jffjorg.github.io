Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Kim Nguyen, alleges that the defendants, Adam Lavoy and Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., owed her a duty of care because they had a special relationship with the defendant, Natay Solomon, who assaulted her. The judge found that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to support her allegations and that the defendants had a duty to protect her. The judge also analyzed the Rowland factors, which consider the foreseeability of harm, the moral blame attached to the defendants' conduct, and other public policy concerns, and found that the defendants' conduct was not morally blameworthy and that imposing a duty on them would not prevent future harm but could mitigate the severity of the harm. Therefore, the judge overruled the defendants' demurrer and ordered them to answer the plaintiff's complaint within 10 days.
