Significant Statements:
  - "In an employment or consumer arbitration that requires . . . that the drafting party pay certain fees and costs during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the material breach."

  - "Any extension of time for the payment due date must be agreed upon by all parties." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1281.98, subd. (a)(2))

Summary:

The Judge denies Plaintiff's motion to withdraw his case from arbitration. The Judge holds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not preempt Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98, which provides that if the drafting party fails to pay arbitration fees within 30 days, they are in material breach of the arbitration agreement and waive their right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with the arbitration. The Judge also holds that the arbitrator's continuance of the arbitration hearing does not affect the outcome and that Plaintiff waived relief under section 1281.98 by failing to object to the changed payment deadline and engaging in gamesmanship.
