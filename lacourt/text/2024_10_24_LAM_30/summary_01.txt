And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication with respect to his claims for private nuisance and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court found that the plaintiff had not met his burden of proof with respect to these claims. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendant's conduct was a substantial invasion of his property rights, and that the plaintiff had not presented competent expert testimony to link his physical symptoms to the defendant's conduct. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiff had not presented evidence of serious emotional distress, as required for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.
