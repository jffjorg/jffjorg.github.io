And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the case with prejudice, citing the doctrine of res judicata. The plaintiff had previously filed a lawsuit against the defendant and obtained a default judgment on the same contracts. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to file a timely opposition and present good cause for an extension constitutes a waiver of the issues on appeal. The judge concludes that the case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any compelling reason to relitigate the same claims.
