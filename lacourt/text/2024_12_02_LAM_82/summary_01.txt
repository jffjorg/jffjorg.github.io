The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application to seal a declaration and exhibits filed by John Doe, a minor, in a petition for writ of mandate challenging his expulsion from the Curtis School. The declaration and exhibits contain information about a minor friend who is not a party to the case, and the judge has ordered that they be sealed to protect the privacy of the minor. The judge has also ordered Petitioner's counsel to re-file a redacted version of the declaration and exhibits. The court has considered the factors required under California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d) and NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, and has determined that redacting the friend's name is necessary to protect the privacy of a minor third-party.
