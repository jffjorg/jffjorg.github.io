Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint for motor vehicle negligence should be dismissed because the plaintiff entered into a binding settlement agreement with the defendant's insurance carrier in August 2008. However, the defendant failed to provide evidence of the settlement agreement or show that it was approved by the court, as required by law. The court found that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether a valid and binding settlement agreement exists, and therefore denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
