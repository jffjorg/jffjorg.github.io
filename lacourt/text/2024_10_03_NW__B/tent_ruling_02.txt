COMPLAINT

TRIAL
  DATE: JANUARY 27, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
            On October 14, 2020, Plaintiff
Emerson Langlois-Ulrich (“Plaintiff") filed a complaint in the instant
action against Defendant Michael Evich Kirsanov (“Defendant”) alleging one
cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. The complaint arises from a March
1, 2008, incident, at which time Defendant allegedly operated his motor vehicle
in a negligent manner and hit Plaintiff, who was a pedestrian. Plaintiff was a
seven-year-old minor at the time of the incident. Plaintiff alleges personal
and economic injuries as a result. 
            On June 5, 2024, the matter was
assigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East.
            On July 16, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.
II.      
RELIEF
REQUESTED
            Defendant moves for summary judgment
on Plaintiff’s complaint for motor vehicle negligence. Defendant alleges that,
in August 2008, Plaintiff entered a binding settlement of his claims with
Defendant’s insurance carrier Mercury Insurance Company (“Mercury”) for $15,000
(Shaver Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.) Defendant alleges that Mercury tendered the $15,000
settlement amount to Plaintiff on August 28, 2008. (Ibid. at ¶ 5.) As a
result, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff’s claim is barred by the compromise
settlement. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 13-15.)
 
III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
Burden
on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication
            In reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met his or
her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.” 
(Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510,
1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met
his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party
has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
            A moving defendant may satisfy the
initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be established by
“presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's
cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery
responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably
obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A.
(2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the defendant to merely
point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)
            Unless and until a defendant meets
that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer
Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468 [“There is no
obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit
unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing
every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a
defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if
the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.
            On the other hand, if the defendant
“has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely
rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.)
“If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi
v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463,
467.)     
 
IV.      
DISCUSSION 
Requests
for Judicial Notice
            Defendant’s July 16, 2024, requests
for the Court to take notice of Plaintiff’s complaint and Defendant’s first amended
answer in the instant action are denied. Judicial notice of the Court’s own
records and case file is unnecessary and redundant as the Court can always
review the case at hand.
 
Defendant’s
Burden
            Alleged August 2008 Settlement
Agreement
            Defendant fails to meet his initial
burden.
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
complaint for motor vehicle negligence must fail as a matter of law because
Plaintiff entered a binding settlement agreement with Defendant’s insurance
carrier, Mercury, in August 2008. However, Defendant fails to proffer evidence
of this agreement.
            Settlements Involving Minors
            “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” (CCP § 664.6.) A compromise and release agreement “has many of the
attributes of a judgment” and is determinative of the rights of the parties in
a dispute. (Shriver v. Kuchel (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 421, 425.)
            An enforceable settlement of a
minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; CCP § 372.) For this purpose, a
petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted,
there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by
the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.)¿ 
            Defendant Offers No Evidence of a
Minor’s Compromise
            Defendant asserts that, following
the March 1, 2008, incident, Plaintiff retained counsel from the Law Offices of
Gary A. Dordick (“Dordick”). (Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact “USSF” No.
2. [Decl. of Bustamante ¶¶5-7, Exhs. E, F, and G.) Defendant claims that
Dordick, on behalf of Plaintiff, sent Mercury a written demand for payment of
Defendant’s policy limits as a full and final settlement of Plaintiff’s claims.
(Ibid. at No. 5.; Ex. F.) In response, Mercury timely accepted and
complied with the letter by tendering $15,000 to Plaintiff, in addition to (1)
a certified copy of the declarations page for Mr. Kirsanov’s insurance policy
(2) written confirmation of acceptance of Plaintiff’s policy limit demand, (3)
written confirmation of payment, and (4) Defendant’s signed declaration that he
had no excess liability insurance and that he was not working for an employer
at the time of the underlying incident. (Ibid. at No. 7; Ex. G.)
            Based on these facts, Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff entered into a settlement of his claims against
Defendant arising out of the March 1, 2008, incident, “pending court
approval of the settlement as required under Probate Code section 3500 and
Code of Civil Procedure section 372.” (Ibid. at No. 8)(emphasis added).
However, Defendant offers no evidence of approval by the Court. Instead,
Defendant acknowledges that the alleged settlement offer was pending court
approval as required by Prob. Code § 3500 and CCP § 372.
            Plaintiff was a seven-year-old minor
at the time of the incident and proposed settlement. Accordingly, court
approval was required for the settlement to take effect. “As with any other
contract where one party lacks capacity, or a necessary contractual formality
has been ignored, the [settlement] is voidable until the [court ratifies the
settlement.]” (Scruton, supra, 39 Cal.App.4th at 1605.) Defendant fails
to offer evidence of a court-ratified agreement and therefore fails to meet
their initial burden.
            Unless and until a defendant has met
their burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer
Cause, Inc. supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 468.) Here, Plaintiff has no burden to
present controverting evidence. 
            Even assuming, arguendo, Defendant
had met his burden, Plaintiff submitted evidence suggesting the existence of a
triable issue of fact as to whether a valid minor’s compromise exists. (Lisa
Langlois Decl. ¶ 2.) Furthermore, Lisa Langlois, appointed guardian ad litem of
Plaintiff at the time of the alleged settlement, denies authorizing Dordick’s
demand letter. (Ibid.) An attorney cannot enter settlement on behalf of
their client without their client’s authorization. (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
Rule 1.4.1.)  Therefore, a triable issue
of material fact exists as to whether a valid settlement offer existed at all.
V.      
CONCLUSION
            A triable issue of material fact
exists as to the existence of a valid and binding settlement agreement.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
