The Judge denies Petitioner Zoila Monroy's Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability. The Petitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Genesis and Kelly would receive $7,500 and $6,000, respectively, out of a total settlement of $87,500. The Judge finds that the settlement is fair considering the risk of going to trial and the alleged injuries sustained by Plaintiffs. However, the Petitioner failed to file forms MC-351 as required by Cal. Rules of Court 7.950, which is a requirement for approving a minor's compromise. The Judge denies the petition without prejudice.
