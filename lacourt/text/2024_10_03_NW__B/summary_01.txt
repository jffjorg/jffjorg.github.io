And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' request for default judgment and dismisses the complaint against the defendant without prejudice. The plaintiffs, Crystal Coleman and Renee Larkins, alleged that the defendant, Joshua Randles, recklessly opened the door of his vehicle, causing a collision, and seek damages of $9,594.19. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to file required documents, including a Statement of Damages for Renee Larkins, a declaration of nonmilitary status, and a calculation of interest. The Judge also notes that the plaintiffs have previously attempted to enter or obtain default judgment but have failed due to repeated filing deficiencies. Therefore, the Judge exercises discretion and dismisses the complaint against the defendant without prejudice.
