Re:                         20STCV20703 Crystal Coleman, et al. vs John Doe

 

 
Plaintiffs Crystal Coleman, et al.’s Request
for Default Judgment
 
Defendant: Joshua Randles
 
TENTATIVE RULING
            Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment is DENIED
and the Complaint is dismissed without prejudice.  
            
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiffs
Crystal Coleman and Renee Larkins allege that, on June 14, 2018, Defendant
Joshua Randles recklessly opened the door of his vehicle on the side of moving
traffic, causing Plaintiffs’ vehicle, which was lawfully travelling southbound
on Van Ness Ave., to suddenly and violently collide with the door of
Defendant’s vehicle. Plaintiffs allege this constitutes negligence per se under
Cal. Veh. Code § 22517 and seek damages of $9,594.19.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs
seek damages in the amount of $9,594.19. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek $7,385.00
in damages, $1,809.19 in costs, and prejudgment interest at the annual rate of
10%. Plaintiffs did not provide a calculation of interest.
 
Plaintiffs’
request for default judgment is denied for the following deficiencies:
 
1.     
Plaintiffs failed to file a Statement of
Damages for Renee Larkins. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).)
2.     
Plaintiffs failed to complete a
declaration of nonmilitary status on either CIV-100s. (CRC 3.1800(a)(5).)
3.     
Plaintiffs failed to provide a
calculation of interest. (CRC 3.1800(a)(3).)
 
Because
the Court finds Plaintiffs have not submitted filings required by CRC 3.250(a)
and CRC 3.1800(a), the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ request for default
judgment.
 
Plaintiffs have attempted, and
failed, to enter or obtain default judgment multiple times due to repeated
filing deficiencies under CRC 3.250 and CRC 3.1800. These instances are as
follows:
 
·        
May 5, 2023, request for default
rejected (outdated CIV-100; no declaration under penalty of perjury in support
of damages sought; no copy of Statement of Damages; failure to dismiss unnamed
Does; no evidence of damages)
 
·        
February 6, 2024, request for
default rejected (failure to file CIV-100; only provided a Statement of Damages
on behalf of Coleman; failure to dismiss unnamed Does; no evidence of damages)
 
·        
May 20, 2024, request for default
rejected (excessive General Damages sought; failure to complete declaration of
nonmilitary status; requested costs not permitted under CCP § 1033.5)
 
Plaintiffs’ most recent request
for default judgment is denied for a fourth time on 
account of filing deficiencies, some of which the Court has
previously identified and addressed.
 
Failure to Timely Obtain Default Judgment
 
            Pursuant to CRC
3.110(h), the party who requested an entry of default must obtain default
judgment within 45 days after the default was entered. The court may issue an
order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if that party fails to
obtain default judgment within that time, including terminating sanctions and
dismissal of the action. 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 583.410(a), the
court may dismiss an action on its own motion if doing so “appears appropriate
under the circumstances of the case.” Dismissal shall be appropriate pursuant
to the procedure and criteria prescribed by rules adopted by the Judicial
Council. (CCP § 583.410(b).) The court may dismiss pursuant to CCP § 583.140 if
the action is not brought to trial within three years after the action is
commenced against the defendant. (CCP § 583.420(a)(2)(A).)
            
            Here, Plaintiffs’
Complaint naming Defendant was filed on June 2, 2020. The action was commenced well
over three years ago and it has not yet been brought to trial or judgment.
Therefore, it is within the court’s discretion to dismiss the case pursuant to
CCP § 538.410 and CCP 583.420(a)(2)(A). 
 
            The Court
exercises its discretion and dismisses the Complaint against Defendant Joshua
Randles without prejudice.
