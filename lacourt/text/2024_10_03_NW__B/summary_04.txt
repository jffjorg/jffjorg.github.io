And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Lyft's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The judge found that Lyft proved the existence of a valid arbitration agreement with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff then had the burden of demonstrating a valid defense against the enforceability of the agreement. The plaintiff argued that arbitration would risk inconsistent verdicts in disputes arising from the same accident, since it involves third parties who are not bound to Lyft's terms of service. The judge agreed that there is a risk of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact, and therefore applied California Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2, which allows courts to refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement in certain circumstances. As a result, the judge denied Lyft's motion to compel arbitration.
