Here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion for attorney's fees filed by the defendants, Dignity Health, Carolyn Caldwell, Charles Anderson, and Christopher Pook, in a lawsuit brought by Dr. Nayyer Ali, M.D. and Dr. Mauricio Heilbron, M.D. The defendants seek to recover attorney's fees in the amount of $41,619.23 for work done on their anti-SLAPP motion. The court granted the anti-SLAPP motion in part, striking allegations relating to the peer review process.

The court finds that the defendants are entitled to recover their attorney's fees and costs, as provided by CCP § 425.16(c). The court rejects the plaintiffs' argument that the defendants should not recover any fees because the anti-SLAPP motion did not strike any material claims. The court also finds that the defendants' counsel's hours and hourly rates are reasonable, despite the plaintiffs' contention that they are excessive.

The court grants the defendants' motion for attorney's fees and orders them to notice the plaintiffs.
