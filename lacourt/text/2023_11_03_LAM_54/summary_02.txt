English text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling addresses a demurrer to the complaint and a motion to strike in a lemon law action brought by Plaintiff Daniel Meza against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to disclose defects in a 2022 Honda Accord, which the Plaintiff purchased. The Defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to adequately plead fraud and that the economic loss rule bars the claim. The Judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations sufficiently pled fraud by concealment. The Judge also denied the motion to strike, holding that the economic loss rule does not bar the Plaintiff's claim for fraudulent inducement by concealment. The Judge ordered the Defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
