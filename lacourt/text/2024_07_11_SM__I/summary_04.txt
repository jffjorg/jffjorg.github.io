And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion confirming the referee's jurisdiction to hear the discovery dispute. The referee has already issued orders on the discovery at issue, and the judge believes that the referee is in the best position to address the dispute. The judge has also continued the trial for one week to allow the referee to rule and for the parties to re-tool their cases if necessary. The judge notes that the trial is scheduled to begin on July 22, 2024, but may need to be continued due to the discovery dispute.
