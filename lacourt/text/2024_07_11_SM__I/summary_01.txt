And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application by the plaintiff, which sought two orders: (1) an order for sanctions related to a prior discovery motion and (2) to set the matter for trial, effectively rescinding the settlement agreement. The application is opposed by the defendants. The court denies the application without prejudice as to the sanctions, finding that the sanctions issue is now moot due to the settlement. However, the court will require further briefing on the effect of the settlement on the sanctions issue. The court also sets a status conference for July 24, 2024, and will consider the judgment against Luminosity at that time.
