  Case Number:  22SMCV01644    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  I This is an ex parte application by plaintiff for two
orders: (1) an order for sanctions relating to a prior discovery motion; and
(2) to set the matter for trial (impliedly rescinding the settlement agreement)
as to some, but not all, defendants.  The
application is opposed.  The court DENIES
the application without prejudice as to the sanctions.  As background, the court issued a discovery
order in plaintiff’s favor on January 2, 2024. 
The court stated that it would rule on the sanctions aspect from chambers.  However, before the court’s ruling the court
learned that the parties had settled, thereby rendering the sanctions issue
moot.   However, defendants breached the
settlement agreement.  Plaintiff now
wants the sanctions order to be ruled upon. 
Defendants contend that the right to sanctions was waived because the
settlement mooted the issue, at least to the extent that plaintiff seeks to
enforce the settlement, but more importantly defendants contend there is no
exigency.  The court agrees that there is
no exigency.  Further, the court will
require further briefing as to the effect of the settlement on the sanctions
issue.  Therefore, plaintiff may renew
its request for sanctions by way of a noticed motion.
 
The second aspect of the application is to restore the
matter to the trial calendar except for Luminosity, and to enter the judgment
as against Luminosity.  The court already
has a non-appearance in this case set for July 24, 2024.  The court will now make that a status
conference (where appearance is required) and will take up these issues at that
time.  The court will inquire, though, as
to whether all parties agree that the judgment against Luminosity should be
signed.  If so, and the court recalls
that defendants agreed to the judgment’s form, the court will sign it now.  If there is any issue with it at all, the
court will take it up on July 24.
