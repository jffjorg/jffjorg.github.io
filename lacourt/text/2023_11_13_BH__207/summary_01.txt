And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of Steven J. Barkin, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Stradella Equity Holdings, LLC and Aveta Parsazad. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication between Counsel and his clients, which makes it impossible for Counsel to provide effective counsel to the clients. The judge has determined that the motion is substantively proper under Rule 1.16(b)(4) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which permits withdrawal where the client's conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively.

The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to December 8, 2023, and has ordered Counsel to serve the proposed order (MC-053) on the plaintiffs and other parties who have appeared in the action by November 20, 2023. The judge has also ordered Counsel to provide notice of the continued hearing and file a proof of service which evidences compliance with the court's orders in advance of the continued hearing.
