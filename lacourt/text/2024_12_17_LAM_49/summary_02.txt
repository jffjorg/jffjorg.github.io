And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the plaintiff's motion for trial preference due to Farideh Rad's advanced age and deteriorating health. The plaintiff, Farideh Rad, is 78 years old and has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She has experienced rapid cognitive decline and is unable to recall significant details about her case. She has been hospitalized multiple times in the past year.

The defendant opposed the motion, citing inconvenience and due process concerns. However, the judge found that the plaintiff meets both prongs of section 36(a) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires a trial preference for litigants who are over 70 years old and have a substantial interest in the action as a whole.

The judge ordered that the trial will be set within 120 days of the ruling, to be determined at the hearing. The moving party is ordered to give notice, unless waived.
