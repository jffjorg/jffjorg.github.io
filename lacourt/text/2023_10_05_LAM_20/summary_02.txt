Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Cynthia Cohen and Brown, White & Osborn, LLP. The demurrer challenges the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Omanoff, et al., alleging legal malpractice and breach of contract. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs can re-file the complaint with additional details and/or modifications to address the defects identified by the defendants.

The judge has ruled that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it is time-barred by the statute of limitations. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs knew of the alleged malpractice more than one year before the complaint was filed, and that the plaintiffs did not suffer actual damages until later. The judge agrees that the complaint does not establish that the plaintiffs suffered actual injury prior to the filing of the complaint, and that the limitations period was tolled until the plaintiffs incurred actual damages.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiffs' attempt to mitigate damages by disclosing Cohen's actions to the insurers does not constitute actual injury. The judge has given the defendants notice of the ruling and has encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
