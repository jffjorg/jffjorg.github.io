The judge has granted the Motion to Compel Arbitration filed by the defendants, Joey Restaurant (Los Angeles) Inc. and Joey Restaurant (Woodland Hills) Inc. The court has stayed the action pending the resolution of arbitration. The defendants are required to give notice of the stay to the plaintiff, Kalkidan Siler. The court has determined that the arbitration agreements signed by the plaintiff in 2019 and 2020 are valid and enforceable. The court has also ruled that the Ending Force Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFA) does not apply to this case, as the events giving rise to the plaintiff's claims occurred before the EFA became effective. The court has further determined that the arbitration agreements are not procedurally or substantively unconscionable.
