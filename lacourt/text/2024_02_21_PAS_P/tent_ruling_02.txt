[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS
  FOR PRODUCTION, AND FOR SANCTIONS 
 
Date:   February
  21, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an
employment dispute. Plaintiff Irwin Munoz (Munoz) was fired by his employer,
TCK Alhambra LLC (TCK), for allegedly violating company policy and drinking on
the job. The complaint contains ten causes of action: (1) wrongful termination,
(2) California Family Rights Act, (3) Interference with California Family
Rights Act, (4) Retaliation based on California Family Rights Act, (5) New
Parent Leave Act Violation, (6) Discrimination based on marital status, (7) Misclassification
in violation of Labor Code, (8) Wage Statement Violation, (9) Failure to
Reimburse Expenses, and (10) Minimum Wage Violation. 
          Before the Court is Defendant’s unopposed
motion for an order compelling response to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One. Because the evidence shows Plaintiff failed to respond, the
motion is granted.  Sanctions (in a
reduced amount) are also awarded.
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
“Any
party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling
documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored
information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the
action.” (CCP § 2031.010.) “If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP § 2025.480(a).)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Reasonable expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in
researching and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time
spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2025.480(j).)
III.     ANALYSIS
          TCK served Munoz with Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One on September 26, 2023, via mail and email. Responses were due October 26,
2023. On November  1, 2023, Munoz served objection-only
responses to Requests for Production, Set One but did not provide any
responsive documents. (Deam Decl., Exh. B.) On November 2, 2023, Counsel for
TCK, Ryan M. Deam, reached out via email to Plaintiff’s counsel to discuss the
responses. (Deam Decl., Exh. C p. 55.) Deam sent follow-up emails November 8,
November 15, and November 28. (Id. at p. 54-55.) Plaintiff’s counsel
responded November 15 that “I am working on the responses.” (Id. at p.
54.) On December 1, 2023, Munoz served supplemental responses. Deam then
corresponded with Plaintiff’s counsel on December 13, December 29, and January
4, 2024. (Deam Decl. ¶ 3.) On December 15, Plaintiff’s counsel responded “The
RPD response is ready, however, we are still gathering documents.” (Deam Decl.,
Exh. C p. 49.) As of the date of the filing of this motion, no responsive
documents have been received. (Deam Decl. ¶ 6.)
          Accordingly, the motion to compel the production of
documents in response to Defendant’s Requests for Production, Set One is
granted. 
          B. Sanctions
TCK requests
$5,700.00 in monetary sanctions. TCK’s request is accompanied by the
declaration of its Counsel, Ryan M. Deam. (Deam Decl.) Deam declares that he
spent 15 hours preparing the motion to compel responses and expects to spend 3
additional hours responding to Defendant’s opposition and preparing for the
hearing, 1 hour traveling to the court, and 1 hour attending the hearing. (Deam
Decl. ¶ 7.) His hourly rate is $285. (Id.)
The
Court finds that the hourly rate of $285 is reasonable. The Court declines to
find 15 hours preparing the motion reasonable, however.  This amount is excessive.  Instead, the Court awards 3 hours for
preparing the motion. The Court also declines to award time responding to an opposition,
as none was filed.  The Court finds that
1 hour traveling and 1 hour attending the hearing reasonable. 
Accordingly,
the Court imposes a monetary sanction of $1,425.00.   
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Defendant’s motion for an order compelling the production
of documents in response to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One is
granted. Plaintiff is ordered to provide responsive documents within fifteen days.[1]  
Plaintiff
Munoz and his counsel Gene M. Ramos are further ordered to pay monetary
sanctions of $1,425.00 to Defendant TCK within 30 days.
          Counsel for Defendant is ordered to give notice.
