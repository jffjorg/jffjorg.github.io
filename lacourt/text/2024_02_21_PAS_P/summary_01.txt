Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by General Motors LLC (GM) to the fraudulent concealment cause of action brought by Pedro Hernandez Garcia (PHG) in connection with the purchase of a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado. PHG alleges that GM concealed defects in the transmission of the vehicle, which caused PHG to suffer damages. GM argues that the cause of action is time-barred and that PHG did not plead sufficient facts to support the claim. The court disagrees and finds that PHG has adequately pled the cause of action and that GM has a duty to disclose the alleged defects.

The court also denies GM's motion to strike punitive damages, finding that PHG has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for oppression, fraud, or malice. The court orders GM to file its answer to PHG's first amended complaint within 10 days and PHG to give notice of the ruling.
