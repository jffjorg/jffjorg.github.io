Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Daniel Fierros, initiated an employment action against the defendant, County of Los Angeles, on August 24, 2022. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on November 9, 2023, which the plaintiff did not oppose. The defendant satisfied its initial burden of showing that the alleged adverse employment actions were taken for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. The judge found that the plaintiff did not present any evidence to raise a triable issue. The court concluded that the plaintiff's claims for discrimination, retaliation, and failure to accommodate failed as a matter of law.
