```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion for a protective order, which sought to address the burden of responding to identical discovery requests. The plaintiffs argued that the 264 sets of discovery and over 11,000 requests were oppressive, but the court found that the burden was not undue nor disproportionate to the needs of the case. The court noted that each defendant is entitled to ascertain information pertaining to their potential liability as against each plaintiff, and that the multiplicity of requests is a natural result of the multiple plaintiffs and defendants in the case.
