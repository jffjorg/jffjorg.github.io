     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for protective order 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This is a landlord-tenant dispute
arising from habitability issues. Plaintiffs are 23 tenants residing in the
subject premises allegedly owned or managed by the Defendants, Hung R. Wang,
Vivine H. Wang, Marvin Paez, and VHW, LLC. Plaintiffs filed the complaint on
October 19, 2020. Defendants have cross-complained against Plaintiffs, with a
First Amended Cross-Complaint filed March 28, 2022. 
            On April 12, 2024, 21 of the Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion for protective order. Plaintiffs Jeremy Katz and
Adrian Katz filed a joinder to the motion on April 22, 2024.[1] On
May 6, 2024, Defendants Hung R. Wang, Vivine H. Wang, and VHW, LLC filed their
opposition, and Defendant Paez filed a separate opposition adopting the same
arguments. Plaintiffs filed their reply on May 10, 2024.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
The recipient of a discovery request may
move for a protective order. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.090, 2031.060,
2033.080.) “The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice
requires to protect any party or other person from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (Ibid.) “The
issuance and formulation of protective orders are to a large extent
discretionary.” (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 261, 316.) “[T]he burden is on the party seeking the protective
order to show good cause for whatever order is sought.” (Id. at p. 318.)

DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs
seek a protective order to address the burden of responding to identical
Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Production that
each Defendant propounded to each Plaintiff. (Markus Decl. ¶ 3.)[2] Plaintiffs
contend that this has resulted in 264 sets of discovery and over 11,000
requests. (Ibid.) Due to the identity of the issues involved, Plaintiffs
argue that Defendants could have collectively propounded the requests to each
Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs also state that they will not object
to the requests as compound to the extent the requests apply to all Plaintiffs
at once. (Mtn. 4:5-8.)
            “‘Oppression’ means the ultimate
effect of the burden of responding to the discovery is ‘incommensurate with the
result sought.’” (People ex rel. Harris v. Sarpas (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
1539, 1552.) In Sarpas, the court found that second and third sets of
interrogatories propounded in regard to each of hundreds of customers were “unwarrantedly
oppressive or unduly burdensome or expensive” because each of the second sets
contained 4,400 interrogatories, and each of the third sets contained 1,200
interrogatories, even though proof of individualized harm was not required for
restitution under the UCL. (Id. at pp. 1552-53.) 
By contrast, each Plaintiff in this case
asserts their own claim for damages, and particularized requests are necessary
to address each Plaintiff’s individual harm. The multiplicity of requests is a
natural result of 23 Plaintiffs selecting to sue 4 Defendants on 10 causes of
action. Each Defendant is entitled to ascertain information pertaining to their
potential liability as against each Plaintiff. The burden of answering multiple
sets of discovery is not undue nor disproportionate to the needs of the case.     
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for protective
order is DENIED. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial
justification.
