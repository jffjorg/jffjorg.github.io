            v.

                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV27613
  Hearing Date:  May 17, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion for summary judgment
  or adjudication 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Daniel Fierros initiated
this employment action against Defendant County of Los Angeles on August 24,
2022. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on November 16,
2022, asserting six causes of action under FEHA for discrimination,
retaliation, failure to engage and accommodate, and failure to prevent. 
            On November 9, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant motion for summary judgment or adjudication in the alternative. Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Discrimination and Retaliation
Government Code section 12940, subdivision
(a) prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee based on a
protected characteristic. In order to establish a claim of discrimination,
Plaintiffs must prove: (1) they are in a protected class; (2) an adverse
employment action was taken against them; (3) at the time of the adverse action
they were satisfactorily performing their jobs; and (4) some other circumstance
suggesting discriminatory motive. (Guz v. Bechtel (2000) 24 Cal. 4th
317, 355.) To establish a prima facie
case of FEHA retaliation, Plaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in a “protected
activity”; (2) the employer subjected him to an adverse employment action; and
(3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer’s
action. (Moore v. Regents of University of California (2016) 248
Cal.App.4th 216, 244.) 
Under the McDonnell-Douglas
framework, (1) the plaintiff must initially establish a prima facie case of
discrimination, (2) the defendant must then articulate a legitimate
nonretaliatory explanation for its acts, and (3) in response, the plaintiff
must show that this explanation is pretextual. (Patten v. Grant Joint Union
High School Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1384.) On summary judgment,
the defendant employer must either (1) undermine an element of the plaintiff’s
prima facie case or (2) provide a legitimate nonretaliatory reason for the
adverse employment action. (Cornell v. Berkeley Tennis Club (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 908, 926.) 
a. Medical Condition
A “medical condition” under FEHA is
defined as “[a]ny health impairment related to or associated with a diagnosis
of cancer or a record or history of cancer,” or “[g]enetic characteristics . .
. known to be a cause of a disease or disorder in a person or that person’s
offspring, or that is determined to be associated with a statistically
increased risk of development of a disease or disorder.” (Gov. Code, §
12926(i).) 
Here, Plaintiff has admitted that he does
not suffer from a medical condition under FEHA. (Def.’s Undisputed Facts (UF)
37-39.) Therefore, the first cause of action for medical condition
discrimination fails as a matter of law. 
b. Adverse Employment Action
An adverse employment action is any “course
or pattern of conduct that, taken as a whole, materially and adversely affected
the terms, and conditions of a plaintiff’s employment.” (Holmes v. Petrovich
Development Co., LLC (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1063.) “A change that is
merely contrary to the employee's interests or not to the employee's liking is
insufficient.” (McRae v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 377, 386.) A FEHA claim cannot be premised on a “minor
change in working conditions or trivial action.” (Ibid.) 
Defendant argues that the various
instances of coaching or counseling were routine contacts with supervisors that
did not amount to adverse employment actions. Defendant argues that Plaintiff
was simply not receptive to the criticism or instructions. The undisputed
evidence shows that Plaintiff was merely counseled on issues such as email
etiquette, symptom screening, and task prioritization. (UF 77, 138-171,
189-208, 213, 397-414, 419-430, 448-467.) 
Defendant further argues that the alleged
failure to accommodate Plaintiff, by placing him on leave and not allowing him
to return until a specified date, does not constitute an adverse employment
action. (See Brown v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2021) 60
Cal.App.5th 1092, 1106-07.) Failure to accommodate is an independent claim. (Ibid.)

Lastly, harassment cannot constitute an
adverse employment action because an adverse employment action is an “official
action taken by the employer . . . such as hiring, firing, failing to promote,
adverse job assignment, significant change in compensation or benefits, or
official disciplinary action.” (Roby v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th
686, 706.) Therefore, the incidents where Plaintiff met with certain
supervisors and felt insulted or engaged in arguments do not constitute adverse
employment actions because no official action was taken with regards to
Plaintiff’s employment. 
Defendant has satisfied its initial burden
of showing that the alleged actions do not amount to adverse employment
actions. Plaintiff does not oppose the motion and presents no evidence raising
a triable issue. 
 
 
c. Causal Link
Defendant argues that the failure to
promote Plaintiff in January 2019 could not have been caused by Plaintiff’s
disability or protected activity because Defendant discovered Plaintiff’s
disability and received Plaintiff’s complaints after January 2019. Defendant
argues that it first learned of Plaintiff’s mental disability when Plaintiff
filed a worker’s compensation claim in July 2019. (See UF 28.) Plaintiff first
filed a Policy of Equity (POE) complaint in March 2019. (UF 231.)  
For the remaining alleged adverse actions,
Defendant argues that there is no evidence demonstrating discriminatory or
retaliatory motive. In particular, Defendant points out that these actions were
carried out by five different supervisors over multiple years. (See UF 3-14.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not identified any comment or occurrence
suggesting bias against Plaintiff’s disability or protected activity. Defendant
further argues that it properly investigated all of Plaintiff’s POE complaints,
never denied Plaintiff the right to bring a POE complaint, and exhibited no
retaliatory animus. (UF 490-496.) 
Defendant has satisfied its initial burden
of showing that there is no causal link between the alleged adverse actions and
prohibited animus. Plaintiff presents no evidence raising a triable issue. 
d. Legitimate Reason
In the face of a nondiscriminatory reason,
the plaintiff must offer “substantial evidence” allowing a reasonable
conclusion that “the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.” (Foroudi
v. The Aerospace Corp. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 992, 1007.) “[S]ummary judgment for the employer may . . . be appropriate where,
given the strength of the employer's showing of innocent reasons, any
countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive, even if
it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a
rational inference that discrimination occurred.” (Guz v. Bechtel National,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 362.)
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff was
not promoted in January 2019 because he was unable to demonstrate his
qualifications for the position during the interview process. (UF 249.) To the
extent that the vacation approvals could be considered adverse employment
actions (which Defendant denies), Defendant argues that it had the right to
evaluate Plaintiff’s requests in light of the department’s staffing needs and
was not required to grant all requested time off. (UF 289-300.) There was a
department-wide policy limiting vacation requests to one week at a time. (UF
307.) Defendant argues that it approved Plaintiff’s outside employment requests
after making a legitimate inquiry to ensure that Plaintiff was not using County
time to engage in outside employment. (UF 315.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff
did not qualify for the bilingual bonus pay under the County Code because
Plaintiff was on leave during February 2022. (UF 323-325.)
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
performance evaluations (PE) declined from “Very Good” to “Competent” based on
legitimate reasons. For the 2018-2019 evaluation period, Plaintiff’s supervisor
at the time, Mr. Herwick, submitted a draft PE with a “Very Good” rating, but
revised the final PE to “Competent” based on a new department policy aimed at
reducing “grade inflation.” (UF 273-276.) When Plaintiff grieved the 2018-2019
PE, Mr. Herwick provided a written response explaining how the rating was
substantiated by Plaintiff’s performance during the evaluation period. (UF
282.) Plaintiff also grieved the 2019-2020 PE given by another supervisor, Mr.
Rojas, who also provided a response explaining the evaluation and denying that
the grade was influenced by Plaintiff’s protected activity. (UF 284.) 
            Defendant has satisfied its initial
burden of showing that the adverse employment actions were taken for
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Plaintiff does not present any evidence
to raise a triable issue. 
            In sum, Defendant has satisfied its
initial burden of negating at least one element of the discrimination and
retaliation claims, and showing that it acted for legitimate reasons. Plaintiff
does not oppose the motion and presents no evidence to raise a factual issue.
Therefore, the discrimination and retaliation claims fail as a matter of
law.  
II.
Interactive Process
FEHA requires an
employer to “engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the
employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any,
in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or
applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical
condition.” (Gov. Code, § 12940(n).) 
Defendant argues
that it discharged its obligation by meeting with Plaintiff seven times between
2019 and 2023 regarding doctor’s notes and work restrictions. (UF 326-327.)
Defendant argues that the record shows it acted in good faith and attempted to
find reasonable accommodations for Plaintiff. (See UF 326-371.) 
Defendant has
satisfied its initial burden of showing that it properly engaged in the
interactive process with Plaintiff. Plaintiff presents no evidence to raise a
factual issue. Therefore, the interactive process claim fails as a matter of
law. 
III. Reasonable
Accommodation
            FEHA
requires an employer to “make reasonable accommodation for the known physical
or mental disability of an applicant or employee.” (Gov. Code, § 12940(m).) “FEHA
does not obligate an employer to choose the best accommodation or the specific
accommodation a disabled employee or applicant seeks.” (Raine v. City of
Burbank (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1222.) “It requires only that the
accommodation chosen be ‘reasonable.’” (Ibid.) 
            Defendant
argues that it fully accommodated Plaintiff through November 1, 2021 and then
validly continued his leave instead of allowing him to return to work. Specifically,
Plaintiff’s doctor recommended that Plaintiff refrain from work that exposed
him to “unnecessary stress.” (UF 75.) Defendant could not determine what
assignments would cause Plaintiff stress. (UF 81, 83.) Therefore, Defendant
determined that the only reasonable accommodation was a temporary leave of
absence. (UF 84.) Plaintiff’s leave was subsequently converted to Temporary
Total Disability (TTD) in accordance with a doctor’s note. (UF 89.) In February
2022, Plaintiff requested to return to work without restrictions but was
rejected because he had restrictions in place until March 2022 and was still on
TTD status. (UF 91.) The TTD status was subsequently extended to June 2022 per
doctor’s note. (UF 92.) Plaintiff returned to work in June 2022 without
restrictions. (UF 93.)  
            Defendant
has satisfied its initial burden of showing that it reasonably accommodated
Plaintiff. Plaintiff presents no evidence to raise a factual issue. Therefore,
the reasonable accommodation claim fails as a matter of law.    
IV.
Failure to Prevent
            The failure to prevent claim is
derivative of the other claims and fails along with those claims. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment is GRANTED.
