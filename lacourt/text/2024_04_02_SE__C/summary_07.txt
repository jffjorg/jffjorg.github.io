And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for an order to name and serve the defendant, Doe 1. The application was denied because the plaintiff's certificate of corroborative fact did not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1(l). The plaintiff's statements, which were made 30 years after the alleged abuse, did not constitute corroborative facts to support the allegations. The judge has ordered that the certificate of corroborative fact be kept under seal, as per CCP 340.1(o). The plaintiff's counsel is required to give notice of the denial.
