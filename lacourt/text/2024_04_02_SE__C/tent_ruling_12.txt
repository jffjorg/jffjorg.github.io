Tentative Ruling 
Cross-Complainant Maria Gonzalez Navarro’s
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED. 
Cross-Complainant to give notice. 
 
Background 
On or about February 17, 2017, Plaintiff ALBERTO MURATALLA
(“Plaintiff”) brought the instant action against Defendant JIMMY MURATALLA, who
was deceased on August 6, 2018, for one cause of action for partition and sale
of the subject property located at 9027 Hagel Street, Bellflower, Los Angeles
County, California (“Property”). The Estate of Jimmy Muratalla (“Defendant”)
disputes Plaintiff’s allegations and claims full ownership of the subject
Property.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Maria Gonzalez was named in the
instant case on November 9, 2021, as a named defendant, and filed her Answer on
April 29, 2022. On or about February 22, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant was
granted leave to file a Cross Complaint against ESTATE OF ALBERTO MURATALLA, an
entity of unknown form; MARTIN MURATALLA, as co-Administrator of the Estate of
Alberto Muratalla; TERESA SEPULVEDA, as co-Administrator of the Estate of
Alberto Muratalla, and against ESTATE OF JIMMY MURATALLA; MANNY MURATALLA, as
Administrator of the Estate of Jimmy Muratalla, as the Real Parties in
Interest. The Cross-Complaint was filed on March 23, 2023.
On or about June 16, 2023, the Court called to hearing the
Trial Setting Conference and Order to Show Cause, re: service/answer/responsive
pleading/default as to the Cross Defendants on the cross complaint. The former
counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Reyes Valenzuela, Esq. failed to
appear. The Court continued the Trial Setting Conference and set an Order to
Show Cause, re: Dismissal as to why the Cross-Complaint should not be dismissed
for counsel for the cross-complainant’s failure to appear on June 16, 2023, for
August 25, 2023.
On or about August 25, 2023, the Court called to hearing
the Trial Setting Conference and Order to Show Cause, re: Dismissal as to why
the Cross-Complaint should not be dismissed for counsel for the
cross-complainant’s failure to appear on June 16, 2023. The former counsel for
Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Reyes Valenzuela, Esq. again failed to appear. The
Court ordered the cross-complaint filed on March 23, 2023 dismissed without
prejudice (“Dismissal”). (Chan Decl., Exhibit C.) Defendant/Cross-Complainant seeks
to set aside the Dismissal and to reinstate her Cross Complaint filed on March
23, 2023.
This motion was unopposed as of March 27, 2024. 
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis added.)
(CCP §473(b).) 
Discussion 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Maria Gonzalez moves to set
aside dismissal of Cross-Complaint that was entered on August 25, 2023. 
This motion was filed on January 25, 2024. 
The Court finds that since the motion was filed within six
months the motion is timely. 
At
any time, “[t]he court…may, on motion of either party after notice to the
other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (CCP §473(d).) 
The Court finds that the previous attorney not attending
the default hearings came as a surprise to Cross-Complainant accordingly, the
Motion to Set Aside is GRANTED.
