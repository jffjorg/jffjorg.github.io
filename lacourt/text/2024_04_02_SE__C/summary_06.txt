And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) against Jeffrey Scott Jones' cross-complaint for indemnity. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that Jones' cross-complaint does not meet the requirements for a cause of action. The judge has granted Jones leave to amend the cross-complaint within 20 days. The case involves allegations of childhood sexual abuse by Jones, who was a teacher at Bell High School. Jones' cross-complaint alleges that LAUSD is responsible for the abuse and that he is entitled to indemnification. The judge has ruled that the cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
