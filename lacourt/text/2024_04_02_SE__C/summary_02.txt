```

And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge finds that the motion to relieve Frederick W. Lee as counsel for the plaintiffs and cross-defendants is moot because a substitution of attorney was filed on October 2, 2023, prior to the hearing. The judge notes that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, and the attorney's declaration demonstrates good cause for withdrawal. The judge also notes that the attorney failed to file a proposed order relieving counsel, as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362. Therefore, the motion is MOOT, and the attorney's motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
