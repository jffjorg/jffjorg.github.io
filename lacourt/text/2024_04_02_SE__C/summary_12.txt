And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the Cross-Complainant Maria Gonzalez's motion to set aside the dismissal of her Cross-Complaint. The Cross-Complaint was filed on March 23, 2023, and was dismissed without prejudice on August 25, 2023. The Court finds that the motion was timely, as it was filed within six months of the dismissal. The Court also finds that the previous attorney's failure to appear at the default hearings came as a surprise to the Cross-Complainant, and therefore grants the motion to set aside the dismissal.
