Background 
On June 9, 2022, Plaintiff National Group Construction
& Management, Inc. filed a Complaint against Defendants Iglesia De Cristo
Ministerios Llamada Final, Inc. ("Iglesia"), Ariel Mayorga, Humberto
Espinola, Edwin Lopez, and Does 1-50 stating causes of action for breach of
fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, fraudulent
concealment, aiding and abetting fraud and fraudulent concealment, negligent
misrepresentation, aiding and abetting negligent misrepresentation, negligence,
civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, unfair competition in violation of Bus.
& Prof. Code sec. 17200, violation of the Trade Secret Act (Civ. Code sec.
3426 et seq.), and declaratory relief. 
Legal Standard 
Where there has been no timely response to requests for
admissions, a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
section 2023.010).” The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for
admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
Discussion
Defendant moves to deem its Request for Admissions, Set Two,
admitted as to Plaintiff. Defendant is entitled to an order deeming its Request
for Admissions admitted. Defendant supports its claims with a declaration from
Counsel. On November 6, 2023, Defendant served Requests for Admissions, Set No.
2 (the “RFA”), on Plaintiff. Responses to the RFA were due 30 days later plus
five days for postal service. Plaintiff failed to respond by the deadline and
did not provide subsequent responses. (Buchanan Decl., ¶¶ 9, 14-15.) Because
Plaintiff has not sent verified responses to Defendant’s Request for
Admissions, Defendant’s motion is granted. The genuineness of any documents and
the truth of any matters specified in Defendant’s motion is admitted. 
Sanctions
Sanctions with respect to motions to deem requests for
admissions admitted are mandatory if a party to whom the requests for
admissions have been directed failed to serve a timely response to the request
for admission. (Code Civ. Proc., §2033.280(c).) 
Here, sanctions are mandatory because Plaintiff failed to
serve timely responses to Defendant’s RFAs. Defendant seeks $3,256.65 in
sanctions for Mr. Friedman spending 4.1 hours researching and preparing this
motion and 3.0 hours reviewing any discovery responses prior to the hearing
date, reviewing the opposition, drafting the reply, and appearing at the
hearing at $360.00 per hour and Mr. Buchanan’s 1.0 hour reviewing and filing
materials at $495.00 per hour. Using the lodestar method, the Court finds that
due to simplicity of the motion, the similarity to the RFA, Set One motion
filed in the instant action, and lack of opposition and thus no need for reply.
Therefore, the Court awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,215.00 (1.5
hours for Mr. Friedman preparing the instant motion and .5 hours appearing at
the hearing at $360.00 and Mr. Buchanan’s reviewing the motion for 1 hour at
$495.00.) Plus, the $61.65 in filing fees. 
The Defendant's Motion to Deem RFA's, Set Two Admitted;
REQUEST FOR ORDER AWARDING TO DEFENDANT MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST PLAINTIFF
AND PLAINTIFF’S ATTORNEY; MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES filed by Iglesia
De Cristo Ministerios Llamada Final, Inc., a California corporation on
12/28/2023 is Granted.
