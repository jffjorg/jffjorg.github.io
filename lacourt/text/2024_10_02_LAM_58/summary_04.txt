And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant is sustained as to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant's demurrer is overruled as to the eighth and ninth causes of action.

The plaintiff's complaint alleges that she was terminated from her employment after informing the defendant about her medical condition that required surgery. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant made inappropriate comments about her medical condition and surgery, and that she was placed on a medical leave of absence and then terminated shortly after returning to work.

The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to support her claims of wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant argues that the plaintiff did not plead sufficient facts to show that she had a disability or was perceived as having a disability under FEHA.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support her claims of wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The plaintiff has been given leave to amend the complaint to plead sufficient facts to support her claims.
