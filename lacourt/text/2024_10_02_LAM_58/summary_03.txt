And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the issue of fees in a case where counsel is seeking an award of $3,500 to review the defendant's opposition, draft a reply brief, and attend a hearing on fees. The court notes that Mr. Gibson, one of the counsel, has more litigation experience than Ms. Haw, but bills at a lower rate. The court also recognizes that Ms. Haw is a senior associate at the firm, while Mr. Castro and Mr. Gibson are referred to as associates. Since the plaintiff did not draft a reply brief, the court concludes that a reasonable award for the plaintiff's preparation is 2 hours at a rate of $335 per hour, for a total of $710.
