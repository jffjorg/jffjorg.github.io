And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Brandon Charif's Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two. The motion arises from a breach of contract claim filed by Charif against Fuelster Technologies, Inc., Philip Valtario, and Does 1-25. The plaintiff propounded requests for production on September 6, 2023, and the defendant served responses on October 30, 2024, after the filing of the motion. As the defendant served responses before the hearing, the motion is now moot.

The judge finds that sanctions are warranted against the defendant for failing to timely respond to the discovery requests. The defendant was represented by counsel, Mr. David M. Gonor, at the time, but he failed to timely respond to the discovery requests. The plaintiff requests $1,060 in attorney's fees and costs, which the court finds reasonable. The court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,060 payable by the defendant within 30 days.

The court also declines to impose sanctions against Mr. Gonor, as he has been relieved as counsel.
