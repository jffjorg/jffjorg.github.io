  Case Number:  20STCV49213    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  74 Charif v.
Fuelster Technologies, Inc. 
Plaintiff Brandon Charif’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
motion arises out of a breach of contract claim. 
            On
December 24, 2020, plaintiff Brandon Charif (Plaintiff) filed a breach of
contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation claim against defendants
Fuelster Technologies, Inc. (Defendant), Philip Valtario and Does 1-25. 
            On
September 6, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Requests for Production, Set Two.
            On
October 30, 2024, Defendant served responses. 

 
LEGAL STANDARD
If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).)  
The
Court may impose sanctions against a party who unsuccessfully makes or oppose a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).)
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
served responses on Plaintiff on October 30, 2024, after the filing of the
motion but before the hearing on November 14, 2024.  Therefore, the motion is moot.
            Sanctions
may be awarded even if supplemental responses have been provided.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.)  Defendant was represented by counsel when the
discovery requests were propounded.  At
the time, Defendant’s counsel, Mr. David M. Gonor, failed to timely respond to
the discovery requests.  (Nourian Decl., ¶
4.)  Mr. Gonor filed a motion to be
relieved as Counsel on December 12, 2023, which was granted on March 1,
2024.  (Nourian Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff filed the Motion to Compel on June
14, 2024, while Defendant was unrepresented. 
(Nourian Decl., ¶ 6.)  On August
15, 2024, Defendant retained new counsel and on August 30, 2024, Defendant
served objection-free responses to the discovery.  (Nourian Decl., ¶ 8.)
            Sanctions
are warranted.  
            Plaintiff
requests $1,060 in attorney’s fees and costs for 3 total hours at $500 per
hour, 1.5 hours preparing the motion and an addition 0.5 hours to file the
motion and appear at the hearing. The Court finds this reasonable.  Plaintiff requests that sanctions be payable
by both Defendant Valtario and his counsel Gonor. The Court granted Mr. Gonor’s
motion to be relieved and therefore declines to impose sanctions against Mr.
Gonor.
            
CONCLUSION
            The
Court finds Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Initial Responses moot. The Court
awards sanctions in the amount of $1,060 payable by Defendant within 30 days.
            Plaintiff
shall give notice.
