English text summary:
The tentative ruling for case number 23STLC02650, Transportation Alliance Bank, Inc. v. Christopher R. Ramos, will be heard on September 28, 2023. Plaintiff's unopposed application for writ of possession was first heard on August 22, 2023, and the court tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff. However, plaintiff requested to modify the application at the hearing. The court continued the hearing to this date and ordered supplemental declarations and briefing to be filed and served on or before 09/01/2023. No supplemental declarations or briefs have been filed by any party. The court recalls plaintiff sought to add an additional location where the property may be taken that was not reflected in the application and supporting materials. It does not appear that plaintiff even provided notice to defendant of the continued hearing date or opportunity for supplemental filings. If the court grants the application, plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property, namely, a 2015 Freightliner CA125SLP Tractor. The court will order a writ upon plaintiff’s posting of an undertaking in the amount of $65,018.74, pursuant to CCP § 515.010(a), which requires a bond of no less than twice the amount of defendant’s interest in property. The written undertaking required by the defendant for redelivery or to stay delivery is in the amount of $22,912.63, the balance owed by defendant. The court will sign the proposed Order for Writ of Possession with modifications to reflect the amount of undertaking required and accurate details for the hearings on this matter.
