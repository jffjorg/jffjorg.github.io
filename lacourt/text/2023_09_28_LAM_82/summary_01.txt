And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for writ of possession filed by Transportation Alliance Bank, Inc. against Christopher R. Ramos. The application was first heard on August 22, 2023, but was continued to September 28, 2023, due to plaintiff's request to modify the application and defendant's lack of notice of the continued hearing date. The judge finds that plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of a 2015 Freightliner CA125SLP tractor and may issue a writ of possession upon plaintiff's posting of an undertaking in the amount of $65,018.74. The judge also orders redelivery bond in the amount of $22,912.63, which is the balance owed by defendant. If the judge grants the application, the proposed Order for Writ of Possession will be signed with modifications to reflect the amount of undertaking required and accurate details for the hearings.
