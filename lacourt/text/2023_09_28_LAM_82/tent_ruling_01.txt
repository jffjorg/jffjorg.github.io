  Case Number:  23STLC02650    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  82 APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF POSSESSION
  
Date:               9/28/23

Case:               Transportation Alliance Bank, Inc. v. Christopher R. Ramos (23STLC02650)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Transportation Alliance Bank, Inc.’s application
for writ of possession was first heard on August 22, 2023. The application was
unopposed. The Court issued a tentative ruling to grant the application, but
plaintiff requested to modify the application at the hearing.  (While not reflected in the Minute Order, the
Court recalls plaintiff sought to add an additional location where the property
may be taken that was not reflected in the application and supporting
materials.) Accordingly, the Court continued the hearing to this date and
ordered supplemental declarations and briefing to be filed and served on or
before 09/01/2023. No supplemental declarations or briefs have been filed by
any party.  Indeed, it does not appear
from the docket that plaintiff even provided Notice to defendant of the
continued hearing date or opportunity for supplemental filings, as this Court
had ordered.  (See 8/22/23 Minute
Order.)
 
At the hearing, the Court will hear from plaintiff whether
the application should be DENIED or whether the Court should GRANT plaintiff’s
UNOPPOSED application for writ of possession in accordance with the 8/22/23
tentative ruling. 
 
Insofar as this Court decides to GRANT the application, the
Court does find that plaintiff has established the probable validity of its
claim to possession of the property, namely, a 2015 Freightliner CA125SLP
Tractor (VIN 3AKJGLD51FSGA7843). The Court further finds that a writ may issue
upon plaintiff’s posting of an undertaking in the amount of $65,018.74,
pursuant to CCP § 515.010(a), which requires a bond of no less than twice the
amount of defendant’s interest in property. Here, defendant’s interest in the
vehicle is based on its market value of $55,422.00, minus the $22,912.63
defendant still owes. (Bishop Decl. ¶¶ 8, 20 & Ex. 5.) Redelivery bond shall
also be ordered. The written undertaking required by the defendant for
redelivery or to stay delivery is in the amount of $22,912.63, the balance owed
by defendant. (Bishop Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
If the Court GRANTS the application, the Court shall sign
the proposed Order for Writ of Possession, electronically received 4/26/23, with
modifications to reflect the amount of undertaking required and accurate
details (dates, appearances, bench officer) for the hearings on this matter.
