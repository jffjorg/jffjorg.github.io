ORDER RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff BCS Investment Group, LLC d.b.a. Kaleidoscope Services (“Plaintiff”)
requests entry of default judgment against Defendant SameSky Health Inc.,
formerly known as ConsejoSano, Inc. (“Defendant”) Plaintiff seeks judgment in
the total amount of $159,145.47, comprising $158,497.75 in damages and $647.72
in costs.  
On April 29, 2024, the Court issued an Order on Plaintiff’s request
for default judgment, which noted, inter alia, that “Item 6 of the Request for Court Judgment
(Form CIV-100) is blank.” (April 19, 2024 Order at p. 1:20-21.) The April 29,
2024 Order further provides that “Plaintiff submitted a specially
prepared proposed judgment and did not use Form JUD-100. The Court will require
the use of Form JUD-100 because this does not appear to be a case where a
lengthy or detailed judgment is necessary. (See LASC Rule 3.213(b).).” (Id.
at p. 2:13-15.) 
The Court’s April 29, 2024 minute order provides, “[b]ases [sic] on
the discussion at the hearing, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is
continued so Plaintiff can file a declaration regarding service of package and
form JUD-100. Status Conference Review of Default Judgment is continued to
06/12/24…”[1] 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Proof of Service of all Request
for Default Judgment Papers” indicating that the request and other default
judgment papers were served on Defendant on May 9, 2024. In addition, on May
13, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a proposed judgment on Form JUD-100. 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request with the
submitted declaration and evidence. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request is granted,
and the Court will sign the judgment submitted on May 13, 2024. No appearance
at the hearing is necessary.¿¿
