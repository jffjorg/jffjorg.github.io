The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel of record for the plaintiffs. The motion was filed by Steven J. Barkin, who seeks to withdraw as counsel. The judge finds that Barkin has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal. However, the judge notes that the proposed order does not include the scheduled trial dates and a Final Status Conference. The judge orders Barkin to provide a revised order correcting these defects before the hearing, and will grant the motion if the defects are corrected.
