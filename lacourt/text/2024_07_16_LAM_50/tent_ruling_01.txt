[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 



            Steven J. Barkin of the Law Offices
of Steven J. Barkin (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel of
record for Plaintiffs Nivo 1, LLC, D.A. Beec-007, LLC, and Anne Kihagi. 
The Court finds that Counsel has provided sufficient
reason for withdrawal. However, the
Court notes that after the instant
motion was filed, a Trial Setting Conference was held in which a Final Status
Conference (“FSC”) was scheduled for August 9, 2024, and a Non-Jury Trial was
scheduled for August 28, 2024. (See July 9, 2024 Minute Order.) Thus, the
proposed order (Form MC-053) do not list the August 9, 2024 FSC or the August
28, 2024 trial date. In addition, Item 6 of the proposed order does not list
Counsel’s clients’ telephone number(s). 
If Counsel provides the Court with a revised order
correcting the foregoing defects prior to the hearing, the Court will grant the
motion.¿
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
