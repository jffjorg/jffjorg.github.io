Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, C&M Investment Group, Ltd., to seal excerpts of their trial brief and certain trial exhibits. The motion is unopposed. The plaintiff asserts that the sealed documents contain confidential information relating to a settlement agreement and that the information is sensitive and non-public. The plaintiff cites to the California Supreme Court's ruling in Monster Energy Co. v. Schechter, which noted that the privacy of a settlement is generally understood and accepted in our legal system, which favors settlement and therefore supports attendant needs for confidentiality. The plaintiff argues that routine public disclosure of private settlement terms would chill the parties' ability in many cases to settle the action before trial.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown that there is an overriding interest that supports sealing the record, but that the proposed sealing is not narrowly tailored. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not filed public redacted versions of the subject trial exhibits in connection with the motion. As a result, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion to seal.
