And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to deem the contents of Defendant Macera Crematory's RFA admitted against Defendant Ashes to Ashes until November 20, 2024. The case was previously stayed due to Ashes to Ashes' bankruptcy, and there is no court order lifting the stay. Therefore, the stay remains in effect. The judge has scheduled the hearing for October 2, 2024, and notes that if all parties do not submit to the tentative ruling by email, they should be prepared to appear remotely or in person for oral argument. If no parties submit or appear, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
