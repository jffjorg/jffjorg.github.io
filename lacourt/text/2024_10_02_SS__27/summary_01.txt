And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to correct a clerical error in the case status. The plaintiff claims that the case status incorrectly reflects a court-ordered dismissal as of September 13, 2022. However, the judge is unsure of the basis for this request and finds that the plaintiff is disputing the legal authority and facts relied upon by the Court in making the decision to dismiss the case, which is beyond the scope of a motion to correct a clerical mistake. The judge finds that there appears to be no clerical mistake regarding the status of the case, which remains dismissed as of September 13, 2022. Therefore, the motion is denied.
