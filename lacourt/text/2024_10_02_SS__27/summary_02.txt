And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Uber's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and to continue Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The judge grants the motion to compel the deposition, but denies the request to continue the hearing on Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiffs have not met the statutory requirements to compel the deposition, as they did not serve a new notice of deposition and did not provide a valid objection to the original notice. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not shown good cause to justify the production of additional documents or testimony from the second deposition.

The judge orders the second deposition of Uber's PMK to take place on October 8, 2024, as proposed by Defendant. The judge also denies the request to continue the hearing on Defendant's motion for summary judgment beyond the current date of November 6, 2024.
