And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of West Hollywood has filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against the City. The Court has reviewed the complaint and finds that the demurrer is sustained on two bases: (1) the complaint does not allege that the plaintiff presented a government claim to the City of West Hollywood prior to filing the lawsuit, as required by California Government Code section 945.4; and (2) the complaint lacks specific and concrete details as required for claims against public entities.

The Court finds that the plaintiff needs to specify whether the incident occurred on a sidewalk or walkway, and what caused the plaintiff to fall. The Court also finds that the plaintiff needs to state with particularity the cause of the fall, whether it was due to striking an uneven displacement or due to debris.

The Court grants leave to amend the complaint and orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days. The Court notes that if the parties do not submit to the tentative ruling, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
