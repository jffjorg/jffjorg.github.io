  Case Number:  22CHCV01502    Hearing Date:   May 28, 2024    Dept:  F51  MAY 24, 2024    MOTION FOR  ATTORNEY FEES  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV01502      Motion Filed: 1/8/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Jairo Hernandez  (“Plaintiff”)¿  RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Hyundai Motor America  (“Defendant”)¿  NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: A judgment in favor of Plaintiff and  against Defendant, and an order granting Plaintiff his attorney fees in the  amount of $23,846.23, and costs in the amount of $2,291.14.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted in part.  Plaintiff is awarded $12,520.07 in attorney fees and costs.   Plaintiff is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended  General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.¿When e-filing  documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set  forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First  Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly  bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply  with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,  matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be  resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being  considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff  brings this action against Defendant under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty  Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle he leased on 5/16/20, and for  which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 10.)   On 12/28/22, Plaintiff filed his complaint, alleging  against Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Violation of the  Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of the  Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; and (3) Violation of the  Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b). On 4/5/23, Defendant filed its answer. On 12/20/23, the parties entered  into a settlement agreement. (Pl.’s Mot. 1:3–5.) On 1/8/24, Plaintiff filed the  instant motion. On 1/9/24, Plaintiff filed a notice of conditional settlement  of the action. On 2/20/24, Plaintiff filed his memorandum of costs. On 5/8/24,  Defendant filed its opposition. On 5/14/24, Plaintiff filed his reply.   ANALYSIS   1.       Right to Recovery   An award of  attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code  Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the Song-Beverly Act  authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the  aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on  actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred  by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such  action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)   Moreover,  Plaintiff bases his instant motion on the settlement agreement wherein  Defendant agreed to pay “Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses in an  amount determined by the Court, by way of a single noticed motion, to have been  reasonably incurred by Plaintiff to date in the commencement and prosecution of  this action, unless the parties agree on the amount of fees, costs and expenses  to be paid absent such a motion.” (Pl.’s Mot. p. ii.) The Court notes that  Plaintiff has not attached a copy of the agreement to his moving papers for the  Court’s corroboration. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Song-Beverly Act  affords Plaintiff the right to recover reasonable attorney fees.   2.       Attorney Fees Incurred   A buyer prevailing  under the Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as  determined by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) “The burden is on the  party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.” (Gonzalez  v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162,  169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar  method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied  by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,  Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler  (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.)    Here, Plaintiff  seeks to recover $25,699.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 56.1 hours of his  attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:      Name   Title   Hourly    Rate   Hours   Total     Michael Saeedian   Partner   $695.00   18.2   $12,649.00     Chrisopher Urner   Managing Attorney   $525.00   13   $6,825.00     Jorge Acosta   Certified Law Clerk   $250.00   24.9   $6,225.00     Total   56.1   $25,699.00      a.       Counsel’s  Hourly Rate   When  determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates  “are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded  [to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med.  Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.)   Here,  Plaintiff asserts that “the rates charged by The Lemon Pros, LLP are  commensurate with the experience and skill of the attorneys involved and the  general rates of attorneys in Los Angeles California that handle consumer  protection lawsuits on a contingency basis.” (Pl.’s Mot. 8:9–11.) Counsel  declares that these rates are commensurate with the Laffey Matrix, an attorney  fee billing matrix for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. metro area, which  California courts have applied to attorney fee awards in the Los Angeles area.  (Saeedian Decl. ¶ 12, citing Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65  Cal.App.5th 1050, 1057, fn. 5; Tukes v. Richard (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1;  569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016)  248 Cal.App.4th 125; Gutierrez v. Chopard U.S. Ltd. (2022) 82  Cal.App.5th 383; Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226  Cal.App.4th 691; Nemecek v. Horn (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 641.)   In  opposition, Defendant presents several cases where the court elected to reduce  hourly billing rates of plaintiff’s counsel in similar cases. (Defs.’ Opp.  6:1–7:8.) Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates should be  reduced to an attorney rate of $350.00 per hour and paralegal rate at $250.00  per hour, because “although every lemon law case is different, like here, there  were no unique issues or extraordinary motions for a lemon law case.” (Id.  at 12:23–24.) Defendant further argues that “the Laffey Matrix has no bearing  on appropriate fees in California state court for a lemon law matter and should  be disregarded by this Court.” (Id. at 13:8–10.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s attorney’s hourly rates exceed  the range of reasonable rates charged by attorneys in these types of cases and  judicially awarded in similar cases. The Court reduces the hourly rates as  follows:       Name   Title   Reduced    Hourly Rate     Michael Saeedian   Partner   $350.00     Chrisopher Urner   Managing Attorney   $350.00     Jorge Acosta   Certified Law Clerk   $150.00       b.      Hours  Expended   Plaintiff  seeks to recover attorney fees for the 56.1 hours expended by his attorneys on  this matter, totaling $25,699.00. Plaintiff proffers an itemized list of time  entries detailing his attorneys’ work on this matter. (Ex. A to Saeedian Decl.)   In addition  to the attorney hourly billing rate, Defendant challenges the following  specific entries in Plaintiff’s attorneys’ proffered time log: (1) time  incurred in drafting pleadings and discovery; (2) Mr. Acosta’s time entries;  (3) Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication; (4) Plaintiff’s motion to  compel the deposition of Defendant’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”); (5) time  spent on internal updates and administrative tasks; and (6) time incurred in  connection with the instant fee motion; and (7) time spent on clerical tasks.   i.                     Discovery   Defendant argues  that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff in drafting pleadings and discovery  to Defendant should be reduced by 3.2 hours because “pleadings and discovery  are simply copy and paste” to those used in other cases involving both parties’  counsel. (Def.’s Opp. 8:21–24.) Regarding discovery requests, Defendant argues  that “these demands and deposition notice are recycled from previous lemon law  cases and are nearly identical in each and every case.” (Decl. Of Brian  Yasuzawa ¶ 8.)   Plaintiff’s  billing statement reflects that 2.7 hours (2.2 hours by JLA, 0.5 hours by MS)  were incurred in drafting discovery requests to Defendant, and 4.2 hours were  incurred (by MS) in reviewing Defendant’s discovery responses. (Ex. A to  Saeedian Decl., pp. 3, 4.) The Court reduces the hours incurred for these tasks  by 2.9 hours (0.2 hours by JLA, 2.7 hours by MS), a total reduction of $1,926.50.   ii.                   Motion for Summary Adjudication   Defendant  further argues that the Court should strike the attorney fees incurred by  Plaintiff in drafting his motion for summary adjudication against Defendant’s  affirmative defenses. (Def.’s Opp. 9:22–24.) “Plaintiff made no attempt to meet  and confer on any of HMA’s affirmative defenses or requested HMA to withdraw  any of them. … Furthermore, Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication was  premature as HMA had not yet conducted any discovery in the matter. Plaintiff’s  motion is predicated on the assertion HMA had no evidence to support its  defenses.” (Id. at 9:26–10:5.)   Plaintiff’s  billing statement reflects that 6.3 hours (0.6 hours by JLA, 5.7 hours by CU)  were incurred in preparing the subject motion for summary adjudication. (Ex. A  to Saeedian Decl., p. 5.) The Court finds the fees associated with this motion  are not reasonably recoverable because the motion was not necessary, nor was it  heard by the Court. Accordingly, the Court reduces the fee demand for these  associated tasks by 6.3 hours, a total reduction of $3,142.50.   iii.                 Motion to Compel Deposition   Defendant  further argues that the Court should strike the attorney fees incurred by  Plaintiff in preparing its motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMK.  (Def.’s Opp. 10:14–15.) Defendant maintains that the motion was improper  because “at no time prior to Plaintiff filing the motion to compel did the  parties meet and confer in person or via phone about this issue. … In addition,  the motion was never heard and the matter settled.” (Id. at 10:14–18.) The  Court agrees.   Plaintiff’s  billing statement reflects that 1.9 hours (0.4 hours by JLA, 1.5 hours by CU)  were incurred in preparing the subject motion for summary adjudication. (Ex. A  to Saeedian Decl., pp. 5–6.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the  above fees were not reasonably incurred, and reduces the fee demand for these  associated tasks by 1.9 hours, a total reduction of $887.50.   iv.                 Administrative Tasks   Defendants  argue generally that throughout the billing records, there entries for “purely  administrative work.” (Def.’s Opp. 10:23–24.) “For example, Attorney Saeedian  bills to review a notice of case assignment, review assignment of a case  number, to receive and review the Notice of Case Management Conference, to receive  and review defendant’s Notice of Posting Jury Fees, to receipt and review of  Notice of Case Reassignment from Court, and for each and every email with  Defense Counsel discussing settlement, even if the email was a simple  follow-up.” (Id. at 10:26–11:3.) Defendant also argues that time  incurred for internal updates are “duplicative and unnecessary” because the  bill already reflects numerous entries for providing updates to the client. (Id.  at 11:7–8.)   Plaintiff’s  billing statement reflects that 1.2 hours (0.8 hours by JLA, 0.3 hours by MS,  and 0.1 hours by CU) were incurred for purely administrative tasks. (Ex. A to  Saeedian Decl., passim.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that  the above fees were not reasonably incurred, and reduces the fee demand for  these associated tasks by 0.6 hours, a total reduction of $230.50.   3.       Costs Incurred   Plaintiff asserts  that he incurred costs and expenses totaling $2,291.14, which encompasses: (1)  $1,177.75 in filing and motion fees; (2) $172.08 in jury fees; (3) $35.00 in  process server fees; (4) $105.99 in electronic filing/service fees; and (4) $800.32  in other unspecified costs. (2/20/24 Mem. of Costs.) The Court notes that  Defendants do not challenge the purported costs incurred by Plaintiff in this  action. Nevertheless, as the Court strikes attorney fees in connection with Plaintiff’s  motion for summary adjudication and motion to compel the deposition of  Defendant’s PMK, the Court reduces the cost award by $651.07.     Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff $12,520.07 in  attorney fees and costs, as outlined below:      Name   Title   Hourly    Rate   Hours   Total     Michael Saeedian   Partner   $350.00   15.35   $5,372.50     Chrisopher Urner   Managing Attorney   $350.00   5.75   $2,012.50     Jorge Acosta   Certified Law Clerk   $150.00   23.3   $3,495.00     Total   44.4   $10,880.00     Additional    Costs   $1,640.07      CONCLUSION   The motion is granted in part. Plaintiff is awarded $12,520.07  in attorney fees and costs.
