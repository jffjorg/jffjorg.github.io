And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the plaintiffs, The Vons Companies, Inc., Albertsons Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc. to compel the deposition of two persons most qualified for the defendant, Mondelez Global, LLC. However, the judge has denied the request to compel the deposition of the person most qualified because the defendant has already produced two of its most qualified persons for deposition. The judge has also granted the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $935, which is a reasonable amount based on the hourly rate and filing fee. The judge has ordered the defendant to pay the sanctions to the plaintiffs within 30 days of the date of this order.
