[Tentative]
  Order RE:

  judgment on the pleadings
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant and cross-defendant
Canon Business Properties, Inc.            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant and cross-complainant Karlen
Galstyan
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-defendant Canon Business Properties, Inc.
(“Canon”) moves the court for an order granting its motion for judgment on the
pleadings as to the fourth cause of action for identity theft alleged in the
Cross-Complaint filed by defendant and cross-complainant Karlen Galstyan
(“Galstyan”) on June 5, 2020.
The court denies Canon’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to
Galstyan’s fourth cause of action for identity theft.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(1)(B)(ii).) 
The court finds that Galstyan has alleged facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under the identity theft statute for actual damages and
attorney’s fees by providing written notice to the claimants that Galstyan was
a victim of identity theft by alleging that fact “within [his] cross-complaint
pursuant to” Civil Code section 1798.92 et seq. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); Galstyan
Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 21-22; Civ. Code, § 1798.93, subd. (c)(5).)  
In addition, Galstyan has alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of
action under the identity theft statute for other relief provided thereby by
alleging that “he is entitled to judgment for a declaration that he is not
obligated to Plaintiffs, Cross-Defendants or anyone else regarding the
incidents, events, happenings, losses, harm, injuries and damages alleged in
Plaintiffs’ Complaint or any Cross-Defendants’ Cross-Complaints[,]” and has
requested “a dismissal of any cause of action brought by any party against”
Galstyan.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438,
subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); Galstyan Cross-Compl., ¶ 24; Civ. Code, § 1798.93,
subds. (c)(1), (c)(4).)  
ORDER
            The court denies defendant and
cross-defendant Canon Business Properties, Inc.’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings.
The court orders defendant and cross-complainant Karlen Galstyan to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
