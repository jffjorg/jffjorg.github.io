[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiffs’ motion to compel deposition of
  person most qualified and request for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs The Vons Companies,
Inc., Albertsons Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Mondelez Global, LLC
Motion to Compel Deposition of Person Most Qualified and Request for
Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs The Vons Companies, Inc., Albertsons Companies, Inc., and
Safeway, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for an order (1) compelling the
deposition of the person most qualified for defendant Mondelez Global, LLC
(“Defendant”), and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiffs and against
Defendant in the amount of $1,810.
First, the court denies as moot Plaintiffs’ request to compel the
deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified because Defendant produced two
of its persons most qualified for deposition on May 24, 2023, and August 7, 2023.  (Purcell Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7.) 
Second, the court grants Plaintiffs’ request for monetary
sanctions against Defendant.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1); Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1348, subd. (a)
[“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who
files a motion to compel discovery, even though . . . the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed”].)  The court finds that $935 (2.5 hours x $350
hourly rate + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose
against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Lenkov Decl., ¶¶ 12-14.)  
ORDER
The court grants in part plaintiffs The Vons Companies, Inc.,
Albertsons Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc.’s motion to compel deposition and
for sanctions as follows. 
The court denies as moot plaintiffs The Vons Companies, Inc.,
Albertsons Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc.’s request to compel the
deposition of the person(s) most qualified for defendant Mondelez Global, LLC.
The court grants plaintiffs The Vons Companies, Inc., Albertsons
Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc.’s request for sanctions.  The court orders defendant Mondelez Global,
LLC to pay sanctions to plaintiffs The Vons Companies, Inc., Albertsons
Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc. in the amount of $935 within 30 days of the
date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiffs The Vons
Companies, Inc., Albertsons Companies, Inc., and Safeway, Inc. to give notice
of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
