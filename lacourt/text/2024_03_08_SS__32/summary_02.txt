And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Tina M. Haun's motion to compel Plaintiff Debra Lawrence's deposition and independent medical examinations. The Court grants the motion to compel the physical examination, but denies the motion to compel the psychiatric examination due to procedural defects.

The Court finds that Defendant has made good faith attempts to resolve the issue and that the physical examination is necessary to determine the extent of Plaintiff's injuries. The Court orders Plaintiff to appear for the physical examination within 30 days of the order.

The Court denies the motion to compel the psychiatric examination because Defendant failed to follow the rules set out in California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310(b) and Carpenter v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 249.

The Court awards Defendant sanctions in the amount of $660 for Plaintiff's failure to appear for deposition and examinations. The Court also orders Defendant to provide notice of the order and file a proof of service of such.
