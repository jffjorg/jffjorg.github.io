Judge's Tentative Ruling: Motion to Deem Admitted Requests for Admissions and Monetary Sanctions

The City of West Covina moves to deem admitted Requests for Admissions, Set One against the County of Los Angeles and seeks monetary sanctions. The City served the requests on September 5, 2023, and no responses were received. Since the County did not oppose the motion and did not provide a verified response, the motion is granted. The City also requests sanctions against the County and its counsel in the amount of $510, but the Court reduces this to $382.50 due to the type of motion and lack of opposition. The Court grants the motion and orders the County and its counsel to pay the reduced amount of $382.50 within 30 days.
