MOTION
 
             
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) moves
to set aside the June 7, 2023 order of dismissal of its complaint without
prejudice and enter judgment against Defendant Lorena Martinez Rubio. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
 
1.      Relief
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 
 
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)

 
            On May 22, 2023, the parties entered
into a settlement agreement whereby Defendant Lorena Martinez Rubio (“Defendant”)
agreed to pay $15,000 with a $500 down payment due June 15, 2023, a second
payment of $250 due on or before January 15, 2024, and monthly payments of $50
thereafter. (Benson Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1.) 
 
Pursuant to the agreement, in the event that Defendant defaults on
payments, Plaintiff may cause judgment to be entered pursuant to the terms of
the stipulation. Additionally, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to
enforce settlement according to the terms of the agreement and pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section
664.6. (Ibid.) 
 
On June 7, 2023, this action was dismissed pursuant to the stipulation
for dismissal. 
On December
7, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion alleging that Defendant defaulted on
payments. (Benson Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff mailed a notice of default on September
6, 2023. Defendant has not made any payments. (Id.) According to Plaintiff,
Defendant’s insurer made a payment of $5,000. This means the remaining balance
is $10,000, plus $72 filing costs for this motion. Plaintiff therefore seeks a
judgment of $10,072.00. No opposition has been filed. 
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is
granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Judgment is
entered against Defendant Lorena Martinez Rubio in the amount of $10,072.00 (Principal of $15,000 +
Payments of $5,000.00 + Costs of $72.00).  
 
Plaintiff shall give notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
