And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by counsel, Yesenia Sanchez, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Bruno Delgado. The motion is filed due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication, which has made it impossible for counsel to continue representing the plaintiff. The judge finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the judge orders counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing, including information about all future hearings and proceedings, and to serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order. The judge conditionally grants the motion pending counsel's filing and service of the updated form. Counsel will remain the attorney of record for the plaintiff until the updated proposed order is filed and served.
