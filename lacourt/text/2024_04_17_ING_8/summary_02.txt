And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint is uncertain and unclear, making it difficult for the defendants to respond. The court also finds that the complaint does not state a cause of action against the defendants. As a result, the court sustains the demurrer and allows the plaintiff to amend the complaint. The court also finds that the motion to strike is mooted by the sustaining of the demurrer.
