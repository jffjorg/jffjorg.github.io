And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Strike Portions of Cross-Complaint. The Cross-Defendants, Natasha Campisi, Ryan Campisi, and Rebecca Campisi, seek to strike the prayer for attorney's fees and costs on the grounds that there is no statute in the Cross-Complaint that provides for attorney's fees, and the lease agreement at issue only provides for attorney's fees and costs collectively of $1,000 to the prevailing party. The court has denied the motion, finding that Cross-Complainant is entitled to attorney's fees and costs as the prevailing party. The court also found that Cross-Defendants failed to show that Cross-Complainant could not be entitled to attorney's fees if it is found to be the prevailing party.
