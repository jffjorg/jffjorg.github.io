RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
consolidating two related cases: case number 22AHCV00949 and case number
23AHCV00006. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Dave
Barela’s claim that Defendant Jie Wang owes an outstanding debt. Plaintiff
filed this complaint on January 3, 2023. 
             
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion for an order
consolidating the cases is GRANTED.
             
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves for an order
consolidating two related actions. The first action is case number 22AHCV00949
(“Lead Case”) and involves Plaintiff’s contract claims, which he acquired
through assignment from Zhenjiang Li, against Defendant Kiko Jia Liu for money
paid for ownership interest in a business known as Happy Pet. The other case is
case number 23AHCV00006 (“Related Case”), which is brought by Plaintiff against
Defendants Kiko Jia Liu and Jie Wang. Plaintiff filed the related case after
assignment from Zhenjiang Li and Diyang Li and involves Plaintiff’s claim that
Wang owes over $500,000 for a loan for the purchase of property.
 
            “When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; ¿it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)
 
            The two
cases were ordered related on June 8, 2023. Additionally, both cases have the
same Plaintiff and name Kiko Jia Liu as a defendant. However, the related case
also names Jie Wang as a Defendant. The two cases, while both sounding in
contract, appear to stem from separate factual allegations. 
 
            In
opposition, Defendants argue that the cases should not be consolidated.
Defendants first argue that Jie Wang would be prejudiced because he is not
named in any of the allegations pertaining to Happy Pet. However, Wang fails to
argue or establish how he would face prejudice, either procedurally or
substantively. Defendants also argue that the cases would cause confusion to a
jury. Defendants’ position is speculative and rejected. Although the cases do
stem from separate allegations, the claims underlying each case are not complex
nor do they present complicated legal theories or fact patterns that would
cause confusion. 
 
            Here, common
facts exist in regard to Defendants’ interactions with Plaintiff’s assignor and
both cases sound in contract. Thus, Plaintiff’s motion for an order
consolidating the cases is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion for an order
consolidating the cases is GRANTED.
