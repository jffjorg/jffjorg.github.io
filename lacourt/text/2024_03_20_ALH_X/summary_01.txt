And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to consolidate two related cases: 22AHCV00949 and 23AHCV00006. The cases involve the same plaintiff, Dave Barela, who acquired contract claims through assignment from Zhenjiang Li and Diyang Li. The cases stem from separate factual allegations, but they share common facts regarding the defendants' interactions with the plaintiff's assignor. The judge finds that the cases can be consolidated without causing confusion to a jury, as the claims are not complex and do not present complicated legal theories or fact patterns. The opposition filed by the defendants is rejected, as they fail to establish how Jie Wang would be prejudiced by the consolidation. The consolidation will help avoid unnecessary costs and delay.
