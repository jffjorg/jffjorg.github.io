RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
sealing the certificate of corroborative facts. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Barbara
Waffer’s (“Plaintiff”) claim she was sexually assaulted in or around 1963.
Plaintiff brings this claim pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff's motion to seal the
certificates of corroborative facts is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
sealing the certificate of corroborative facts. 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 2.585,
subdivision (a), provides: “If a confidential in-camera proceeding is held in
which a party is excluded from being represented, the clerk must include in the
minutes the nature of the hearing and only such references to writings or
witnesses as will not disclose privileged information.” Further, Rule 2.585,
subdivision (b), provides: “Records examined by the court in confidence under
(a), or copies of them, must be filed with the clerk under seal and must not be disclosed without court
order.” Here, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 340.1, subdivision (i), the
certificates of merit are to be reviewed in camera. Thus, Plaintiff's motion to
seal the certificates of corroborative facts is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff's motion to seal the
certificates of corroborative facts is GRANTED.
