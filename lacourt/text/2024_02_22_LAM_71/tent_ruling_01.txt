  Case Number:  22STCV25657    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  71   Superior  Court of California County  of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 71   TENTATIVE  RULING      TEODULO    CASTELLANOS, et al.,               vs.   PINNACLE    ESTATE PROPERTIES, INC., et al.    Case No.:     22STCV25657        Hearing Date:  February 22, 2024      Defendants Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc.’s  and Jeremy Rodriguez’s motion for summary judgment of Plaintiffs Teodulo  Castellanos’ and Maria Castellanos’ first amended complaint is denied.    Defendants Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc.’s  and Jeremy Rodriguez’s motion in the alternative for summary judgment adjudication  is denied as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action.    Defendants  Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc. (“Pinnacle”) and Jeremy Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”)  (collectively, “Pinnacle Defendants”) move for summary judgment of Plaintiffs Teodulo  Castellanos’ (“Teodulo”) and Maria Castellanos’ (“Maria”) (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”) first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleged against Pinnacle Defendants  and Non-moving Defendants Efrain Flores-Yanez (“Yanez”) and Jose Valentin  Ramirez Solano (“Solano”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.) Pinnacle  Defendants move in the alternative for summary adjudication of eight issues: (1)  Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their cause of action for professional negligence  [Issue 1]; (2) Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their cause of action for  breach of fiduciary duty [Issue 2]. (3) Plaintiffs cannot prevail on  their cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty [Issue 3]; (4)  Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their cause of action for fraudulent concealment [Issue  4]; (5) Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their cause of action for aiding and  abetting [Issue 5]; and (6) Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their cause of  action for conspiracy [Issue 6].   (Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3.)   Evidentiary Objections Pinnacle  Defendants’ 2/16/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Frank J.  Lozoya IV (“Lozoya”) are sustained as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,  11, 12, and 13.  Pinnacle  Defendants’ 2/16/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Christopher DN  Hanson (“Hanson”) are denied as to Nos. 14, 15,[1]  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Plaintiffs’ 2/20/24  evidentiary objections to Pinnacle Defendants’ reply are sustained as to Nos. 1,  2, 3, 4, and 5.   Request for Judicial Notice Pinnacle  Defendants’ 12/8/23 request for judicial notice of (1) Grant Deed for 8224  Geyser Avenue, Reseda, California 91335 from Steve Swaner to Jessica Oliva  dated August 3, 2022, and recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s  Office on or about August 16, 2022, (D-RJN, Exh. 3); and (2) Deed of Trust for  8224 Geyser Avenue, Reseda, California 91335, for borrower Jessica Oliva and  Mortgage Research Center, LLC dba Veterans United Home Loans dated August 12,  2022, and recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on or about  August 16, 2022, (D-RJN, Exh. 4), is granted. Pinnacle  Defendants’ 12/8/23 request for judicial notice of Plaintiffs’ complaint and FAC  is denied, as this Court does not need to take judicial notice of filings on  this case’s docket.   Procedural Background On August 9, 2022,  Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in the instant action.  On May 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the  operative FAC against Defendants alleging eight causes of action (1) professional  negligence [against Pinnacle Defendants and Yanez]; (2) breach of  fiduciary duty [against Pinnacle Defendants and Yanez]; (3) breach of  fiduciary duty [against Defendants]; (4) fraudulent concealment [against  Defendants]; (5) aiding and abetting [against Defendants]; (6) conspiracy  [against Defendants]; (7) declaratory relief [against Defendants];[2]  and (8) injunctive relief [against Defendants].  (See FAC.)   On December 8,  2023, Pinnacle Defendants filed the instant motion.  Plaintiffs filed their opposition on February  8, 2024.  Pinnacle Defendants filed their  reply on February 16, 2024.   Legal Standard Summary judgment may be granted where it is shown that the “action has  no merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding.”  (C.C.P. §437c(a).)  Summary judgment is properly granted if the  evidence presented to the Court demonstrates that there is no triable issue as  to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter  of law.  (C.C.P. §437c(c).) A motion for summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an  alternative to a motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all  procedural respects as a motion for summary judgment.   (C.C.P. §437c(f)(2).)   A party may move for summary adjudication as  to one or more causes of action within an action if that party contends that  the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative defense to the  cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative defense as to any  cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for damages, as specified in  Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more defendants either owed or  did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)  A motion for summary adjudication shall be  granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative  defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.   (C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)   A defendant has  met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the  party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not  separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense  to the cause of action. Once the defendant or cross-defendant has met that  burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one  or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.  The plaintiff shall not rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings  to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set  forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists  as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.   (C.C.P. §437c(p)(2).)    Professional  Negligence (1st COA) “The elements  of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are (1) the duty of  the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of  his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a  proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting  injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional’s  negligence.”  (Budd v. Nixen  (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195, 200.) “To establish a  [professional] malpractice claim, a plaintiff is required to present expert  testimony establishing the appropriate standard of care in the relevant  community. ‘Standard of care “is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of  experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be  proved by their testimony.” [Citation.]’”  (Quigley v. McClellan (2013) 214  Cal.App.4th 1276, 1283, internal citations omitted.) “California law  does not require an expert witness to prove professional malpractice in all  circumstances. ‘In professional malpractice cases, expert opinion testimony is  required to prove or disprove that the defendant performed in accordance with  the prevailing standard of care [citation], except in cases where the  negligence is obvious to laymen.’”  (Ryan  v. Real Estate of the Pacific, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 637, 644-645.) Plaintiffs’  argument that Pinnacle Defendants’ failure to provide expert opinion testimony  regarding the issue of causation is well taken.   Pinnacle Defendants frame their argument as one of damages, stating such  damages were not “caused” to Plaintiffs but rather Jessica Oliva.  (Motion, pg. 17.)  The Court interprets this argument as one  necessarily implicating the element of causation. The “common  knowledge” exception, which Pinnacle Defendants invoke, is principally limited  to situations in which the plaintiff can invoke the doctrine of res ipsa  loquitur, i.e., when a layperson “is able to say as a matter of  common knowledge and observation that the consequences of professional  treatment were not such as ordinarily would have followed if due care had been  exercised.”  (Flowers v. Torrance  Memorial Hospital Medical Center (1994) 8 Cal.4th 992, 1001.)   The  classic example, of course, is the X-ray revealing a scalpel left in the  patient’s body following surgery.  (Id.)   Otherwise, “expert evidence is  conclusive and cannot be disregarded.”  (Id.,  quoting Starr v. Mooslin (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.)  Pinnacle Defendants make no demonstration  that the instant scenario is one akin to res ipsa loquitor.  Pinnacle  Defendants failed to meet their burden of proof by failing to submit expert  testimony on the issue of causation, and submitted instead evidence that Plaintiffs’  claims against Pinnacle Defendants for damages were not caused to them and were  instead “caused” to Jessica Oliva (“Oliva”), who was never a client of  Pinnacle, and who ultimately purchased the Subject Property from Steve Swaner.  (Defendants’ Disputed Separate Statement of  Fact [“D-DSSF”] 30; Decl. of Hawatmeh [“D-COE”] Exh. 3 at 72:7-11, 73:12-25,  74:10-13, 74:20-25, 76:1-25, 78:3-4, 92, 93:15-18; Exh. 7 at 54-55, 63-65;  D-RJN Exhs. 3-4.)   Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence that  Oliva, rather than Plaintiffs, purchased the Subject Property.  (D-DSSF 31; D-COE Exh. 3 at 72:7-11,  73:12-25, 74:10-13, 74:20-25, 76:1-25, 78:3-4, 92, 93:15-18; Exh. 4 at Vol. I 14:6-14,  15:10-11; Exh. 7 at 54-55, 63-65; D-RJN Exhs. 3-4.)  Pinnacle Defendants failed to meet their  burden on summary adjudication and do not shift the burden to Plaintiffs to  raise a triable issue of material fact as to the issue of causation in the 1st  cause of action. Assuming, arguendo,  Pinnacle Defendants met their burden, Plaintiffs raised an issue of material  fact as to the issue of causation by way of expert testimony.  Specifically, Plaintiffs submitted the  declaration of Hanson that Pinnacle Defendants’ conduct as Plaintiffs’ real  estate broker violated the standard of care, which was a substantial factor in  causing Plaintiffs’ damages.  (Plaintiffs’  Disputed Separate Statement of Fact [“P-DSSF”] 30; Decl. of Hanson ¶¶7-11, 94,  96A-D, 96R, 97-107.) Accordingly,  Pinnacle Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of the 1st cause of action  is denied.   Breach of  Fiduciary Duty (2nd & 3rd COAs) The elements of  a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary  relationship, its breach, and damage proximately caused by that breach.  (Knox v. Dean (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th  417, 432-433; CACI 4100.)  Pinnacle  Defendants present the same argument stated in the 1st cause of action in  support of summary adjudication of the 2nd and 3rd causes of action.  However, unlike the cause of action for  professional negligence, Pinnacle Defendants had no burden to present expert  testimony regarding causation for a cause of action for breach of fiduciary  duty.  (See CACI 4100.) Pinnacle  Defendants met their burden of proof by submitting evidence that Plaintiffs’  claims against Pinnacle Defendants for damages were not caused to them and were  instead “caused” to Oliva, who was never a client of Pinnacle, and who  ultimately purchased the Subject Property from Swaner.  (D-DSSF 30.)   Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence that  Oliva, rather than Plaintiffs, purchased the Subject Property.  (D-DSSF 31.)   Pinnacle Defendants met their burden on summary adjudication, shifting  the burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the  issue of causation in the 2nd and 3rd causes of action. Plaintiffs met  their burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether Pinnacle  Defendants owed Plaintiffs a fiduciary duty, whether the duty was breached, and  whether Pinnacle Defendants proximately caused the breach.  Specifically, Plaintiffs submitted evidence from  expert testimony stating Pinnacle Defendants’ conduct with regard to the land  sale contract divested Plaintiffs of their vested ownership rights and fell  below the standard of care due a licensee to a client.  (P-DSSF 13, 31; Decl. of Hanson ¶¶96A-E, 96J, 96O,  96Q, 107.)   Accordingly, Pinnacle  Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of the 2nd and 3rd causes of action  is denied.   Fraudulent  Concealment, Aiding and Abetting, and Conspiracy (4th, 5th, and 6th COAs) “[T]he elements  of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant  must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have  been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must  have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud  the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would  not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,  and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the  plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Boschma  v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.) “The elements  of a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) a third  party’s breach of fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff; (2) defendant’s actual  knowledge of that breach of fiduciary duties; (3) substantial assistance or  encouragement by defendant to the third party’s breach; and (4) defendant’s  conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm to plaintiff.”  (Nasrawi v. Buck Consultants LLC (2014)  231 Cal.App.4th 328, 343; CACI 3610.) “To support a  conspiracy claim, a plaintiff must allege the following elements: ‘(1) the  formation and operation of the conspiracy, (2) wrongful conduct in furtherance  of the conspiracy, and (3) damages arising from the wrongful conduct.’”  (AREI II Cases (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th  1004, 1022.) Pinnacle  Defendants argue Plaintiff’s cause of action for fraudulent concealment fails  because Pinnacle Defendants were entirely unaware of the facts that would  warrant disclosure related to Yanez’s allegedly fraudulent Promissory Note and  did not cause the damages from the Promissory Note.  (Motion, pgs. 21-22.)  Pinnacle Defendants repeat their earlier  argument that Plaintiffs never owned the Subject Property and therefore cannot  demonstrate damages due to the Promissory Note.   (Motion, pg. 23.) Pinnacle  Defendants further argue they cannot be found vicariously liable for Yanez’s  alleged criminal acts because there is no actual connection between Yanez’s  superseding criminal acts and Pinnacle Defendants where Pinnacle Defendants had  nothing to gain from the Promissory Note transaction.  (Motion, pgs. 23-24.) Pinnacle  Defendants demonstrate they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the  last three causes of action alleged against them based on a failure of  Plaintiffs to allege Pinnacle Defendants proximately caused damages, as stated  with regard to the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, shifting the  burden to Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs sufficiently met their burden to demonstrate  there exists a triable issue of material fact as to Pinnacle Defendants  proximately causing their damages. Further,  Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence that they did not conceal or suppressed  a material fact from Plaintiffs.   Specifically, Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence that they were  unaware of Promissory Note in March 2022.   Specifically, Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence of Solano’s  deposition testimony stating that he believed Yanez was going to be his agent  for the sale of the Subject Property, not Rodriguez or Pinnacle.  (D-DSSF 45; D-COE Exh. 1 at Vol. 1 62:2-24;  Exh. 8 at Vol. 2 145:19-146:1.)  Pinnacle  Defendants submitted evidence that their names were not included on the  Promissory Note.  (D-USSF 44.)  Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence that  Oliva provided Yanez with Plaintiffs’ personal information before Plaintiffs  ever signed with Pinnacle or spoke with Rodriguez.  (D-DSSF 51; D-COE Exh. 2 at 33:22-25, 34:1-16,  68:10-19, 147:4-14; Exh. 7 at 72:20-25, 73, 192:6-9; Exh. 13.)  Pinnacle Defendants submitted evidence that  the first time Rodriguez saw the Promissory Note was when he was first served  with the instant lawsuit.  (D-USSF 54.)  Pinnacle Defendants met their burden to  demonstrate they did not conceal or suppressed a material fact from Plaintiffs,  shifting the burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact. Plaintiffs met  their burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether Pinnacle  Defendants concealed or suppressed a material fact from Plaintiffs.  Specifically, Plaintiffs submitted evidence  that Pinnacle Defendants failed to advise Plaintiffs of the legal limitations  of Yanez’s role.  (P-DSSF 51; Decl. of  Hanson ¶96F.) Accordingly, Pinnacle  Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of the 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of  action is denied.   Conclusion Pinnacle  Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied. Pinnacle  Defendants’ motion in the alternative for summary adjudication is denied as to  the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action.
