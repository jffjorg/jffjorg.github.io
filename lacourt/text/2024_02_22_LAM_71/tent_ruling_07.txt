Defendant
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s unopposed demurrer to pro per Plaintiff
Kelley Angela Bell’s 1st cause of action is sustained without leave to

Defendant JPMorgan
Chase Bank N.A. [erroneously sued as JP Morgan Chase] (“Chase”) (“Defendant”)
demurs unopposed to pro per Plaintiff Kelley
Angela Bell’s (“Bell”) (“Plaintiff”) defective complaint (“Complaint”) as to
each cause of action.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 1;
C.C.P. §§430.10(e)-(f).)
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
Chase’s 1/16/24
request for judicial notice of the appellate decision Bell v. Mason (2011)
194 Cal.App.4th 1102, is granted. 
(D-RJN, Exh. 1.)
 
Background
In 2006,
Plaintiff filed a complaint (“2006 Complaint”) against various defendants
arising out of what she alleged was a fraudulent sale of a property located on
4th Avenue in Los Angeles.  (See D-RJN,
Exh. 1).  Among other things, Plaintiff’s
2006 Complaint alleged that in 2004 “she was defrauded in the transaction wherein
she sold the property for $130,000 to Shante [Mason].”  (D-RJN, Exh. 1 at pg. 5.)  Although Plaintiff prevailed at trial, in 2011
the Court of Appeal reversed and ordered that the trial court enter judgment in
favor of the defendants.  (D-RJN, Exh. 1
at pg. 21.)
Plaintiff filed her
initial Complaint on October 24, 2022. 
Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint (“FAC”) on October 31, 2023.  Plaintiff filed another document on November
1, 2023, which the Court assumes to be a second amended complaint (“SAC”).
On January 16,
2024, Chase filed the instant demurrer. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Chase demurs
generally to Plaintiff’s pleading on the basis it fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action and is barred by the statute of
limitations.  (Demurrer, pg. 3; C.C.P.
§430.10(e).)  Chase demurs specially to
Plaintiff’s pleading as uncertain.  (Demurrer,
pg. 3; C.C.P. §430.10(f).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.)  A declaration must be filed with a demurrer
regarding the results of the meet and confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Chase’s counsel’s
declaration states that on January 10, 2024, she called the phone number
Plaintiff had written on her pleading in an attempt to meet and confer, but
found that the number was not a working phone number.  (Decl. of Yu ¶3.)  Chase’s counsel declares she
sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff by Federal Express on January 10,
2024.  (Decl. of Yu ¶¶4-5, Exh. 1.)  Chase’s counsel declares on January 12, 2024,
Plaintiff called her to meet and confer, and Plaintiff indicated she did not
want to dismiss her claim against Chase. 
(Decl. of Yu ¶6.)  Chase’s counsel
declaration is proper under C.C.P. §430.41(a). 
Accordingly, the Court will consider the instant demurrer.

 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Fraud (1st COA)
To prevail on a
cause of action for fraud, a plaintiff must plead (a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.”  (Lazar v. Superior
Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638, citations omitted.)  Claims of fraud have a particularity requirement
which “necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by
what means” the fraud was tendered.  (Id.
at pg. 645.)
          Plaintiff fails to plead any facts of
a fraudulent incident, including the actual property that she was allegedly
defrauded of.  Moreover, Plaintiff’s
complaint does not contain any allegations that Chase made a misrepresentation
to Plaintiff, that Chase knew that any misrepresentation was false, that Chase
had an intent to defraud the Plaintiff, that the Plaintiff relied on a misrepresentation
made by Chase, or that such misrepresentation led to Plaintiff’s alleged damages.  (Id. at pg. 638.)
          Further, an action for relief on the
ground of fraud is subject to a 3-year statute of limitations.  (C.C.P. §338(d).)  “The cause of action in that case is not
deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the
facts
constituting the
fraud or mistake.”  (Id.) 
Here, the alleged
wrongdoing, if any, would have happened in 2003 at the time of the alleged sale
to Shante Mason that Plaintiff claims was fraudulent. The statute of
limitations for a fraud claim against Chase would have lapsed in or
around 2006, more
than 15 years before Plaintiff filed the Complaint in the instant matter.
          Accordingly, Chase’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Chase’s unopposed
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
