English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JP Morgan Chase) to the 1st cause of action of Kelley Angela Bell's complaint. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is barred by the statute of limitations. The court finds that the complaint does not plead any facts of a fraudulent incident, including the actual property that Bell was allegedly defrauded of. Additionally, the complaint does not contain any allegations that JP Morgan Chase made a misrepresentation to Bell, that JP Morgan Chase knew that any misrepresentation was false, that JP Morgan Chase had an intent to defraud Bell, that Bell relied on a misrepresentation made by JP Morgan Chase, or that such misrepresentation led to Bell's alleged damages. The court also finds that the statute of limitations for a fraud claim against JP Morgan Chase would have lapsed in or around 2006, more than 15 years before Bell filed the complaint. Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer to the 1st cause of action without leave to amend.
