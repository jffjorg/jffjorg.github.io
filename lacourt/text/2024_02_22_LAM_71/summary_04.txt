This is a tentative ruling in a case between Melad Naye Haddad, Basimah Haddad (plaintiffs) and Lightning Construction, Hayrapet Hakopchrkyan, Ricardo Rios (defendants). The case involves a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship between Lightning Construction and its counsel, Patricia Rodriguez. The court has granted Rodriguez's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Lightning Construction, but not for the other defendants. The motion was granted because Rodriguez provided a declaration stating the breakdown in the relationship and because there is no prejudice to the client and the motion does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The case is set for trial on May 13, 2024.
