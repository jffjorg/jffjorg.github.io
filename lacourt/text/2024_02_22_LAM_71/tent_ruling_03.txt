   [1] The Court notes objection Nos. 14 and 15 are  identical.   [2] Plaintiffs dismissed the 7th cause of action for  declaratory relief, and 8th cause of action for injunctive relief as to  Pinnacle Defendants only without prejudice.   (1/29/24 Request for Dismissal.)   Therefore, the Court does not address these causes of action in this  ruling.
