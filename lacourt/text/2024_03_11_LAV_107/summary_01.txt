This is a tentative ruling in the case of Michael Mizrachi vs. John Kyle Rosen, et al., case number 23VECV00851. The court has granted the defendants' motion for sanctions against the cross-defendants' counsel in the reduced amount of $4,714.50.

The case involves a dispute over a lease agreement and the payment of security deposit and rent. The plaintiff, Michael Mizrachi, entered into a lease agreement to rent residential property from the defendants, but the defendants failed to return the security deposit and rent. The plaintiff alleged that the funds were stolen and the bank froze the defendants' assets. The defendants filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and others, alleging causes of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, fraud, negligence, and declaratory relief.

The defendants sought sanctions against the cross-defendants' counsel for failing to appear at case management conferences and for failing to respond to discovery requests. The court found that the cross-defendants' counsel had chronically failed to adhere to their statutory obligations and had wasted judicial resources. The court ordered the cross-defendants' counsel to pay the defendants' reasonably incurred attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $4,714.50.
