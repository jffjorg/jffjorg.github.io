On March 29, 2024, defendant Veronica
Morales Banta, M.D. (“Defendant”) filed this motion for an order compelling
plaintiff Peter Richards (“Plaintiff”) to serve verified responses, without
objections, to Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 10 days of the hearing
and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,811.65.
Defendant propounded Special
Interrogatories (Set One) on January 12, 2024, along with Demand for Production
and Inspection of Documents, Set One. A motion to compel responses to the
inspection demands is scheduled to be heard on July 19, 2024. 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling their response. (Code Civ.Proc., § 2030.290.) Here, the
motion to compel is unopposed and there is no dispute that Plaintiff did not
serve responses to Defendant’s written discovery. Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff is ORDERED to serve verified responses, without
objections, to Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 10 days of the date of
this order. 
The Court further imposes sanctions in
the reduced amount of $311.65, consisting of 1 hour at defense counsel’s hourly
rate of $250 and $61.65 in filing fees, payable within 10 days of the date of
this order. 
          Moving party
to give notice. 
Dated
this 18th
day of July, 2024
