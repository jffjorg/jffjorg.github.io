And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' demurrer to the answer and cross-complaint. The demurrer is being overruled for several reasons. First, it fails to comply with California Rule of Court 3.1320(a) because it does not set forth each ground for the demurrer in a separate paragraph. Second, the demurrer is not intelligible and the court cannot understand what is being requested. Third, the plaintiffs are essentially asking for summary judgment, which they have not complied with the requirements for. Additionally, the demurrer exceeded the 15-page limit for memoranda in support of motions and the court has discretion to refuse to consider documents that exceed the limit.
