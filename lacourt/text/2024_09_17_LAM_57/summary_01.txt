And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Louis Hook to amend his complaint to add two new defendants, Eyecare Specialists Medical Group, Inc. and Joseph Perez, and a new cause of action for unpaid wages. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the amendments would be futile and that the court should condition the granting of the motion on their ability to take Hook's deposition again. However, the court has ruled in favor of Hook, stating that leave to amend a complaint should be liberally granted and that the court discerns no undue prejudice to the defendants at this stage in the litigation. The court has ordered Hook to file and serve the proposed amended complaint by September 24, 2024.
