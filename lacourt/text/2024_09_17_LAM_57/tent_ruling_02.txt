 Case Number:  24STCV12023    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiffs'
demurrer to the answer and cross-complaint is overruled for the following
reasons.  First, the demurrer fails to
comply with the requirements of California Rule of Court 3.1320(a) in that it
does not set forth each ground for the demurrer in a separate paragraph stating
whether there is an objection to the whole answer and cross-complaint or just
specified defenses in the answer and allegations in the cross-complaint.  Second, and relatedly, the demurrer is not
intelligible.  The Court cannot discern
what is the subject/are the subjects of the demurrer.  Third, as is apparent from Paragraph 4 in the
"Opening Statement" of the demurrer and again in the "Prayer for
Relief" section at the end of the demurrer, the Plaintiffs are essentially
asking the Court to enter summary judgment for them, thereby ending the case. Plaintiffs
have not, however, complied with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
437c governing motions for summary judgment. 

The
Court also notes that the Plaintiffs failed observe the page limit for
memoranda in support of motions, which applies to demurrers.  That limit is 15 pages.   (California Rule of Court 3.1113(d); Weil
& Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 2023) ¶
7,1203, at p. 7(I)-55.)  Plaintiffs’
demurrer was 38 pages long.  Plaintiffs
need to bear in mind going forward in this case 
that the Court has discretion to refuse to consider memoranda that
exceeded the applicable page limit. 
(California Rule of Court 3.1113(g); id. Rule 3.1300 (d).)  The Court did not exercise that discretion
this time around in connection with the Plaintiffs’ excessively oversized memorandum
