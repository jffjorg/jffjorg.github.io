  Case Number:  23STCV24094    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiff Louis Hook ("Hook") sued Defendants Azul Vision Management Services, L.P., Azul Vision, Inc., and California Eye Management Services, L.P. (collectively, “the Defendants”) for breach of contract, wrongful termination in violation of public policy, violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, unpaid wages in violation of the Labor Code, and unfair business practices in violation of Section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code.  Pending before the Court is the motion of Hook to amend his complaint to add (A) two new Defendants, Eyecare Specialists Medical Group, Inc. and Joseph Perez, and (B) one new and further cause of action for unpaid wages.   Defendants oppose Hook's motion.  The Court is granting it.  It is axiomatic that leave to amend a complaint should be liberally granted.  The Court discerns no undue prejudice to any of the Defendants at this still relatively early juncture of the litigation that would override that general principle.  Nor does the Court believe (as Defendants contend) that the amendments would be futile.  And the Court is declining Defendants' alternative argument in their opposition to the motion that the Court condition the granting of the motion  on the ability of the newly-named Defendants to take Hook's deposition even though the Defendants already have deposed him.  Hook is ordered to file and serve the proposed amended complaint that was attached to his motion by September 24, 2024.
