Summary:

The court's tentative ruling is in response to a request for default judgment against defendants Nelson A. Mancia and NZM Inc. (collectively, "Defendants") in the amount of $1,573,567.39. The plaintiff, Jose Luis Pulido, seeks judgment on his claims for breach of written contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. The court finds that the defendants are liable for the loan and that the plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of $360,000. However, the court reduces the amount of punitive damages from $1,080,000 to zero because the notice of punitive damages was not served before default was taken as required by law. The court also awards the plaintiff prejudgment interest in the amount of $125,654.80 and costs in the amount of $912.59. Finally, the court reduces the amount of attorney's fees from $7,000 to $6,746.54.
