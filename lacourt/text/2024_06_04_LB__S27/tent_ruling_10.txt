 Case Number:  23LBCV01933    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Donna Kappauf filed this
action against Defendant, Rite Aid Corporation for damages arising out of a
slip and fall on a wet floor.  Plaintiff
filed her complaint on 10/09/23.  On
11/29/23, she filed a doe amendment, naming CBRE Provider Network as Doe
1.  On 3/11/24, FacilitySource, LLC filed
an answer to the complaint, indicating it had been erroneously sued and served
as CBRE Provider Network.  
 
2.     Motion
to Stay Proceedings
a.    
Relief Sought
On 10/15/23, Rite Aid filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which stayed all proceedings against it, including
Plaintiff’s complaint.  Co-Defendant,
FacilitySource, seeks an order staying proceedings against it, contending Rite
Aid is an indispensable party and it cannot meaningfully defend itself without
Rite Aid’s participation in the proceedings.
 
b.     Law
Governing Stays in the Co-Defendant Bankruptcy Context
Most of the law concerning whether
a bankruptcy stay applies to a case against a co-defendant is federal statute
and case law.  The Court finds the logic
behind the law applies equally in state court, and absent authority from either
party expressly indicating the law is different in state court, the Court will
rule based on controlling federal law in this regard.
 
Bankruptcy of one defendant in a
multidefendant case does not stay the case as to the remaining defendants. In
re Miller (9th Cir. BAP 2001) 262 BR 499, 503-504; Fortier v. Dona Anna Plaza
Partners (10th Cir. 1984) 747 F.2d 1324, 1329-1330; Queenie, Ltd. v. Nygard
Int'l (2nd Cir. 2003) 321 F.3d 282, 287. 
However, where the debtor is an indispensable party to pending
litigation, the litigation may not proceed in the debtor's absence (FRCP
19(b)). In such cases, the court may issue an injunction staying the action
against the codefendants as well.  Matter
of James Wilson Assocs. (7th Cir. 1992) 965 F.2d 160, 170; United States v. Dos
Cabezas Corp. (9th Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 1486, 1491.  
 
Additionally, some courts have
extended the protection of the automatic stay to nondebtors in “unusual
circumstances” where an action against a nondebtor might have a significant
adverse impact upon the debtor, such as a suit against a nondebtor who is entitled
to absolute indemnity from the debtor. In that situation, there is such
identity between the debtor and nondebtor that a judgment against the nondebtor
effectively constitutes a judgment or finding against the debtor.  A.H. Robins Co., Inc. v. Piccinin (4th Cir.
1986) 788 F.2d 994, 999;  Queenie, Ltd.
v. Nygard Int'l (2nd Cir. 2003) 321 F.3d 282, 287.  
 
c.     Analysis
FacilitySource was involved in
repairing a ceiling water leak from an HVAC unit on Rite Aid’s property.  Plaintiff’s case against FacilitySource is
premised on the position that FacilitySource did so negligently, and that the
water continued to leak, which caused her to slip and fall.  
 
FacilitySource, in its moving
papers, establishes that Rite Aid discovered the leak, placed any buckets
and/or warning cones, responded to Plaintiff’s fall, etc.  FacilitySource cannot meaningfully defend
itself in this action without Rite Aid’s participation.  
 
Plaintiff argues this is not true,
as (a) Rite Aid tendered its defense of the lawsuit to FacilitySource, (b) Rite
Aid’s participation in bankruptcy does not preclude FacilitySource from blaming
the incident, in whole or in part, on Rite Aid, and (c) FacilitySource has
actively participated in this litigation, which establishes it is able to
proceed without Rite Aid in the case.  
 
The fact that Rite Aid tendered the
defense of the lawsuit to FacilitySource does not appear to be of import.  Notably, FacilitySource indicates, in reply,
that it denied the tender, and that it tendered the defense of the lawsuit
against it to Rite Aid.
 
While it is true that
FacilitySource can blame an “empty chair” at trial for the incident, the
problem is that FacilitySource cannot conduct the discovery necessary to do
so.  It cannot ask Rite Aid when it first
discovered the water, what steps it took to prevent water from being on the
floor, whether water continued to leak from the ceiling after FacilitySource
conducted repairs, whether Rite Aid communicated this to FacilitySource, etc.  All necessary discovery would be propounded
to Rite Aid.
 
Additionally, as FacilitySource
correctly notes in reply, it has not taken any actions in this case that are
inconsistent with its position that a stay of proceedings is necessary.  It answered the complaint on 3/11/24 and
filed this motion a month later, on 4/12/24. 
The fact that it has participated in discovery means only that it has
acted diligently to defend itself, which is not inconsistent with seeking a
stay of proceedings.  
 
The motion to stay the action is
granted.  The Court vacates the 12/06/24
FSC and 12/09/24 jury trial dates.  The
Court sets an OSC re: status of bankruptcy for 12/06/24 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department S27.  
 
FacilitySource is ordered to give
notice.
