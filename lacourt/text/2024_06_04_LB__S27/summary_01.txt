And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Laurence C. Hall to be relieved as counsel for Jaime Serrano. The judge finds that the motion was filed at the last minute, just a few days before the scheduled hearing, and that Hall has not provided sufficient explanation for the delay. The judge notes that the case has been pending for over four years, and that Hall has not provided a compelling reason for his request to withdraw as counsel. The judge also reminds Hall that attorneys have an ethical obligation to continue representation on the matter undertaken, unless there is a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship or other compelling reason. The judge orders Hall to give notice of the tentative ruling and sets the matter for a hearing on June 4, 2024.
