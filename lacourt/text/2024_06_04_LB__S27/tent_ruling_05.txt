 Case Number:  23LBCV00627    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff’s Attorney, David Tran of the Prosperous Law Group, seeks to be
relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff, contending there has been a
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, such that relief is
necessary.  Counsel served the moving
papers on Plaintiff at a confirmed address and also personally served Plaintiff
with the moving papers.  Counsel properly
filed proof of service of the moving papers on all parties to the action.  
 
The Court’s concern is about the looming trial date.  Trial is scheduled to commence on 7/15/24,
which is just over a month after the hearing on this motion.  The Court wishes to hear from Counsel, off
the record, concerning the nature of the breakdown of the relationship, why
Counsel did not seek relief earlier, and what steps are being taken to protect
Plaintiff in light of the looming trial date. 
If and only if the Court is satisfied with Counsel’s responses, the
Court will grant the relief sought.  
 
If the parties submit on the tentative ruling, the motion will be denied.
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice. 

 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
on this matter.
