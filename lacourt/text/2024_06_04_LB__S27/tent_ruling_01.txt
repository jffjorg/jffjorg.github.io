  Case Number:  20LBCV00117    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 Cross-Defendant, Jaime Serrano
Lopez’s attorney of record, Laurence C. Hall, seeks to be relieved as counsel,
contending there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship,
including a failure to pay attorneys’ fees. 

 
Counsel has properly served the
moving papers on Lopez at a confirmed address, and has filed proof of service
of the moving papers on Lopez and all parties who have appeared in the
action.  Despite the lack of opposition,
the motion is denied because it is being made at the penultimate moment.  The motion is scheduled for hearing on
6/04/24, but the case is set for an FSC on 6/07/24 and trial on 6/10/24.  Notably, the case has been pending since
2/25/20 (over four years), and Serrano answered on 3/04/21, more than three
years ago.  Nothing in the Hall
Declaration or either of the other declarations filed with the motion explains
why the motion was not filed previously, which could have avoided prejudice to
Serrano in the event the motion is granted.
 
Unlike their clients, attorneys do
not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation at any time with or
without cause. Even where grounds for termination exist, attorneys seeking to
withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in California Rule of
Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3-700 and are subject to discipline for failure to
do so.  Where withdrawal is not
mandatory, an attorney normally must continue representation on the matter
undertaken. The fact the client or matter proves unpleasant or unprofitable
does not excuse attorney performance. The rules have been liberally construed
to protect clients.  See Vann v. Shilleh
(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 192, 197; Chaleff v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d
721; Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915. 
 
 An attorney, either with the client's consent
or the court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to the client's interests.  A lawyer violates his or her ethical mandate
by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d 753, 758 759), or
by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing the client’s case. CRPC
3 700(A)(2); Vann, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d at p. 197.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give
notice.
