The court also scheduled a hearing on a petition to approve the compromise of a minor on May 9, 2024, but the hearing was continued after the petitioner failed to file timely papers. The court will question the petitioner about the status of the settlement at the hearing. Any party appearing at the hearing should make arrangements to do so remotely.
