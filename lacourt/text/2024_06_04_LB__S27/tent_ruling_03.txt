 Case Number:  22STCV04747    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Jane Doe filed this
action against Defendants, LBUSD, Thomas Maggio, and Does 2-60 for damages
arising out of childhood sexual abuse. 
Plaintiff filed her complaint on 2/07/22.  
 
2.     Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings 
a.    
Grounds for Motion
LBUSD moves for judgment on the
pleadings on the ground that AB 218 is unconstitutional.  
 
b.     Legal
Standard 
CCP §438 states, in relevant part:
“(b)(1) A party may move for judgment on the pleadings…(c)(1) The motion
provided for in this section may only be made on one of the following
grounds:  (A) If the moving party is a
plaintiff, that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause or
causes of action against the defendant and the answer does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.  (B) If the moving party is a defendant, that
either of the following conditions exist:… (ii) The complaint does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”  
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings “has the purpose and effect of a general demurrer.”  (Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A. (1995) 11
Cal. 4th 138, 146 (citation omitted)). 
“[T]he trial court generally confines itself to the complaint and
accepts as true all material facts alleged therein.  As appropriate, however, it may extend its
consideration to matters that are subject to judicial notice.  In this, it performs essentially the same
task that it would undertake in ruling on a general demurrer.” (Id. (citations
omitted)).
 
c.     Constitutionality
Defendant contends that Assembly
Bill 218, which modified CCP §340.1, is unconstitutional.  
 
The California Court of Appeal
considered Assembly Bill 218 in K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist.
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717.  In that case,
the Court stated, “Section 340.1 governs the period within which a plaintiff
must bring a tort claim based upon childhood sexual abuse.  After its enactment in 1986, the section was
amended repeatedly to expand the statute of limitations and reduce other
barriers to claims, including with a one-year claim revival period in
2002.  Assembly Bill 218 further extended
the statute of limitations, permitted up to treble damages for abuse resulting
from a cover-up, and provided a three-year claim revival period.  Section 340.1, subdivision (a), now permits
an action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual
assault to be brought within 22 years of the age of majority (i.e., age 40) or
five years of when the plaintiff discovered the injury or should have.”  (K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist.
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717, 735, internal quotations and citations
omitted.)  
 
The Court went on to hold, “Assembly
Bill 218 both reduced barriers to childhood sexual assault claims and added
treble damages for assault resulting from a cover-up.  The provisions aimed at reducing barriers
either do not implicate improper retroactivity, or use express revival or
retroactivity language.”  (Id. at
738.)  The Court in K.M. v. Grossmont
Union High School Dist. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717 cited Quarry v. Doe I (2012)
53 Cal.4th 945.  As the Supreme Court of
California noted in that case, “Enlargement of the statutory period in which
civil actions may be brought constitutes a special category within the general
topic of the prospective or retroactive application of statutes.”  (Quarry v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945, 956,
955.)  “As long as the former limitations
period has not expired, an enlarged limitations period ordinarily applies and
is said to apply prospectively to govern cases that are pending when, or
instituted after, the enactment took effect. 
This is true even though the underlying conduct that is the subject of
the litigation occurred prior to the new enactment.”  (Id. at 956.) 
“However, when it comes to applying amendments that enlarge the
limitations period to claims as to which the limitations period has expired
before the amendment became law—that is, claims that have lapsed—the analysis
is different.  Once a claim has lapsed
(under the formerly applicable statute of limitations), revival of the claim is
seen as a retroactive application of the law under an enlarged statute of limitations.”  (Quarry v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945, 957.)
 
Assembly Bill 218 amended
Government Code section 905.  Prior to
the passage of Assembly Bill 218, Government Code section 905 exempted claims
of childhood sexual abuse based on conduct occurring on or after January 1,
2009 from the claims presentation requirements for asserting claims against a
governmental entity.  (See Rubenstein v.
Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 914.) 
Assembly Bill 218 amended Government Code section 905 to exempt all
claims for childhood sexual abuse from the claims presentation requirement
retroactively.  (Gov. Code, § 905, subd.
(p).)  Assembly Bill 218 thus removed a
substantive element of a claim for childhood sexual abuse against a
governmental entity based on past misconduct by its employees.  (See Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist.
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 209.)  The
Legislature cannot “create a liability against the state for any past acts of
negligence on the part of its officers, agents or employees” because that is
“in effect . . . the making of a gift . . . .” 
(Heron v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507, 517; see also Chapman v. State
(1894) 104 Cal. 690, 693.)  Defendant
therefore contends Assembly Bill 218 is unconstitutional as applied to public
entities because it constitutes a gift. 
The Court is not persuaded that Assembly Bill 218 is unconstitutional in
this instance.
 
“It is generally held that in
determining whether an appropriation of public funds is to be considered a
gift, the primary question is whether the funds are to be used for a public or
private purpose; the benefit to the state from an expenditure for a public
purpose is in the nature of consideration and the funds expended are therefore
not a gift even though private persons are benefited therefrom.  The determination of what constitutes a
public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature to determine, and its
discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination
has a reasonable basis.”  (County of
Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 745–746, internal quotations and
citations omitted.)  As the Court in K.M.
v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717 recognized, the
public purpose in reviving claims of childhood sexual abuse is to reduce
barriers for victims to assert claims. 
(K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717,
738.)  The Court cannot say that the
Legislature lacked a reasonable basis in determining that this is a valid
public purpose.  Further, “[a]s a general
rule statutes should be construed, if reasonably possible, to avoid finding
they are unconstitutional.”  (Martin v.
Santa Clara Unified School Dist. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 241, 254.)  
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the motion
for judgment on the pleadings.
LBUSD is ordered to give
notice.
