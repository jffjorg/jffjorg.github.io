 Case Number:  23LBCV02507    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff’s Attorneys, Jason W. Estavillo and David Chaffin, seek to be
relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff, contending there has been a
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and also Plaintiff has ceased
paying for services, such that relief is necessary.  Counsel served the moving papers on Plaintiff
at a confirmed address, and filed proof of service of the moving papers on all
parties to the action.  Notably, there is
no trial date set in the case, and therefore there will be no prejudice to
Plaintiff if relief is granted.  The
motion is unopposed and granted.  Relief
is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order on Plaintiff.  
 
The Court reminds the parties that there is a Case Management Conference
on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the above motion.  The Court asks the parties to make
arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the motion.
