 Case Number:  23LBCV00373    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  S27 Defendants seek an order
consolidating 23LBCV00373 with 23LBCV02142. 
Defendants provide evidence that the two actions arise out of the same
automobile accident.  The two cases are
both assigned to Department S27, such that they are ripe for
consolidation.  Defendants have properly
served all parties in all actions.  Any
opposition to the motion was due on or before 5/21//24.  The Court has not received opposition to the
motion.    
 
The unopposed motion to consolidate is granted.  CCP §1048. 

 
23LBCV00373 is the lead case.  All future papers must be filed in 23LBCV00373.  All future hearing dates must be reserved in 23LBCV00373.  All future hearing dates currently pending in
23LBCV02142 are advanced to today’s date and vacated.  
The Court notes that there is
currently an FSC and trial scheduled in 23LBCV02142 for 11/26/24 and 12/02/24
respectively.  The FSC and trial in
23LBCV00737 are scheduled for 8/23/24 and 9/03/24 respectively.  The Court continues the FSC and trial in both
cases to the dates currently set in 23LBCV02142, 11/26/24 and 12/02/24.  
 
The Court also notes that there is
an OSC re: proof of service on calendar in 23LBCV02142 for 6/05/24.  All defendants in 23LBCV02142 have answered,
and therefore the OSC is discharged and taken off calendar.  
 
Moving Defendants are ordered to
give notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
