The Court has admonished the plaintiff for not meeting and conferring with the defendant's counsel and for not opposing the demurrer or motion to strike. The Court has ordered the plaintiff to meaningfully participate in meet and confer discussions prior to the hearing and to dismiss the challenged claims if he does not intend to oppose the demurrer.
