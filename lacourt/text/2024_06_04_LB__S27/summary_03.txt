Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that Assembly Bill 218 is unconstitutional. The bill, which amended California Government Code section 905, exempted all claims for childhood sexual abuse from claims presentation requirements. The court held that the public purpose of reviving claims of childhood sexual abuse is to reduce barriers for victims to assert claims, and that the Legislature had a reasonable basis for determining that this is a valid public purpose. The court also noted that statutes should be construed, if reasonably possible, to avoid finding they are unconstitutional. The case will proceed to the hearing on June 4, 2024.
