The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel deposition and motion to compel vehicle inspection. The plaintiff failed to appear for deposition despite being served notice and failing to respond to meet-and-confer requests. The plaintiff's objections to the deposition and inspection are not valid. As a result, the plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days and to produce the vehicle for inspection within 30 days. The plaintiff's counsel is also ordered to pay sanctions of $1,200.00 and $1,485.00, respectively, to the defendant.
