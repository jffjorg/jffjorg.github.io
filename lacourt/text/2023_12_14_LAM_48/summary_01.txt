And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the motion of Thomas H. Citron, counsel for Anza Management Company, to be relieved as counsel. This decision is based on the complete breakdown of communication between the client and counsel, making it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the Defendant. The judge notes that an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice, and no prejudice is shown in this case. However, the judge also orders Anza Management Company to retain new counsel by January 15, 2024, or the Court may strike its answer and place it in default. The judge has scheduled an Order to Show Cause for January 15, 2024, to ensure that the Defendant has retained new counsel.
