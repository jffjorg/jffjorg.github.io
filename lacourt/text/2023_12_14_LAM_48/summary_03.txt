```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for terminating sanctions against Schuster Real Estate Co., Ltd, the defendant. The court finds that the defendant has engaged in a pattern of willful discovery abuse, including failing to serve supplemental responses, not opposing motions, and not appearing for depositions. Despite prior sanctions, the defendant has continued to disregard its discovery obligations. The court orders the defendant's answer to be stricken, places the defendant in default, and grants the plaintiff's request for $1,250.00 in sanctions. The Final Status Conference and Jury Trial scheduled for December 14, 2023 are vacated.
