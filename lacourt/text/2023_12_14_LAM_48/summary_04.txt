And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint (TAC) by the plaintiffs against Gloria Corrales. The TAC adds three new causes of action: Fraudulent Concealment/Failure to Disclose, Fraud and Deceit – Intentional Misrepresentation, and Negligent Misrepresentation against Corrales. The plaintiffs learned the information that led to these claims during discovery in the New York litigation, including during Corrales's deposition. The court did not consider the validity of the new claims when granting the motion, but instead focused on whether the plaintiffs had shown good cause to file the amended complaint. The motion was granted because there was no showing of prejudice. The plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve the TAC within five days.
