[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  TO COMPEL DEPOSITION; GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL VEHICLE INSPECTION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 14, 2023



 
On
May 24, 2022, Plaintiff Israel A. Enriquez filed this action against Defendant American
Honda Motor Co. Inc., arising from his purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle.
On
September 1, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition and
a motion to compel vehicle inspection.
MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
On
December 20, 2022, Defendant served a Notice of Deposition for January 17, 2023.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 2.)  On February 7, 2023, Plaintiff served objections.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 3.)  From February 7, 2023 through June 9, 2023, Defendant
sent three meet-and-confer letters/emails asking for alternative dates.  (Chang Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.)  Plaintiff did not respond.
On
July 26, 2023, Defendant served an Amended Notice for August 25, 2023.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 7.)  On August 21, 2023, Plaintiff served objections.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 8.)  The same day, Defendant contacted Plaintiff about
alternative dates, but Plaintiff did not respond.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 9.)
On
September 1, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.
If
a party to the action fails to appear for or proceed with an examination without
making a valid objection under Section 2025.410, the party noticing the deposition
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Section 2025.410 provides for written objections
to a deposition notice “that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with Section
2025.210).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410.,
subd. (a).)
Plaintiff’s
initial objections that he and his counsel “are not available on the above-referenced
date” and that “Defendant unilaterally noticed said deposition without consulting
Plaintiff’s attorneys” are not valid objections under Section 2025.410.  
Plaintiff
also objected to the Amended Notice, stating that he “will not be appearing for
the deposition as presently noticed.  Plaintiff
request that Defendant meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel in order to schedule
the deposition on a mutually agreeable date.” 
This too is not a valid objection.
Plaintiff
argues that “Defendant’s Motion is moot in light of the fact that Plaintiff’s counsel,
in good faith, provided reasonable alternative dates to Defendant’s counsel for
the deposition of Plaintiff Israel Enriquez to occur on November 16, 17, and 21st.”  (Opposition at p. 3.)  But it is undisputed that to date, Plaintiff failed
to appear for his deposition.  Accordingly,
the motion is not moot.
Plaintiff
also argues that the motion is procedurally defective because Defendant failed to
include a separate statement in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a)(4)-(5).  (Opposition at p. 4.)  Defendant is not seeking to “compel answers at
a deposition” or “compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things
at a deposition.”  No answers to specific
questions are being compelled, and this motion is not challenging Plaintiff’s objections
to the document requests.  Rather, Defendant
is seeking to compel Plaintiff’s attendance at a deposition.
The
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition
within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff’s
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,200.00 to Defendant within 30 days.
MOTION TO COMPEL INSPECTION
On
December 20, 2022, Defendant served a Demand for Vehicle Inspection for an inspection
date of February 6, 2023.  (Chang Decl. ¶
4.)  On January 10, 2023, Plaintiff served
objections.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 5.)  On February 2, 2023 and May 17, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel sent meet-and-confer letters.  (Chang
Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.)
On
June 28, 2023, Defendant served an Amended Demand.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff again objected.  (Chang Decl. ¶ 9.)  On August 9 and 21, 2023, Defendant’s counsel
sent meet-and-confer emails.  (Chang Decl.
¶¶ 10-11.)
On
September 1, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel inspection.
If
a responding party fails to comply with a demand for inspection, the demanding party
may move for an order compelling compliance. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
 
Plaintiff’s
objections that “Defendant unilaterally noticed said inspection without confirming
availability with Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel” and request to “[p]lease meet
and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel for a mutually-agreeable date” are not valid
objections.
Plaintiff’s
objection that the “notice for this inspection lacks any indication as to what Defendant
intends to do during this inspection” is overruled.  The both demands stated that the inspection would
involve “testing of the engine, the body of the vehicle, and electrical system”
and “photographs and/or videotaping.”
Plaintiff
argues that the motion is procedurally defective because Defendant failed to include
a separate statement in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(4)-(5).  (Opposition at p. 4.)  Defendant is not seeking to “compel answers at
a deposition” or “compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things
at a deposition” with this motion to compel inspection.
The
Motion to Compel Vehicle Inspection is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to produce the vehicle for inspection within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff’s
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,485.00 to Defendant within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
