DISCUSSION
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity
Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) 
Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal
sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  The Court “must
accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but does not consider conclusions
of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or facts that
are judicially noticed.”  (Stevenson Real
Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-1220.)
A.        Plaintiffs Do Not Properly Allege Breach
of Contract.
The
standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage
to plaintiff therefrom.  (Wall Street Network,
Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)  “A written contract may be pleaded by its terms—set
out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint
and incorporated therein by reference—or by its legal effect.”  (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)  To plead a contract
by its legal effect, a plaintiff must “allege the substance of its relevant terms.  This is more difficult, for it requires a careful
analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal
conclusions.”  (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs
allege, “Defendant caused damaging harm toward Plaintiff’s mental, physical, and
financial stability.  Plaintiff seeks monetary
award and return of title and possession of residence 8901 La Salle Ave, Los Angeles,
CA 90047 in this matter by rescinding Defendant’s Instrument No. 20190031645, 20190031646,
20190350161, 2021 1228470,20211714355, 20220614291, 20220885007.”  (Complaint at p. 3.)  The additional attachments attempt to explain
the procedural history of Plaintiffs’ attempts to assume her late husband’s loan
with Defendant.  (Complaint at pp. 4-5.)  There are no factual allegations about any contract
between Plaintiffs and Defendant, nor any terms.  (See Motion at pp. 2-3.)  The Complaint’s 117 pages of exhibits do not include
any contract between Plaintiffs and Defendant.
Additionally,
Defendant argues that any claim would be barred by the statute of limitations.  “‘In order for the bar of the statute of limitations
to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the
face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action
may be barred.’”  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership
v. City of San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.)  An action based on a written contract must be
brought within four years.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 337.)  An action based on an oral contract
must be brought within two years.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 339.)  The Complaint alleges that
Defendant breached the agreement on January 11, 2019—more than four years before
Plaintiffs filed this action on June 27, 2023. 
(See Complaint at p. 3.)
To
the extent that Plaintiffs also allege breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing (Complaint at p. 2), they cannot state a claim without an underlying
contract.  (See Guz v. Bechtel National,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 349-350 [“The covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
implied by law in every contract, exists merely to prevent one contracting party
from unfairly frustrating the other party’s right to receive the benefits of the
agreement actually made.  . . . It cannot
impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated
in the specific terms of their agreement.”].)
Judgment
on the pleadings is granted for this cause of action.
B.        Plaintiffs Do Not Properly Allege Fraud.
“The
essential elements of a count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation,
(2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.  [Citations.]  The essential elements of a count for negligent
misrepresentation are the same except that it does not require knowledge of falsity
but instead requires a misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no reasonable
grounds for believing it to be true.  [Citations.]”  (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
217, 230-231.)  “Causes of action for intentional
and negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must
be pleaded with specificity.”  (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  “‘This particularity requirement necessitates
pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.’  [Citation.]”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.)
Fraud
based on concealment requires that “(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed
a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact
to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276, 310-311.)  Less specificity is required
to plead fraud by concealment.  (Ibid.)  “Even under the strict rules of common law pleading,
one of the canons was that less particularity is required when the facts lie more
in the knowledge of the opposite party.” 
(Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn.,
Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1384.)
The
Complaint alleges that Defendant “created and maintained a property loan account
for the ‘Estate of Wayne D. Speed’ until 2022” and “demanded $50,460.67 from last
successor,” despite his death in 2013.  (Complaint
at p. 7.)  Defendant also “failed to disclose[]
to the Trustees and the Beneficiaries they knew Wayne D. Speed demised on 10-13-2013
and demanded $50,460.67 for Plaintiff to assume the loan.”  (Ibid.)  “Defendant kept the loan No.0596808564 under Estate
of Wayne D. Speed and did not honour the Plaintiff as the new owner of the loan,”
and in reliance, Plaintiffs “paid the ambiguous monthly mortgage.”  (Id. at p. 8.)  “The Plaintiff was not aware that they didn[’t]
have to pay the demand amount of $50,460.67 and could continue pay their monthly
payments of $2,034.02 under loan No. 0596808564.”  (Id. at p. 10.)
These
allegations are uncertain, lack any specificity, and do not meet the particularity
requirement for pleading a fraud claim.
Judgment
on the pleadings is granted for this cause of action.
C.        Plaintiffs Do Not Properly Allege Identity
Theft.
Within
the fraud claim, the Complaint alleges theft of Wayne D. Speed’s identity.  (Complaint at pp. 8-9.)  “Under Instrument No. 20190031646, The Defendant
recorded a fraudualnt [sic] foreclosure in 2019 on Wayne D. Speed’s dissolved loan
N0.0596808564 and furthering stealing his identity from the years 2013 (after his
demised DOD 10-13-2013)- until 2022.”  (Complaint
at p. 8.)  Additionally, Defendant “open[ed]
new account loan No. 0596808564 and sent to the Estate of Wayne D. Speed via the
United States Post Service demanded $50,460.67 to steal Wayne D. Speed’s identity
to created fraudulent [sic] foreclosures.” 
(Id. at p. 9.)
“In
order to recover actual damages or attorney’s fees in an action or cross-complaint
filed by a person alleging that they are a victim of identity theft, the person
shall show that they provided written notice to the claimant that a situation of
identity theft might exist, including, upon written request of the claimant, a valid,
signed Federal Trade Commission (FTC) identity theft report completed at least 30
days before filing the action, or within their cross-complaint pursuant to this
section.  In the alternative, the person may
provide a valid copy of a police report or of a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
investigative report, filed pursuant to Section 530.5 of the Penal Code, at least
30 days before filing the action or within their cross-complaint pursuant to this
section.”  (Civ. Code, § 1798.93, subd. (c)(5).)
The
Complaint’s conclusory allegation of identity theft provides no indication that
this was done.  Moreover, Plaintiffs do not
allege theft of their own identities.  (See
Motion at pp. 7-8.)
Judgment
on the pleadings is granted for this cause of action.
D.        Plaintiffs Do Not Allege Any Facts For
the Additional Causes of Action.
To
the extent that Plaintiff purport to bring claims for negligence, violation of the
California Consumer Protection Act, and unjust enrichment (Complaint at p. 2), there
are no supporting factual alleges, and Plaintiffs do not attach pages for these
causes of action as required.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.  Because Plaintiffs have not shown any way they
can plausibly remedy the deficiencies, no leave to amend is granted.
Defendant
is ordered to submit a proposed form of judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
January 3, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
