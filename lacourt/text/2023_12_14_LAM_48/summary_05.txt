And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Nationstar Mortgage LLC's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The ruling states that Plaintiffs Doris Speed and The Doris Speed Trust have failed to properly plead their causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and identity theft.

The judge found that Plaintiffs' allegations of breach of contract were insufficient because they did not specify the terms of the contract or provide any factual support for their claims. Similarly, the judge found that Plaintiffs' allegations of fraud were conclusory and lacked specificity, and that they did not provide any evidence of identity theft.

The judge also found that Plaintiffs had failed to plead any factual allegations in support of their claims of negligence, violation of the California Consumer Protection Act, and unjust enrichment.

As a result, the judge has granted Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and has denied Plaintiffs' leave to amend their complaint. The judge has ordered Defendant to submit a proposed form of judgment within five days.
