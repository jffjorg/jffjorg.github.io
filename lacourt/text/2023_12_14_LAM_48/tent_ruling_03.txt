  CASE NO.: 22STCV17459
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR TERMINATING
  SANCTIONS 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 14, 2023



 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff Bahram
Rasizadeh filed this action against Defendant Schuster Land Corporation.
On
October 17, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for evidentiary sanctions
and prohibited Defendant from introducing witnesses regarding the condition of the
property, the cause of the conditions of the property, the citations, or any attempts
to abate the conditions at the property. 
Defendant did not oppose that motion or appear at the hearing.
On
October 25, 2023, Plaintiff noticed the deposition of Defendant’s PMK on November
8, 2023.  (Littlefield Decl. ¶ 4.)
On
October 26, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions
that was primarily based on Defendant’s failure to serve supplemental responses
pursuant to the Court’s August 31, 2023 order. 
Defendant did not oppose that motion or appear at the hearing.
Plaintiff’s
counsel called or emailed Defendant’s counsel every business day before the November
8, 2023 deposition.  (Littlefield Decl. ¶
5 & Ex. C.)  Defendant did not respond,
and its PMK did not appear for the deposition. 
(Littlefield Decl. ¶ 7; Motion at pp. 5-6.)
On
November 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for terminating sanctions.  Defendant did not file an opposition.
At
the November 27, 2023 Final Status Conference, Plaintiff’s counsel represented that
he had not heard from Defendant.  Defendant
did not appear.
A
court may impose a terminating sanction against anyone engaging in conduct that
is a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)  Misuse
of the discovery process includes failing to respond to discovery, unjustifiably
making unmeritorious objections to discovery, and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)  “The trial court may order a terminating sanction
for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the]
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery.’  [Citation.]  Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly.  But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules,
the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)
Prior
evidentiary and monetary sanctions have not deterred Defendant and have not
been effective in compelling Defendant to comply with its discovery obligations.  Defendant’s disregard of Plaintiff’s discovery
motions and failure to oppose or even appear for those hearings demonstrates a pattern
of willful discovery abuse.  Additionally,
the Final Status Conference and Jury Trial are scheduled for the same date as this
motion, after the Court continued those dates due to Defendant’s failure to appear
at the November 27, 2023 Final Status Conference.  Plaintiff has filed his pretrial documents, but
Defendant has not.
Under
the totality of the circumstances, Plaintiff has shown a history of willful discovery
abuse by Defendant such that less severe sanctions would be ineffective.
Accordingly,
the motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  The request for monetary sanctions is granted
in part, and Defendant’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,250.00 to
Plaintiff within 30 days.
Defendant’s
answer, filed on July 6, 2022, is stricken, and Defendant is placed in default.
The
Final Status Conference and Jury Trial (Five to Seven-Day Time Estimate) scheduled
for December 14, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. are vacated.
An
Order to Show Case Re: Failure to Obtain Default Judgment is scheduled for March
14, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 14th day of December 2023
