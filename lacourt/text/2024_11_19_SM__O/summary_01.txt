And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel property inspection and sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendant, James and Ada Horwich, had requested to inspect the plaintiff, Adam Askari's, home to analyze his home stereo system sound levels. However, during the initial attempt at inspection, Askari's counsel was not present and Askari declined to operate the home stereo system, preventing the inspection from being completed. The court orders another property inspection to be held, with Askari's counsel required to attend. Askari is also ordered to provide information about the sound system and phone application used to control it. Additionally, the court orders Askari to pay sanctions in the amount of $3,115.00 for the defendant's attorney fees and filing fees.
