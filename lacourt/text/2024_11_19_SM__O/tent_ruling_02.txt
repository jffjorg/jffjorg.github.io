TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants Gold’s Gym California, LLC (Doe 1), Google,
Inc., and the Richlar Partnerships’ Motion for Leave to Amend their Answer is
GRANTED. The motion includes a copy of the proposed amended answer pursuant to
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b). (Edic Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Defendants
counsel William S. Edic (“Edic”) includes a declaration specifying the effects
of the amendments, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts
giving rise to the amendment were discovered, and the reason why the amendment
was not made earlier pursuant to Cal Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b). (Edic
Decl., ¶¶ 2–4, Ex. A.) The Court finds that the motion is timely and there will
no prejudice to the Plaintiff because the trial is set for a little under a
year from this motion hearing. Additionally, Plaintiff did not file any
opposition, thus Plaintiff did not argue prejudice if the motion is granted. 
 
            Defendants are ordered to file the amended answer forthwith.
