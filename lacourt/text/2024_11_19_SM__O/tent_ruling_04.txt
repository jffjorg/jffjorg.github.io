TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Kwala, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED. Plaintiff satisfies their burden as moving party to submit admissible
evidence of each element of an unlawful detainer cause of action pursuant to
CCP § 1161a(b)(3). Defendants do not meet their burden to show a triable issue
of fact as the elements of unlawful detainer.
 
            Plaintiffs Objections Nos. 1, 6–24 are SUSTAINED.
Plaintiff’s Objections Nos 2–5 are OVERRULED. 
 
Plaintiffs
RJN Nos. 6, 8, 9, 27, 31, 35, and 36 are GRANTED. “[C]ourts have taken judicial
notice of the existence and recordation of real property records, including
deeds of trust, when the authenticity of the documents is not challenged.” (Fontenot
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264, disapproved of
on separate grounds by Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62
Cal.4th 919.) “Judicial notice may be taken of the fact of a document's
recordation, the date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to
the transaction reflected in a recorded document, and the document's legally
operative language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the
document's authenticity. From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the
legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its
face.” (Linda Vista Village San Diego Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Tecolote
Investors, LLC (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 166, 184.)
 
Plaintiff’s
remaining RJNs are not material to the motion. 
 
            Defendant’s Objections to the
Plaintiff’s RJN are OVERRULED. 
 
 
REASONING
 
            “A plaintiff ...has met his or her
burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party
has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment
on the cause of action. Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)   
A moving
Plaintiff or Cross-Complainant does not bear the burden of disproving a
defendant’s affirmative defenses or cross-claims to succeed on a motion for
summary judgment. (See Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.
(2009) 170 Cal.App. 4th 554, 564 [“Plaintiffs initial burden of proof in moving
for summary judgment, however, did not include disproving any affirmative
defenses asserted by defendants”].)
 
            “[T]he party moving for summary
judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of
material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’
[Citation.]” (Behnke v. State Farm General Ins. Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1463; see also Nalwa v. Cedar Fair, L.P. (2012) 55
Cal.4th 1148, 1153–1154.) “A plaintiff moving for summary judgment establishes
the absence of a defense to a cause of action by proving ‘each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.’
[Citation.] The plaintiff need not, however, disprove any affirmative defenses
alleged by the defendant. [Citation.] Once the plaintiff's burden is met, the
burden of proof shifts to the defendant ‘to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.’ [Citation.]
In meeting this burden, the defendant must present ‘specific facts showing’ the
existence of the triable issue of material fact.” (City of Monterey v.
Carrnshimba (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1081.)  “The court's assessment of whether the moving
party has carried its burden—and therefore caused a shift—occurs before the
court's evaluation of the opposing party's papers.  Therefore, the burden on the motion does not
initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in the opposing
papers.” (Mosley v. Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49
Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 [landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they
were aware of their tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds to
grant summary judgment where moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden
as to the issue); Thatcher v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th
1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot grant summary judgment based merely on lack of
opposition; court must first determine if the moving party has satisfied its
burden].)   
 
            In addition, the evidence and
affidavits of the moving party are construed strictly, while those of the
opponent are liberally read. (Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100. “All doubts as to the propriety of granting the
motion (whether there is any issue of material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] §
437c) are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion (i.e., a
denial of summary judgment).” (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
“The
procedures governing a motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer
action are streamlined (e.g., separate statements are not required under
section 437c, subdivision (s) of the Code of Civil Procedure), but such a
motion ‘shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c.” (KB Salt Lake III, supra, 95
Cal.App.5th at p. 1045.)
 
In
Unlawful Detainer proceedings “[a] motion for summary judgment may be made at
any time after the answer is filed upon giving five days notice. Summary
judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under Section
437c.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.)
 
 
I.  Unlawful
detainer pursuant to CCP §1161a(b)(3) 

A. Elements of unlawful detainer under CCP §1161a(b)(3)  
 
“In
any of the following cases, a person who holds over and continues in possession
of…real property after a three-day written notice to quit the property has been
served upon the person, or if there is a subtenant in actual occupation of the
premises, also upon such subtenant, as prescribed in Section 1162, may be
removed therefrom as prescribed in this chapter:…(3) Where the property has
been sold in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under a power of
sale contained in a deed of trust executed by such person, or a person under
whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been duly
perfected.”  (CCP §1161a(b)(3).) 
 
Under
CCP §1161a(b)(3), three conditions must be satisfied as prerequisites to filing
a UD thereunder:  (1) property that has been sold in accordance with Civil
Code §2924; (2) pursuant to a power of sale contained in a deed of trust
executed by the holdover possessor, or a person under who such person claims;
and (3) the title under the sale has been duly perfected.  (See Dr.
Leevil, LLC v. Westlake Health Care Center (2018) 6 Cal.5th 474,
479.)  Duly perfected title requires that title be recorded, and title
must be perfected prior to service of a 3-day notice under CCP
§1161a(b)(3).  (Ibid. [purchaser who served 3-day notice per CCP
§1161a(b)(3) prior to recording title failed to satisfy preconditions of CCP
§1161a(b)(3) and was not entitled to UD judgment].) 
 
“[T]he
subsequent purchaser must prove that the statutory requirements have been
satisfied, i.e., that the sale was conducted in accordance with section 2924 of
the Civil Code and that title under such sale was duly perfected.” (Stephens,
Partain & Cunningham v. Hollis (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 948, 953.) “[I]n
this context, perfection of title requires that the instrument of conveyance
(the trustee's deed) be recorded pursuant to Government Code section 27280.” (Dr.
Leevil, LLC v. Westlake Health Care Center (2018) 6 Cal.5th 474, 479; see
also Gov. Code, § 27280.)
 
 
B. 
Scope of unlawful detainer proceeding under CCP § 1161a(b)(3) 
 
A
“judgment in unlawful detainer usually has very limited res judicata effect and
will not prevent one who is dispossessed from bringing a subsequent action to
resolve questions of title, [citation,] or to adjudicate other legal and
equitable claims between the parties. [Citations.]  A qualified exception
to the rule that title cannot be tried in unlawful detainer is contained in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a, which extends the summary eviction
remedy beyond the conventional landlord-tenant relationship to include certain
purchasers of property such as Hudgins.  Section 1161a provides for a
narrow and sharply focused examination of title. To establish that he is a
proper plaintiff, one who has purchased property at a trustee's sale and seeks
to evict the occupant in possession must show that he acquired the property at
a regularly conducted sale and thereafter ‘duly perfected’ his title. [Citation.]
Thus, we have declared that to this limited extent, as provided by the statute,
title may be litigated in such a proceeding.”  (Vella v. Hudgins
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 251, 255.)
 
            Thus, in an unlawful detainer action pursuant to CCP
§1161a(b)(3), a “narrow and sharply focused examination of title” is
permitted.  (Ibid.)  The narrow and sharply
focused examination of title includes allegations of technical irregularity in
a trustee’s sale.  (Id. at pp. 256 and 258.)  However,
activities not directly connected to the conduct of the sale is “much less
clear.”  (Id. at p. 256.)   
 
            “[B]road question of title could not be raised and
litigated by cross-complaint or affirmative defense,” in a unlawful detainer
action pursuant to CCP § 1161a(b)(3).” (Cheney v. Trauzettel (1937) 9
Cal.2d 158, 159.) “Matters affecting the validity of the trust deed or primary obligation
itself, or other basic defects in the plaintiff's title, are neither properly
raised in this summary proceeding for possession, nor are they concluded by the
judgment.” (Ibid.)


II.  Plaintiff
satisfies its burden as moving party 
            
            As the moving party on summary
judgment, Plaintiff Kwala, LLC (“Kwala”) was required to establish all three
preconditions to service of a 3-day notice under CCP §1161a(b)(3), in addition
to proper service of the 3-day notice. Kwala establishes the following:
 
(1)
A proper trustee’s sale in accordance with CC §2924 pursuant to a power of sale
based on the evidence presented and the rebuttable presumption of a properly
noticed sale under CC §2924(c). (see Dicecca Decl., ¶¶ 9, 1–12, 25, 29, Ex. 5,
7, 8, 22; Klein Decl., ¶ 4; Ince Decl., ¶ 4; Dutcher Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B; RJN No,
6, 8, 9, 27, 36.)
 
(2)
Duly perfected title by delivery and recordation. (See Ince Decl., ¶ 5; Dicecca
Decl. ¶ 29, Exh. 25; RJN No. 35.); and 
 
(3)
Service of a 3-day notice to quit after a proper trustee’s sale under CC §2924
and due perfection of title. (See Macario Decl., ¶¶ 4–5, Ex. E–G; Klein Decl. ¶
7, Ex. 2; Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 37-39, Exh. 33 [PP’s Resp. to RFA, Set 1, Nos. 19–21,
26], Exh. 34 [SW’s Resp. to RFA, Set 1, Nos.  18–20, 25], Exh. 35 [RW’s Resp. to RFA, Set 1,
Nos. 18–20, 25], Ex. 36 [PP’s Resp. to FRG-UD, Set 1, No. 72.3], Exh. 37 [SW’s
Resp. to FRG-UD, Set 1, No. 72.3] & Exh. 38 [RW’s Resp. to FRG-UD, Set 1,
No. 72.3].)
 
            Kwala establishes the “Notice to Quit required Pacific
and the Weingartens to vacate the Property within three days of service, but
Defendants did not vacate the Property within that time and continue to occupy
the Property.” (Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 37-39, Exh. 33 [PP’s Resp. to RFA, Set 1, No.
20-21], Exh. 34 [SW’s Resp. to RFA, Set 1, Nos. 19-20] & Exh. 35 [RW’s
Resp. to RFA, Set 1, Nos. 19-20].) 
 
            Kwala establishes that they filed the instant action on
5-28-24, more than three days after the service of the notice to quit on
5-21-24. (Ibid.; see also 5-28-24 Complaint.)
 
            Kwala has therefore shown that Kwala was the assignee under
the Deed of Trust on 4-21-22 (RJN No. 6; Dicecca Decl., Ex. 5.) Kwala has shown
that a proper Trustees Deed Upon sale which sets forth compliance with all
requirements of law. (RJN, No. 36; Dicecca Decl. ¶ 29, Exh. 25.) Kwala
establishes they served a three-day notice to occupants to vacate the premises
by personal service on Shlomy Weingarten and by posting and mailing the notice.
(Macario Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Exhs. E-G; Klein Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 2.) Kwala shows that on
10-3-22 a Notice of Default and Election to Sell under Deed of Trust (“NOD”) based
on the 1st Deed of Trust were recorded on the Property. (RJN No. 9;
Dicecca Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. 8)
 
            Thus, Kwala satisfies its burden as moving party to
submit admissible evidence of each element of an unlawful detainer cause of
action pursuant to CCP § 1161a(b)(3).
 
III.  Defendant
fails to raise triable issue of material fact as to the Unlawful Detainer
Action  
 
            Defendants Pacific Panorama, LLC (“Panorama”), Shlomy
Weingarten (“Shlomy”), and Revital Weingarten (“Revital”) (collectively
“Defendants”) argue there are triable issues of fact because Kwala allegedly
entered into an agreement with Shlomy, “years before the purported foreclosure,”
to maintain the property in exchange for his residency on the property. (Oppo.,
p. 6; (Tiomkin Decl, ¶¶ 3-5, Exhibits A-C.) Defendants point to a 6-30-14
agreement between Shlomy and Kwala purporting to give Shlomy the right to
occupy the Property, however, Shlomy declares that this agreement was part of a
plan between Panorama and Kwala where Kwala was to “invest in the development
and sell the property for a profit after paying off the encumbrances.” (Shlomy
Decl., ¶ 5.).  
 
Shlomy
does not provide any evidence that Kwala owned, or was an agent for the owner,
of the Property.  Shlomy does mot provide
any evidence that Kwala had the right or authority grant any “occupancy”
interest in the property to Shlomy.  Nor
does Shlomy provide any evidence any “plan” between Panorama and Kwala was ever
finalized. Additionally, Shlomy does not provide any purchase agreement, grant
deed, or any other document which would prove that Kwala was  the owner of the property in 2014 when the
alleged occupancy agreement was made. (Ripani v. Liberty Loan Corp.
(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 603, 609 [“Civil Code section 1624, subdivision (4),
provides that a lease for a period longer than one year is invalid unless the
lease, or a note or memorandum thereof, is in writing and subscribed by the
party to be charged or his agent, and if by his agent, the lease is invalid
unless the agent's authority is in writing and subscribed by the party to be
charged”].) 
 
Without
evidence provided that Kwala could legally enter into an occupancy agreement
with Shlomy on 6-30-14 as an owner, or agent for the owner, of the property,
Shlomy has not met his burden to show that there are triable issues of fact as
to an existing lease agreement between Kwala and Shlomy. 
 
Defendants
argue there are procedural defects within the foreclosure process “such as a
failure to provide a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as required by Civ Code §
2923.7 and lack of proper notification under Civ. Code § 2923.55.” (Oppo., p.
10.) However, Defendants do not point to any competent evidence in the attached
declarations to support this argument.  Thus,
Defendants provide no evidence to show a triable issue of fact remains
regarding the validity of the foreclosure sale. 
 
Kwala’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.  Kawla is to submit the proposed judgment of
possession.
