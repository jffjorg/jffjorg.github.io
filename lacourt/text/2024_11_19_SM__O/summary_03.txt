Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to strike the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's notice to the Labor Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) is sufficient to put the defendant on notice of the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claim. The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient specific facts to meet the pleading standards of the prelitigation LWDA notice and that the notice is not a sham pleading. The court also grants the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint to fix typographical errors.
