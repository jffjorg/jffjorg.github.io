  Case Number:  21SMCV01433    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  O 11-19-24 21SMCV01433 Askari MTC Property Inspection
(essentially a Motion to Compel Compliance with Property Inspection)
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainants James and Ada Horwichs' Motion
to Compel Property Inspection and sanctions in the amount of $3,115.00 (4.7
hrs. @ $650/hr + $60 filing fee) against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Adam Askari
is GRANTED. The Motion was filed on 8-20-24, and no opposition has been filed
as of 11-13-24.  On 7-16-24 the Court ordered discovery reopened so that
Defendant/Cross-Complainants James and Ada Horwich (the "Horwiches")
could inspect Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Adam Askari's ("Askari")
property for the express purpose of analyzing Askari's home stereo system sound
levels. (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, Ex. A, B; see 7-16-24 Minute Order.) The
Horwiches counsel, Kenneth Ruttenberg ("Ruttenberg") declares that on
8-9-24, Ruttenberg, along with an acoustical consultant to examine the home
stereo system, arrived at Askari's home to conduct the property inspection, but
Askari's counsel was not present, and Askari declined to operate the home
stereo system. (Id., ¶¶ 4–5, Ex. C.) The Horwiches therefore could not
complete the property inspection because the examination of the home stereo
system was the stated goal of the inspection. 
 
The Court orders another property inspection to be held on
_____________________________________________________. 
 
Counsel for Askari is ordered to attend the inspection, in
person.  Askari is ordered to give Horwiches'
counsel, and acoustical consultant, access to the home the sound system, and allow
them to use  Askari's phone application to
control Askari's home stereo system for the purpose of measuring sound levels
originating at the Askari property.   Specifically, Askari is ordered to provide
the make and model of the sound system used by Askari  the name of the phone application that is
readily available to use to control that system, the user login information, including
user name and password, if necessary, to access and test that sound system, all
to Horwich’s counsel within 5 days from this hearing. 
 
Finally, the Court orders Askari to pay sanctions to the
Horwichs in the amount of $3,115.00 (4.7 hrs. @ $650/hr + $60 filing fee) under
CCP § 2031.320. 
 
The Horwiches request for issue and/or evidentiary sanctions
is DENIED.
 
The Horwichs
are to submit the proposed order.
