Summary:

The judge has denied Defendant Patrick Graham's motion for reconsideration of the July 10, 2023, order extending the stay, increasing the rent, and requiring payment of the water bill. The motion was filed on July 24, 2023, and the court found that it was timely. However, the court denied the motion because it lacked any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that could not have been discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion. The court also found that Defendant failed to establish an equitable basis to vacate the order in its entirety, given the four-month period of non-payment and continuing occupation of the premises. The court has deferred consideration of the current order until the January 3, 2024, hearing to terminate, and advises Defendant to account for the actual bill responsibility during the period of the tenancy and present express justification for any basis of non-payment.
