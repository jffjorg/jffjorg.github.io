And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the person most qualified (PMQ) for General Motors (GM), as well as the production of documents. The plaintiff has been seeking to compel the deposition of the PMQ for almost 11 months, while GM has been attempting to delay discovery. The court notes that the motion effectively constitutes a preemptive motion to compel further testimony and/or a counter motion for protective order. The court orders the parties to meet and confer within the next 20 calendar days to agree upon a mutually convenient deposition date, which must occur within the next 45 days. The court will not impose sanctions given the parties' agreement to conduct the deposition, but warns that excessive objections and/or termination of the deposition may lead to the setting of an order compelling further responses with sanctions.
