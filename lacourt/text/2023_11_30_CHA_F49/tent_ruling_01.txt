SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
January 4, 2022, Plaintiff Macaria Beltran, trustee of the MCB Trust, filed a
complaint for unlawful detainer based on an alleged breach of a month to month
residential lease agreement in November 2021.
 
On
August 19, 2022, the court held a bench trial and ruled in favor of plaintiff
landlord. The court entered judgment on September 12, 2022, which provides for
possession within 30 days of the order, and the return of keys, clickers, and
gate operating systems. The writ of possession was entered on September 29,
2022. 
 
On
November 8, 2022, the court denied Defendant’s motion for relief from
forfeiture. Defendant filed an appeal on November 10, 2022. On November 22,
2022, the court stayed any lockout from the property pending a hearing on a
motion to stay. On December 30, 2022, the court granted the stay pending appeal
on condition that defendant continue to pay the $5,000 monthly rent. On July
10, 2023, the court heard the ex parte motion to terminate the stay, whereby
the court left the stay in place on condition that defendant pay $10,000 no
later than July 21, 2023, and $7,500/month rent due on the 20th of
each month, plus the entire outstanding water bill. 
 
RULING: Denied.
Defendant
Patrick Graham moves for reconsideration of the July 10, 2023, order extending
the stay, increasing the rent, and requirement for payment of the water bill. Plaintiff
in opposition challenges any showing for a basis of relief and contends the
motion misrepresents the order of the court in conditionally granting the stay
pending payment of rent and the water bill.
 
“When an application for an order has been made to a judge,
or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
Defendant in reply challenges the late filed reply. Defendant reiterates the
circumstances leading to the failure to earlier raise the arguments at the time
of the ex parte hearing. Defendant concedes to a preexisting $2,3374.44 water
bill at the time of the beginning of the tenancy.
 
The motion itself was filed on July 24, 2023. Because the
July 10, 2023, order was taken under submission and mail notice of the ruling provided,
the court adds five days for service of the order. The motion is therefore
timely.
 
“A motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the
party moving for reconsideration can offer ‘new or different facts,
circumstances, or law which it could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion. (Citations.) A motion
for reconsideration will be denied absent a strong showing of diligence.”
(Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690; Forrest v. State Of
California Dept. Of Corporations (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202 disapproved of
and overruled on unrelated grounds in Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal.4th
1164, 1172 (footnote 3); New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212–213; Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America. (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199.) Disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact that will
support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd v.  AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a
motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.” (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494,
1499.)  Motions for reconsideration are
restricted to circumstances where a party offers the Court some fact or
circumstance not previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering
it earlier. (Id.) 
 
Defendant moves for relief on grounds that the order for
payment of the full outstanding water bill, now totaling $30,409.64, includes
amounts predating the tenancy. The subject matter is specifically encompassed
within the appeal. Defendant therefore moves to alter the order requiring
payment for only that period of tenancy. Requiring payment of the entire bill
improperly violates the parameters of the stay. Counsel acknowledges the lack
of argument at the time of the ex parte hearing, but seeks to excuse the
omission due to the pressing timeline of the ex parte hearing, and decision to
focus on the impact to the stay itself. 
 
Plaintiff in opposition notes the absence of any argument
regarding concerns over the water bill at the time of the opposition and
hearing, or at any time during the litigation. Defendant continues to fail to
make any payment towards the water bill, thereby prompting Plaintiff to file an
ex parte motion to terminate the stay currently set for January 3, 2024.
Plaintiff argues against yet another effort to reargue the issue.
 
The court accepts the failure to present the new argument at
the ex parte hearing, even considering the acknowledgment of the water bill
dispute at the beginning of the tenancy. The court also considers the equity of
the situation and the intent of the court in increasing the rent, and
addressing the water bill dispute, rather than simply deflecting consideration
due to the admitted omissions of counsel at the time of the ex parte.
 
In considering the motion itself, the court finds a complete
lack of any address for establishment of the dates of the tenancy, and more
specifically the failure to even offer payment for a portion of the bill during
the clear period of the tenancy. Only in the reply does Defendant even acknowledge
the preexisting bill for $2,337.44. Defendant seeks to excuse the failure to
pay the remaining $28,072.20 balance admittedly accrued during the tenancy on
grounds that Los Angeles City Department of Water and Power refuses to transfer
the bill into Defendant’s name due to the prior outstanding bill.
 
While the court accepts the representation of the refusal to
transfer the bill, nothing in the motion or reply justifies the failure to
still arrange for payment of the admitted accrued bill during the tenancy. The
court can consider deducting the currently undisputed amount of $2,337.44, but
the motion still lacks justification for complete non-payment and therefore
disobedience of the court order simply based on the insistence that the bill be
transferred in the name of Defendant in order to facilitate payment. Nothing in
the motion establishes the inability to pay the bill as a third party.
 
Thus, even considering the basis for the failure to raise
the issue at the time of the hearing and consideration of the basis of the
request, the court finds a lack of an equitable basis to vacate the order in
its entirety as requested, especially given the now four months and counting
period of non-payment with continuing occupation of the premises.
 
The court therefore defers consideration of the current
order until the January 3, 2024, hearing to terminate. The court advises
Defendant to both account for the actual bill responsibility during the period
of the tenancy, and present express justification for any basis of non-payment.
If Defendant maintains an inability to pay as a third party tenant, the court
will ask for explicit citation to published rules from the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power expressing the basis for the inability to process
a third party offer of payment. A lack of proof will be interpreted as a
concession to the nonexistence of such a condition, and therefore potential
evidence of a simple refusal to comply with the court order. Defendant remains
in the property as a function of court equity. Thus, any and all failure to
sufficiently account for the lack of payment will be considered at the time of
the January 3, 2024, hearing. 
 
Graham to give notice.
