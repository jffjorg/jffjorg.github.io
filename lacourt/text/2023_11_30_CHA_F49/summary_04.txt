Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for preliminary injunction filed by Same Love Surrogacy, LLC (SLS) against Jay Cook-Wong, Danny Cook-Wong, and All Love Surrogacy, LLC. The motion seeks to enjoin the respondents from soliciting, employing, or retaining current or former employees of SLS, as well as to prevent them from using any confidential information or trade secrets. The judge denies the motion to seal the records, finding that the motion lacks specific support for a nexus between the medical information and the existence of a trade secret. The judge invites the parties to consider a protective order regarding disclosure limitations and invites them to file redacted documents with the court. The motion for preliminary injunction will be heard on January 23, 2024.
