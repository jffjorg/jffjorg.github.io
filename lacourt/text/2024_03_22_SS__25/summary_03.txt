And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award filed by Robert K. Holmes. The Petitioner is seeking to confirm an arbitration award in the amount of $17,588.00 against Marcus Kellum. However, the judge has found that the Petitioner has not satisfied all the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4, which requires the Petitioner to provide the substance of the parties' agreement to arbitrate within the petition. Additionally, the judge has not received proof of service indicating that the petition and notice of hearing were served on the Respondent. Therefore, the judge has continued the hearing on the petition to June 6, 2024, and ordered the Petitioner to provide supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies noted in the ruling.
