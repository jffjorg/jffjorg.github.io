Dederick (the  “Arbitrator”) issued an arbitration award (the “Award”) in the amount of $17,588.00  for Petitioner Robert K. Holmes (“Petitioner”) and against Respondent Marcus  Kellum (“Respondent”).    On November 17, 2023, the Petitioner  filed the instant Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award.    No opposition has been filed.           MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Petitioner requests  the Court to confirm the arbitration award for $17,588.00 and enter judgment  for Petitioner. The Petitioner additionally seeks an award of interest at the  statutory rate and costs of the suit.    OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.   ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  “Any  party to an arbitration award in which an award has been made may petition the  court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief  granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a  judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)  107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to  confirm an award is filed, the superior  court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm the award,  correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of  Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well  settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely  narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.  v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may  ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the  arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an  arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, at p.  1063-64.)    II.        Discussion    A.        Filing Requirements (Code Civ.  Proc., § 1285.4)   Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4  states: “A petition under this  chapter shall:    (a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of  the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of the  agreement.   (b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators.    (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and  the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”    (Code Civ.  Proc. § 1285.4.) “A response to a petition under this chapter may request the  court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.2.)   The Court  finds that the Petitioner has not  satisfied all the requirements of CCP section 1285.4 by setting forth the  substance of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate within the Petition. Here,  the Petitioner has provided the name of the arbitrator – Mary J. Dederick. (Pet. p. 2 ¶  4.) Petitioner has also attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of  the Arbitrator. (Pet. pp. 4-10 – Attach. 6(c).)  The  Award provides that the Petitioner is to be awarded the amount totaling  $17,588.20 representing the difference  between the $22,588.20 in fees and/or costs which should have been charged in  the matter, and $5,000.00 paid by Respondent. (Id. p. 9: 2-17.)  However, the  Petitioner has not attached a copy of the attorney-client agreement and has not  set forth the substance of the arbitration provision in accordance with CCP  1285.4(a), or otherwise denied the existence of an attorney-client agreement.  Moreover, the Arbitrator refers to a written retainer in her opinion. (Pet.  p.7: 27.)  Thus, the Petitioner has not satisfied CCP section  1285.4. B.        Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (Code Civ.  Proc. § 1290.4) Code of  Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 states, in relevant part:    “(a) A copy of the petition and a  written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other  papers upon which the petition is based  shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the  service of such petition and notice.   (b) If the arbitration agreement does not  provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom  service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not  previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:   (1) Service within this State shall be made in the  manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.    (2) Service outside this State shall be made by mailing  the copy of the petition and notice of hearing and other papers by registered  or certified mail. Personal service is the equivalent of such service by mail.  Proof of service by mail shall be made by affidavit showing such mailing  together with the return receipt of the United States Post Office bearing the  signature of the person on whom service was made…”    (Code Civ. Proc., §  1290.4(a)&(b).)   Here, the Petitioner does not  provide the Court with proof of service indicating that both the Petition and  notice of hearing were served on Respondent. Thus, the Court finds that Petitioner has not satisfied CCP  section 1290.4. C.        Service  of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (Code Civ. Proc. §§  1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6  provides that, “The neutral arbitrator  shall serve a signed copy of  the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or  certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  1283.6.)  California Rules of Court rule  3.825(b)(1) provides that the arbitrator must file the award with the clerk,  with proof of service on each party to the arbitration. (CA ST CIVIL RULES Rule  3.825(b)(1)) A party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award  by filing and serving a petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served on the petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)             Here, included in the Petition is a copy of the proof of  service indicating that the Arbitrator served the Award by mail on both  Petitioner and Respondent on October 02, 2023. The instant Petition was filed  on November 17, 2023, more than ten days after the award was served on the  Petitioner. Therefore, the  Court finds that the Petition satisfies CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4.  D.  Challenge to the Award.  Code of Civil Procedure § 1285.2 provides that a response to  a petition to confirm an arbitration award may request the court to dismiss the  petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.)  The Code further provides in § 1285.8  that a response requesting such relief “shall set forth the grounds on which  the request for such relief is based. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.8.)  Moreover,  the court may not either vacate or correct the award unless the petition or  response was:  (a)   …  duly served and filed; or  (b)   …  duly served and filed and;  (1)    All petitioners and respondents are before the court;  or  (2)    All petitioners and respondents have been given  reasonable notice that the court will be requested at the hearing to vacate the  award or that the court on its own motion has determined to vacate the award  and all petitioners and respondents have been given an opportunity to show why  the award should not be vacated. (Code Civ.  Proc., §§ 1286.4, 1286.8.)   The Court notes that no opposition has been filed in response  to the instant Petition. However, as noted above, the Petitioner does not  provide the Court with proof of service indicating that both the Petition and  notice of hearing were served on Respondent.  Accordingly, for the reasons noted herein, the Court CONTINUES  the hearing on the Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award.  II.        Conclusion               Petitioner Robert K. Holmes’s Petition  to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award is CONTINUED TO JUNE 6, 2024, at  10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.    At least 16 court days before the next  scheduled hearing, Petitioner must serve and electronically file supplemental  papers addressing the deficiencies noted in this Court’s ruling. Failure to do  so will result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.    Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
