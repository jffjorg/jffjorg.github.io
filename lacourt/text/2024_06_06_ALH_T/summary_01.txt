And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling grants defendant's motion to enforce the court's January 31, 2024, order. The plaintiff, Christina Gutierrez, failed to comply with the court's order to provide code-compliant responses to interrogatories. The defendant, AEG Management LACC, LLC, seeks to enforce the court's order and impose sanctions. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order is willful and intentional. As a result, the court awards evidentiary sanctions to exclude plaintiff from introducing any evidence at trial that she will need or has been advised to need future treatment, including surgery, to her neck and back. The court also declines to award monetary sanctions at this time.
