 Case Number:  22STCV07559    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Set Aside Dismissal  Moving Party: Plaintiff Gideon Victor     Responding Party: Unopposed  Tentative Ruling: Granted BACKGROUND On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff Gideon Victor (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Etan Boritzar (“Defendant”) alleging a cause of action for Negligence. The Complaint arises from an automobile accident which occurred on March 4, 2020. (Complaint, ¶ 9.)  On August 16, 2023, a Final Status Conference was scheduled and there was no proof of service filed showing service on Defendant. (08/16/23 Minute Order.) The Court placed the Final Status Conference off calendar and set an OSC re: Failure to File Proof of Service for October 27, 2023. (08/16/23 Minute Order.)  On October 27, 2023, the OSC re: Failure to File Proof of Service was not held as Plaintiff requested additional time to serve Defendant. (10/27/23 Minute Order.) The Court continued the OSC re: Failure to File Proof of Service to March 4, 2024. (10/27/23 Minute Order.) The Court advised counsel that it “intend[ed] to exercise its discretion to dismiss this case, at the continued OSC date for Plaintiffs failure to file a Proof of Service within two years per CC P583.410 and 583.420(a)(1), as ordered by this Court.” (10/27/23 Minute Order.)  On March 4, 2024, the Court continued the OSC to May 1, 2024 as Plaintiff requested additional time to file proof of service. (03/04/24 Minute Order.)  On April 29, 2024, this action was reassigned from the Honorable Lynne M. Hobbs to the Honorable Ian C. Fusselman sitting in Department T at Alhambra Courthouse effective May 13, 2024.    On May 1, 2024, no appearances for Plaintiff were made at the OSC re: Dismissal for Failure Serve/Prosecute and the Court ordered the Complaint dismissed without prejudice. (05/01/24 Minute Order.) The Court noted that proof of service had not been filed. (05/01/24 Minute Order.)  On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Dismissal. The Court notes that the motion sets forth Department 30 as the department in which the motion will be heard, even though this action was reassigned to this department prior to the filing of the motion. Moreover, no proof of service was filed with the motion. Although Defendant has not yet been served with the Complaint and was not served with the instant motion, the Court does not find that the aforementioned procedural irregularities prevent the Court from ruling on the motion or that ruling on the motion will prejudice Defendant.   DISCUSSION “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) “Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding was taken.” (Ibid.) “It is well settled that appellate courts have always been and are favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of the trial courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal controversies upon their merits.” (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 525.)   Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b) also contains a mandatory relief provision. (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516.)  “[T]he court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment; or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) “If the prerequisites of the mandatory relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b) exist, the trial court does not have discretion to refuse relief.” (Ibid.)  “Whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, the court shall direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties, in addition to whatever additional fees are authorized by subdivision (c), of Code Civ. Proc. § 473.” (J.A.T. Entertainment, Inc. v. Reed (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1485, 1491.) Whenever the court grants relief from a dismissal based on any grounds in Code Civ. Proc. § 473, the Court may: (1) impose a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending attorney or party; (2) direct that an offending party pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund; or (3) grant other relief as is appropriate.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (c)(1)(A)-(C).)    Analysis A. Appropriateness of Setting Aside the Dismissal Counsel for Plaintiff, D. Hess Panah, Esq. (“Panah”), declares that the OSC in this matter escaped entry on his firm’s calendar because his firm hired an appearance attorney due to being double booked in departments on March 4, 2024. (Panah Decl., p. 6:10-11.) Counsel declares that the new OSC date for the matter was not calendared and therefore his office missed the hearing on May 1, 2024. (Panah Decl., p. 6:12-13.) Counsel declares that this was an excusable error and there was no undue prejudice caused to either party. (Panah Decl., p. 6:15-16.)  The Court finds that counsel has shown that the dismissal of this action was due to counsel’s mistake and inadvertence in failing to properly calendar this matter. The Court finds that the motion is also timely. Plaintiff has shown grounds for relief under both the mandatory and discretionary prongs of CCP § 473(b). The Court will not require Plaintiff to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees or penalties under CCP § 473(c). CONCLUSION  Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED. Plaintiff to give notice.
