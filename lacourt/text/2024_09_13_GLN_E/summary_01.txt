* The Court finds Plaintiff's argument convincing that a temporary ban on the enforcement of personal guarantees is supported by the rules of statutory construction.
* Although affirmative defenses appear to survive termination of the Resolution, rules of statutory construction support the view that, when reading the Resolution as a whole, Plaintiff is not permanently barred from enforcing a Personal Guarantee.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, granting the motion for summary adjudication on the 28th affirmative defense. The 28th affirmative defense claims that a COVID resolution passed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 2023 prohibits enforcement of the guaranty. The Judge finds that the resolution only provided for a temporary stay of enforcement, and that the Plaintiff is not permanently barred from enforcing the guaranty. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's argument is convincing, supported by the rules of statutory construction. The Judge also notes that the resolution mentions limited periods in which landlords cannot enforce a personal guarantee, and that the Plaintiff is not permanently barred from enforcing a personal guarantee.
