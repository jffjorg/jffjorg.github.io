And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant the defendant's motion to seal certain portions of the declaration of Evan J. Smith, submitted in support of dismissing the action. The Judge finds that the interest in keeping the monetary terms of the settlement confidential outweighs the public's right of access to court records. However, the Judge finds that the public's interest in knowing the non-monetary terms of the settlement outweighs the interest of the individual parties in keeping those terms confidential. The Judge will seal the monetary terms of the settlement, but not the non-monetary terms. The Judge will also require counsel for the defendant to advise the Court whether the settlement agreement itself is to be returned or destroyed.
