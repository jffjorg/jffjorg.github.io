Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The motion is granted in part with 10 days' leave to amend as to the request for prejudgment interest. The motion is denied in part on all other grounds. The court has determined that the request for prejudgment interest is improper because the damages are not "certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation" from a specific day. The court has denied the motion to strike on all other grounds, including requests for compensatory and equitable damages, award of costs and expenses, appointment of a partition referee and receiver, equitable relief, damages imposed on the defendant's interest in the Pomona property, and writ of possession.
