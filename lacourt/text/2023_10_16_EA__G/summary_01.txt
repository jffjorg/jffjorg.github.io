And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding Plaintiff Mohammed Khodabakhsh's application for default judgment against Defendant Terry L. Vechik. The court finds that the application is continued to a date to be set at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). The court's decision is based on the fact that Plaintiff failed to establish the value of the allegedly misappropriated trade secrets in this action in a previous hearing. However, Plaintiff has since submitted an expert report from Joseph D. Smith, Ph.D., FAICHE, which appears to be qualified to provide an expert opinion on the applicability of Plaintiff's trade secrets to the '907 Patent. However, the court notes that the report is not a proper declaration and will continue the hearing so Plaintiff can resubmit the declaration in proper form.
