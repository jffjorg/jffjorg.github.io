And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for leave to intervene in a personal injury action. The action arises from an automobile collision in January 2022, in which Freddy Omar Perez Talavera was driving a box truck and collided with other vehicles, injuring Ramon Perez. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, which is the insurer of the defendant Dynamic Delivery Install, Inc., is seeking to intervene in the action. The judge has granted State Farm's motion, finding that State Farm has a direct interest in the action as it may be required to satisfy a judgment obtained against Dynamic. The judge also finds that State Farm's intervention will not likely enlarge the issues in the litigation, and that the plaintiff failed to file a timely opposition to the motion. As a result, State Farm's motion is granted, and its proposed answer is deemed filed.
