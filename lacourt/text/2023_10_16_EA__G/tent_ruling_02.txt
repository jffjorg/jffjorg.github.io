Respondent: Defendant Sam
Shang
Plaintiff Ian Giant, Inc’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication
Respondent: Defendant Sam
Shang
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs Dongjin Zhang’s Motion for Summary
Adjudication is DENIED.
Plaintiff Ian Giant, Inc’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.
The motion is GRANTED as
to the issue of whether Shang was authorized to use CG Plastics’ funds for work
on Shang’s personal residence and DENIED as to the remaining issues.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a recycling venture. In March 2019,
Dongjin Zhang agreed to become business partners with Defendant Sam Shang in a
recycling venture. On April 23, 2019, Shang formed CG Plastics LLC (CG
Plastics) and assisted Zhang in forming Ian Giant, Inc. (Ian Giant) as Zhang’s
investment company. On May 24, Zhang alleges Shang, without Zhang’s consent or
approval, caused CG Plastics to enter into a lease agreement for a warehouse in
Rancho Cucamonga. On June 28, Zhang alleges Shang told Zhang that the company
needed an investment and that each of them needed to contribute $100,000. While
Zhang subsequently wired $100,000 into CG Plastics’ bank account, Zhang alleges
Shang never made a matching investment and only contributed $5,000.
Zhang
then alleges Shang used CG Plastics’ funds to hire an entity that Shang had
formed ten days earlier named Renova Environment LLC (Renova Environment) for
consulting services. On September 6, 2019, Zhang and Shang memorialized their
previous oral agreement into an operating agreement for CG Plastics. Zhang then
made subsequent investments of $150,000 on September 11, 2019; $150,000 on
October 17, 2019; and $100,000 on November 29, 2019. Zhang alleges Shang only
invested a total of $92,000 into CG Plastics. Shang also had CG Plastics enter into an amended lease with an
increased security deposit of $120,000 and paid Renova Environment an
additional $150,000 in fees and costs.
On February 2, 2020, Shang requested Zhang loan CG
Plastics $125,000 for business expenses. After Zhang declined Shang’s request,
Shang claimed CG Plastics needed to urgently pay expenses to prevent losses and
convinced Zhang to make a loan of $100,000 on the condition that it would be
repaid by February 28. On March 4, Shang reported to Zhang that CG Plastics received
an eviction notice for its warehouse and would need to hire legal counsel to
reclaim $360,000 in rental losses. On March 6 and March 10, Zhang requested
repayment of the loan and Shang agreed to repay the loan by April 15. After
Shang failed to repay the loan on April 15, Zhang was unable to contact Shang
and discovered CG Plastics’ bank account had less than $3,000.
On
December 30, 2021, Zhang, individually and on behalf of Ian Giant, filed a
verified complaint against Shang; NP 8720 Rochester, LLC; CG Plastics; Renova
Environment; and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach
of contract, (2) breach of implied-in-fact contract, (3) breach of written
contract, (4) breach of fiduciary duty, (5) negligent misrepresentation, (6)
fraud, (7) unjust enrichment, (8) conversion, (9) accounting, (10) constructive
trust, (11) resulting trust, (12) fraudulent conveyance, and (13) declaratory
relief.
On
March 25, 2022, Zhang and Ian Giant filed a First Amended Verified Complaint
(FAC) against the same defendants except NP 8720 Rochester, LLC and alleged the
following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of
implied-in-fact contract, (3) breach of written contract, (4) breach of
fiduciary duty, (5) negligent misrepresentation, (6) fraud, (7) unjust
enrichment, (8) conversion, (9) accounting, (10) resulting trust, (11)
fraudulent conveyance, and (12) declaratory relief.
On January
18, 2023, Zhang and Ian Giant, derivatively on behalf of CG Plastics, filed a Second
Amended Verified Complaint (SAC) against the same defendants and alleging the
same causes of action.
On
April 4, 2023, Ian Giant filed one of the present motions for summary
adjudication. And on April 5, Zhang filed the other motion for summary
adjudication. At a hearing on July 18 for the motions, the court continued the
hearing and allowed Plaintiffs to file amended notices for their motions. While
Zhang filed an amended notice on July 26, Ian Giant did not.
A
hearing on the motions is set for October 16, 2023, along with a case
management conference on November 6.
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Ian
Giant makes the following objections to Shang’s declaration and the court rules
as follows: OVERRULED as to Nos. 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and SUSTAINED as to 2, 4, 10, and 11. Any
other objections not made in compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1354 (b) is not considered by the court.
ANALYSIS
Zhang
moves for summary adjudication of Zhang’s third cause of action for breach of
written contract. Ian Giant moves for summary adjudication of eight issues
involving whether Shang had the authority to bind CG Plastics into agreements
with third parties, whether Shang breached fiduciary duties in entering into
those agreements, and whether Shang was authorized to use CG Plastics’ funds
for work on Shang’s personal residence.
For
the following reasons, the court GRANTS Ian Giant’s motion for summary adjudication of
whether Shang was authorized to use CG Plastics’ funds for work on Shang’s
personal residence. The court DENIES Zhang’s motion for summary adjudication of the third
cause of action for breach of written contract and Ian Giant’s motion for
summary adjudication of the remaining issues.
Legal Standard
A motion
for summary judgment or adjudication provides “courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) It must be granted
“if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
To establish a triable issue of material fact, the opposing party must produce
substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of
the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Breach of Written Loan Agreement (Third Cause of
Action)
Zhang
argues Zhang is entitled to summary adjudication on the third cause of action
for breach of a written loan agreement. The court disagrees.
To
state a cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to
establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51
Cal.4th 811, 821.)
According
to Zhang’s evidence, Shang signed an agreement where Zhang agreed to loan
$80,000 to Shang on February 3, 2020. (SSSSUMF[1],
¶ 6.) In exchange, Shang agreed to repay the $80,000 by February 28. (SSSSUMF,
¶ 6.) Shang also agreed to pay an additional $20,000 to Zhang to reimburse an
overpayment Zhang made to CG Plastics. (SSSSUMF, ¶ 6.) On February 4, Zhang
wired $80,000 to Shang. (SSSSUMF, ¶ 7.) Subsequently, Shang failed to make any
payments on the loan by February 28 or anytime thereafter. (SSSSUMF, ¶ 8-9.) Based
on the foregoing, Zhang submitted evidence establishing the existence of a
contract, the performance of a contract, Shang’s breach, and Zhang’s resulting
damages. Accordingly, Zhang has met Zhang’s burden on summary adjudication and
the burden now shifts to Shang to demonstrate a triable issue of material fact.
In
response, Shang does not dispute that Shang signed the agreement and failed to
repay the $100,0000. (SSSSUMF, ¶ 6, 8-9.) Instead, Shang argues Zhang is not
entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law because the loan agreement
is unenforceable. Shang argues it is unenforceable because the loan agreement
was unconscionable and entered under duress.
“Unconscionability
is a flexible doctrine designed to allow courts to directly consider numerous
factors which may adulterate the contractual process.” (A & M Produce
Co. v. FMC Corp. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 473, 484 (A & M Produce).)
“[T]he core concern of the unconscionability doctrine is the ‘absence of
meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract
terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.’” (Sonic-Calabasas
A, Inc. v. Moreno (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1109, 1145, quoting Sonic-Calabasas
A, Inc. v. Moreno (2011) 51 Cal.4th 659, 684-685.) “Unconscionability is
ultimately a question of law for the court.” (Flores v. Transamerica
HomeFirst, Inc. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 846, 851.) It “requires oppression or
surprise—that is, procedural unconscionability—along with the overly harsh or
one-sided results that epitomize substantive unconscionability.” (De La
Torre v. CashCall, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 966, 982.) “Some measure of both procedural
and substantive unconscionability must be present—although given the
sliding-scale nature of the doctrine, more of one kind mitigates how much of
the other kind is needed.” (Id., at p. 982.)
Procedural
unconscionability requires “oppression” or “surprise” in the negotiation of a
contract. (A & M Produce, supra, 135 Cal.App.3d at p. 486.)
“‘Oppression’ arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no
real negotiation and ‘an absence of meaningful choice.’” (Ibid, quoting Williams
v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co. (D.C. Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 445, 449.) “‘Surprise’
involves the extent to which the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain
are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the
disputed terms.” (Ibid.) “The circumstances relevant to establishing
oppression include, but are not limited to (1) the amount of time the party is
given to consider the proposed contract; (2) the amount and type of pressure exerted
on the party to sign the proposed contract; (3) the length of the proposed
contract and the length and complexity of the challenged provision; (4) the
education and experience of the party; and (5) whether the party's review of
the proposed contract was aided by an attorney.” (Grand Prospect Partners,
L.P. v. Ross Dress for Less, Inc. (2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1348.)
In
this case, Shang only had a few days to consider Zhang’s loan offer as Shang
requested help from Zhang on an unspecified date in February 2020 and signed
the agreement on February 3, 2020. (Shang 2nd Decl., ¶ 12-13.) It also appears
significant pressure was placed on Shang to sign the agreement as Shang feared
CG Plastics would be evicted and Shang would lose an investment of $91,880 if
Shang could not obtain funds for CG Plastics’ rent. (Shang 2nd Decl., ¶ 13-14.)
Shang stated, “I had no meaningful choice but to follow [Zhang’s] directive”
and “[i]f I had more time, I would have negotiated terms that were not so
grossly unfavorable to me.” (Shang 2nd Decl., ¶ 14-15.) Based on these factors,
the court finds a degree of procedural unconscionability existed in the form of
oppression.
But
even if terms are procedurally unconscionable, the court will only refuse to
enforce them if they are also substantively unconscionable. (A & M
Produce, supra, 135 Cal.App.3d at p. 486-487.) Substantive
unconscionability “concerns whether a contractual provision reallocates risks
in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner” that shocks the
conscience. (Jones v. Wells Fargo Bank (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1527,
1539-1540.) Terms that are merely unreasonable and do not “shock the
conscience” fail to meet this standard. (American Software, Inc. v. Ali (1996)
46 Cal.App.4th 1386, 1391.) This is because “[a] party cannot avoid a
contractual obligation merely by complaining that the deal, in retrospect, was
unfair or a bad bargain.” (Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC (2015)
61 Cal.4th 899, 911.) To “shock the conscience,” the terms go beyond a simple
bad bargain and be “overly harsh,” “unduly oppressive,” or “unreasonably
favorable.” (Ibid.)
In
addition, the contract must also lack justification for being overly harsh or
one-sided. (A & M Produce, supra, 135 Cal.App.3d at p. 487.) For
example, overly harsh or one-sided terms may be found unconscionable when they
shift risk to the party without control over that risk “in contravention of the
basic principle that the ‘risk of loss is most appropriately borne by the party
best able to prevent its occurrence.’” (Morris v. Redwood Empire Bancorp (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1324, quoting A & M Produce, supra, 135
Cal.App.3d at p. 491; see, e.g., Allan v. Snow Summit, Inc. (1996)
51 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1377 [waiver placing risk of injury on skier was
appropriate where risk was based on skier’s individual acts and ability]; Kurashige
v. Indian Dunes, Inc. (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 606, 614-615 [waiver placing
risk of injury on motorcyclist was appropriate where risk was based on motorcyclist’s
individual acts and ability].)
In
this case, Shang argues the agreement was substantively unconscionable because
it required Shang to personally guarantee the repayment of a loan for CG
Plastics. Shang also notes that it required Shang to cover a $20,000
overpayment that Zhang had made to CG Plastics, not Shang. In other words,
Shang is arguing the agreement is unconscionable because it requires Shang to
personally assume CG Plastics’ debt when CG Plastics is jointly owned by Shang
and Ian Giant. (See SSSSUMF, ¶ 3.) Because the agreement essentially
shifts all risk of default on Shang when the control over that risk is jointly
exercised by Shang and Zhang, this is sufficient to create a triable issue on
the question of whether the terms of this loan agreement were one sided,
unjustified, and thus substantively unconscionable.
Thus,
because the court finds the loan agreement is procedurally unconscionable and a
triable issue exists regarding whether the loan agreement is substantively
unconscionable, Shang has met the burden of establishing Zhang is not entitled
to summary adjudication of this issue. Accordingly, Zhang’s motion for summary adjudication
of the third cause of action for breach of written loan agreement is DENIED.
Shang’s Authority to Bind CG Plastics
Ian
Giant contends Shang was not authorized to bind CG Plastics to lease agreements
for the Rancho Cucamonga warehouse, a contract with Renova Environment, a
contract with Montrose Water and Sustainability Services, a loan agreement with
Kray-Z Logistic, LLC, and employment agreements with Hongjuan Li and Sophia Liu.
The court disagrees.
“Agency
is either actual or ostensible. (Civ. Code, § 2298.) An actual agency exists
when one person is employed to represent another (Civ. Code, § 2299), while an
ostensible agency exists when the principal causes a third person to believe
another, not employed by him, is his agent. (Civ. Code, § 2300.)” (Vallely
Investments, L.P. v. BancAmerica Commercial Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th
816, 826.)
In
this case, paragraph eighteen of CG Plastics’ operating agreement states as
follows:
“Only the following individuals, classes or groups
have authority to bind the Company in contract: Sam Shang may bind the Company
in contract, except any employment contract, real estate contract, or contract
with a consideration of $20,000 or more, in which case at least two Members
shall be signed on behalf of Company.” (SSSUMF[2],
¶ 6; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 3, p. 4, ¶ 18.)
Paragraph
sixty-six of the operating agreement requires unanimous consent from CG
Plastics’ members to incur Company liabilities over $20,000, to incur a single
transaction expense over $20,000, to endanger ownership or possession of
Company property, or to release any Company claim without full payment.
(SSSUMF, ¶ 6; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 3, p. 12-13, ¶ 66.)
Pursuant
to this operating agreement, each of the contracts or agreements at issue would
have required Shang to obtain approval from Ian Giant as the other member of CG
Plastics. The first lease agreement for the Rancho Cucamonga warehouse was a real
estate contract and involved more than $20,000 in consideration as it required
a security deposit of $195,852 and monthly rent of at least $39,166.40.
(SSSUMF, ¶ 9-10; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 5.) An amended lease agreement also
involved more than $20,000 in consideration as it increased the security
deposit to $120,000. (SSSUMF, ¶ 15-16; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 6.) Both agreements
were only signed by Shang. (SSSUMF, ¶ 12; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 218:3-5, Ex.
5, Ex. 6.)
The
consulting agreement with Renova Environment involved more than $20,000 in
consideration as it provided for a proposed budget of $427,100. (SSSUMF, ¶ 46;
Maxwell Decl., Ex. 16.) The contract with Montrose Water and Sustainability
Services (Montrose) also involved more than $20,000 in consideration as it
provided for a proposed budget of $20,880. (SSSUMF, ¶ 53; Maxwell Decl., Ex.
17.) Both agreements were only signed by Shang. (SSSUMF, ¶ 47, 54; Maxwell
Decl., Ex. 16-17.) CG Plastics also loaned $30,000 to an entity named Kray-Z
Logistics, LLC (Kray-Z). (SSSUMF, ¶ 62-64; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 146:8-147:12,
149:10-150:16.) Although the amount loaned involved more than $20,000 in
consideration, Shang made the agreement for CG Plastics orally. (SSSUMF, ¶ 63-64;
Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 151:13-18.)
Last,
Ian Giant claims Shang hired Hong Juan Li and Sofia Liu for CG Plastics. (SSSUMF,
¶ 75, 79.) However, the evidence cited by Ian Giant does not establish this material
fact. While Ian Giant cites to special interrogatories propounded on Shang,
Shang merely provides the job responsibilities for these employees and does not
state who hired them. (SSSUMF, ¶ 75, 79; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 18, p. 14:13-14, 19-22.)
A citation to Shang’s deposition is similarly insufficient as Shang just
provides a more detailed job description and does not state who hired either
employee. (SSSUMF, ¶ 75; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 132:21-134:9.)
Based
on the above undisputed material facts, Ian Giant contends Shang lacked
authority to bind CG Plastics to these agreements without Ian Giant’s signature
pursuant to CG Plastics’ operating agreement. In response, Shang contends Shang’s
actions were approved by Yu Chai who Shang believed to be an agent for Ian
Giant.
“Ostensible
authority is authority that the principal, either intentionally or by lack of
ordinary care, causes or allows a third party to believe the agent possesses.”
(Taylor v. Roseville Toyota, Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 994, 1005,
citing Civ. Code, § 2317.) It “must be based on the acts or declarations of the
principal and not solely upon the agent's conduct.” (Ibid.) “Whether an
agent has ostensible authority is a question of fact and such authority may be
implied from circumstances.” (Pierson v. Helmerich & Payne Internat.
Drilling Co. (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 608, 635.)
In
this case, Shang states Chai often spoke for Ian Giant in group text messages
and conference calls. (Shang Decl., ¶ 5-7.) In the same group text messages and
conference calls, Shang states Zhang was also present and barely spoke. (Shang
Decl., ¶ 5-7.) In fact, Plaintiffs’ own SAC alleges Shang communicated with
Chai about Ian Giant’s investments. (SAC, ¶ 20-22.) With regards to each of the
agreements discussed above, Shang contends Shang received approval from Ian
Giant through Chai. Shang states Chai directed Shang to enter into the two
lease agreements for the Rancho Cucamonga warehouse. (SSSUMF, ¶ 14, 20; Shang
Decl., ¶ 11; Manjlai Decl., Ex. A, p. 221:17-222:5, 222:20-224:15.) Shang also
states Chai agreed CG Plastics contracting with Renova Environment and
Montrose. (SSSUMF, ¶ 45, 56-57; Shang Decl., ¶ 17-18; Manjlai Decl., Ex. A, p. 257:8-12.)
With regards to the Kray-Z loan, Shang states Chai authorized the loan. (SSSUMF,
¶ 62; Shang Decl., ¶ 19.) Last, although Ian Giant provided insufficient
evidence, Shang admits to hiring Li and Liu. (SSSUMF, ¶ 76, 80; Shang Decl., ¶
20-21.) However, Shang states Shang hired Li at Zhang’s direction and Liu at Chai’s
direction. (SSSUMF, ¶ 76, 80; Shang Decl., ¶ 20-21.)
While
it is undisputed most of the documents at issue here were only signed by Shang,
it is not undisputed that Shang lacked authority to act as CG Plastics’ agent given
a question of fact remains as to whether Chai was Zhang’s agent. Accordingly,
Ian Giant’s motion for summary adjudication is DENIED on the issue of Shang’s authority to bind CG
Plastics.
Shang’s Fiduciary Duties
Ian
Giant maintains Shang’s decisions to enter into lease agreements for the Rancho
Cucamonga warehouse and loan CG Plastics’ funds to Kray-Z breached Shang’s
fiduciary duties to CG Plastics. The court disagrees.
The
elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of
a fiduciary relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, and damages.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.) “The manager of an
LLC has a fiduciary duty and owes to the members of the LLC the same duties of
loyalty and good faith as a partner owes to the partnership and its partners.”
(Feresi v. The Livery, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 419, 425.)
In
this case, it is undisputed that Shang owed fiduciary duties to CG Plastics as
its manager. To the extent Ian Giant maintains Shang breached those duties by
entering into agreements without authorization, that ground for summary
adjudication has already been rejected for the reasons detailed above. Ian
Giant also maintains Shang’s actions breached Shang’s fiduciary duty of care. “A
member’s duty of care to a limited liability company and the other members in
the conduct and winding up of the activities of the limited liability company
is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless
conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law.” (Corp. Code, §
17704.09, subd. (c).) Whether Shang breached the fiduciary duty of care to CG
Plastics is a question of fact. (Marzec v. California Public Employees
Retirement System (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 915.)
With
regards to the lease agreements for the Rancho Cucamonga warehouse, Ian Giant argues
Shang breached Shang’s duty of care to CG Plastics for six reasons. First, Ian
Giant argues Shang entered into the warehouse lease when CG Plastics did not
have sufficient financial resources to pay the monthly rent. Around the time
Shang signed the lease with a $195,832 security deposit and monthly rent of
$39,166.40, CG Plastics only had $200 in its bank account. (SSSUMF, ¶ 25-26;
Maxwell Decl., Ex. 5, Ex. 7, p. 120-121.) However, Shang believed it would take
three months for CG Plastics to become operational after gaining licensing and
equipment and that Chai promised to provide the equipment within the three
months. (SSSUMF, ¶ 28; Shang Decl., ¶ 14; Manjlai Decl., Ex. A, p.
218:15-220:20.) Thus, based on these facts, a triable issue of material fact
exists as to whether Shang’s decision to enter into a lease agreement was
grossly negligent or reckless.
Second,
Ian Giant contends Shang misunderstood the lease agreement by believing CG
Plastics would not have to pay rent for the first three months and that the
lease included an option for CG Plastics to purchase the warehouse. However,
evidence provided by Ian Giant does not support this material fact. Instead,
Shang believed CG Plastics would not have to pay the first three months of rent
based on oral assurances by the warehouse’s landlord. (SSSUMF, ¶ 32; Maxwell
Decl., p. 222:20-223:4, 224:16-225:23.) With regards to the option to purchase
the warehouse, Shang’s belief was also based on the broker and the landlord’s
assurances. (SSSUMF, ¶ 31; Maxwell Decl., p. 216:16-218:10.) Thus, while
Shang’s failure to have these oral assurances memorialized in writing may have
been negligent, a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether these
failures rise to the level of gross negligence or recklessness.
Third,
Ian Giant maintains Shang failed to determine whether the Rancho Cucamonga
warehouse had sufficient electrical capacity before signing the lease. While
Shang received building plans for the warehouse, Shang failed to review them
because Shang did not understand how to read them. (SSSUMF, ¶ 34-35; Maxwell
Decl., Ex. 1, p, 214:7-215:18, Ex. 12.) While Shang had an engineer inspect the
warehouse to determine its electrical capacity three months after the lease was
signed, Shang did not have an engineer inspect the warehouse before the signing
of the lease because CG Plastics reportedly had insufficient funds to hire one.
(SSSUMF, ¶ 35; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 211:6-213:22.) However, Shang also
stated the landlord or the broker assured Shang that the warehouse had
sufficient electrical capacity for CG Plastics’ needs. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1,
p. 210:1-9.) Thus, while Shang’s reliance on representations by the landlord or
broker without additional verification may have been negligent, a triable issue
of material fact exists as to whether this failure rises to the level of gross
negligence or recklessness.
Fourth,
Ian Giant argues Shang’s decision to enter into an amended lease agreement with
an increased security deposit after learning the Rancho Cucamonga warehouse had
insufficient electrical capacity was grossly negligent or reckless. (SSSUMF, ¶
39; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 39.) However, as noted above, Shang stated CG Plastics
entered into the amended lease at Chai’s direction because CG Plastics needed
an additional reprieve from paying rent. (Manjlai Decl., Ex. A, p.
220:20-224:15.) Thus, a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether Shang’s
decision to enter into an amended lease agreement was necessary or reckless and
grossly negligent.
Fifth,
Ian Giant contends Shang failed to pursue timely claims against CG Plastics’
landlord for allegedly misrepresenting the electrical capacity of the
warehouse. While Shang retained counsel in March 2020 to fight CG Plastics’
eviction and raise the alleged misrepresentations as a defense, counsel
terminated representation of CG Plastics after Shang allegedly failed to
communicate. (SSSUMF, ¶ 41; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 238:7-16, 239:17-23, Ex.
13, Ex. 14.) However, Shang provides two reasons why the case did not go
forward. First, Shang testified in depositions that CG Plastics’ engineer was
refusing to cooperate with Shang or CG Plastics’ counsel because the engineer
did not want to be involved in any litigation. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 241:1-243:16.)
Second, Shang stated CG Plastics was having difficulty paying for counsel’s
services. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 244:8-19.) Shang’s stated difficulties with
obtaining a witness and finances were also mentioned in correspondence from CG
Plastics’ counsel. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. 13-14.) With regards to Shang’s failure
to promptly pursue claims against CG Plastics’ landlord, Shang had first tried
to get an additional reprieve from paying rent as noted above and had also investigated
options for increasing the warehouse’s electrical capacity. (Maxwell Decl., Ex.
1, p. 238:17-239:17.) Ultimately, a triable issue of material fact exists as to
whether Shang’s attempts at litigation were grossly negligent or reckless.
Sixth
and last, Ian Giant maintains Shang’s failure to pay timely CG Plastics’ rent
resulted in additional late fees. However, Shang states Shang was unable to
timely pay CG Plastics’ rent because it had insufficient funds. (Shang Decl., ¶
15.) Thus, a reasonable factfinder could find Shang was not responsible for
paying CG Plastics’ rent given it allegedly lacked the funds.
Ian
Giant also argues Shang’s decision to loan funds to Kray-Z and failure to memorialize
the terms of the loan agreement were grossly negligent or reckless. However,
Shang suggests it was necessary to sublease the warehouse to Kray-Z because of
CG Plastics’ rent obligations. (SSSUMF, ¶ 67; Maxwell Decl., Ex 1, p.
234:14-25, 236:24-237:8.) A reasonable factfinder could find Shang’s decision
to loan funds to Kray-Z was aimed at securing their sublease, since the loan
was for Kray-Z to remodel the warehouse or obtain equipment. (Maxwell Decl.,
Ex. 1, p. 147:23-148:1.) To the extent it may have been negligent for Shang to
fail to secure authorization for the sublease from the landlord and reduce the
loan agreement to a signed writing or promissory note, a triable issue of
material fact exists as to whether this failure rises to the level of gross
negligence or recklessness. As for Shang’s failure to pursue legal remedies
against Kray-Z, a reasonable factfinder could find this was reasonable given CG
Plastics already had difficulty financing legal counsel for its own eviction.
Ultimately,
because triable issues of material fact remain as to Shang’s alleged breaches of
the fiduciary duty of care, Ian Giant’s motion for summary adjudication of
these issues is DENIED.
Shang’s Personal Use of CG Plastics’ Funds
Ian
Giant contends Shang must reimburse CG Plastics for funds used on work for
Shang’s personal residence. The court agrees.
In July
and August of 2019, it is undisputed that Shang used CG Plastics’ funds to pay
$19,000 to contractors for work performed on Shang’s personal residence.
(SSSUMF, ¶ 83-84; Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p. 130:18-132:8; Ex. 7.) During a
deposition, Shang admitted that the $19,000 was a personal expense and stated
it was a mistake. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1., p. 130:18-132:8.) Shang also admitted
that the funds needed to be repaid to CG Plastics. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. 1, p.
132:1-8.) And in Shang’s opposition to the present motions, Shang declines to
oppose the grant of summary adjudication on this issue.
Accordingly,
in light of the undisputed material facts and admissions by Shang, Ian Giant’s
motion for summary adjudication of this issue is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS Ian Giant’s motion
for summary adjudication of whether Shang was authorized to use CG Plastics’
funds for work on Shang’s personal residence. However, the court DENIES Zhang’s motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action for
breach of written contract and Ian Giant’s motion for summary adjudication on
the remaining issues.__________________________________________________________________
