And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Upinder S. Kalra on a motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication filed by Good Samaritan Hospital (defendant) against John Doe (plaintiff). The plaintiff brought a suit against the hospital for alleged dissemination of his HIV status by Dr. Joshua Rice while he was a patient at the hospital. The defendant argued that it is not liable for the plaintiff's alleged injuries because it provided the plaintiff with actual notice that the treating physicians are not hospital employees and there is no reason to believe the plaintiff was unable to understand or act on the information.

The court found that the defendant met its burden to show the first prong of Wicks v. Antelope Valley Healthcare District, which requires actual notice to the patient that the treating physician is not a hospital employee. The court also found that the defendant showed that the plaintiff signed the Conditions of Admission form, which contained a notice that the physicians and surgeons providing services to the patient are not employees, representatives, or agents of the hospital.

The plaintiff argued that the defendant is vicariously liable for the acts of Dr. Rice, but the court found that the defendant has shifted the burden to show a triable issue based on the signed Consent for Admission. The court also found that the plaintiff has created a triable issue as to whether the plaintiff was able to understand or act on the information provided in the Conditions of Admission.

Therefore, the court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication.
