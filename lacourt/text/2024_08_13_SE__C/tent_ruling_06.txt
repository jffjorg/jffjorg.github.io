Background

 
This is a lemon law action. Plaintiffs David Saurez and
Alma Castellanos (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action on May 3, 2023. Plaintiffs
filed their operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on November 15, 2023. Plaintiffs
allege Defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”) did not disclose and
actively concealed defects involving a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado (“Vehicle”).
Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserts the following causes of
action: (1) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code §
1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Merchantability; and (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment.
Defendant demurs to the Fifth Cause of Action on the
grounds that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action and that it is barred by the lack of a transactional relationship
between the parties.
 
Legal
Standard 
 
Code
Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a complaint
fails to state a cause of action. A demurrer admits, provisionally for purposes
of testing the pleading, all material facts properly pleaded. (Tindell v.
Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1247.) A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994. )
 
Discussion
 
Agency
 
A
duty to disclose only exists where there is some relationship, whether
fiduciary or transactional, between the parties, and that such relationship
must be alleged.  (CACI 1901; Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe, LLC
(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187.) 
A
duty to disclose does not exist in all circumstances. The tort of fraudulent
concealment is only viable where it does. “There are ‘“four circumstances in
which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when
the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the
defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff;
(3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses
some material facts. [Citation.]”’ (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.)
The
complaint alleges that: “On or about June 08, 2021, Plaintiffs entered
into a warranty contract with Defendant GM regarding a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado
vehicle identification number 3GCPWBEK0MG358770 (hereafter "Vehicle"
or “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured and or distributed by Defendant
GM. Subject Vehicle was purchased at Win Chevrolet Hyundai in Carson, CA (GM’s
authorized dealer).” (Complaint, ¶ 7.) 
 
Together,
these allegations contend that Plaintiffs purchased the vehicle from Defendant
through its agent Win Chevrolet Hyundai.  
Defendant argues that there is no transactional
relationship between itself and Plaintiff.  Plaintiff argues that Defendant expects its
dealerships to sell its vehicles to purchasers. 
Additionally, citing Khan v. Shiley Inc. (1990) 217 Cal. App. 3d
848, 850-51, Plaintiff states that privity of contract is not required for a
deceit cause of action. Plaintiff cites the following holding that addresses
transactional relationships and privity: 
“At the pleading stage (and in the absence of a
more developed argument by Nissan on this point), we conclude plaintiffs’
allegations are sufficient. Plaintiffs alleged that they bought the car from
a Nissan dealership, that Nissan backed the car with an express warranty,
and that Nissan’s authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes of the
sale of Nissan vehicles to consumers. In light of these allegations, we
decline to hold plaintiffs’ claim is barred on the ground there was no
relationship requiring Nissan to disclose known defects.”
(Dhital v. Nissan N. Am., Inc. (2022) 84
Cal. App. 5th 828, 844 (emphasis added).) 
Here, Plaintiff adequately argues that
Plaintiff entered into a warranty contract directly with Defendant and that Win
Chevrolet Hyundai was an authorized dealer of Defendant. (Complaint, ¶7.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff has properly pleaded agency. 
Facts Sufficient to State Cause of
Action
The elements of a
cause of action for intentional fraud are 1) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); 2) knowledge of falsity
(scienter); 3) intent to defraud or induce reliance; 4) justifiable reliance;
and 5) damages. (See Cal. Civ. Code §1709.)
“[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud and deceit based on concealment
are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2)
the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,
(3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with
the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (f) the plaintiff must have been unaware
of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of
the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Marketing West, Inc.
v. Sanyo Fisher (USA) Corp. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 603, 612-613.) 

Fraudulent inducement is a viable tort
claim under California law. ‘The elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or
knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage. Fraud
in the inducement is a subset of the tort of
fraud. It ‘occurs when ‘the promisor knows what he is signing but his consent
is induced by fraud, mutual assent is present and a contract is formed, which,
by reason of the fraud, is voidable.’”  (Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022)
84 Cal.App.5th 828, 838-839.)
Here, Plaintiffs
alleges at ¶¶ 69-77 that Defendant concealed and failed to disclose facts
relating to the defects.  ¶¶ 82-83
alleges scienter and intent to induce reliance based on concealment.  ¶ 84 alleges Plaintiff’s resulting damages.
The court finds that the Complaint alleges sufficient prior
knowledge at this pleading stage. Less specificity is required if it appears from the nature of
allegations that defendant must necessarily possess full information, or if the
facts lie more in the knowledge of opposing parties.  (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement
System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356,
1384-1385.)
The Demurrer to the Fifth cause of action is OVERRULED.
Motion
to Strike
Given the reasoning above as to the Fifth Cause of Action,
Defendant’s Motion to Strike is DENIED.
