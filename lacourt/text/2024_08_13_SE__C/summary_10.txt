And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to strike the prayer for $482,500 from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Paul Richards, filed a personal injury action against the defendants, Robert Peters and Carmel Peters, alleging negligence. The defendants moved to strike the prayer for damages on the ground that it is improper under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.10(b), which requires that the amount demanded not be stated on the face of the complaint in personal injury actions. The motion was unopposed, and the court has granted it, striking the prayer for $482,500.
