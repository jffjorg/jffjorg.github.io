```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The judge found that the Plaintiff's claims arise from Defendant's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act, rather than from the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) with its arbitration provision. The judge specifically disagreed with the defendant's argument that the Plaintiff's claims are based on the RISC because the Plaintiff could have purchased the vehicle through other means, such as cash or an outside loan. The judge concluded that equitable estoppel does not apply in this case because the Plaintiff was not making use of the terms of the sale contracts.
