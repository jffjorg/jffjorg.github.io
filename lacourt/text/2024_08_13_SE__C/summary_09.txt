And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents is continued to November 5, 2024. The judge notes that the defendant failed to respond in a code-compliant manner to the plaintiff's initial request and that the parties have not exhausted their meet and confer obligations. The judge encourages the parties to make further efforts to resolve their discovery disputes and advises them to review the stipulated protective order signed on June 5, 2024, which is intended to facilitate a freer exchange of discovery. If the parties are unable to resolve their disputes informally, they are instructed to submit a revised joint separate statement outlining the remaining disputed issues by October 25, 2024.
