And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David Suarez and Alma Castellanos against General Motors, LLC. The ruling addresses two motions: a demurrer to the fifth cause of action and a motion to strike. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action for intentional fraud. The judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the arguments presented are insufficient to support the motion.

The case involves allegations that General Motors failed to disclose defects in a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado sold to the plaintiffs through an authorized dealer, Win Chevrolet Hyundai. The plaintiffs claim that General Motors had a duty to disclose the defects and failed to do so, and that they relied on General Motors' representations when purchasing the vehicle.

The judge has found that the complaint adequately alleges a warranty contract between the plaintiffs and General Motors, and that the plaintiffs have properly pleaded agency. The judge has also found that the complaint alleges sufficient prior knowledge and that the elements of a cause of action for intentional fraud have been met.
