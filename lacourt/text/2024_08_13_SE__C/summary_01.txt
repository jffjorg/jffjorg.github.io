And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant/Cross-Complainant's motion to stay the proceedings in this case pending the resolution of a similar lawsuit in South Dakota. The Defendant/Cross-Complainant had argued that the dissolution of the company Ripple, which is a foreign corporation not registered in California, can only be decided in South Dakota and that the California court should stay its proceedings. However, the Judge has found that the two cases are not interdependent and that the resolution of this case will likely decide the rights and duties of the three partners with respect to Ripple, including how its assets can be distributed upon a possible dissolution. The Judge has also noted that settlement discussions and mediation between the parties should remain confidential.
