Sheena Gatewood and Isaac Luke is GRANTED.  Sanctions are imposed in the reasonable amount
of $560.00 upon Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel, jointly and severally,

Defendant to give NOTICE. 
 
On March 9, 2023, Plaintiffs Sheena Gatewood and Isaac Luke
(“Plaintiffs”) filed this lemon law action against Defendant American Honda
Motor Company (“Defendant”) alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
Defendant moves for orders compelling the depositions of both
plaintiffs. 
CCP¿section¿2025.450(a) provides:¿“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for¿inspection any document . . . described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order¿compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document . . . described in the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(a).)¿ 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.450(c)(1),
the Court shall award sanctions in response to a motion to compel attendance at
deposition unless substantial justification for the failure to attend is
demonstrated.
As a preliminary matter, these motions seek to compel the
deposition of two Plaintiffs. Accordingly, they should have been filed as two
separate motions. 
On November 1, 2023, Defendant served a notice for the
deposition of Sheena Gatewood for December 19, 2023. Additionally, on November
1, 2023, Defendant served a notice for the deposition of and Isaac Luke for
December 20, 2023. (Sadanaga Decl. ¶3, Ex. "A" and “B” – Deposition
notices.) On December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs served objections to the deposition
notices indicating that Plaintiffs would not appear to their respective depositions.  (Sadanaga Decl. ¶4, Ex. "C" and “D”
– Objections to deposition notices.  On
December 8, 2023, Defendant requested alternative dates, but received no
response as of December 15, 2023, the date the instant motion was filed.
(Sadanaga Decl., ¶5.) 
In Opposition, Plaintiffs state that on July 22, 2024, they
offered October 1, 2024 for the deposition of Plaintiff Sheena Gatewood, and they
will provide another date for the deposition of Plaintiff Isaac Luke. (Tran
Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 1)
The motions to compel the deposition of Plaintiffs are
GRANTED.  The Court orders the deposition
of Plaintiffs to take place within 60 days. 
This time period may be extended by agreement of the parties.  
Sanctions 
Sanctions are mandatory in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs did not act with
substantial justification. Although Plaintiffs have now offered a date for the
deposition of Plaintiff Sheena Gatewood, they did not do so until July 22,
2024, more than seven months after Defendant requested alternative dates.  
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $560.00 (1.0
hour preparing the motion, and 1.5 hours reviewing the opposition, preparing, a
reply, and attending the hearing on the motion at a rate of $200.00 per hour,
plus reimbursement of $60.00 filing fee).  The Court finds the fees reasonable. 
Accordingly, sanctions are awarded in the reasonable amount
of $560.00.
