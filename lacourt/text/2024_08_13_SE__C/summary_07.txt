And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' ex parte application to dismiss the lawsuit against them and enter judgment in their favor. The reason for this decision is that the plaintiffs failed to file an amended complaint within the time period allowed by the court after the defendants' demurrer was sustained on June 14, 2024. The court had given the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint, but as of the current date, no amended complaint has been filed. Therefore, the court has dismissed the complaint against the defendants and entered judgment in their favor, as allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2).
