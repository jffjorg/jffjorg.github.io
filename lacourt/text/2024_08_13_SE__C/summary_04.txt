The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case involving Sheena Gatewood and Isaac Luke (Plaintiffs) against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant). The Defendant has moved to compel the depositions of both Plaintiffs, and the judge has granted the motion. The judge has also imposed sanctions of $560.00 on the Plaintiffs and their counsel, payable within 60 days. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs did not act with substantial justification in failing to appear for their depositions and did not provide alternative dates until July 22, 2024, more than seven months after the Defendant requested alternative dates. The judge has ordered the depositions to take place within 60 days, and the parties may agree to extend this time period.
