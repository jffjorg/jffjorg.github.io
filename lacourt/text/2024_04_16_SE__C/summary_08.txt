And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration and for stay of action filed by the defendants. The defendants had argued that the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and Roth Staffing Companies, LP was enforceable. However, the judge ruled that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) prohibits the enforcement of arbitration agreements in cases involving sexual assault or harassment. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims of sexual battery and sexual assault, which occurred on March 9, 2022, were covered by the EFAA. The judge also rejected the defendants' attempt to exclude certain claims from the protections of the EFAA.
