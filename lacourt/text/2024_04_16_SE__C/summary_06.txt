"This tentative ruling grants the motion of Paymon John Vafa, the counsel for plaintiff Elizabeth Castaneda, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted based on the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge finds that good cause exists for withdrawal under Rule 3-700(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which provides for withdrawal in cases where the client insists on pursuing a course of conduct that is illegal or prohibited by the rules or the State Bar Act. The judge notes that the attorney has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal based on a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and that the client has been served by mail at their last known address. The motion is granted and the attorney is relieved as counsel."
