Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
The motion is unopposed as of April 15, 2024.
 
Background 
Plaintiff Community Connect SoCal, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
entered into an assignment agreement with Behavior Resources, Inc. (“BRI”)
whereby Plaintiff acquired all of BRI’s rights relating to the wrongful conduct
of Defendant Stephanie Alvarez (“Defendant”). 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, during her employment with BRI, from
approximately 2016 through her termination in January 2023, stole and/or
embezzled approximately $228,000.00 from BRI. 
Among other things, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant: (1) improperly and
without authorization assigned herself a company American Express card, which
she used for her own personal expenses; (2) improperly and without
authorization obtained a debit card linked to BRI’s checking account, which she
used for her own personal expenses; (3) forged Christy McIntyre’s (“McIntyre”)
signature on checks and other company documents without permission and
knowledge by McIntyre; and (4) used company funds to pay for, among other
things, her mother’s cell phone bill, her personal travel, personal doctor’s
appointments, personal spa appointments/treatments, personal rent and/or
mortgage payments, personal credit card bills, personal bills, used BRI’s FedEx
account for personal shipments, her side businesses, and to pay for her gas, even
though BRI reimbursed Defendant for her mileage.
 
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and
confer requirement.
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030.
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion 
 
 
 
On July 28, 2023, Plaintiff served a total of four requests
for production of documents seeking the following:
Request for Production 1: Produce all DOCUMENTS identified
in YOUR responses to Form Interrogatories – General, Set One, served
concurrently herewith.
Request for Production 2: Produce all mortgage statements
RELATING TO all mortgage payments YOU made, or made on YOUR behalf, from 2016
through January 2023.
Request for Production 3: Produce all credit card
statements RELATING TO all credit card payments YOU made, or made on YOUR
behalf, from 2016 through January 2023. 
Request for Production 4: Produce all bank account records
in YOUR name from 2016 through January 2023. 
Responses were due on September 1, 2023.  On September 4, 2023, Defendant served untimely
responses which stated the following: “Objection, irrelevant, oppressive,
burdensome, overbroad. Without waiving the foregoing responding party responds
as follows: After diligent search and reasonable inquiry responding party is
unable to produce these documents at this time.”
Because the responses were untimely, all objections are
waived. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a).)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Request for Production of Documents is GRANTED.  
Sanctions
The court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or demand for production
of documents unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $4,390.00
(for 6.6 hours of work at a rate of $650.00 per hour). Plaintiff’s counsel does
not indicate the allocation of fees. Given the lack of opposition, the Court imposes
sanctions in the reasonable amount of $1,260.00, which includes costs.
