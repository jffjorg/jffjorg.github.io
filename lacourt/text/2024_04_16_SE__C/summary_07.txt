And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not persuaded that the parties have exhausted their meet and confer obligations regarding a motion to compel further responses to a request for production. The judge orders the parties to make further efforts to resolve the discovery disputes and suggests that they file a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues by May 24, 2024. The judge also advises counsel to make a greater effort at informal resolution, rather than simply sending letters stating their respective positions. If the parties are unable to informally resolve their disputes, they may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date.
