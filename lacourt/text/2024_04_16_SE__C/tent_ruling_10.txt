Background 
This action arises out of a debt allegedly owed by
Defendant Socheata San ("Defendant") to Plaintiff National Collegiate
Student Loan Trust 2004-1 (“Plaintiff”) in the amount of $56,861.09.
On November 4, 2014, the parties entered into a Conditional
Stipulated Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”). Defendant Socheata San signed
the Agreement on September 24, 2014. Plaintiff National Collegiate Student Loan
Trust 2004-1 signed the Agreement on November 04, 2014, The Agreement was filed
with this Court on December 26, 2014.
On December 26, 2014, the Court entered a dismissal without
prejudice and retained jurisdiction pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure § 664.6. 
Defendant made payments towards the balance due, totaling
$9,454.00. The last payment Defendant made was on May 15, 2018. (Boone Decl., ¶
10.) Plaintiff now moves to set aside and vacate the dismissal and enter
judgment pursuant to the Conditional Stipulated Settlement Agreement.  
Legal Standard 
The California Code of Civil Procedure states, in pertinent
part, that, “If parties to pending litigation stipulate…for settlement of the
case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (CCP § 664.6.)
Discussion 
Here, the Court finds that a conditional settlement
agreement was reached, and Defendant defaulted on the terms of the
agreement.  In the agreement, the Court
retained jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement. Therefore,
the Court may grant judgment in the full amount claimed in the complaint, less
any amounts already paid under the agreement. 
Accordingly, the motion to vacate dismissal is GRANTED.  Judgment is ordered against Defendant in the
amount of $48,144.59, consisting of the pre-judgment amount of $56,861.09 plus
court costs of $737.50, minus the $9,454.000 already paid by Defendant.
