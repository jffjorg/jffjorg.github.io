Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Charlie Lara’s Motion to Compel
Further Response Request for Production is DENIED.  The Court declines to impose sanctions.  
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff Charlie Lara (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel
further response to Request for Production No. 9 (Set One).  
Background 
This lawsuit arises out of injuries and damages sustained
by Plaintiff on March 13, 2021. Plaintiff alleges he was a pedestrian when he
was struck by a driver employed by Defendant Parsec, Inc. (“Defendant”).
(Complaint, p. 4.)
On July 07, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Request for Admission (Set One)
and Request for Production (Set One). 
After multiple extensions, Defendant served responses on August 29,
2023.  
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and
confer requirement.
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030.
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s response to Request for
Production No. 9 is incomplete and evasive. 
Request for Production No. 9 seeks: 
All DOCUMENTS or ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION which
evidence and/or reflect insurance policies for which YOU may be insured and
which may have been in effect at the time of the INCIDENT, including, but not
limited to, commercial, excess coverage, or umbrella policies and including the
entire policy, endorsements, riders, and declaration pages.
Defendant responded to Request for Production No. 9 with
objections.  During the meet and confer
process, Defendant provided a link to the declaration page for Defendant’s
insurance policy.  Plaintiff contends that
the declaration page provided by Defendant is for an “Excess Commercial
Liability Policy” (Ebrahim Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) Plaintiff’s Counsel, Rassa
Ebrahim, asked Defendant’s Counsel, Michael Fabrega, why the declarations page was
an “excess” policy and whether there was an underlying policy. (Ebrahim Decl.,
¶ 12, Ex. J.) Mr. Fabrega replied, “You have the correct dec page.” (Ibid.)
In a later email, Mr. Fabrega stated “[the excess policy] is the applicable
policy.  There is not a below policy…” (Ebrahim
Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. K.)  Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s responses
are evasive.  
In Opposition, Mr. Fabrega
declares, “I am informed, and continue to be informed, that there is NOT a
separate policy beneath the Chubb Group policy implicated by this litigation (Chubb
Group, Policy No. XSL157202A, $750,000 Retained Limit and $2,000,000 Occurrence
Limit).” (Fabrega Decl., ¶ 9.) This response, made under penalty of perjury, appears
to be code-compliant in so far as Mr. Fabrega is acting as an agent on behalf
of Defendant, a corporation. (CCP § 2031.250.) 

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further response is DENIED.  
 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or demand for production
of documents unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
The Court determines that
Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in light of Defendant’s August
29, 2023 objections.
