Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez moves to compel responses to form
interrogatories (set one), special interrogatories (set one) and request for
production (set one) from Defendants Kulpati Chodha and Kulpati Chodha dba Las
Vegas Ice Cream.  
Background
This personal injury lawsuit alleges that on December 11,
2021, Defendant Jacqueline Rivera crashed a motor vehicle directly into the
rear of Plaintiff’s vehicle which caused serious and life-altering injuries.
On June 08, 2023, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Production of
Documents (Set One) on Defendants by electronic service. (Malek Decl., ¶ 4 and
Exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F.) Defendants’ deadline to respond to Plaintiff’s
written discovery was July 11, 2023. (Malek Decl., ¶ 5.)
After numerous meet and confer attempts, Plaintiff filed
the motions to compel initial discovery on September 1, 2023. 
On December 29, 2023, Defense
Counsel served Plaintiff’s Counsel with written discovery responses, along with
the verifications. (Opp., Exhibit J.) 

Legal
Standards
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
served the discovery requests on June 08, 2023.  After several meet and confer attempts,
Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel discovery on September 1,
2023.  On December 29, 2023, Defendants
served untimely written discovery responses, along with the verifications.  
Accordingly, the instant
motions to compel discovery are MOOT.  
 
Sanctions 
 
Failure to respond to discovery requests is misuse of the
discovery process and subject to sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) The
court is required to award monetary sanctions against Plaintiff unless
Plaintiff can show they “acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The monetary
sanction shall be in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.) Counsel for Plaintiff requests sanctions for the six motions in the
amount of $4,971.54 (6 hours preparing the motions and meet and confer efforts,
4 hours reviewing six oppositions, and preparing reply briefs at a rate of
$450.00 per hour and filing fees in the amount of $471.54.)  (Mot., pg 7.) 
 
Defense counsel argues that she acted with substantial
justification. Defense Counsel indicates that the discovery requests were made
prior to being retained as counsel for the defense. (Renaud
Decl., ¶ 4.) She admits that she told Plaintiff’s counsel that she would
produce documents in a few weeks, however, her client had a death in the family
and would not be able to provide counsel with additional information. (Renaud
Decl., ¶ 11.)  Defense counsel also acknowledges
that she told Plaintiff’s counsel that she would send responses by August 31,
2023.  (Renaud
Decl., ¶ 10.)  However, she failed to do
so until December 29, 2023. (Renaud Decl., ¶ 12.)  
 
Given the simplicity of
the motions and the duplicative content, the Court imposes sanctions in the
reasonable amount of $1,500.00 upon Defendants and Counsel, jointly and
severally, payable within 30 days.
