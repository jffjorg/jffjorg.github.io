And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment is continued to April 18, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The defendant is ordered to file and serve a copy of the answer no later than April 23, 2024. The court is inclined to grant relief due to the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults, but the defendant failed to attach a copy of the answer to the motion to set aside default. The court has previously established that the policy of hearing cases on their merits is well-established and favors trials on the merits.
