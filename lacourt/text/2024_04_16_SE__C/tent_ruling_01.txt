Hernandez, et al.
Case No.: 19NWCV00885

#7 
Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Natalie Hernandez’s Motion to Set
Aside is CONTINUED to April 18, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
Clerk to give notice.
 
Background 
This is a foreclosure action. 
Defendant
Natalie Hernandez moves to set aside the default and default judgment pursuant
to CCP §§ 473(b), 473.5, and
473(d).
 
CCP §§ 473(b)
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. (CCP § 473(b).)
Here, default was entered on February 21, 2020, and
default judgment was entered on February 2, 2024.  However, on October 9, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant motion to set aside the default entered on February 21, 2020.  Because Defendant’s motion was pending when
default judgment was entered on February 2, 2024, it appears default judgment
was entered improperly.  
The policy of hearing cases on their merits is
well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d
900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults, the
Court is inclined to grant relief.  The
law favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th
975, 980.) 
However, Defendant has not attached a copy of the answer
to the motion to set aside default.  “Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).)  Therefore, the
hearing is CONTINUED to April 25, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Defendant is ordered to file and serve a copy
of the answer no later than April 23, 2024.
