And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff Laura Karina Lopez's motions to compel discovery are moot. Sanctions are imposed upon Defendants and Counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1500.00 payable within 30 days. The Plaintiff served discovery requests on June 08, 2023, and after several meet and confer attempts, filed the instant motions to compel discovery on September 1, 2023. The Defendants served untimely written discovery responses, along with verifications, on December 29, 2023. The Judge finds that the Defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests, which is considered misuse of the discovery process and subject to sanctions. The Judge imposes a reasonable sanction in the amount of $1500.00 upon the Defendants and Counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.
