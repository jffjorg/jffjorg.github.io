And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to enjoin the trustee's sale of the allegedly defective home. The plaintiffs claim that the defendant failed to disclose water intrusion and argue that they are entitled to offset damages under the note. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the relief they seek is within the scope of relief likely to be obtained at trial on the merits. The judge cites the case of Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) in support of this finding.
