And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant has moved for an order permitting the judge and jury to view the properties of the plaintiffs and defendant during trial. The defendant argues that a site visit is necessary to allow the jury to assess the claims and cross-claims, citing People v. Fudge (1994) and Code of Civil Procedure section 651. However, the judge denies the motion due to insufficient justification. The defendant fails to establish that the evidence presented at trial, including surveys, photographs, videos, and testimony, are insufficient to allow the finder of fact to come to a conclusion. Moreover, the remote location of the properties would necessitate taking a day of trial, which is an undue consumption of resources, and the properties may be inaccessible if jurors have mobility issues. Therefore, the motion is denied.
