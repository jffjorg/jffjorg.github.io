  Case Number:  21STCV46833    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Mani Brothers Nine Thousand
(DE), LLC’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Reinstate Case, and Enter Judgment
Pursuant to Stipulation
            Plaintiff Mani Brothers Nine
Thousand (DE), LLC moves to vacate the dismissal of this action and enter judgment
against defendants Knock Out Creative, Inc. and Kristi Kilday pursuant to the
parties’ stipulation.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6(a) provides, “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the
court... for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion,
may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” 
Plaintiff
meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  The parties stipulated in writing to settle
this action.  They signed a settlement
agreement in November 2022.  (Rosenbaum
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1.)  The agreement
provides the parties stipulate to enter judgment of $250,000.  (Id., § 2.3.)  The parties stipulated, “Through October 1, 2022,
there is over $230,000.00 in unpaid rent after credit for [defendants’] security
deposit of $20,000.00.”  (Id.,
recital E.)  The agreement required
defendants to pay $7,500 by October 31, 2022, and 36 monthly payments of $3,500,
for a “discounted amount of $133,500.”  (Id.,
§ 2.4.)  It further provides, “In the
event” defendants do not make the required payments, plaintiff “shall have the
right to file the attached STIPULATION and have judgment entered.”  (Id., § 3.1.)  
The
separate stipulation for judgment provides, “1. The [defendants] agree to pay [plaintiff]
$250,000.00 representing the stipulated balance due as is more fully set forth
in the parties’ settlement agreement…  2.
The [defendants] agree that a judgment may be rendered against them, jointly
and severally, in the amount of $250,000.00 plus interest, costs, and
reasonable attorney’s fees which accrue, less credit for payments tendered by
the [defendants] in accordance with the Agreement.”  (Rosenbaum Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 1-2.)
Plaintiff
establishes defendants did not make the required payments.  Plaintiff’s counsel states, “Defendants paid
the $7,500.00 due on October 31, 2022, and the $3,500.00 payments due on
December 1, 2022, through February 1, 2023 (for a total of $18,000.00),”
followed by another $10,500 “in September, October, and November, 2023.”  (Rosenbaum Decl., ¶ 8.)  Defendants “then stopped making
payments.”  (Ibid.)  
Defendants
defaulted under the agreement.  Plaintiff
is entitled to entry of judgment for $250,000, minus $28,500 in credit for
payments by defendants, plus attorney fees and costs incurred making this
motion.  The court finds plaintiff
reasonably incurred $1,100 in attorney fees and $60 in costs for this motion.
Disposition
            Plaintiff Mani Brothers Nine
Thousand (DE), LLC’s motion to vacate dismissal, reinstate case, and enter
judgment pursuant to stipulation is granted.  The court hereby vacates the dismissal
of this action entered on November 8, 2022. 
The court will sign the proposed judgment plaintiff submitted on April
12, 2024, and enter judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $222,660.
