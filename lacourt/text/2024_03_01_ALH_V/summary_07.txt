And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Sarah J. Heidel, has issued a tentative ruling on Barbara Steinhauer's motion for trial preference. Steinhauer, an 83-year-old woman, tripped and fell at a Walmart Supercenter and is seeking an order for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (a). The Judge finds that Steinhauer has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The Judge grants the motion for trial preference and sets the matter for trial on June 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department V. The Judge also orders a final status conference for June 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department V.
