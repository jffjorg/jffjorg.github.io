The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)DISCUSSIONA.

(Martirosyan Decl. ¶ 3, Exhib. A.) After receiving no verified responses Plaintiff extended Defendant’s time to respond to January 8, 2024. (Id. ¶¶ 4-5, Exhib. B.)Defendant has failed to timely provide responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, and does not oppose this motion. Accordingly, the court grans the motion and find the truth of the matters contained within the requests are deemed admitted.B. Sanctions“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)Plaintiff seeks $610.00 against Defendant in connection with filing the instant motion. However, in the attached declaration and page 5 of the memorandum, Plaintiff seeks $510.00 in sanctions.
