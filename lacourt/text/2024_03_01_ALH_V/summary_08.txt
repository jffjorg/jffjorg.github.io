And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to a demurrer filed by the defendants, Estate of Patrick Aaron Levine, Deceased, and Levine Foot & Ankle Surgery, Inc., to the plaintiff's complaint alleging medical malpractice, medical battery, and negligence. The demurrer argues that the second and third causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with the demurrer and sustained the demurrer as to the second and third causes of action. The court found that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a cause of action for medical battery, as the plaintiff did not allege that his consent was conditional or that the doctor performed a substantially different treatment for which consent was not obtained. The court concluded that the plaintiff's allegations of lack of informed consent do not support a cause of action for medical battery, but rather are encompassed by his claim for professional negligence. The court also noted that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege that the doctor failed to obtain his consent to perform the type of procedure performed, or that the doctor performed a substantially different type of procedure than that for which consent was obtained.
