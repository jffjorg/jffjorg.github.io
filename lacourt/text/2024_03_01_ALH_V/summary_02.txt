And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion filed by Attorney Shanda Beach, who seeks to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Alejandro Duran and Standard Design Group Nurseries. The motion is based on a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, and the attorney has been unable to obtain a signed Substitution of Attorney. The court notes that the motion complies with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1362, and that the attorney has not shown any resulting prejudice to the plaintiffs. The court continues the motion to March 21, 2024, and orders the attorney to refile and include the corrected address of the Alhambra Courthouse and the location of the future hearings. The court also schedules an OSC re: Standard Design Group Nurseries' Representation for March 21, 2024, at which time the entity must appear with substitute counsel. The court grants the motion to be relieved as counsel and orders the attorney to give notice of this ruling.
