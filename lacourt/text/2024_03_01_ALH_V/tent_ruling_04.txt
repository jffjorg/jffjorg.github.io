(Phillips Decl. ¶¶ 8-23, Exhibit 1.) Plaintiff demonstrates that it is entitled to possession of the Subject Vehicle by providing a copy of its registered title for the Subject Vehicle. (Id. ¶ 10, Exhibit 2.) Plaintiff states it is authorized to bring this action on behalf of Plaintiff pursuant to the terms of a separate servicing agreement and power of attorney. (Id. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff establishes that the Subject Vehicle is wrongfully detained by Defendants. (Id. ¶¶ 13-19.) Plaintiff provides that on or about December 2, 2021, Defendant Armen Vardanyan entered into a written motor vehicle lease agreement with Pacific BMW, for valuable consideration regarding the Subject Vehicle. (Id. ¶ 8, Exhibit 1.) Upon Defendant’s default of failure and refusal to pay the monthly payments, Plaintiff was entitled to take possession of the vehicle by any method permitted by law pursuant to paragraph 23(ii). (Id. ¶ 14.)  ¿ The vehicle sought to be attached is a 2022 BMW Alpina B8 Gran Coupe motor vehicle, Serial No. WBAGX0C1XNCH56889, estimated to be worth between $90,000. (Phillips Decl. ¶ 21.) Plaintiff provides that Defendant Armen confirmed that the Subject Vehicle was located at Defendant Mariam Vardanyan’s garage, 501 N. Shelton St., Apt. A, Burbank, CA 91506. (Id. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff provides that the Subject Property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to statute. (Application at p. 2, ¶ 8.)¿ Plaintiff has complied with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010.¿ Service Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 512.030 On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service for the summons and complaint on December 17, 2023. On the same date, Plaintiff also filed a proof of service for the notice of application and hearing, application, and affidavits on December 18, 2023.¿¿ Plaintiff has complied with the requirements of 512.030.¿ Issues at Hearing “At the hearing, a writ of possession shall issue if both of the following are found: [¶] (1)¿The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property. [¶] (2)¿The undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 are satisfied.”¿ “The facts of the instant case establish the ‘probable validity’ of [Plaintiff’s] claim for possession. [Defendants] merely leased [the Subject Vehicle.]” (RCA Serv. Co. v. Superior Ct., 137 Cal. App. 3d 1, 3.) Further, Defendants fail to assert any rights which may defeat Plaintiff’s “ownership rights and right to reclaim the [Subject Vehicle].” (Id.)  Plaintiff states in its memorandum that no equity exists for Defendants based on the agreement which involved a true lease with no equity or ownership interest being conveyed to Defendants. Plaintiff requests that Defendants be required to post a re-delivery bond in the sum of $141,000.00, which is the account balance, and includes an estimated $1,000.00 for attorney’s fees and court costs. (Phillips Decl. ¶ 22.)   Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the application for writ of possession.   Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling. IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED:  ¿March 1, 2024¿
