Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied Defendant Lyoo's motion to dismiss the action based on prior settlement. The judge found that the settlement agreement in 21STCV12715 did not apply to other actions, including the instant case. The judge also denied Cross-Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action (slander per se) because there was a factual question as to whether Cross-Defendants made their statements with actual malice. The judge granted Cross-Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second, third, and fourth causes of action (violation of Labor Code sections 1050-1054, interference with prospective economic advantage, and interference with contractual relationship) because Cross-Complainant failed to allege essential elements of these claims.
