And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the claim of exemption filed by Judgment Debtor Linda Castillo and has granted the claim. Judgment Creditor State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company had opposed the claim, but the court finds that the judgment debtor has demonstrated a need for the exemption.

The court has ordered that Judgment Creditor shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of such. The court has also ordered that $20.00 be withheld from the judgment debtor's pay each pay period.

The court has considered the financial circumstances of the judgment debtor and has taken into account the expenses listed in the claim of exemption, including mortgage payments, water and power bills, gas bills, and car payments. The court has found that the expenses exceed the judgment debtor's net pay and appear necessary for the support of the judgment debtor and her family.

However, the court has limited the exemption to $20.00 per pay period, as the judgment debtor had offered to withhold this amount. The court has also noted that the judgment creditor's wages can be garnished no more than $31.95 per week, as limited by law.

The court's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after further review or at the hearing scheduled for January 22, 2024.
