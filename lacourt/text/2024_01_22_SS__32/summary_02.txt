And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the information presented and is tentatively ruling on the matter. It notes that Getaround claims to be a "rental company" within the meaning of the Vehicle Code, but this assertion is doubtful in light of a recent court decision. The court also notes that a previous court decision concluded that a rental car agency is not liable for negligent entrustment as a matter of law, as long as the agency has complied with Vehicle Code requirements and the customer does not appear unfit to drive. The court will consider the defendant's motion for summary adjudication, which appears to repeat the arguments made in favor of summary judgment.
