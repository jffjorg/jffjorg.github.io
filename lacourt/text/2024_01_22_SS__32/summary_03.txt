```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and has concluded that Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. The Court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the condition of the basket that caused Plaintiff's injury and whether Defendant breached a duty to inspect and maintain the basket. Specifically, the Court concludes that the condition was not open and obvious and that a jury could reasonably find that the basket was sharp and caused the injury. The Court also notes that there is no evidence regarding the condition of the basket at the time of the incident, and a jury could reasonably find that the basket was in a dangerous condition. Therefore, the Court cannot grant summary judgment to Defendant and the matter must proceed to trial.
