And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying GetAround, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion was filed in response to a complaint alleging negligence and negligent entrustment surrounding a motor vehicle accident involving a GetAround rental vehicle. GetAround argued that it is not liable for the accident because it is a rental car company and is protected by the Graves Amendment. However, the Court found that GetAround has not set forth undisputed facts that it verified the driver's license of the person renting the vehicle, as required by Vehicle Code section 14608. Therefore, GetAround has not met its initial burden and the motion is denied. The Court orders GetAround to give notice of this ruling and file a proof of service.
