MATTER:  


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Brian Whitaker
(“Plaintiff”) requests for default judgment against Defendant House
of Abundance Weho LLC (“Defendant”) in the amount of $9,185.25, which is
composed of general damages in the amount of $4,000; costs in the amount of $755.25;
and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $4,430.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges two causes of action for
(1) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act; and (2) violation of the
California Disabled Persons Act, alleging Defendant’s restaurant failed to
adequately provide disability accommodations. 
Defendant was served with a copy of the summons and complaint via
substitute service on September 6, 2023. 
Default was entered against Defendant on April 9, 2024, and the Doe
defendants were dismissed on April 22, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks $4,000
in statutory damages for violating the Unruh Act. (See Complaint at Prayer ¶ 4.)
 Plaintiff does not seek damages that are
in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a)
[“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed
that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  Plaintiff has supported his allegations via
the Declarations of Brian Whitaker and of Evens Louis.
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to the requested $4,000 in damages. 
 
            d.         Attorney Fees and Costs 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs
to a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the
recovery of attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021 provides “[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided
for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties
[….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717
provides “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines
the “prevailing party” as follows: 
 
[T]he party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
            
            Civil Code section 52 provides for the recovery of
“Attorney’s fees as may be determined by the court.”  (Civ. Code, § 52, subd. (b)(3).)   
 
            Plaintiff seeks $4,430 in attorneys’ fees as outlined in
the billing invoice attached as Exhibit 2 to the Declaration of Prathima Reddy
Price.  Therefore, Plaintiff has
substantiated the legal and factual basis for his request for attorneys’ fees.
 
            Plaintiff also requests $461.17 in costs composed of $461.17 in filing fees, $94.08 in process server fees, and $200 in
“investigator’s fees.” (CIV-100.)  However, Code of Civil Procedure, section
1033.5, subdivision (b) specifically disallows the recovery of “Investigation
expenses in preparing the case for trial.” 

 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award the requested $200 in
“investigator’s fees.”  Plaintiff’s
request for costs is otherwise granted as Plaintiff is the prevailing party in
this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is granted in
part.  The Court grants default judgment
in the amount of $8,985.25, composed of $4,000 in general statutory damages,
$4,430 in attorneys’ fees, and $555.25 in costs.  Plaintiff’s request for $200 in
“investigator’s fees” is denied as investigation fees are disallowed by
statute.
