Roles:
  - Judge: Michael E. Whitaker
Significant Statements:
  - "Defendant had reasonable grounds to deny that it owed those amounts because ... Defendant previously objected to paying a $20,000 flat fee per month and ultimately agreed to a contract ... for period 08/01/18 to 09/01/18 only."
  - "Although Defendant denied it owed Plaintiff the outstanding invoice balance, and Plaintiff was forced to litigate the issue at trial, this is not a situation where Defendant failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into the facts underlying its position, or otherwise denied the issues without a reasonable factual basis, and then failed to introduce any evidence on the topic at trial, forcing Plaintiff to expend unnecessary fees presenting its case on an issue that should have been resolved through admissions."
```

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees, citing that the defendant had a good faith basis for denying the requests for admission (RFA) and that the plaintiff did not prove that the defendant failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into the facts. The judge found that the defendant genuinely disputed the amount owed to the plaintiff and presented evidence at trial to support its position. As a result, the court did not find that the defendant lacked a good faith evidentiary basis upon which to base its denials.
