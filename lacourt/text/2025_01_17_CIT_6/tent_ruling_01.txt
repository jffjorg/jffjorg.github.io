Petition for Expedited Approval of Compromise of Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability
COURT RULING 
The Court GRANTS Petitioner Gabriela Pineda’s petition for
expedited approval of minor’s compromise. The Court will sign the proposed order
approving compromise of claim (Form MC-351) and the proposed order to deposit
funds in blocked account (Form MC-355). 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s

BACKGROUND 
This is an auto accident case. On May 25, 2023,
plaintiffs Gabriela Pineda (Petitioner), Andrew Pineda (Claimant), Hailey
Samantha Pineda, Sophia Nicole Pineda, filed this action against defendant
Peter Yulin (Defendant) and Does 1 to 20, alleging causes of action for
negligence and excessive speed. 
On October 7, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of
settlement. On December 17, 2024, Petitioner filed an expedited petition for
approval of minor’s compromise. The Petition is unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .
[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for
the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) The same protection applies for a disabled
person.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing
upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person
who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise
of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit of funds
of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,
Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
DISCUSSION
Form MC-350EX (Rev. January 1, 2021)
The Petition has been verified by Petitioner and
presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350EX, using
the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
Settlement 
Claimant has agreed
to settle this action against Defendant in exchange for $20,000.00, $8,650.00 of which
will go to Claimant. If approved, $6,000.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $209.98
will be paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s
attorneys, and $5,140.02 will be paid for medical expenses, leaving a balance
of $8,650.00 for Claimant, to be deposited into a blocked account at Chase
Bank. 
The Court has reviewed the
proposed settlement and finds the Petition contains a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the settlement
amount to Claimant. 
Attorney's Fees 
The retained attorney’s
information has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition, ¶
14, subd. (a), Attach. 14a.) There is an agreement for services provided in
connection with the underlying claim. (Petition, ¶ 14, subd. (a), Attach. 14a.)
A copy of the agreement was submitted with the Petition as strictly required by
Rule of Court 7.951(6). (Petition, Attach. 14a.) 
Petitioner’s counsel seeks to
recover $6,000.00 in attorney’s fees. (Petition, ¶ 14, subd. (a), Attach. 14a.)
Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness of the fee
request, as required by Rule 7.995, subdivision (c), of the California Rules of
Court, accounting for the factors specified in Rule 7.995, subdivision (b), of
the California Rules of Court. Rule 7.955, subdivision (b), provides: 
(b) Factors the court may
consider in determining a reasonable attorney's fee. In determining a
reasonable attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive
factors: 
(1) The fact that a minor or
person with a disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or
person with a disability. 
(2) The amount of the fee in
proportion to the value of the services performed. 
(3) The novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services
properly. 
(4) The amount involved and the
results obtained. 
(5) The time limitations or
constraints imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a
disability or by the circumstances. 
(6) The nature and length of the
professional relationship between the attorney and the representative of the
minor or person with a disability. 
(7) The experience, reputation,
and ability of the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services. 
(8) The time and labor required. 
(9) The informed consent of the
representative of the minor or person with a disability to the fee. 
(10) The relative sophistication
of the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability. 
(11) The likelihood, if apparent
to the representative of the minor or person with a disability when the
representation agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the
particular employment would preclude other employment. 
(12) Whether the fee is fixed,
hourly, or contingent. 
(13) If the fee is contingent: 
(A) The risk of loss borne by the
attorney; 
(B) The amount of costs advanced
by the attorney; and 
(C) The delay in payment of fees
and reimbursement of costs paid by the attorney. 
(14) Statutory requirements for
representation agreements applicable to particular cases or claims. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subd. (b).)
The Court addresses these factors below. 
Amount of Fee in Proportion to
Value of Services Performed 
Claimant's counsel’s declaration
indicates that contingency fees of 50% have been upheld before, and that
California courts have routinely upheld 40% contingency fees. (Petition, Attach.
14a, ¶¶ 16-17.)
Claimant’s counsel does not set forth the amount of time expended on this
matter. The Court also notes that Claimant’s counsel’s declaration requests
$8,000.00, which conflicts with the $6,000.00 requested everywhere else in the
Petition. (See Petition, ¶¶ 14, subd. (a), 15, subd. (b)(2), 17, subd. (c), Attach.
14a, ¶ 18.) The Court assumes the $8,000.00 is a typo left over from the prior
petition submitted in which Claimant’s counsel sought a 40% recovery. (See
Notice of Rejection (12/3/24).) The Court further assumes that Claimant’s
counsel seeks only $6,000.00, i.e., 30%, as directed in the Court’s prior
Notice of Rejection. (Notice of Rejection (12/3/24).) 
Novelty and Difficulty 
Claimant’s counsel indicates that
this matter involved numerous complicated legal and factual issues arising out
of different areas of law, including motor vehicle negligence and insurance law.
(Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶¶ 9, 17.) 
Amount Involved and Results
Obtained 
Claimant’s counsel states that the
settlement amount is $20,000.00. (Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶ 12.) 
Nature and Length of Professional
Relationship 
Claimant’s counsel indicates that
Mr. Perez began his representation of Plaintiff on approximately June 11, 2021,
and that Robinson Di Lando became involved to litigate the case when Mr. Perez
was unable to obtain a policy limit settlement. (Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶¶ 7-8.) 
Experience, Reputation, and
Ability of Counsel 
Claimant’s counsel indicates that
Michael C. Robinson has over thirty years of experience practicing law,
including personal injury and catastrophic injury matters. (Petition, Attach. 14a,
¶ 2.) Ricardo A. Perez has over twenty-four years of experience, including
personal injury and workers compensation. (Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶ 3.) Orion
S. Robinson has been practicing law since 2013, and has experience with
catastrophic personal injury law. (Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶ 4.) An unnamed
associate and paralegal also worked on this matter. (Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶
5.) 
Time and Labor Required 
Claimant’s counsel does not
indicate how much time was expended working on this matter. (See generally,
Petition, Attach. 14a.) 
Acceptance of Case Precluding
Other Employment 
Claimant’s counsel does not
mention whether acceptance of this case precluded other employment. (See
generally, Petition, Attach. 14a.) 
Contingent Fee 
Claimant’s counsel states this
case was taken on a contingency basis. (Petition, Attach. 14a, ¶ 14.) The legal
services agreement provides for recovery of 25% before filing suit or demanding
mediation or arbitration, and 40% if a lawsuit is filed or a mediation or
arbitration is demanded or held. (Petition, Attach. 14a.) 
“California
Rules of Court, rule 7.955 requires a trial court, in determining
reasonable attorney fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair
compensation with the protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a
trial court ‘must give
consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between
the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability
and must evaluate
the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the
agreement was made.’ [Citation.]” (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177, italics in original.) 
The Court finds that Claimant’s
counsel has sufficiently demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee award in
light of the factors and circumstances in this case. 
Medical Bills 
Claimant incurred $9.744.40 in
medical expenses, but the medical service providers agreed to reduce their claims
to a total of $5,140.02. (Petition, ¶ 13, subds. (a)(1), (a)(4).) 
Costs 
Claimant’s counsel seeks to
recover $209.98 in costs advanced. (Petition, ¶ 14, subd. (b).) 
Amount to Be Paid to Claimant 
The net amount to be paid to Claimant
is $8,650.00. (Petition, ¶ 16, subd. (f).) 
Disposition of Balance of
Proceeds 
Petitioner requests that the net
proceeds, $8,650.00, be deposited into a blocked account at Chase Bank. (Petition,
¶ 19, subd. (b)(2), Attach. 19b(2).) 
Prognosis 
Claimant has recovered completely
from the effects of the injuries. (Petition, ¶ 9, subd. (a).) 
Order Approving Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability (MC-351) & Order
to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account (MC-355)
Petitioner has filed a proposed order for approving the Petition
(Form MC-351) and a proposed order to deposit funds in a blocked account (Form
MC-355).
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the settlement to be fair
and adequate, and the Court GRANTS the Expedited Petition for Minor’s
Compromise.
CONCLUSION

expedited approval of minor’s compromise. The Court will sign the proposed
order approving compromise of claim (Form MC-351) and the proposed order to
deposit funds in blocked account (Form MC-355).
