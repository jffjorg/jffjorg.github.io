Code section 946.6 provides in part:
“(a) If an application for leave to present a claim is
denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to Section 911.6, a petition may be made
to the court for an order relieving the petitioner from Section 945.4. The
proper court for filing the petition is a superior court that would be a proper
court for the trial of an action on the cause of action to which the claim
relates. If the petition is filed in a court which is not a proper court for
the determination of the matter, the court, on motion of any party, shall
transfer the proceeding to a proper court. If an action on the cause of action
to which the claim relates would be a limited civil case, a proceeding pursuant
to this section is a limited civil case.
“(b) The petition shall show each of the following:
“(1) That application was made to the board under
Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied.
“(2) The reason for failure to present the claim
within the time limit specified in Section 911.2.
“(3) The information required by Section 910.
“The petition shall be filed within six months after
the application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to
Section 911.6. . . .”

subds. (a), (b).)
