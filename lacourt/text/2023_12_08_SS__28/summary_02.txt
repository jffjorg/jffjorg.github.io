And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the procedure for filing a petition to relieve a petitioner from Section 945.4 when an application for leave to present a claim is denied or deemed denied by the board under Government Code section 911.4. The petition must show the reason for failure to present the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2 and must be filed within six months of the denial or deemed denial. The judge notes that if the petition is filed in a court that is not a proper court for the determination of the matter, the court may transfer the proceeding to a proper court on motion of any party.
