The Court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. The City of Santa Monica requests that the Court order Christina Choi to undergo a physical examination with Alfredo A. Sadun, M.D., Ph.D., a neuro-ophthalmologist and board-certified ophthalmologist, including dilation of Choi's eyes, on January 9, 2024, at 10:45 a.m., 625 South Fair Oaks Ave., Suite 280, Pasadena, CA 91105, or a mutually convenient date and time no later than January 30, 2024. The Court finds good cause for the examination and grants the motion. The examination will take place at Dr. Sadun's office in Pasadena, which is approximately 25.1 miles from Choi's home.

The Court limits the examination to one hour and allows Dr. Sadun to dilate Choi's eyes as part of the examination.
