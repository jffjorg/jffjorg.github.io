LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.310 provides: 
“(a) If any party desires to obtain discovery by a
physical examination other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with
Section 2032.210), or by a mental examination, the party shall obtain leave of
court. 
“(b) A motion for an examination under subdivision (a)
shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice of the motion shall be served on the
person to be examined and on all parties who have appeared in the action..” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.310.) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320 provides in part: 
“(a) The court shall grant a motion for a physical or
mental examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown.  * * *
“(d) An order granting a physical or mental
examination shall specify the person or persons who may perform the
examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and
procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. 
“(e) If the place of the examination is more than 75
miles from the residence of the person to be examined, an order to submit to it
shall be entered only if both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The court determines that there is good cause for
the travel involved. 
“(2) The order is conditioned on the advancement by
the moving party of the reasonable expenses and costs to the examinee for
travel to the place of examination.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subds. (a), (d), (e).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.410 provides: 
“If a party is required to submit to a physical or
mental examination under Articles 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210) or 3
(commencing with Section 2032.310), or under Section 2016.030, but fails to do
so, the court, on motion of the party entitled to the examination, may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may,
on motion of the party, impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.410.)  
DISCUSSION 
Choi
previously submitted to examinations by a neurologist and an orthopedist.
 The City
argues that good cause supports a third physical examination because Choi
continues to complain of symptoms involving her eye, including double vision.  Dr. Sadun has determined that a neuro-ophthalmological
examination of Choi is needed to determine the type of injury that Choi
experienced in her eye. 
The City
states that the examination will be conducted under standard office conditions
and will consist of the taking of
history, present status, physical examination, and the scope of examination may
include, but is not limited to, ophthalmology, fundus photography, optical
coherent tomography, visual field testing, and possibly dilation of the eyes. 
Choi
opposes the request for an order compelling the examination but asks that, if
the Court grants the order, the Court impose the following conditions: 
1.
The examination be done at the Jules Stein Eye Institute rather than Pasadena. 
2.
The examiner be precluded from dilating Plaintiffs eyes. 
3.
The examination be the last physical examination of Plaintiff.
4.  The examination be limited in time to one
hour. 
The
Court finds good cause for the examination.  The examination will take place at Dr. Sadun’s
office in Pasadena, which is approximately 25.1 miles from Choi’s home.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd. (e) [place of examination may be more than 75 miles from residence of person to be examined only if court determines there is good cause for the travel involved and court orders moving party to pay examinee's travel expenses].)  Although dilation of the eyes is more
intrusive than, for example, simple observation of the eye, it is a routine and
generally painless procedure whose effects are temporary.  Dr. Sadun may dilate Choi's eyes as part of the examination.  The Court will not preclude the City from
seeking additional examinations subject to the requirement of showing good
cause.  The City does not object to
limiting the examination to one hour. 
The
Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant City of Santa Monica’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Christina Choi’s physical examination. 
The Court orders Plaintiff Christina Choi to undergo a physical
evaluation with Alfredo A. Sadun, M.D., Ph.D., a neuro-ophthalmologist and
board-certified ophthalmologist, including dilation of Choi’s eyes, on January
9, 2024, at 10:45 a.m., 625 South Fair Oaks Ave., Suite 280, Pasadena, CA
91105, or a mutually convenient date and time no later than January 30, 2024.
