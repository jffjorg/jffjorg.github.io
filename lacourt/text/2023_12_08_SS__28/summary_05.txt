The City of Los Angeles filed a motion to vacate its default in a lawsuit filed by Patricia Durazo-Perez against the City, the State of California, and others. The City claims that it overlooked the lawsuit due to a large caseload and staffing issues, and that it timely filed the motion and proposed answer. The judge agrees that the City's default resulted from its mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and grants the motion to vacate the default. The judge also orders the City to file a new answer and cross-complaint if it wishes to have them considered. The judge sets a hearing date for January 9, 2024, to consider the City's answer and cross-complaint.
