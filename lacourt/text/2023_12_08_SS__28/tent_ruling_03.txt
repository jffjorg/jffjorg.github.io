for each set of special interrogatories.)  Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
Trial

PARTY’S REQUESTS 
          Defendant asks the Court to compel Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant
responses, without objections, to Defendant’s special interrogatories (sets two
and three) and to award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
B.       Discovery sanctions 
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
“Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: 
* * * 
“(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
January 17,2023, Defendant served special interrogatories (set two) on
Plaintiff.  On June 23, 2023, Defendant
served special interrogatories (set three) on Plaintiff.

The
Court grants Defendant’s motion and orders Plaintiff to provide verified,
code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories (sets two and three) without
objections by January 7, 2024.         
Defendant
requests $750.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney’s work at rate
of $250.00 per hour.  Counsel spent two
hours preparing the motion and anticipated spending one hour appearing at the
hearing on the motion. The Court awards $500.00 in sanctions based on two hours
of attorney’s work. 
CONCLUSION

Authority’s motion to compel

interrogatories (sets two and three).  The
Court orders Plaintiff Quiwaneca Spikes to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without
