LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides: 
“(a) In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery
for personal injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the
plaintiff, if both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The examination does not include any diagnostic
test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive. 
“(2) The examination is conducted at a location within
75 miles of the residence of the examinee. 
“(b) A defendant may make a demand under this article
without leave of court after that defendant has been served or has appeared in
the action, whichever occurs first. 
“(c) A demand under subdivision (a) shall specify the
time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well
as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the physician who will perform
the examination. 
“(d) A physical examination demanded under subdivision
(a) shall be scheduled for a date that is at least 30 days after service of the
demand. On motion of the party demanding the examination, the court may shorten
this time. 
“(e) The defendant shall serve a copy of the demand
under subdivision (a) on the plaintiff and on all other parties who have
appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides: 
“(a) If a
plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, that plaintiff waives any
objection to the demand. The court, on motion, may relieve that plaintiff from
this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: 
“(1) The
plaintiff has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Section 2032.230. 
“(2) The plaintiff’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. 
“(b) The
defendant may move for an order compelling response and compliance with a
demand for a physical examination. 
“(c) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical
examination, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. 
“(d) If a
plaintiff then fails to obey the order compelling response and compliance, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240.)  
DISCUSSION 
On
June 23, 2023, Defendants served a demand on Plaintiff to attend a physical
examination with Dr. Russell W. Nelson, M.D. on August 1, 2023 at 11:30 a.m.  On dates between June 23, 2023 and July 31,
2023 (Defendants' motion does not specify the dates), Plaintiff’s counsel informed
Defendants’ counsel that Plaintiff would not appear for the physical
examination on August 1.  (Exh. B.)  Plaintiff’s counsel provided four alternative
dates in August, including August 29.  (Exh.
B.) 
On
August 10, 2023, Defendants’ counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel that
Plaintiff had not appeared for the August 1 examination.  (Exh. B.) 
On
August 11, Plaintiff’s counsel reminded Defendants’ counsel that Plaintiff’s
counsel had previously informed Defendants’ counsel that Plaintiff would not
appear on August 1 and had provided alternative dates.  (Exh. B.) 
Defendants’ counsel checked his emails and confirmed that he had
received this information from Plaintiff’s counsel.  (Exh. B.) 
Defendants’ counsel stated that the doctor was available on August 29 in
the afternoon. 
On
August 18, 2023, Defendants’ counsel sent a follow-up email to Plaintiff’s
counsel asking for a response to his August 11 email. 
On
August 23, 2023, Defendants filed their motion to compel Plaintiff’s
examination, arguing that Plaintiff failed to appear for examination on August
1, 2023. 
The Court
denies the motion without prejudice.  Defendants
have not shown that Plaintiff refused to attend an
examination.  Instead, the evidence shows
that, before the scheduled August 1 examination, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendant’s
counsel that Plaintiff would not appear and provided alternative dates. Defendants’
counsel did not respond to Plaintiff’s counsel’s attempts to reschedule the
examination until August 10, 2023.  Then,
when Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to Defendants’ counsel’s August 11
email by August 23, Defendants filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s attendance
at a physical examination. 
Counsel
should meet and confer and attempt to find a mutually-agreeable date for
Plaintiff’s examination.  If
they cannot, Defendants may make another demand under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2032.220 and, if necessary, file a motion to compel under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2032.240, subdivision (b). 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the motion of Defendants Peter Brueggeman and Josephy Brueggeman to
compel Plaintiff Jeffrey D. Devorebest to attend an independent medical
examination at the office of Dr. Russell W. Nelson, M.D., Orthopedic Surgery,
250 Lombard Street, First Floor, Thousand Oaks, California 91348 on August 1,
2023 at 11:30 a.m.
