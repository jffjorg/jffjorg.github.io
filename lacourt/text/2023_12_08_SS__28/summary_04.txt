And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel Plaintiff Jeffrey D. Devorebest to attend an independent medical examination. The Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Defendants Peter Brueggeman and Josephy Brueggeman for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The Defendants filed an answer and later filed a motion to compel the Plaintiff's attendance at a physical examination with Dr. Russell W. Nelson, M.D. on August 1, 2023. However, the Plaintiff's counsel informed the Defendants' counsel that the Plaintiff would not attend the scheduled examination and provided alternative dates. The Defendants' counsel did not respond to the Plaintiff's counsel's attempts to reschedule the examination until August 10, 2023. The Court denies the motion without prejudice, stating that the Plaintiff did not refuse to attend the examination, but rather, the parties failed to meet and confer to reschedule the examination. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer to find a mutually-agreeable date for the Plaintiff's examination, and if they cannot, the Defendants may make another demand under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 and, if necessary, file a motion to compel under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (b).
