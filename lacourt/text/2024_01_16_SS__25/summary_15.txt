And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the City of Duarte's motion for fees and costs in the amount of $45,078.93. The City had sought to recover these fees and costs as the prevailing party in the appeal of an administrative citation issued against Appellant Armando Mendoza. The Judge found that the City was the prevailing party under CCP § 1032(b), but that its request for fees and costs was time-barred under CRC 3.1700. The Judge also noted that the City's motion was filed 15 days after the court issued notice of its decision, which exceeded the 30-day deadline for filing a motion seeking attorney's fees. Therefore, the Judge denied the City's motion for fees and costs.
