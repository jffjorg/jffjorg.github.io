And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Equifax Information Services to the complaint filed by Jason Alan. The judge finds that the demurrer is unfounded and overrules it. The judge holds that the complaint states sufficient facts to show that Jason Alan has a cause of action against Equifax Information Services for violating the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act. The judge notes that a demurrer tests the pleading alone and not the evidence or facts alleged, and that the court assumes the truth of the complaint's properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. The judge also finds that Equifax Information Services misunderstood the purpose of a demurrer and is using it to challenge Jason Alan's residence, which is a factual inquiry and not appropriate in the context of a demurrer. The judge orders Equifax Information Services to file an answer within 20 days of the ruling and directs the moving party to give notice.
