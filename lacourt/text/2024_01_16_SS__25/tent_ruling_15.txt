BACKGROUND
On April 27, 2023, Appellant Armando Mendoza (“Appellant”) filed
notice of his appeal of his administrative citation issued against him on
February 22, 2023, by the City of Duarte (“Respondent” or “the City”). 
On July 10, 2023, the City filed an Ex-Parte Application to confirm
Court Process and obtain a brief continuance of the hearing. The Court granted
the application on July 11, 2023, and continued the hearing date to August 25,
2023.
On August 16, 2023, the Parties jointly stipulated to continue the
hearing on the appeal to October 06, 2023. 
 On October 13, 2023, the Court
affirmed the citation issued against Appellant. 
On December 18, 2023, the City filed the instant Motion for City’s
Fees and Costs. Appellant files in opposition. The City replies. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            The City
prays for the court to issue an order awarding the City attorney’s fees and
costs in the amount of $45,078.93. The City argues it is the prevailing
party within the meaning of CCP § 1032(b) and 1032(a)(4), since Appellant did
not recover any relief against the City and is therefore entitled to
reimbursement of the City’s Reasonable Attorney’s Fees and Costs pursuant to
Duarte Municipal Code Section 1.08.140 and 1.08.130. The City additionally
argues that its request for reimbursement of $45,078.93 is reasonable given the
circumstances and is fully supported by the Declaration of its counsel. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            In
opposition, Appellant argues that the City is not the prevailing party under
CCP 1033.5 because the appeal of his administrative citation does not constitute
an action defined by CCP § 1032. Alternatively, if the Court were to determine
otherwise, the Court should deny fees because the City’s request is wholly
unreasonable and excessive in the absence of accurate time records. Appellant further
asserts the fees sought are prohibited by the Excess Fines Clause of the [18th]
Amendment. (sic) Appellant argues that the fine is simply disguised by the City
to punish him for seeking an administrative review of his citations as a pro
per litigant and that the motion seeks “100 times of the actual fine…therefore
grossly disproportional to the offense and is excessive and cruel…” (Opp. p.3:4-6.)  
 
REPLY
 
            In reply, the
City continues to assert that Duarte Municipal Code establishes that the city
is entitled to reimbursement for their efforts to abate nuisances for the
protection of the community. Moreover, the City argues that there can be no excessive
fines clause violation because the City is not imposing a Fine or Forfeiture to
punish Appellant. Further, Petitioner cites no supporting case law establishing
that a city seeking reimbursement of its cost and fees, as a prevailing party,
constitutes a fine for purposes of the 8th Amendment. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including
attorney’s fees, as a matter of right.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.)  Attorney’s fees
are allowable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10).)  
 
In a breach of contract action, attorney’s fees shall be
awarded when a contract provides that one of the parties or the prevailing
party shall be awarded attorney’s fees in an action on that contract.  (See
Civ. Code § 1717.)  A prevailing party is “the party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).)  However, “[w]here an action has been
voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case, there
shall be no prevailing party for purposes of [Civil Code section 1717].” 
(Civ. Code § 1717(b)(2); see Shapira v. Lifetech Resources, LLC
(2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 429, 441 (“A trial court lacks discretion to award fees
under section 1717(b)(2) where a case has been voluntarily dismissed.”); see
also Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17¿Cal.4th 599, 615.) 
 
The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.  A
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. 
The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  Such
an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of
the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not
arbitrary.  (Ibid. at p. 48, fn. 23.)  After the trial court
has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total
award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a
reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is
a reasonable figure.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095-1096.) 
 
As explained in Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154: 
 
“[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal
services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors
including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)
the contingent nature of the fee award. [Citation.] The purpose of such
adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.
In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation
involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying
augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market
rate for such services. . . . This approach anchors the trial court's analysis
to an objective determination of the value of the attorney's services, ensuring
that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.” [Internal citations and internal
quotation marks omitted.] 
 
(Graciano v. Robinson Ford
Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140.) “It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citations.]  The value of legal services
performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise.
. . . The trial court makes its determination after consideration of a number
of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention
given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. 
[Citations.]”  (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618,
623624.)   
 
No specific findings reflecting
the court’s calculations are required.  The record need only show that the
attorney fees were awarded according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone”
approach.  The court’s focus in evaluating the facts should be to provide
a fee award reasonably designed to completely compensate attorneys for the
services provided.  The starting point for this determination is the
attorney’s time records. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence
absent clear indication they are erroneous].)  However, California case
law permits fee awards in the absence of detailed time sheets. (Sommers v.
Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America
(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 103.)  An experienced trial judge is in a
position to assess the value of the professional services rendered in his or
her court.  (Ibid.; Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 255.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
As a preliminary matter the Court
will not address Appellant's contention of supposed violations of the Excessive
Fines Clause. The Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence
applies only to criminal matters and does not reach the issuance of fees and
costs incurred by a prevailing party. (Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vermont, Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc. (1989) 492 U.S. 257.) 
 
The City cites to Duarte
Municipal Code (DMC) 1.08.130(a) and 1.08.140 as relevant statutory authority
in granting its request for attorney’s fees. DMC 1.08.130(a) provide that, 
 
At its discretion, the city may pursue any and all
available legal means to ensure collection of all fines issued under this
chapter, including any applicable interest and penalties and costs of abatement
or enforcement. Pursuit of any one remedy shall not preclude enforcement by any
other legal means until the total amount due has been collected.
 
(Duarte Mun. Code § 1.08.130(a).)
DMC 1.08.140 additionally states that, “In any hearing, proceedings, or action
under this chapter, attorneys' fees may be recovered by the prevailing party;
provided, however, that the award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party
shall not exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the city
in the action or proceeding.” (Duarte Mun. Code § 1.08.140.)
 
The City asserts that it is the
prevailing party within the meaning of CCP §
1032(b) and 1032(a)(4), since Appellant did not recover any relief against the
City. Here the City’s declaration in support of the motion states that the
Court upheld the Hearing officer’s final administrative decision and entered
the Notice of Decision. (Matther G. Trujillo Decl. ¶ 2.) Thus, the Court finds
the City to be the prevailing party under CCP § 1032(b). 
 
In opposition,
Appellant argues that the City’s motion is time barred under CRC 3.1700 as the
motion was filed 15-days after the court issued notice of its decision. (Opp’n
p. 6:26-28.) The Court agrees the motion is time barred, however, the Court finds
better authority under CRC rule 3.1702. CRC rule 3.1702(a) provides in relevant
part that,
 
Except as otherwise provided by statute,
this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney's fees and
claims for attorney's fees provided for in a contract. Subdivisions (b) and (c)
apply when the court determines entitlement to the fees, the amount of the
fees, or both, whether the court makes that determination because the statute
or contract refers to “reasonable” fees, because it requires a determination of
the prevailing party, or for other reasons.
 
(Cal Rules of
Court Rule 3.1702 (a).) CRC rule 3.1702(b)(1) further provides that a notice of
motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up to and including the rendition
of Judgement in the trial court, including attorney’s fees on an appeal before
rendition of a judgement in the trial court must be served and filed within the
time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited
civil case. (Cal Rules of Court Rule 3.1702 (b)(1).) CRC rule 8.822 provides
that unless provided otherwise by statue or rule 8.823 a party must provide
notice on or before the earliest of,
(A) 30 days
after the trial court clerk serves the party filing the notice of appeal a
document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the
judgment, showing the date it was served.
(B) 30 days
after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with
a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of
the judgment, accompanied by proof of service: or
(C) 90 days after the entry of judgment.
 
(Cal Rules of
Court Rule 8.822(a)(1).) Here, notice of the Court’s decision was given on
October 13, 2023. The City did not file its motion for Attorney’s fees until
December 18, 2023, well over the 30-day deadline to file a motion seeking
attorney’s fees. Therefore, for that reason the Court DENIES the motion for
Attorney’s fees. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Respondent City of Duarte’s Motion for City’s Fees and
Cost is DENIED
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
