And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Victoria Glass and Martel Grace against Jorge Alexander Godinez Flores. The case concerns a motion by Counsel Paul Kingston to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Glass, citing a breakdown in communication between Counsel and the client. However, the Judge has denied the motion due to deficiencies in Counsel's filing, including failure to list the reason for the motion and misplacement of the reason in the declaration. The Judge notes that Counsel has not provided any supplemental filings to correct these deficiencies, and therefore the motion is denied.
