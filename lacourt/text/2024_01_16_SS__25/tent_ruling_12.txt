(“Plaintiff”)  filed four causes of action against Defendant Jose Mendoza (“Defendant”) for  the following: (1) Possession of Personal Property; (2) Breach of Express  Contract; (3) Unjust Enrichment; and (4) Reasonable Value.  Defendant filed his Answer on February 17, 2023.  On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary  Judgment or Alternatively for Summary Adjudication of Claims.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION                Plaintiff moves for summary judgment as to all  four of its causes of action. Plaintiff argues that there are no triable issues  of material fact as to its causes of action for breach of contract and thus is  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   OPPOSITION               In  opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not met its burden under CCP §  437(c). Specifically, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff fails to show that 1)  the installation work was complete per the Contract; 2) the system became fully  operational; 3) the system generated energy; 4) that Defendant defaulted; and  5) Plaintiff performed all conditions on its part under the Contract.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    EVIDENTIARY  OBJECTIONS   1.       Overruled per business record exception to the hearsay  rule.   2.       Sustained.   ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  A party seeking summary judgment has  the burden of producing evidentiary facts sufficient to entitle him/her to  judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c).) The moving party must  make an affirmative showing that he/she is entitled to judgment irrespective of  whether or not the opposing party files an opposition. (Villa v. McFerren  (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 742- 743.) Thus, “the initial burden is always on  the moving party to make prima facie showing that there are no triable issues  of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128  Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)  25 Cal.4th 826, 850.). When a plaintiff seeks summary judgment, he/she must  produce admissible evidence on each element of each cause of action on which  judgment is sought. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1).) The moving party’s  “affidavits must cite evidentiary facts, not legal conclusions or ‘ultimate’  facts” and the courts must construe the evidence in support of the opposing  party, resolving any doubts in favor of the opposing party. (Hayman v. Block  (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 629, 639; Scalf, 128 Cal.App.4th at 1519; Dore  v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)  The opposing  party on a motion for summary judgment is under no evidentiary burden to  produce rebuttal evidence until the moving party meets his or her initial  movant’s burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance Company (1999) 75  Cal.App.4th 832, 840.) Once the initial movant’s burden is met, then the burden  shifts to the opposing party to show, with admissible evidence, that there is a  triable issue requiring the weighing procedures of trial. (Code Civ. Proc. §  437c(p).) The opposing party may not simply rely on his/her allegations to show  a triable issue but must present evidentiary facts that are substantial in  nature and rise beyond mere speculation. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68  Cal.App.4th 151, 162.) Summary judgment must be granted “if all the evidence  submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and  uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment  as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7  Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)    As to any  alternative request for summary adjudication of issues, such alternative relief  must be clearly set forth in the Notice of Motion and the general  burden-shifting rules apply but the issues upon which summary adjudication may  be sought are limited by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(f)(1).) “A motion  for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a  cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of  duty.” (Id.)   II.        Discussion                As a preliminary matter the Court notes  that Defendant filed opposition papers beyond the required filing deadline. A  court has the discretion to refuse consideration of late filed papers without a  prior court order finding good cause for late submission. (Bozzi v.  Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186 CA4th 755, 765.) In deciding to consider the  late-filed papers, a court may continue the hearing to allow the moving party  an opportunity to reply to the matters contained therein. (Hobson v. Raychem  Corp. (1999) 73 CA4th 614, 623.)    The Court will consider the late opposition submission. Defendant,  in addition to filing his opposition to the motion, files a notice of  Substitution of Attorney indicating he is now represented by counsel.    Separately, the Court notes that Plaintiff erroneously indicates  in its moving papers that Defendant offers no affirmative defenses within his  answer but rather general denials. (Mot. p. 2:1.) However, Defendant’s answer  does make an affirmative defense in arguing that Plaintiff is not entitled to  recover because Plaintiff failed to correctly install the solar panel,  resulting in no energy production and Defendant not receiving the benefits of the  product. (Ans. Par. 4)                Plaintiff moves for summary judgment  against Defendant as to all its causes of action. In the alternative, Plaintiff  moves for summary adjudication. Courts have held that plaintiffs moving for  summary judgment bear the burden of persuasion that each element of the cause  of action in question has been “proved.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.  (2001) 25 C4th 826, 850.) The Court notes that Plaintiff’s complaint alleges four of causes  of action for (1) Possession of Personal Property; (2) Breach of  Express Contract; (3) Unjust Enrichment; and (4) Reasonable Value. However,  based on Plaintiff’s moving papers the Court interprets Plaintiff’s position is  to move for summary adjudication as to its cause of action for breach of  contract as it is the only issue it discusses in its moving papers. Therefore,  the Court will determine whether Plaintiff has met its burden under CCP §  437c(c).               To state a  cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish  “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for  nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)  51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)   If a breach of contract claim “is  based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out  verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must  be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299,  307.) In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of  the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co.  (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)    Here, Plaintiff submits evidence  that on or around October 20, 2017, Defendant for valuable consideration made  and executed an agreement with Plaintiff. (Plaintiff Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. A.) Based  on the terms of the agreement, Defendant promised to purchase from Plaintiff  “all energy produced by a certain photovoltaic solar system [Solar System]  installed on the real property commonly known as 9519 Holbrook St., Pico  Rivera, CA 90660 from Plaintiff” at a rate established under the contract (Id.)  Plaintiff completed installation of the solar system around December 14, 2017,  which became fully operational and generating energy, thereby commencing its In  service Date under the contract. (Id. ¶ 5.) As a result, Plaintiff has  performed all its obligations under the agreement. (Id. ¶ 8.) Defendant defaulted  under the terms of the agreement when he failed to make payments when they were  due. (Id. ¶ 7.) As a result of Defendant’s non payments, Plaintiff is  owed $24,731.00 and has also incurred court costs in the amount of $510.00 for  the following: filing fees in the amount of $370.00, and service of process  fees of $140.00. (Id. ¶ 10-11.)    The  Court finds Plaintiff has met its evidentiary burden for its cause of action  for breach of contract. Plaintiff submits evidence that there was an agreement between  the parties, that Plaintiff performed under the agreement and that further  Defendant breached his duty when he defaulted on payments. Plaintiff’s evidence  notes the extent of its damages and furthermore provides the Court with a copy  of the parties’ agreement.    In  opposition, Defendant provides the Court with a filed separate statement in  which it disputed Plaintiff’s evidence: 1) that Plaintiff had completed  installation of the Solar System; 2) that the system became fully operational;  3) that the system generated energy; 4) that Defendant defaulted; and 5)  Plaintiff performed all conditions on its part under the Contract. (Opp’n Separate  Statement.) However, Defendant fails to provide the Court with evidentiary  facts that are substantial in nature and rise beyond mere speculation. CCP  473(c) provides that when the moving party has satisfied its burden, the  opposing party must show through admissible evidence, that there is a triable of  material fact. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(1).) The opposing party may not  simply rely on his/her allegations to show a triable issue but must present  evidentiary facts that are substantial in nature and rise beyond mere  speculation. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 162.) Here,  Defendant’s separate statement cites Defendant’s Declaration to dispute  Plaintiff’s facts but does not supply the Court with Defendant’s Declaration. Thus,  without any contrary evidentiary facts, Defendant’s arguments can be considered  mere speculation and thus fails to carry his burden under CCP 437(c).    Noting  this, the Court CONTINUES the hearing to allow Defendant to properly file his  Declaration and to allow Plaintiff the opportunity to reply to Defendant’s  late-filed opposition.    III.       Conclusion                          Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication as to its cause  of action for Breach of Contract is CONTINUED TO MARCH 7, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the  SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.    At least 16 court  days before the next scheduled hearing, Defendant must file and serve  supplemental papers addressing the missing Declaration noted in Defendant’s  separate statement. Plaintiff may file a replay to the late-filed opposition noted  herein. Failure to do so will result in the Petition being placed off calendar  or denied.    Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
