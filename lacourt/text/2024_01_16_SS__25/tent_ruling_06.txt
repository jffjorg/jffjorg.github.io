ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For
purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any
of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney
who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court
must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.
[Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement
were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly
acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In
re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of
Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may interpret the terms
and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d
561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as
opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed
upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 810).
 
II.        Discussion 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the
parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of
Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary
nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction
under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and
it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,
97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here, the parties signed a stipulation containing the
parties’ agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter
judgment in the event of default. (05-27-22 Stipulation.) Prior to the
dismissal of this action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and
submitted to the Court. (Id. at p. 3.) On May 31, 2022, the Court
dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and
expressly stated that it “shall retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (05-31-22
Order.) Therefore, the Court finds that the Stipulation complies with CCP §
664.6 requirements and has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to
the parties’ Stipulation in this action. 
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Settlement
Agreement filed on May 27, 2022, provides that the parties agreed to settle the
matter for a principal sum of $12,648.10, with Defendant paying an initial
payment of $6,648.10 and then making subsequent monthly payments of $130.00
beginning on March 14, 2022. (Harlan Reese Decl., Ex. A.) Plaintiff’s Counsel
avers that Defendant’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment of $6,648.10
and that Defendant made monthly payments totaling $1,690.00 pursuant to the
Agreement. (Id. ¶¶ 4-5.) Counsel further states that around October 19,
2023, Plaintiff mailed Defendant a default letter regarding the missed payments
with no payment being made fourteen (14) days after its issuance. (Id., ¶¶
6-7; Exhibit C – a copy of the default letter.) Specifically, Plaintiff
declares that “[Defendant] did call me but said he is not going to bring the
account current.” (Id. ¶ 7.) Accordingly, due to Defendant’s failure to
comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff requested that a judgment of $4,766.31
be entered against Defendant. 
The Court
finds the Settlement Agreement to be valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,
Plaintiff presents evidence that Defendant has not made any payments and has
not cured the default after Plaintiff sent notice. (Id. ¶¶ 6-7.) Therefore,
since a valid and signed settlement agreement between the parties has been
breached, and the Court retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the motion satisfies
CCP § 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on May 31, 2022, is
vacated, and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $4,766.31 for the following: the principal amount of $12,648.10, less
the later payments of $8,338.10, plus court costs Plaintiff has incurred of
$456.31 (consisting of: $396.31 complaint filing fee, and $60.00 motion fee). 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Motion is GRANTED and judgment is entered for
Plaintiff and against Defendant for $4,766.31. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
