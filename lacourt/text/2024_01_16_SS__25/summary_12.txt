And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Sunrun Installation Services Inc. (Plaintiff) against Jose Mendoza (Defendant) for breach of contract. The Plaintiff is seeking to have the court determine that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence presented.

The Defendant filed opposition to the motion, disputing the Plaintiff's evidence regarding the installation, operation, and energy production of the solar panel system. The Defendant also failed to file its Declaration in support of its opposition, which the court considers to be mere speculation and insufficient to carry its burden under the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The court finds that the Plaintiff has met its evidentiary burden for its cause of action for breach of contract, having presented evidence of the agreement between the parties, its performance under the agreement, and the Defendant's breach when he defaulted on payments.

The court continues the hearing to allow the Defendant to properly file its Declaration and to allow the Plaintiff to reply to the late-filed opposition. The court orders that the Defendant must file and serve supplemental papers addressing the missing Declaration at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing.

The court also orders that the Plaintiff may file a reply to the late-filed opposition. Failure to comply with these orders may result in the petition being placed off calendar or denied.
