Newrez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing erroneously sued as Shellpoint
Mortgage Servicing
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): None as of March 22, 2024
 
REQUESTED RELIEF: 
 
1.      Demurrer
to the entire Complaint for failure to state sufficient facts constituting a
cause of action.
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
1.      Defendant’s
Demurrer to the Verified Complaint is SUSTAINED in its entirety.
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff Alec Alexander (Plaintiff)
filed a Verified Complaint against Defendant Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing
(Defendant) with nine causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach
of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Estoppel; (4) Negligence; (5)
Fraudulent Misrepresentation; (6) Negligent Misrepresentation; (7) Fraudulent
Promise without Intention to Perform; (8) Violation of Business &
Professions Code § 17200, et seq; and (9) Accounting.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs owns property located
at 22766 Saddle Peak Rd., Topanga, California 90290 (the Property) and has been
paying a loan on the Property. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant began servicing
the loan in/around April wrongly collected Forced Placement Insurance amounts. Plaintiff
further alleges that while he worked to resolve the FPI issue, Defendant added
another unauthorized fee to his mortgage payments. Plaintiff alleges Defendant
structured their system in such as way as to keep homeowners, like Plaintiff, paying
FPI when they do not need to.
 
On January 29, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer.
Oppositions were due on or before March 19, 2024. As of March 22, 2024, there
is no opposition filed with the court. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet and Confer¿ 
¿¿ 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the
demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41, and demonstrate that they so satisfied
their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code
of Civ. Proc. §430.41(a)(2) & (3). The parties met and conferred on January
8, 2024, but were unable to resolve the issues. (Mika Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.)
Accordingly, the meet and confer requirement is met.
 
Demurrer¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿ 
¿ 
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true. (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) Courts also consider exhibits attached to
the complaint and incorporated by reference. (See Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94 (Frantz).)¿ 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Defendants’ request for judicial notice as
to its own case file and Exhibit A. (Evid. Code § 452(c), (d), and (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing
Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23, 37.) However, the court only takes
judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content
and authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not
take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those
documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022)
87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
First Cause of
Action – Breach of Contract
 
Defendant contends that as a subsequent loan servicer, it
lacks contractual privity with Plaintiff concerning the alleged deed of trust.
Alternatively, Defendant argues that Plaintiff insufficiently alleged breach
because Plaintiff did not allege that he provided proof of insurance to
Defendant prior to adding the forced placed insurance under paragraph 5 of the
deed of trust. Additionally, Defendant contends Plaintiff insufficiently
alleged he fully performed under the deed of trust or that he sufficiently
alleged damages. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
“To establish a cause of action for breach of contract, the
plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of the contract, (2) the
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s
breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff. [Citation.]” (Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98.) “A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms
– set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the
complaint and incorporated therein by reference – or by its legal effect.
[Citation.] In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must
‘allege the substance of its relevant terms.’” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 993.)¿¿
 
Upon reviewing the FAC, Plaintiff has not sufficiently
alleged a claim for breach of contract. While Plaintiff attached a copy of the
deed of trust (FAC, Exhibit A) and alleged that Defendant subsequently took
over from the original Lender (FAC ¶ 12), Plaintiff failed to allege compliance
with Paragraph 20. Paragraph 20 of the deed of trust states: “Neither Borrower
nor Lender may commence . . . any judicial action . . . that arises from the
other party’s actions pursuant to this Security Interest or that alleges that
the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of,
this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other
party . . . of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a
reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action.”[1]
(FAC, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff only alleges he performed by making payments under
the deed of trust. (FAC ¶ 14.) 
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the first cause of action.
 
Second Cause of
Action – Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
Defendant advances the same arguments as for the first cause
of action. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
Every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing that neither party will do anything to interfere with the
other party’s right to receive the benefits of the agreement. (Howard v. American Nat’l Fire Ins. Co.
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 498, 528.) 
 
The elements of a claim for breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing are: (1) a contractual relationship; (2) plaintiff
fulfilled their contractual obligations; (3) any conditions precedent to
defendant’s performance occurred; (4) defendant unfairly interfered with
plaintiff’s right to receive the benefits of the contract; and (5) plaintiff
was harmed by defendant’s conduct. (Waller
v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 36.)  
 
As discussed above, Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege
that he fully performed under the deed of trust.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the second cause of action.
 
Third Cause of
Action – Estoppel
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff alleged preliminary
discussions and legal conclusions, not facts. Additionally, Defendant contends
Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged damages because the forced placed
insurance funds were credited back to Plaintiff’s account. Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition.
 
“The elements of promissory estoppel are (1) a clear
promise, (2) reliance, (3) substantial detriment, and (4) damages “measured by
the extent of the obligation assumed and not performed.”  (Toscano v. Greene Music (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 685, 692.) 
 
Upon reviewing the FAC, Plaintiff has not sufficiently
alleged a claim for estoppel. Notably, Plaintiff’s claim is based on conduct
covered by the deed of trust which, as discussed above, requires Plaintiff to
notify Defendant (as an alleged successor to the Lender) of the alleged breach.
(FAC, Exhibit A, ¶ 20.) The court declines to develop Defendant’s other
arguments as to how Plaintiff’s claim for estoppel fails.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the third cause of action.
 
Fourth Cause of
Action – Negligence
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently
allege duty and damages. As to duty in particular, Defendant contends that
Plaintiff’s claim is barred by the economic loss rule because the parties here
are lender and borrower and Plaintiff did not allege conduct by Defendant intended
to harm Plaintiff warranting an exception. Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition.
 
A claim for negligence requires: (1) a legal duty owed to plaintiffs
to use due care; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) 
 
The
same analysis for the third cause of action applies here because Plaintiff
alleges breach of a duty owed under the deed of trust. (FAC ¶ 33.)
 
Accordingly,
the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action.
 
Fifth Cause of
Action – Fraudulent Misrepresentation
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to plead fraud with
specificity and plead statements that truthfully described the process to
reverse the forced placed insurance. Additionally, Defendant contends Plaintiff
failed to plead a causal connection between the alleged misrepresentation and
harm and Plaintiff has no damages because his account was credited. Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition.
“The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or 'scienter'); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court¿(1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 638.)¿¿ 
“In
California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations
do not suffice…this particularity requirements necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were tenders.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645; Cansino v. Bank of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469; Perlas v. GMAC Mort., LLC (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 429, 434
[requiring plaintiffs who claim fraud against a corporation to allege the names
of the persons who made the misrepresentations, their authority to speak for
the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was
said or written.]) Fraud allegations need not be liberally construed, general
pleading of the legal conclusion of fraud is insufficient, and every element of
the cause of action for fraud must be alleged fully, factually and
specifically. (Wilhelm v. Pray, Price,
Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal. App. 3d 1324, 1331.)¿ 
The same analysis as the third cause of action applies here.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action.
 
Sixth Cause of
Action – Negligent Misrepresentation
 
Defendant contends this claim fails because there was no
duty and Plaintiff failed to otherwise sufficiently plead the requisite
elements.[2]
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
The elements of a claim for negligent misrepresentation are
(1) the defendant made a false representation as to a past or existing material
fact; (2) the defendant made the representation without reasonable ground for
believing it to be true; (3) in making the representation, the defendant
intended to deceive the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the
representation; and (5) the plaintiff suffered resulting damages. (Majd v. Bank of America, N.A. (2015) 243
Cal.App.4th 1293, 1307; National Union
Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Penn. V. Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50.) As in negligence, there is also a requirement
that legal duty exists imposed by statute, contract, or otherwise. (Bock v. Hansen (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
215, 228.) This is a question of law. (Ibid.)
Fraud and negligent misrepresentation must be pleaded with particularity, which
means the pleading “must set forth how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
the representations were made.” (SI 59
LLC v. Variel Warner Ventures, LLC (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 146, 155; Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th
170, 184-185, fn. 14; see Foster v.
Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1028 [citing Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.])  
 
The same analysis as the third cause of action applies here.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the sixth cause of action.
 
 
Seventh Cause of
Action – Fraudulent Promise Without Intention to Perform
 
Defendant did not directly include argument here. It appears
to the court, however, that this claim is substantially identical to the fourth
cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation. As such, the same analysis
applies. 
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action.
 
Eighth Cause of
Action – Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff failed to allege that he
suffered monetary or property loss as a result of the alleged conduct and that
he failed to allege he did not cause the alleged conduct by failing to allege
he provided proof of insurance prior to Defendant instituted the forced placed
insurance. Additionally, Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to allege
unlawful conduct. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
 
California Business and Professions Code section 17200
prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17200; see Clark v.
Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610.) A business practice is unfair
when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,
unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to
consumers." (Community Assisting
Recovery, Inc. v. Aegis Security Ins. Co. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 886, 894.)
A business practice is unlawful if it violates another law. (Berryman v. Merit Property Management, Inc.
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554.) A business practice is fraudulent if
“members of the public are likely to be deceived." (See Wang v. Massey Chevrolet (2002) 97 Cal. App. 4th 856, 871.) “A
plaintiff alleging unfair business practices . . . must state with reasonable
particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the violation.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)¿ 
 
The same analysis as the third cause of action applies here.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the eighth cause of action.
 
Ninth Cause of
Action – Accounting
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to allege
misconduct justifying an accounting when he is not owed any money. Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition.
 
“A cause of action for accounting requires a showing of a
relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, such as a fiduciary
relationship, that requires an accounting or a showing that the accounts are so
complicated they cannot be determined through an ordinary action at law.”
(Fleet v. Bank of America N.A. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1413.) “‘An action
for accounting is not available where the plaintiff alleges the right to
recover a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by calculation.’” (Id.
(quoting Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 179).) 
 
“The right to an accounting can arise from the possession by
the defendant of money or property which, because of the defendant’s
relationship with the plaintiff, the defendant is obliged to surrender.” (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 156, 179-80.)
 
The same analysis as the third cause of action applies here.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to
the ninth cause of action.
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend should be liberally
granted if there is a reasonable possibility an amendment could cure the
defect.¿ (County of Santa Clara v.
Superior Court (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018,1035.)¿ The Plaintiff has the
burden of demonstrating that leave to amend should be granted, and that the
defects can be cured by amendment. (“Plaintiff must show in what manner he can
amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his
pleading.” (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 349).
 
Here, Plaintiff has not requested leave to amend from the
court.[3]
However, in an exercise of caution, the court will allow Plaintiff to present
oral argument at the hearing. The court is inclined to deny leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Verified Complaint is SUSTAINED in its entirety.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
