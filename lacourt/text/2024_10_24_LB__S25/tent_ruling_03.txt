(June 21, 2024 Notice of Settlement.) On September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed four Petitions to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim for Fernando Aguilar Montes, Angel Lucas Montes, Joseph Lucas Montes and Josie Lucas Montes, respectively, and one Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise with Special Needs Trust for Edgar Rosalino Rosas Montes.Legal Standard“The guardian or conservator of the estate or guardian ad litem so appearing for any minor, person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions . . . has been appointed shall have power, with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, to compromise the same, to agree to the order or judgment to be entered therein for or against the ward or conservatee, and to satisfy any judgment or order in favor of the ward or conservatee or release or discharge any claim of the ward or conservatee pursuant to that compromise.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(3).) “A petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a covenant not to sue or enforce judgment on, a minor's disputed claim; a compromise or settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or person with a disability is a party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment for a minor or person with a disability under Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600-3613 or Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the petition must be submitted on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form MC-350).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)A court approving a minor and/or person with a disability’s compromise will order and direct payment of reasonable expenses – including attorney’s fees out of the total settlement amount. (Prob. Code, § 3601.) Under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(1), the Court “must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.” Also, the court must give weight to the terms of any existing representation agreement. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) Other non-exclusive factors to consider include: (1) the fact that a person with a disability is involved, and her particular circumstances; (2) the length and nature of representation; and (3) the time and labor required. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b)(1-14).) “The rule permits, but does not require, the court to allow attorney’s fees in an amount specified in a contingency fee agreement. The amount of attorney’s fees allowed by the court must meet thereasonableness standard of section 3601 no matter how they are determined.” (Advisory Com. Comment to rule 7.955.)“If a court makes an order under Section 3602 or 3611 that money of a minor or person with a disability be paid to a special needs trust, the terms of the trust shall be reviewed and approved by the court and shall satisfy the requirements of this section. The trust is subject to continuing jurisdiction of the court, and is subject to court supervision to the extent determined by the court. The court may transfer jurisdiction to the court in the proper county for commencement of a proceeding as determined under Section 17005.” (Prob. Code, § 3604, subd. (a)(1).)“In any case described in Section 3610, the court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600 shall, upon application of counsel for the minor or person with a disability, order any one or more of the following…: (c) After a hearing by the court, that the remaining balance of any money and other property be paid to a special needs trust established under Section 3604 for the benefit of the minor or person with a disability. Notice of the time and place of the hearing and a copy of the petition shall be mailed to the State Director of Health Care Services, the Director of State Hospitals, and the Director of Developmental Services at the office of each director in Sacramento at least 15 days before the hearing.” (Prob. Code, § 3611, subd. (c).)A special needs trust may be established and continued under this section only if the court determines all of the following:(1) That the minor or person with a disability has a disability that substantially impairs the individual’s ‘ability to provide for the individual’s own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap.(2) That the minor or person with a disability is likely to have special needs that will not be met without the trust.(3) That money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the special needs of the minor or person with a disability.(Prob. Code, § 3604, subd. (b)(1)-(3).) Payment of all statutory liens in favor of certain state and local agencies that have rendered assistance to the minor or incompetent is a prerequisite to creation of the trust. (Prob. Code, § 3604, subd. (d).)AnalysisPetition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim for FERNANDO AGUILAR MONTESThe Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds that the settlement itself is fairand reasonable.

(b), in order to approve the request to establish and fund a Special Needs Trust the Court must make the following findings:1) That the person (who will be named as the beneficiary of the trust) has a disability which substantially impairs the person’s ability to provide for the individual's own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap2) That the person with a disability is likely to have special needs thatwill not be met without the trust3) That the money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the special needs of the person with a disability.The Court has made these findings herein, and therefore, the analysis of the petition turns to whether the proposed trust instrument complies with the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903 and Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 4.116 for trusts established and/or funded by court order. The proposed trust instrument complies with the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903 and Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 4.116.Prob. Code, § 3602, subd.

The Court cannot find documentation indicating that Plaintiff provided such notice.Tentative RulingPlaintiffs’ counsel may submit proof of service in compliance with Prob. Code, § 3602(f) prior to the hearing. Or, if no notice was given, to rectify this omission, the Court is inclined to continue the hearing for a period of no more than 30 days for Plaintiffs’ counsel to provide notice to the State Director of Health Care Services, the Director of State Hospitals, and the Director of Developmental Services at the office of each director in Sacramento.
