 Case Number:  24LBCV00413    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  S25 Plaintiff Ruben Rodriguez-Ponce’s Motion to Deem Admitted the Truth of the Matters in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, to Defendant Jose Luis Tenorio, and Request for Monetary SanctionsProcedural HistoryOn February 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Jose Luis Tenorio, Beacon Funding Corporation, Inner State Towing, LLC, and Does 1 to 10, alleging a sole cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants were negligent and caused Plaintiff injuries on August 26, 2022 at E. 7th Street and Orange Ave., City of Long Beach, CA. (Compl., at p. 4.) On March 29, 2024, Defendants Jose Luis Tenorio and Inner State Roadside Assistance, LLC filed an answer to the complaint. On May 1, 2024, Defendant Beacon Funding Corporation filed a general denial. On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for an order deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted. As of October 18, 2024, no opposition has been filed.Legal StandardIf a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product . . . . The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)AnalysisOn May 3, 2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Admissions, Set One, on Defendant Tenorio. Defendant failed to respond by the June 5, 2024 deadline. (Knypstra Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5, Ex. 1.) Although not required to meet and confer prior to filing a motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to obtain discovery multiple times, on June 18, 25, July 11, 25, 30 of this year. (Knypstra Decl., ¶¶ 7-14, Exs. 2-8.) Despite Defendant Tenorio’s counsel stating that he would provide an update on the efforts made to obtain responses, no update was provided and no response to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, has been served. (Knypstra Decl., ¶ 15.)No opposition has been filed by Defendant.Tentative RulingThe motion is GRANTED and all matters specified in Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted. Because Defendant did not file an opposition, the Court removes the 1 hour that Plaintiff’s counsel anticipates spending on preparing a reply to Defendant’s opposition. The Court awards monetary sanctions of $2,450.00 in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel jointly, payable within 30 days of this order.Plaintiff Ruben Rodriguez-Ponce’s Motion to Compel Defendant Jose Luis Tenorio to Respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Monetary SanctionsLegal StandardIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all objections.¿¿On motion, a party may be relieved from its waiver of objections if: (1) the party subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance “with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240” and (2) “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c), provides that, "[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (d), provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (h), states that a misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)AnalysisIn the instant motion, Plaintiff states that Form Interrogatories, Set One, was served on Defendant on May 3, 2024, and that Plaintiff failed to respond by the June 5, 2024 deadline. (Knypstra Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff asserts that although not required to meet and confer prior to filing a motion to compel initial responses, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to obtain discovery multiple times, on June 18, 25, July 11, 25, 30 of this year. (Knypstra Decl., ¶¶ 7-14, Exs. 2-8.) Despite Defendant’s counsel stating that he would provide an update on the efforts made to obtain responses, no update was provided and no response to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, has been served. (Knypstra Decl., ¶ 15.)Tentative RulingThe motion is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide objection-less responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days from the date of the hearing. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions against Defendant in this instance; however, further continued failure by Defendant to timely respond to discovery requests or engage in the discovery process may result in future monetary sanctions.Plaintiff Ruben Rodriguez-Ponce’s Motion to Compel Defendant Jose Luis Tenorio to Respond to Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set One, and Request for Monetary SanctionLegal StandardIf a party to whom document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion.

Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c), provides that, "[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust."
