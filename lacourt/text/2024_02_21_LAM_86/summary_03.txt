And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge sustains the demurrer to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, dismissing the petition for writ of mandate, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. The Judge finds that the Respondents, Terence Newman and Priscillia Hernandez, are the registered owners of the dog, and that Petitioner, Niloufar Ghafouri, has not alleged sufficient facts to create a factual dispute concerning ownership. The Judge also finds that Petitioner has not complied with the Los Angeles Municipal Code section 53.09, which requires the finder of a lost dog to notify the Department of Animal Services and surrender the dog to them within 30 days. As a result, the Judge does not grant leave to amend the petition, as there is no reasonable possibility that the defects can be cured by amendment.
