[1] All undesignated statutory references are to this
code.


[2] For facts not disputed by the parties, the court may quote
directly from the administrative decision (AR 13633-13736) or to the
unpublished Court of Appeal decision granting Tarkington’s petition for writ of
habeas corpus (In re Tarkington (2017) 2017 WL 4707964 [In re
Tarkington]).  


[3] As discussed infra, Petitioner contends the
Board should not have considered or relied upon Tarkington’s prior robbery
conviction. (Opening Brief 12:18-19.) However, Petitioner has not disputed the
accuracy of the Board’s summary of this evidence.


[4] As summarized in the Board’s decision and the State’s
opposition, other evidence was submitted during the habeas evidentiary
hearings. (AR 13666-13676.) Where relevant to this court’s ruling on the
petition, such evidence is discussed in the Analysis section infra.  


[5] MAAQ refers to “methylamino anthraquinone . . . which
is a chemical used in bank red dye packs.” (AR 376; see also AR 385,
4258.)  


[6] “Officer and Recurrent Witness Information Tracking
System (ORWITS) is a database used to track and alert prosecuting deputy
district attorneys of information that may discredit testifying Department
members.” (Opening Brief 5, fn. 1.)


[7] Petitioner has not cited any
misstatements of the applicable standard in the Board’s decision.


[8] Thus, Petitioner’s arguments concerning the standard of proof
are actually a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Board’s
findings. The court reviews the Board’s findings for substantial evidence infra.  


[9] Gonzales was decided on December 29, 2023,
after Board filed its opposition and the same day Real Party filed its
opposition, and a full month before Petitioner filed her replies on January 29,
2024.  Petitioner did not cite or address
Gonzales in reply, even though the decision is highly relevant to the
question of which parts of In re Tarkington were binding on the
Board.  In any event, while Gonzales is
helpful guidance, the court has not found it to be dispositive to any issue.
Counsel may address Gonzales at the hearing.
