Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment against the defendant, Andrew Hanna, in the amount of $987,617.22. The plaintiff, Hunt Capital Partners, LLC, is seeking to enforce a guaranty agreement against Hanna, who is a natural person. The guaranty agreement was executed in October 2019 and was intended to guarantee the payment of loans made by the plaintiff to LBB Housing Investors, L.P. and SF Eddy Housing Investors L.P.

The judge found that the plaintiff has shown a probably valid claim against Hanna and that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim. The judge also found that the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.

The defendant, Hanna, raised several defenses, including claims that the plaintiff lacks standing to enforce the guaranty agreement, that the plaintiff failed to pursue or exhaust its remedies against the borrowers, and that the plaintiff committed intentional or negligent misrepresentation. However, the judge found that these defenses were not supported by sufficient evidence and were therefore not valid.

The judge denied the defendant's claim of exemption and ordered the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000. The writ of attachment shall be limited to the items specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 487.010, subdivisions (c) and (d).
