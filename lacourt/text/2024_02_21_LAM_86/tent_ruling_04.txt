[1] On its own motion, the court judicially notices LAMC section
53.09.


[2] Petitioner does argue: “Since when does the animal
shelter tell a person who has paid for, chipped, and adopted a dog to give it
back?” (Opposition 2:28.) To be sure, Petitioner does not allege she “adopted”
the dog—she alleges she is the rightful owner “having properly registered [the
dog] with all appropriate government agencies, and added her information to his
microchip.” (FAP ¶ 18.) Nothing suggests Petitioner
adopted the dog through any of the City’s animal shelters.


[3] Petitioner also does not allege the City currently has
possession of the dog. Rather, Petitioner indicates Respondents have possession
of the dog. (FAP ¶¶ 21, 31.) If the City does not have possession of the dog as
alleged, the City cannot be compelled by mandate to “return” the dog.
