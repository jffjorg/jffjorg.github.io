And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by Petitioner, who is challenging the decision of the Board. The Board had considered Tarkington's prior robbery conviction in its decision, and Petitioner argues that the Board should not have done so. The judge has reviewed the evidence presented during the habeas evidentiary hearings and has not found any misstatements of the applicable standard in the Board's decision. The judge will review the Board's findings for substantial evidence. The judge also notes that a recent decision in Gonzales is relevant to the issue, but it is not dispositive to any issue. The judge intends to discuss Gonzales at the hearing and invites counsel to address it.
