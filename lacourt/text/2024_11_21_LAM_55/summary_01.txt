Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the petitions for approval of the compromise of claims or actions for minors Nevaeh Ochoa and Nyla Ochoa. The proposed settlement is for $135,000, with $134,000 going to Petitioner Charquinta Ochoa and $500 each to the minor plaintiffs. The judge finds that the minors' share of the settlement is not reasonable and fails to adequately compensate them. The judge also expresses concern that the settlement does not account for attorney's fees and that the proposed arrangement for paying attorney's fees from Petitioner's share of the recovery is not acceptable.
