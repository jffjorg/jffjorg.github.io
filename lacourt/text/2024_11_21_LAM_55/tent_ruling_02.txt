 Case Number:  23STCV04789    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDING: Defendant 600 Tower, LLC’s (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, and Sanctions; (2)
Motion to Deem Requested Matters Admitted as to Plaintiff, and Sanctions; and
(3) Motion to Compel Responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, and
Sanctions. 
 
In this habitability case, Defendant 600 Tower, LLC has filed
motions to compel discovery responses to its document requests, form and special
interrogatories, and for an order for requests for admission to be deemed
admitted. Defendant requests sanctions for each of the three motions. 
Defendant’s motion to compel regarding the requests for
admission is set for hearing on 11/21/2024. Defendant’s motions to compel
responses to the document requests and interrogatories are set for hearing on
11/22/2024, however, the Court advances the hearing on those motions to
11/21/2024 and considers those motions in this tentative along with the motion
regarding the requests for admission.
As set forth in Defendant’s motions, Plaintiff Eja
Haynespolke did not serve responses to the discovery requests served on Plaintiff
on 3/26/2024.  Defendant filed its
motions to compel such responses on 10/17/2024, seven months after Defendant
served the discovery requests. In addition to not responding to the discovery, Plaintiff
did not file an opposition to the motions. 
The motions to compel are granted. Defendant shall serve
verified responses, without objections, to the document requests and
interrogatories, by 5 p.m. 12/2/2024. The requests for admission are deemed
admitted. 
Defendant seeks $1,425.00 in sanctions for each of the three
motions. The Court exercises its discretion to reduce the sanctions for each
motion to $550 because the requested sanctions sought by Defendant includes
time spent reviewing and responding to Plaintiff’s opposition and appearing at
a hearing on this matter. Given the lack of opposition and straightforward nature
of the motions, the Court determines that $550 per motion ($1,650 total) is
reasonable and awards $1,650 to Defendant in discovery sanctions.
