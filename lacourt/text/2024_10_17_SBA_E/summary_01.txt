Summary:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment, holding that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the existence of a triable, material factual issue as to causation. The judge finds that the stopped escalator did not constitute a dangerous condition, and that the plaintiff's testimony does not establish causation. The judge also holds that Schindler did not own or control the premises, and that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists as to possession of the premises and the right to control and manage the premises.
