And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to deem the Defendant's responses to the requests for admission admitted. The Plaintiff had served the requests for admission on the Defendant via mail on July 3, 2024, and sent a letter requesting responses by August 30, 2024, but the Defendant failed to respond. The Judge found that the Plaintiff was entitled to an order deeming the requests for admission admitted against the Defendant, citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.250 and 2033.280. The Judge also noted that sanctions would be mandatory if the Defendant had not acted with substantial justification, but since the Plaintiff did not request sanctions, the Court did not award any. The Plaintiff is to give notice of the order.
