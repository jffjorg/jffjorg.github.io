BACKGROUND
On
May 17, 2024, Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Julie
C. Welch (“Defendant”). The complaint asserts a causes of action for Common
Counts seeking damages of $40,250.99 for an open book account for money due by
Defendant.
 
On
June 24, 2024, Defendant filed a general denial. 
 
September
19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion. 
 
No
opposition was filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
Legal
Standard
A
party must respond to requests for admissions within 30 days after service of
such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)  “If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response…(a)
[that party] waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) “The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at
subd. (b).)  A motion dealing with the failure to respond, rather than
with inadequate responses, does not require the requesting party to meet and
confer with the responding party. (Deymer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4 [disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973]. There is no time limit within which
a motion to have matters deemed admitted must be made. (Brigante v. Huang
(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1585.)  
 
Here,
Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming its Request for Admissions, Set One,
admitted. Plaintiff served Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant via mail
on July 3, 2024. (Parks Declaration, ¶ 2; Exh. 1.) Plaintiff sent a letter to
Defendant on August 20, 2024 requesting responses by August 30, 2024 and
notifying Defendant that a motion to deem the requests admitted would follow if
responses were not received. (Parks Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 2.) As of the date this
Motion was filed, Plaintiff has not received any responses. (Parks Decl., ¶ 3.)
Defendant did not oppose this motion. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
deeming the Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against Defendant. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
 
Sanctions
Sanctions
are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem matters specified in a
request for admissions as true and motions to compel responses to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c).)¿¿
 
Here,
sanctions would be mandatory because Defendant failed to serve timely responses
to Plaintiff’s RFAs.  However, Plaintiff did not request sanctions and as
such did not provide an accounting of time or an hourly rate. Thus, the Court
does not award sanctions to Plaintiff.   
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion
to deem Request for Admissions admitted as to Defendant.  
 
            Plaintiff is to give notice.
