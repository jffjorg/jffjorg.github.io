BACKGROUND
 
             On February 28,
2023, Plaintiff Jessica Margarita Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendant JCKY Property Investment, LLC (“Defendant”). On May 19, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant, the same
day as a demurrer was filed by Defendant to the original complaint.  On June 22, 2023, the Court overruled the
demurrer to the original complaint on the ground that the FAC had been
filed.  On October 9, 2023, Defendant
filed an answer to the FAC.On April 2, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for
judgment on the pleadings (the “MJP”) to the FAC, but the proof of service
thereon was improper, and the MJP was denied, without prejudice.  On July 2, 2024, Defendant filed a second MJP,
which was granted on August 8, 2024, with thirty days leave to amend.  Plaintiff therefore was allowed until
September 9, 2024 to file a third amended complaint.  She failed to do so.  
 
DISCUSSION
 
A
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings where the court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint or the complaint does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that
defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(1)(B).)  A
non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before
or during trial.  (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100
Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)  
 
“A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is subject to the same rules governing
demurrers.”  (Hardy v. America’s Best Home Loans (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 795, 802.)  “Like a demurrer, the grounds for the motion must
appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the
court is required to take judicial notice and the [cross-complainant’s]
allegations are accepted as true.”  (Id.)  “A motion for
judgment on the pleadings may be brought . . .  on the grounds the [cross]
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.”  (Id.)  In the context of a motion
for judgment on the pleadings a court “accept[s] as true the
[cross-complainant’s] factual allegations and construe[s] them
liberally.”  (Stevenson Real Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis
Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1220.)   
Here, Defendant contends
Plaintiff’s FAC fails to plead sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action.  In fact, there is no operative
complaint in this case, as Plaintiff failed to file a second amended complaint within
the time allowed by the Court. Pursuant to Section 438((i)(1)(B), if no amended
pleading is filed, then the party shall move for entry of judgment in its
favor.  As no opposition to this motion
for judgment on the pleadings, the motion is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to submit a proposed
Judgment in its favor to the Court within twenty (20) days of the date of this
Order.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
