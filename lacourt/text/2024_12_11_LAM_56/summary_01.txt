And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to plead sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The judge accepted the defendant's allegations as true and construed them liberally. The plaintiff failed to file a third amended complaint within the time allowed by the court, and therefore, the FAC is considered an operative complaint. The judge found that the FAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant and granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant is ordered to submit a proposed judgment in its favor to the court within 20 days.
