MOVING PARTY: Petitioner
J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: None.

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Petitioner has filed a petition for approval
of transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights (the “Petition”) belonging
to Real Party-in-Interest/Transferor Gilbert Becerrada (“Transferor” or “Payee”).
Specifically, Petitioner seeks the transfer of $149,688.10 in future annuity
payments belonging to Transferor which span payments to be paid between February
2037 and October 2041, the present discounted value of which is $83,834.46, to be
transferred in exchange for a $42,000.00 lump sum payment to Transferor. 
            
            The Petition was filed on September
30, 2024. The amended petition (the “Amended Petition”) was filed on November
15, 2024. 
 
On October 1, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice
of hearing for December 11, 2024. That same day, Petitioner filed a proof of
service via mail and email. The filing evidences service of the notice of
hearing, verified Petition, notice of case assignment, declaration of payee and
proof of service on Transferor, the annuity issuer and the annuity obligor. 
 
On October 29, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice
to the settlement attorney of record. 
 
On November 26, 2024, Petitioner filed an
amended declaration in support of Petitioner’s Amended Petition. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A transfer of structured settlement payment rights is void unless a court
reviews and approves the transfer and finds that (a) the transfer of the
structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and in the best
interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of his or
her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies with the requirements of
Insurance Code (“Ins. Code”) sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not contravene
other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved the transfer
as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds. (a)-(b).)
 


 
Section 10136
Requirements
            No direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies
shall be effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer
shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee,
unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of the Insurance Code are
satisfied. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)
 
            The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10136 as follows (Ins. Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e)): 
            
            First, the transfer agreement
satisfies the disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section
10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer agreement is accompanied by a
disclosure addressed to Transferor and the disclosure contains all the statutorily
required language of section 10136, subdivision (b).) (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California
Purchase Contract, § 10.)
 
Second, the
transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase
Contract, §§ 2 [amount and due date of payment rights to be sold], 10
[remaining requirements].)
 
Third, the
transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of the contents
prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer agreement.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase
Contract.)
 
Fourth, Transferor
has not sought cancellation of the transfer agreement as of the date of this
hearing. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e); Amended Decl. of Payee ¶ 13.)
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds that Petitioner’s proposed transfer of Transferor’s settlement
rights satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136, subdivisions
(a) through (e).
 
Section 10139.5
Requirements
A direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured
settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment
directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement payment rights
unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a final court order based
on express written findings by the court subject to Section 10139.5. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)
 
            Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)
The petition
satisfies the entirety of the findings requirement set out in Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the Court
expressly makes by the following language, are that: 
 
(1) The transfer
is fair and reasonable in the best interests of Payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of Payee’s dependents. Transferor is collecting $42,000.00
for future payment of $149,688.10, the discounted present value of which is
$83,834.46. Payee is a married, unemployed thirty-four-year-old with one
five-year-old child, is experiencing financial hardship and would use the
transfer funds to buy vehicles for himself and his wife. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see also Amended
Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase Contract, ¶ 10; Amended Decl. of Payee ¶¶ 8,
11.)
(2) Payee has been advised in writing to
seek independent professional advice regarding
the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived, in
writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California
Purchase Contract [Payee was advised to obtain independent legal advice and
professional tax advice about the sale of the Purchased Payments]; Amended
Decl. of Payee, ¶ 12 [“I did not receive independent legal or financial advice
regarding the proposed transaction. A copy of the waiver is attached to Exhibit
‘E’ of the petition.”].)
 
            (3) Petitioner has complied with the
notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), has
provided Payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136 and the
transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); Ins.
Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e) discussion supra & Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f) discussion infra at “Second, …” & Amended
Petition Ex. A, California Purchase Contract.)
 
            (4) The transfer does not contravene
any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            (5)
Payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set
forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(5); Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 13 [“I understand the terms of
the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure
statement …”].)
 
(6) Payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the right to cancel the transfer
agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 13 [“I
… do not wish to exercise my right to cancel the agreement”].)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)
            Except
as noted below, the Amended Petition satisfies all the Payee information
required from Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows ((Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)):
 
(1) Included the
Payee’s name and age. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(1); Amended Decl. of
Payee, p. 1:19-20 [Gilbert Becerrada] & [34 years old].)
 
(2) Included the
Payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of Payee’s
spouse. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(2); Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 8 [“I am
married and my spouse’s name is Ana Maria Becerrada.”].)
 
(3) Included the
names, ages, and place or places of residence of Payee’s minor children or
other dependents, if any. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(3); Amended Decl. of
Payee, ¶ 8 [“one minor child”; “G.B. Jr.”; “5 years old”].)
 
(4) Included the
amounts and sources of Payee’s monthly income and financial resources. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 8 [“I am unemployed.”].)

 
The Court notes
that there is nothing in the declaration about the
amounts and sources of the monthly income and financial resources of Payee’s
spouse. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4).) The Court would accept
sworn testimony on this point at the time of the hearing. 
 
 
 
(5) Included
information permitting the determination of whether Payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)(5); Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 8 [“I am married…”; “I do not
have any court-ordered child support obligations”].) The Court notes that there is nothing in the
declaration specifying that Payee has no obligation for spousal support. The
Court would accept sworn testimony to that effect at the time of the hearing. 
 
(6) Included
information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described
in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring
information only for petitions in last five years]; Amended
Decl. of Payee, ¶¶ 9-10 [three prior petitions since February 2024, two
approved, with case numbers and transfer information provided].)

 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
            The
amended petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)
as follows (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)):
 
First, the
transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision
(f)(1), because Petitioner made the instant Petition and the Petition was
brought in the county in which the Payee resides. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(1); Amended Petition, p. 1 [showing
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth brings
this Petition]; Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 1 [“I reside in Los Angeles County,
California”].)
 
            Second,
the Petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(2).
 
            Formal notice of this transfer and a
copy of the Petition itself were filed by Petitioner with the Court and served
on all interested parties no later than November 21, 2024—i.e., original
Petition, notice, Amended Petition, declaration in support of Petitioner’s
Petition, notice of case assignment, and proof of service were served on
Transferor, the annuity issuer, and the annuity obligor. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2) [notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its
authorization to be filed with the court and served on all interested parties
within 20 days of hearing]; see also 10/01/24 Proof of Service.) While the
amended declaration in support of Petitioner’s Petition was not filed until
November 26, 2024—i.e., 15 days prior to this hearing—the amended declaration
makes only minor changes and no opposition appears on the record. Based on
these circumstances, the Court proceeds with a determination on the merits. 
 
Further, the notice and Petition have
attached all the necessary documents required from this subdivision. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and petition are required to:

 
(A) Include a
copy of the instant petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside
of five years from the date of this petition. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(A) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is
framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information
about petitions in last five years]; Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶¶ 9-10 [three
prior petitions since February 2024, two approved, with case numbers and
transfer information provided].)
 
(B) Include a
copy of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(B);
Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase Contract &, Ex. B, California
Disclosure Statement.)
 
(C) Include
information regarding Transferor’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); Amended Decl. of Payee ¶ 8 [married; one minor child,
age five years].)
 
(D) Include a
copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); Amended Petition, Ex. B, California
Disclosure Statement.)
 
(E) Include
copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and
underlying structured settlement agreement, if available, and if not available,
a showing of reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document
have been made, including making inquiry with Payee. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); Amended Petition, Exs. C & D, ¶ 9 [“I have attempted
to locate the Annuity Contract and have been unsuccessful”; “I have attempted
to locate the Qualified Assignment and have been unsuccessful”; I have
attempted to locate the Settlement Agreement and have been unsuccessful”.)
 
(F) Include
copies of the proofs of service made for notice of this petition. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); 10/01/24 Proof of Service.)
(G) Include a
notification that any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or
otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel,
by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in the hearing.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(J); Amended Petition, p. 5; 10/01/24 Proof
of Service.)
 
(H) Include a
notification of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the
manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition must be
filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s
notice, in order to be considered by the court. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(K); Amended Petition, p. 5; 10/01/24 Proof of Service.)
 
(I) If Payee
entered into the structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the
date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide notice to the
payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement was created,
if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the attorney’s
address on file with the State Bar of California. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(L); 10/29/24 Notice to the Settlement Attorney of Record.)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g)
The Petition satisfies the requirements of
Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees bear the costs of
transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (g); Amended Petition, Ex. A,
California Purchase Contract [“We have charged [Gilbert Becerrada] for
the following expenses: [¶] … $0.00 [¶] for a total of $0.00 in expenses”] & Ex. B, California Disclosure
Statement, p. 1 [same].)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h)
The amended petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (h) because, when the petition was
filed, Petitioner advised Transferor of his right to seek independent counsel
and financial advice in connection with this transfer petition and advised Transferor
of his right to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h); Amended Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract [Gilbert Becerrada was advised to receive independent
representation and elected not to seek out such independent professional
representation]; Amended Decl. of Payee, ¶ 12 [“I did not receive independent
legal or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. A copy of the
waiver is attached to Exhibit ‘E’ of the petition.”].)
 
Requirements
Conclusion
            The
Court seeks (1) information about the
amounts and sources of the monthly income and financial resources of Transferor’s
spouse and (2) confirmation that Transferor has no spousal support obligations.
 
If satisfactory sworn

of Payment Rights will be GRANTED.
