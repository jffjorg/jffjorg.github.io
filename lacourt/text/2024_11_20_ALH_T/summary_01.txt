And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel an independent medical examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff allegedly suffered a significant injury to his hand in a car accident and was demanded to undergo an independent medical examination with Ross Nathan, M.D. However, the plaintiff failed to appear for two scheduled medical examinations, despite the defendants' accommodations and attempts to reschedule. The judge found that the plaintiff's repeated failure to appear for medical examinations prevented the defendants from conducting a medical examination they were entitled to, and thus granted the motion.

The judge also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $2,000. This includes $800 for the first medical examination, $1,140 for attorney fees, and a $60 filing fee. The judge found that six hours of time was reasonable for the defendants' work on this motion.

The judge ordered that the independent medical examination be completed within 45 days of the order.
