 Case Number:  21STCV43897    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Compel ProductionCase Name: Shahid Shaikh v. Sandra Min Cha, et al.Moving Party: Defendants Sandra Min Cha; Mimi ChaResponding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDOn February 22, 2024 Defendants served an initial set of written discovery on Plaintiff Shahid Shaikh (“Plaintiff”), including a Request for Production of Documents, Set One (“Requests”) (Fierro Decl. ¶¶4, 5; Exhibit 1.) To date, Defendants have received no response to their discovery or any contact from Plaintiff regarding the outstanding discovery request. (Fierro Decl. ¶6.) MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendants argue the Court should grant their motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Defendants’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One, without objections, because Plaintiff’s failure to provide responses prevents Defendants from obtaining legitimate and essential discovery. (Motion to Compel, p. 4.)Defendants additionally request monetary sanctions in the sum of $1,310.00 based on 5 hours of work – 1.5 hours preparing this motion, an anticipated 1.5 hours drafting a reply, and 2 hours to attend the hearing – at a rate of $250.00 per hour, in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. (Motion to Compel, p. 6; Fierro Decl. ¶7.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed to this motion.ANALYSISI.  Motion to Compel DiscoveryCode of Civil Procedure sec. 2031.010 allows a party to propound a written request for document production, to be answered under oath. This discovery may be served by a defendant at any time, without leave of court. (Sec. 2031.020(a).) Written responses to the document production request must also include a statement asserting that the party will comply, that the party cannot comply, or alternatively objecting to the request. (Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210(a).) Responsive documents shall be produced on the date specified in the demand, or other date agreed by the parties. (Section 2031.280(d).) The party propounding the requests for production may extend the time in which responses are provided, confirmed in writing. (Section 2031.270.) A responding party’s failure to serve a timely response will waive any objection to the demand. (Section 2031.300(a). If a party fails to respond to a document production request, the requesting party may move for an order compelling a response. (Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 2031.310(b).) Plaintiff here has failed to provide timely respond to Defendants’ propounded discovery and failed to obtain an extension of time to respond.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to grant Defendants’ motion to compel responses to Defendants’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One. SanctionsDefendants requests sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 based on 5 hours of work bringing the instant motion – 1.5 hours preparing the motion, an anticipated 1.5 hours drafting a reply, and estimated 2 hours attending the hearing – at a rate of $250.00 per hour, in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. (Motion to Compel, p. 7; Fierro Decl. ¶7.)Defendants are entitled to recover the $60 filing fee. Additionally, Defendants’ reported $250.00 hourly rate is reasonable. However, the Court reduces the total number of hours worked from 2.5. While the Court finds Defendants’ asserted 1.5 hours of work preparing the instant motion is reasonable, no opposition has been filed, and thus Defendants’ counsel did not need to review any material or prepare a reply. Moreover, Defendants significantly overestimate the number the hearing on this unopposed motion is likely to take. The Court finds 1 hour is the reasonable anticipated amount of time required to remotely attend the hearing on the instant unopposed motion. The Court accordingly finds sanctions in the amount of $685.00 is appropriate for the reasonable costs incurred in bringing the instant motion.RULINGDefendants’ motion to compel production is GRANTED.  Plaintiff to provide code-compliant responses without objections and document production within 20 days.  Defendants’ request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $685.00.  Sanctions payable within 30 days of this order.
