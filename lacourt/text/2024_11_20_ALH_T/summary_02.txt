And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to their discovery requests without objections. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' initial set of written discovery, including a request for production of documents, and the defendants have received no response or contact from the plaintiff. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond prevents the defendants from obtaining legitimate and essential discovery. The judge grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $685.00, which represents the reasonable costs incurred in bringing the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to provide code-compliant responses to the discovery requests and to produce the requested documents within 20 days.
