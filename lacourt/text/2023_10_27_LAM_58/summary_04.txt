The judge has denied the motion filed by Calhoun & Associates (Judgment Creditor) seeking an order assigning Ocok, LLC (Judgment Debtor) interest in current and future rental income to satisfy the default judgment of $11,290.02 plus interest. The judge found that Judgment Creditor failed to show that Judgment Debtor was properly served with the motion, and that Judgment Creditor lacks evidence of Judgment Debtor's rights and interests in the properties. Additionally, the judge noted that Judgment Creditor did not provide sufficient information about the amount it expects to receive based on the monthly rents to be assigned. As a result, the judge concluded that Judgment Creditor has not satisfied the requirements of California Civil Code of Procedure section 708.510.
