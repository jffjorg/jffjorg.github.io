And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of process brought by Diodes Incorporated. The motion was filed in response to the amended complaint filed by plaintiff Tony Laurita, which named Diodes as a Doe defendant. The judge found that Diodes had demonstrated that the plaintiff knew of its connection to the environmental response action and had relied on public documents to inform the complaint. As a result, the judge concluded that the plaintiff had failed to meet his evidentiary burden to show that he properly named Diodes as a Doe defendant. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's claims against Diodes would be time-barred by the statute of limitations if the Doe substitution were not allowed.
