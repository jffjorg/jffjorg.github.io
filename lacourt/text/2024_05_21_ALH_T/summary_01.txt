And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to reopen expert discovery for the limited purpose of deposing experts. The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident and alleges negligence by the defendants. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has demonstrated a lack of diligence. The plaintiff argues that there was good cause to reopen discovery due to administrative errors and emergencies. The court finds that there was an adequate showing of excusable delay and allows the expert depositions to take place. The motion is granted, and the expert depositions are to be completed by the cut-off date based on the new trial date.
