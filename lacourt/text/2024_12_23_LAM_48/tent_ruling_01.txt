  CASE NO.: 21STCV25928
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 23, 2024



 
Zhana
Azizz, Esq. (FKA Zhana Aivazi), counsel of record for Plaintiffs Simon Cvijanovic
and Marjan Fathi, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that Plaintiffs and
counsel are at an impasse as to how to proceed on the matter and it has created
a breakdown between Plaintiffs and counsel.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until April 28, 2025, and there is
no prejudice to Plaintiffs.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Simon
Cvijanovic, Marjan Fathi, and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 23rd day of December 2024
