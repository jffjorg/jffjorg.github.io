And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the case as to Defendant Maria Cecelia S. Doratan. The ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to serve the defendant within three years of filing the complaint. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted. The court found that the plaintiff's proof of service did not indicate that service was made, and therefore, the court was required to dismiss the action as to the defendant.
