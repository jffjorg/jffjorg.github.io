MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (filed 8/16/2023) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 11,
2019, Plaintiff Lauren Padilla (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Youth Policy Institute, Inc. (“Youth Policy”) and Enrique Rodriguez
(“Rodriguez”).
 
Plaintiff
is a former employee of Defendant Youth Policy.  Youth Policy is in the business
of transforming Los Angeles neighborhoods to reduce poverty, including the
Youth Policy on Western Avenue, where all events alleged in the complaint
occurred.  In June 2016, Defendant Youth Policy hired Plaintiff as a
receptionist.  Plaintiff was later promoted to Program
Assistant/Promotor.  Plaintiff alleges that, in March 2017, she was
diagnosed with chronic migraines.  Because of her disability, Plaintiff
was given special accommodations (i.e., more time to complete paperwork, more
rest breaks, and not forced to do any physical activities).  In July 2017,
Defendant Rodriguez began working for Youth Policy.  Rodriguez allegedly
began a campaign of harassment against Plaintiff by: (1) taking away
Plaintiff’s accommodations, (2) singling Plaintiff out to do tasks that she
could not do in attempt to humiliate and degrade her (e.g., moving heavy boxes
and throwing out heavy bags of garbage); and (3) yelling at, berating, and
embarrassing Plaintiff by making certain derogative comments as well as pushing
her (see Compl., ¶¶ 19-25).  On February 28, 2019, Plaintiff’s employment
was terminated.   
 
The
Complaint alleges causes of action for:  
 
C/A 1:
Against Youth Policy for Disability Discrimination 
C/A 2: Against
Youth Policy for Wrongful Termination  
C/A 3: Against
Youth Policy for Retaliation (GC § 12940(h)) 
C/A 4: Against
Defendants for IIED 
C/A 5: Against
Defendants for Harassment 
 
On
August 16, 2023, counsel for Defendants filed a Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel as to Youth Policy and Rodriguez each. They also filed supporting
declarations and proposed orders.  
 
No
opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.     Discussion
Here,
Defendants’ counsel, Lyne Richardson and Brittney Turner, seek relief under
Code of Civil Procedure, Section 284(2). Counsel correctly completed and filed
the notice (Form MC-051) and declaration (MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2);
Cal. Rules Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In the declaration, counsel
sufficiently explains that this motion is being brought under Section 284(2)
instead of 284(1) because Defendants Rodriguez and Youth Policy have breached a
material term of their Attorney Retainer Agreement concerning fees. Defendants
were provided
with reasonable warning after the breach that undersigned counsel would
withdraw unless Defendants performed their obligations. However, Defendants
have not cured the breach.
Counsel
served the notice (MC-051), the declaration (MC-052), and the proposed order
(MC-053) on Defendants and filed a Proof of Service with the Court. 
The
Court finds all the requirements for relief have been completed. Additionally,
trial has not been scheduled in this case and Defendants have a reasonable
amount of time to obtain new counsel, such that they should not be prejudiced
by the withdrawal.
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is granted.
