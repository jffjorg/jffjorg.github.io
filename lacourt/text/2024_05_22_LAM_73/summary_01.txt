```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Youth Policy Institute, Inc. and Enrique Rodriguez. The defendants' counsel, Lyne Richardson, had filed a motion to withdraw as counsel due to a breach of a material term of the Attorney Retainer Agreement concerning fees. The judge found that all the requirements for relief had been completed and that the defendants had a reasonable amount of time to obtain new counsel, so they would not be prejudiced by the withdrawal.
