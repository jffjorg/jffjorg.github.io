And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Equity Residential Management, LLC, moves to strike three portions of the first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs Tadeh Davtian, Lauren Gordon, and Gabriella Mitry. The plaintiffs seek punitive damages for violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). The defendant argues that the allegations of gross negligence are conclusory and do not rise to the level of the legal standard applicable to recover punitive damages.

The judge finds that the allegations of gross negligence are sufficient to constitute a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings. The plaintiffs allege that Equity knew its process for evaluating potential tenants violated ICRAA, but Equity continued to employ that unlawful process. The judge concludes that reasonable minds could conclude that this conduct constitutes a want of even scant care or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct.

The judge denies the defendant's motion to strike and orders the defendant to answer the first amended complaint within 20 days.
