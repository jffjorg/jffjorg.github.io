And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the case between Daniel Molina and Enrich Estate LLC, et al. The court has overruled Cross-Defendants' demurrer and granted their motion to strike. The case involves allegations of trespass, private nuisance, and declaratory relief.

The court finds that Cross-Defendants' first cause of action for trespass is sufficient, as they have alleged that they purchased the Subject Property and that the alleged trespass occurred during the subsequent period of construction. The court also finds that Cross-Defendants' second cause of action for private nuisance is sufficient, as they have alleged that their conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm and that the alleged nuisance occurred during the relevant time period.

The court also grants Cross-Defendants' motion to strike their request for attorney fees, as they have not pleaded any facts that would show an entitlement to attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
