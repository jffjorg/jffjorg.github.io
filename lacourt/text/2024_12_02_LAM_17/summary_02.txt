Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions. The first motion is from East West Bank, the plaintiff, which seeks reconsideration of the court's previous denial of its motion for terminating sanctions and reconsideration. The court has denied this motion, finding that the plaintiff has not identified any new facts or law that would warrant reconsideration. The second motion is from Jacob O. Partiyeli, the attorney for Gevork Papazian, which seeks to withdraw as counsel. The court has denied this motion, finding that Partiyeli has not provided sufficient explanation for the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and that the motion would result in prejudice to the defendant. The court will adopt this tentative ruling as the final order unless the parties submit a written statement on the tentative by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing.
