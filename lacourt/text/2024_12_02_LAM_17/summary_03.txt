Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and dismiss the action is granted. The defendant, Sahib Transport, Inc., argued that it was improperly served and had no involvement in the accident. The defendant submitted evidence that the truck involved in the lawsuit was registered in New Jersey and that the defendant did not own, operate, or employ the driver named in the lawsuit. The plaintiff, Savannah Danielle Gonzalez, failed to oppose the motion, and the court took this as a concession to the motion on the merits. The court concluded that the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and dismiss the action is valid, and the action will be dismissed.
