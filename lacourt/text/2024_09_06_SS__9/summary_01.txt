Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a complex case between Arthur Sierra, the plaintiff, and the City of Los Angeles, the defendant. The judge has lifted the stay and permitted the defendant to file and serve a responsive pleading by October 21, 2024. The judge has also phased discovery, allowing class certification discovery once the defendant's answer is filed and served, and merits-based discovery after a successful class certification motion. The judge has set deadlines for the class certification motion and settlement notice, and has ordered telephonic conferences to handle discovery motions informally. The judge has also reminded the parties to use model protective orders and to file a notice of related cases if they discover any potentially related cases.
