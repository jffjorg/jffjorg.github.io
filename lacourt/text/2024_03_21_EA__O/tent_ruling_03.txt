DEFENDANTS, MICHELLE PERRAULT’S and MICHELLE PERRAULT
LIVING TRUST’s AND HMR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, INC.’S (collectively, “Defendants”)
MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT is GRANTED with
leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
This is a habitability case. Plaintiffs GERMAN CENTENO;
DANIELLE CENTENO (“Danielle”); SOFIA CENTENO; PRISCILLA CENTENO, a minor by and
through her Guardian ad Litem, DANIELLE CENTENO; AMELIA CENTENO, a minor by and
through her Guardian ad Litem, and ANNALISE CENTENO, a minor by and through her
Guardian ad Litem allege the following against Defendants MICHELE PERRAULT
(“Michelle”); MICHELE PERRAULT, TRUSTEE OF THE MICHELE PERRAULT LIVING TRUST
(“Trust”); HMR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC. (“Management Company”)[1]:
Plaintiffs have been tenants at Michelle’s property July 1, 2013.  Plaintiffs faced two issues at the property:
(1) mold and (2) defective plumbing. The mold problem started on August 30,
2021 and though Michelle sent someone to address the issue, no remediation was
performed such that Plaintiffs’ recent bloodwork results indicated a positive
presence of mold in their system. As to the latter, Plaintiffs experienced
recurrent issues with the upstairs toilet overflowing over the years, causing
leakage through the kitchen ceiling.[2]
On October 13, 2022, Plaintiff Danielle filed a complaint with the Los Angeles
County Health Department; on April 27, 2023, in retaliation, Plaintiffs
received a 60-day Notice of Termination from the Management Company. (See
generally Complaint pp. 1-4.) 
 
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiffs filed suit asserting the
following five causes of action (COAs) against Defendants: 1.    
Negligence 2.    
Tortious
Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability 3.    
Breach
of the Covenant of Quiet Use and Enjoyment 4.    
Retaliation
under Civil Code Section 1942.5 5.    
Constructive
Eviction 
On January 16, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion
to strike (MTS) without a demurrer. 
 
On March 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition. 
 
On March 7, 2024, Defendants filed their reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Defendants bring forth the motion pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 436. In turn, the statute provides that “The Court may,
upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion,
and upon terms it deems proper: (1) Strike out any irrelevant, false or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or
an order of the court.” 
 
As for punitive damages, the defendant
must be guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. (Civ.Code, §
3294.) “He must act with the intent
to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's
rights.” (Silberg v. California Life Insurance Company (1974)
11Cal.3d 452, 462.) “To support an award of
punitive damages on the basis of conscious disregard of the safety of others, a
plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to
avoid those consequences.’” (Penner v. Falk (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 858,
867, quoting Taylor v. Superior Cout (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 895-896.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants seek to strike ¶54:10-18 and the prayer for
relief seeking punitive damages on the grounds “the allegations that defendants
acted maliciously, intentionally, or with conscious disregard for the health
and safety of plaintiffs’ rests squarely on bald legal conclusion, without any
of necessary factual substantiation necessary to support claims for punitive
damages.” (Motion p. 3:22-25.)[3]

 
Here, the pleadings allege
long existing problems with mold which portend harm for the tenants. By
illustration, the problems with mold started on 8/30/2021 and continued for
nearly one year as evidenced by the fact that on 10/19/22, inspection
results showed that mold was found in the subfloor of the hall bathroom.
(Complaint ¶26.) The pleadings also allege that Michelle knew of the
problems as she was the one who was notified on or about 8/30/2021 (¶14);
5/17/22 (¶17); 10/19/22 (¶23); 3/20/23 (¶24).[4]
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the pleadings do not set out that Michelle knew of those
conditions for years, had power to make changes, but failed to take any corrective
and curative measures. (C.f., Penner, supra, 153 Cal.App.3d at pp.
866-867 [punitive damages warranted when within two years before the plaintiff
was assaulted, defendants “were aware that acts of trespass, robbery, burglary,
physical assault, battery and rape had been committed on the premises and in
the apartments. In this same time frame, respondents knew of tenant complaints
that unauthorized persons were often in the building, but respondent refused
to exclude them or prevent their access.”], emphasis added.) 
 
In fact, the very same complaint provides that is
Michelle who took certain measures. For example, she sent a handyman to
address the issue (¶14) and the work remove the mold in the master bathroom was
completed by the time mandated by the county-mandated inspection (¶15,
18). While the problem(s) were not completely repaired, it cannot be
said that Michelle did nothing. 
 
Additionally, the complaint fails to adhere to CCP
section 3294’s requirement that each defendant be liable because here,
Plaintiffs improperly lump allegations against all Defendants. (See e.g.,
Motion p. 6:9-11 [“There is not a single paragraph in the Complaint which
separates the conduct of one defendant from any other defendant. There is no
specific pleading as to any actions directly taken by either defendant against
the plaintiffs.”].) The opposition does not address this point. 
 
Therefore,
the court GRANTS the MTS. As for leave to amend, as Plaintiffs have pled some
facts and under California law, a landlord’s
failure to repair can support a claim for punitive damages (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980)
101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920), the court grants leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion to strike punitive damages is granted WITH leave to
amend.
