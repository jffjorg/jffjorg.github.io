significant_statements:
  - "Without a start date, interpreting any malice—which requires an understanding of the timeline (i.e., whether defendant refused to take action)—makes such allegations insufficient for punitive damages."
  - "Leave to amend should be used to provide additional specific facts as to the plumbing problem."
  - "The court disagrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs have pled no facts. As addressed in Stoiber, Penner, and other cases discussing habitability issues, the failure to remediate issues or address issues is sufficient for pleading actual intent or evil motive by a landlord."
```

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling for a future court hearing. The management company took over on March 23, 2023. There is no specific date provided for when the defective plumbing started, but notifications were sent to Michelle on May 12 and 17, 2022. The judge believes that without a start date, it is difficult to interpret whether the defendant acted with malice, which is necessary for punitive damages. The judge suggests that the plaintiffs should be allowed to amend their claims to provide more specific information about the plumbing problem. The judge disagrees with the defendant's argument that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient facts to support their claims. The judge notes that the failure to remediate issues or address problems can be sufficient evidence of a landlord's intent or evil motive. The judge is considering the Civil Code section 1942.5 and relevant case law, including Stoiber and Penner.
