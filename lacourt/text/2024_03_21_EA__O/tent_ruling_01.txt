  Case Number:  20PSCV00381    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
The City
of El Monte’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED, but upon
filing a new proposed order that reduces attorney fees.  
 
Background
 
This is a
nuisance action. Plaintiff City of El Monte (“Plaintiff”) alleges the following
against Defendants CHUN C. Li and ALICE LI (Li Defendants): In 2019, the city
police executed a search warrant and seized marijuana. On that basis, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants engaged in illegal commercial marijuana activities at
the property.[1]

 
On June 9,
2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint for the ABATEMENT, INJUNCTION, EQUITABLE
RELIEF, AND CIVIL PENALTIES. 
 
On December
31, 2020, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint naming Shi Chang Chen as
Doe 1. 
 
On May 12,
2021, Li Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Chen, who was the tenant on
the property. 
 
On April 27,
2023, Plaintiff dismissed the Li Defendants. 
 
On May 26,
2023, default was entered against Chen.[2]
 
On July 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment, which was denied on
7/14/23.
 
On December
11, 2023, the court denied Plaintiff’s second application for default judgment.

 
On February
27, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application. 
Discussion
 
The court
notes that the City withdrew its request for penalties under its fourth
cause of action for UCL. 
 
That said, the only defect the court observes is with
attorney fees. Previously, in the 7/14/23 ruling, court determined that utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in
view of the totality of the circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the pending motion is $7,500 (i.e., $250/hour for 30 hours). 
 
Should
the City be amenable to the $7,500 amount, the court requests a new JUD-100
form that corrects the amount of attorney fees (reduced from $15,000). 
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the application is GRANTED,
subject to the filing of a new proposed order that reduces attorney fees.
