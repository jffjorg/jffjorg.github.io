[1] The management
company took over on 3/23/23. (¶25.) 
 


[2] There is no specific
date as to when the defective plumbing started. The relevant
dates provided as to defective plumbing are notifications sent on 5/12/22 and
5/17/22 to Michelle regarding the problem. Without a start date, interpreting
any malice—which requires an understanding of the timeline (i.e., whether
defendant refused to take action)—makes such allegations insufficient
for punitive damages. Leave
to amend should be used to provide additional specific facts as to the plumbing
problem. 


[3] Paragraph 54 is found within the 4th
COA for the Retaliation COA under Civil Code section 1942.5. 
 


[4] For this reason, the
court disagrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs have pled no facts. As
addressed in Stoiber, Penner, and other cases discussing habitability
issues, the failure to remediate issues or address issues is sufficient for
pleading actual intent or evil motive by a landlord.
