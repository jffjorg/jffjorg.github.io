```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The City of El Monte's application for default judgment is granted, but only if a new proposed order is filed that reduces the amount of attorney fees. The court notes that the City withdrew its request for penalties under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). The only defect observed by the court is with the amount of attorney fees, which was previously set at $7,500. The court requests that the City submit a new JUD-100 form that corrects the amount of attorney fees, which should be reduced from the initial amount of $15,000.
