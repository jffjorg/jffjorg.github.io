And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Martin Basch, and has granted his motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Jan Alunowski Campbell. The judge found that the plaintiff has failed to comply with discovery requests since at least February 7, 2023, and has failed to respond to a court order. As a result, the judge has ordered the plaintiff's complaint against the defendant to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. The judge has also advanced and vacated the final status conference and jury trial dates. The defendant must give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service.
