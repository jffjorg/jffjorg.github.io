CASE NUMBER:


21STCV22840




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Tax Costs




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Andrew Rosen and Julie Rosen




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Smitty and Gentil, Inc.



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 18, 2021, Plaintiffs Andrew Rosen and Julie Rosen (“Plaintiffs”)
filed a complaint for negligence and premises liability. On April 12, 2022,
Plaintiffs amended the complaint to add Defendant Smitty and Gentil, Inc.
(“Defendant”) as Doe 1. 
 
On August 22, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On September 26, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment. 
 
On September 28, 2023, Defendant filed and served electronically, its
Memorandum of Costs (forms MC-010 and MC-011), claiming $4,432.59 in costs. 
 
Judgment for Defendant was entered on October 24, 2023. 
 
On November 27, 2023, Defendant served and filed notice of the entry
of the order. 
 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to strike
Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs, or in the alternative, Tax Costs. Defendant
opposes and Plaintiffs reply.
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code
Civ. Proc. section 1032, subd. (b).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subd. (c)(2), allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”¿Subdivision (3) requires: “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount.”¿“Items not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) There is no requirement that copies of bills,
invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the
memorandum. Only if the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs
must supporting documentation be submitted. (Bach v. County of Butte
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) 
 
On a motion to tax, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill appear to
be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to
the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision
is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because the right to costs is
governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to award costs not
statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) “The court’s first
determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the item, and
whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting
party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.) The objecting
party does not meet this burden by arguing that the costs were not necessary or
reasonable, but must present evidence and prove that the costs are not
recoverable. (Litt v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiffs argue the memorandum of costs was
prematurely served because it was served before judgment was entered. (Motion, 4.)
“A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs
within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date
of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180
days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a)(1).) Here, judgment was entered on October 24, 2023, but the
memorandum of costs was served on September 28, 2023. However, the premature
filing of a cost memorandum is treated as a mere irregularity at best, and is
not a basis for granting a motion to strike costs absent any prejudice to
plaintiff. (Pamela W. v. Millsom (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 950, 961.) Plaintiffs
do not show that they suffered prejudice due to the premature filing. 
 
Next, Defendant argues this motion is untimely because it was served
on November 29, 2023, 62 days after Defendant served its cost memorandum on
September 28, 2023. “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically,
the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1).) “In the absence of an
agreement, the court may extend the times for serving and filing the cost
memorandum or the notice of motion to strike or tax costs for a period not to
exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(3).) 
 
Here, fifteen days after the cost memorandum was served electronically
was October 13, 2023, which was a court day.[1]
Thirty days past this date was November 12, 2023. Even applying the extension,
Plaintiffs’ motion is untimely since it was filed on November 29, 2023. In
reply, Plaintiffs argue the Court should use its discretion to allow relief for
the untimely filing under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. (Reply, 5.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs argue they inadvertently filed the motion late because
they believed that Defendant’s memorandum was filed prematurely, before
judgment was entered. “[T]he court presumably has discretion to grant relief
under [Code of Civil Procedure section] 473 for ‘inadvertence’ or ‘excusable
neglect’ to consider late-filed motions” to tax costs. (Douglas v. Willis
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 290.) The mandatory provision of section 473 does
not apply. (See id. at 290–91.)  However,
even if the Court were to grant relief, the motion to strike costs would be
denied for the reasons below. 
 
As Plaintiffs did not “recover any relief against” Defendant,
Defendant is the prevailing party in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).) Defendant is therefore entitled to recover its costs.
 
Plaintiffs object to and seek to strike the following portions of
Defendant’s memorandum of costs: filing and motion fees and deposition costs.
 
Filing
and Motion Fees
 
Plaintiffs do not provide any evidence or argument as to why the
filing or motion fees are unreasonable. Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(a)(1) expressly allows for filing, motion, and jury fees. The values
appear reasonable on the face of the memorandum. Since Plaintiffs provide no
argument or evidence, they fail to meet their burden. Accordingly, the Court
denies the motion as to these costs.
 
Deposition
Costs
 
Plaintiffs challenge $3,419.40 in deposition costs. Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(a)(3)(A) expressly authorizes costs for the “[t]aking, video recording,
and transcribing” necessary depositions. Plaintiffs argue the amount is
unreasonable. Looking at the face of the memorandum, the amount for depositions
appears proper. Plaintiff provides no evidence or argument for why the amount
is unreasonable. Therefore, the Court denies the motion as to these costs. (See
County of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113-14 [the party did not
meet its burden where it submitted no affidavits in support of motion to tax
costs, but merely alleged depositions were unnecessary or unreasonable].)
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to strike costs is DENIED.
 
Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
