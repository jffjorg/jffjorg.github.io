And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV09483, granting the Defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories. The Defendant served the interrogatories on September 28, 2022, and the Plaintiff failed to serve verified responses. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to serve verified responses waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The Judge also imposes monetary sanctions on the Plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $750. The Plaintiff is ordered to serve properly verified responses without objections to the interrogatories within 10 days. The Defendant is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of the sanctions within 30 days.
