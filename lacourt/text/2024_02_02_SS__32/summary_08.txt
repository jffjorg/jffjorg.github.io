And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling granted by the court allows Counsel, Robert M. Zavidow, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Bryan Paige. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as Counsel claims that Plaintiff failed to respond to Counsel's request to be relieved. The court finds this a valid reason for withdrawal, but notes that the proposed order filed by Counsel is incomplete and contains errors. The court orders Counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days and to serve the signed order within 10 days. The motion is conditionally granted pending Counsel's compliance with these requirements.
