And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike costs filed by the plaintiffs. The motion was filed late and the court has denied it. The defendant is the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to recover its costs, including filing and motion fees and deposition costs. The plaintiffs had objected to these costs, but the court found that they had not provided any evidence or argument to support their objections. The court has ordered that the plaintiffs provide notice of the ruling and file proof of service.
