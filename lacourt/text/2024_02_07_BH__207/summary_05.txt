And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to confirm and enforce the settlement agreement reached orally in open court on January 10, 2023. The judge found that the parties did not reach a complete meeting of the minds with regard to the terms of the settlement agreement, including the use of the breezeway and gate. Although the parties agreed on some terms, such as payment and lease, they did not agree on all terms, including the maintenance of the gate and the removal or replacement of the gate. The judge concluded that the parties did not have a complete meeting of the minds and therefore denied the motions to confirm and enforce the settlement agreement.
