And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies defendant Joseph Shemaria's motions to confirm and enforce a settlement agreement reached orally in open court on January 10, 2023. The court finds that the parties did not reach a complete meeting of the minds on the settlement agreement, and that several issues remain unresolved. Specifically, the parties did not agree on the type of gate to be installed, and the issue of access to the dumpster was left unclear. The court concludes that the parties did not have a complete agreement and therefore denies the motions.
