MOTION
 
On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff Jaimie L. Beavers (“Respondent”) filed a
complaint for damages against Defendants Fisher Capital, LLC, Brookfield
Holdings, LLC; AMS Consulting Solutions, LLC; Alexander Spellane; and Kevin
Hill, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) negligence;
(3) fraud and deceit, including fraud in the inducement; (4) constructive fraud;
(5) negligent misrepresentation; (6) California Corporations Code §§ 25400,
25401 fraud in connection with the sale of securities; and (7) negligent
infliction of emotional distress, stemming from the Defendants’ alleged scheme
to defraud Plaintiff of her recently deceased husband’s retirement
account.  
 
Defendant Fisher Capital, LLC (“Defendant”) moves to compel Plaintiff
to arbitrate her claims and to stay the action pending resolution of the
arbitration proceeding.  Defendant
Alexander Spellane has filed a joinder to Defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration.  Plaintiff opposes the motion
and Defendant replies.
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL ARBITRATION – LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            “[T]he advantages of arbitration
include a presumptively less costly, more expeditious manner of resolving
disputes.  It follows a party to a valid
arbitration agreement has a contractual right to have its dispute with another
party to the contract resolved quickly and inexpensively.”  (Henry v. Alcove Investment, Inc.
(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 94, 99–100 [cleaned up].) 
Thus, “on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to
the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; see also 
EFund
Capital Partners v. Pless (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1320 [the language
in section 1281.2 compelling arbitration is mandatory].) The right to compel
arbitration exists unless the court finds that the right has been waived by a
party’s conduct, other grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or where
a pending court action arising out of the same transaction creates the possibility
of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds.
(a)-(c).)    
 
            “On a petition to compel
arbitration, the trial court must first determine whether an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists. 
Because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to
granting the petition, the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence
by a preponderance of the evidence.  The
party seeking arbitration can meet its initial burden by attaching to the
petition a copy of the arbitration agreement purporting to bear the
respondent's signature.”  (Bannister
v. Marinidence Opco, LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 541, 543-544 [cleaned
up].)  The party seeking to compel arbitration must also “plead and prove a
prior demand for arbitration and a refusal to arbitrate under the
agreement.”  (Mansouri v. Superior
Court (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 633, 640-641.) 

 
            And while the moving party on a
motion to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence, [a] party
opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence any fact necessary to its defense.  The trial court sits as the
trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary
evidence, and any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to
reach a final determination.”  (Ruiz
v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842 [cleaned
up]; see also Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236 [“The party
seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any
defense, such as unconscionability”].)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     
ENFORCEABLE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
 
On July 15, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a transaction to purchase
gold and silver coins from Fisher Capital. 
(Spellane Decl. ¶¶ 1-2 and Ex. 1.) 
Paragraph 12. e. of the agreement provides as follows:
 
e. Arbitration
of Disputes: CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT BY SIGNING THIS
AGREEMENT CUSTOMER IS AGREEING FOR HIMSELF/HERSELF, AND FOR CUSTOMER’S
SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, HEIRS AND/OR ANY PARTY ACTING ON CUSTOMER’S BEHALF, THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF,
INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT
WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO FISHER CAPITAL’S
CHOICE OF ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED
DISPUTES AND CUSTOMER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY. AS AN ALTERNATIVE,
CUSTOMER MAY BRING A CLAIM IN A "SMALL CLAIMS", IF PERMITTED BY THAT
SMALL CLAIMS COURT’S RULES. CUSTOMER MAY BRING CLAIMS ONLY ON HIS/HER OWN
BEHALF. NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR FISHER CAPITAL WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
OR CLASS- WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. CUSTOMER
ALSO AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR CONSOLIDATED CLAIMS INVOLVING ANOTHER PERSON'S
ACCOUNT, IF FISHER CAPITAL IS A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING. THIS DISPUTE
RESOLUTION PROVISION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. IN THE EVENT
THE FISHER CAPITAL ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO SET A
HEARING DATE WITHIN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY (160) DAYS OF FILING THE CASE, THEN
EITHER FISHER CAPITAL OR YOU CAN ELECT TO HAVE THE ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED
INSTEAD BY THE JUDICIAL ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION SERVICES. JUDGMENT ON THE
AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING COMPETENT
JURISDICTION. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER AND FISHER CAPITAL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. IF THE PROHIBITION AGAINST CLASS
ACTIONS AND OTHER CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES CONTAINED ABOVE IS
FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN ALL OF THE PRECEDING LANGUAGE IN THIS ARBITRATION
SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL SURVIVE THE
TERMINATION OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FISHER CAPITAL. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM
PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION CUSTOMER AND FISHER CAPITAL EACH
WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT CUSTOMER AND FISHER CAPITAL
SHALL LITIGATE EXCLUSIVELY IN THE COURTS LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.
 
(Ibid.)  Defendant argues that the case should
therefore be compelled to arbitration, pursuant to the arbitration clause in
the purchase agreement.
 
            Plaintiff counters (1) Plaintiff was
fraudulently induced to sign the agreement containing the arbitration
provision; (2) the provision leaves the arbitration forum up to the unilateral
discretion of Defendant; (3) it does not provide the relevant arbitration
rules; and (4) it appears to contemplate that arbitration will be conducted by an
arbitration entity associated with or controlled by Defendant.
 
            Defendant argues in reply that the
issue of arbitrability should be delegated to the arbitrator pursuant to the
delegation clause.
 
            Before the Court can address the
issue of delegation, it must first determine whether the parties indeed entered
into a binding agreement to arbitrate.
 
Plaintiff argues she was fraudulently induced to the shipping and
transaction agreement containing the arbitration provision.  Specifically, Plaintiff contends: 
 
(1) Defendant’s employees who contacted Plaintiff
used fake names when interacting with Plaintiff (Beavers Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, 10); 
 
(2) Defendants falsely informed Plaintiff that if
she did not transfer her late husband’s retirement funds into her name, “the
government could take the funds” (Beavers Decl. ¶ 7, 18);
 
(3) Defendants also misrepresented to Plaintiff
that her assets “would be safe from losing value” (Beavers Decl. ¶ 18);
 
(4) Defendants misrepresented that the coins
Plaintiff was purchasing were exclusive, when they were not (Beavers Decl. ¶
18);
 
(5) Defendants concealed from Plaintiff that the
prices they charged Plaintiff for the coins “were exorbitantly above market
rates” (Beavers Decl. ¶ 18.)
 
            Thus, the evidence presented
demonstrates that Plaintiff was induced to transact with Defendants, and agree
to the resulting arbitration provision, under false pretenses.  As such, the agreement is likely voidable, as
the product of fraud in the inducement.
 
2.     
DELEGATION
 
Even if the arbitration agreement were valid and enforceable, the
delegation clause is not.
 
“A delegation clause gives an arbitrator authority to decide even the
initial question whether the parties' dispute is subject to arbitration.” (New
Prime Inc. v. Oliveira (2019) 139 S.Ct. 532, 538.) To be enforceable, a
delegation clause must satisfy two prerequisites: (1) the language must be
clear and unmistakable, and (2) the delegation must not be revocable under
state contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability. (Pinela
v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 227, 240.)
 
a.      
Clear and Unmistakable Language
 
The delegation clause at issue provides:
 
ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT,
INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR
APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO FISHER CAPITAL’S CHOICE OF ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION
RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES
 
(Spellane Decl. ¶¶ 1-2 and Ex. 1.)
 
            Thus, it is unclear from the
delegation clause exactly which arbitrator or arbitration company will determine
the issue of arbitrability or resolve the parties’ claims, or what rules shall
apply to such arbitration, apparently leaving the decision to Defendant’s subsequent
unilateral determination.  
 
            The only further clues about the
arbitrator and terms of arbitration is the following passage:
 
IN THE EVENT THE FISHER CAPITAL ARBITRATION
ASSOCIATION IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO SET A HEARING DATE WITHIN ONE HUNDRED AND
SIXTY (160) DAYS OF FILING THE CASE, THEN EITHER FISHER CAPITAL OR YOU CAN
ELECT TO HAVE THE ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED INSTEAD BY THE JUDICIAL ARBITRATION
AND MEDIATION SERVICES.
 
(Ibid.)  
 
            Plaintiff has indicated that after
searching, Plaintiff has been unable to find any such forum or association by
the name of “Fisher Capital Arbitration Association.”  (Opposition at p. 7.)  
 
Thus, there appears to be no real arbitrator or arbitration
association to whom the Court could delegate the issue of arbitrability, or to
whom Plaintiff could initiate arbitration proceedings.
 
Nor does the “backup” provision regarding JAMS save the delegation
clause, because that provision may only be invoked one hundred and sixty days
after Plaintiff files the “case” with a phantom arbitrator, an event which is
impossible to occur, since the “Fisher Capital Arbitration Association” does
not appear to exist.  Moreover, the only
case law Defendants cite in support of their position that the provisions about
arbitrating before the apparently nonexistent “Fisher Capital Arbitration
Association” should be severed and the case simply sent to JAMS instead is a
nonbinding district court case, which is inapposite in any event because it
analyzes the severability of unconscionable provisions, not salvaging language
that is otherwise not “clear and unmistakable.” 

 
3.     
UNCONSCIONABILITY
 
            Having determined that the
delegation clause is unenforceable, the Court next turns to the issue of
whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable.
 
“Unconscionability is ultimately a question of law for the
court.”  (Flores v. Transamerica
Homefirst, Inc. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 846, 851.)  “However, numerous factual issues may bear on
that question.” (Gutierrez v. Autowest, Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 77,
89.)  As such, Respondent must show two
elements to establish the unconscionability defense: (1) procedural
unconscionability, which focuses on the manner in which the contract was
negotiated, and (2) substantive unconscionability, which concerns whether the
contract’s terms are unreasonably one-sided. (Armendariz v. Foundation
Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 113-115 (hereafter, Armendariz).)

 
            “The prevailing view is that
procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for
a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause
under the doctrine of unconscionability. But they need not be present in the
same degree. Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the
regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates
the terms, in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the
substantive terms themselves.  In other
words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence
of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the
term is unenforceable, and vice versa.” 
(Armendariz, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 114 [cleaned up].)  
 
                                                                         
i.     
PROCEDURAL UNCONSCIONABILITY 
 
Procedural unconscionability examines the “oppression
that arises from unequal bargaining power and the surprise to the weaker party
that results from hidden terms or the lack of informed choice.”  (Ajamian v. CantorCO2e, L.P. (2012)
203 Cal.App.4th 771, 795.)  Preprinted
forms buried within a volume of documents offered on a “take or leave it basis”
evidence a high degree of procedural unconscionability.  (See Dougherty v. Roseville Heritage
Partners (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 93, 102-104 (hereafter, Dougherty).)  Most consumer contracts are adhesive and
therefore present some procedural unconscionability. (Sanchez v. Valencia
Holding Co., LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899, 915, (hereafter, Sanchez).)  “[A] finding of procedural unconscionability
does not mean that a contract will not be enforced, but rather that courts will
scrutinize the substantive terms of the contract to ensure they are not
manifestly unfair or one-sided.”  (Ibid.)  
 
In addition to the facts listed above regarding fraudulent inducement,
Plaintiff also asserts that:
 
(6) the Defendants contacted Plaintiff while she
was grief-stricken from the recent loss of her husband, and therefore in a
vulnerable emotional state, and leveraged this grief to manipulate Plaintiff by
saying her husband “would be proud” of her for “moving decisively to protect”
the retirement assets (Beavers Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7; 18); 
 
(7) Defendant was also vulnerable because of her
inexperience and lack of knowledge about investments and investing (Beavers
Decl. ¶ 8); 
 
(8) Defendants made a series of phone calls to
Plaintiff “in relatively rapid succession,” each time using “urgent and
alarmist tones” as well as “threatening” and “bullying” (Beavers Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8,
10);
 
(9) Prior to signing, Plaintiff received all
documents only by email and she had to sign them through DocuSign on her phone,
as she does not own a computer (Beavers Decl. ¶ 12)
 
(10) Plaintiff’s understanding was that
Defendants were merely helping her transfer the assets into a new IRA account
in her name, and as such, she instructed Defendants to keep the proceeds in
cash (Beavers Decl. ¶ 13)
 
(11) Instead of following Plaintiff’s
instructions to keep the proceeds in cash, Defendants sent Plaintiff the July
15, 2021 “Purchase Invoice” to purchase gold and silver coins with the proceeds
(Beavers Decl. ¶ 14)
 
Therefore, the Court finds that there was a high degree of procedural
unconscionability in entering the agreement containing the relevant arbitration
provision.
 
                                                                       
ii.     
      SUBSTANTIVE
UNCONSCIONABILITY 
 
            Substantive unconscionability refers
to agreement terms which are overly harsh, unduly
oppressive, unreasonably unfavorable, or so one-sided as to shock the
conscience – which, for practical purposes, all mean the same thing.  (Sanchez, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p.
915.)   With regard to demonstrating
substantive unconscionability, an “old-fashioned bad bargain” or a contract
term which “merely gives one side a greater benefit” is insufficient.  (Id. at pp. 911-912.)  The test for substantive unconscionability is
whether the terms impair the integrity of the bargaining process or otherwise
contravene public policy, or the terms “attempt to alter in an impermissible
manner fundamental duties otherwise imposed by the law” or “negate the
reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party.” (Sonic-Calabassas A, Inc.
v. Moreno (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1109, 1145; see also Carbajal v. CWPSC, Inc.
(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 227, 247 [“outside the reasonable expectation of the
nondrafting party or is unduly oppressive”]; Dougherty, supra, 47
Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-107 [arbitration agreement that curtailed plaintiffs’
ability to recover statutory remedies, such as punitive damages and attorney
fees, and contained limitations on discovery that risked frustrating
plaintiffs’ statutory elder abuse claims was substantively
unconscionable].)  
 
            Here, the arbitration agreement
provides (1) Defendant shall unilaterally choose the rules that govern the
arbitration proceedings; and (2) the arbitration shall be held by “Fisher
Arbitration Association,” an entity which, not only does not appear to exist,
but if it did, appears, by virtue of the naming, to be associated with or part
of Defendant.  
 
            Thus, the terms are not only
extremely one-sided in Defendant’s favor, but also appear to impair the very
integrity of the dispute resolution process, in contravention of public
policy.  As such, the arbitration
provision also has a high degree of substantive unconscionability.
 
            Therefore, even if there were a
valid agreement, the arbitration provision is unconscionable and unenforceable.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            For the reasons stated above, Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s claims to arbitration and to stay the proceedings
is denied.  
 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of the same.
