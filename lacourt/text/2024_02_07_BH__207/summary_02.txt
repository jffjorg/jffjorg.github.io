And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Baruch Kreiman, Esq.'s motion to be relieved as counsel for Francisco Becerra due to a breakdown in communication with the plaintiff. Counsel had been unable to reestablish contact with the plaintiff despite diligent efforts to do so. The motion was procedurally proper, as Counsel filed the required forms and served the motion papers on all parties and the client by U.S. mail and email. The court finds that the motion is substantively proper, as Counsel has provided a valid reason for withdrawal under Rule 1.16(b)(4) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. As a result, Counsel must serve the signed order on all parties who have appeared in the action within 10 days of the date of this Order.
