English-text summary:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. The defendant, Fisher Capital, LLC, had moved to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings based on an arbitration agreement between the parties. The plaintiff, Jaimie L. Beavers, had opposed the motion, alleging that she was fraudulently induced into signing the agreement and that the arbitration provision is unconscionable.

The judge found that the arbitration agreement is likely voidable due to fraud in the inducement and that the delegation clause is unenforceable. Additionally, the judge found that the arbitration provision is unconscionable and unenforceable, as it provides that the arbitrator will be chosen by the defendant and that the arbitration will be governed by rules chosen by the defendant.

As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings, and the case will proceed to trial.
