And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Stylenquaza LLC, has successfully moved to quash the service of the summons due to the plaintiff's failure to demonstrate personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to show that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the forum (California) and that the plaintiff's claims are related to or arise out of the defendant's contacts with the forum. Therefore, the court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant through the doctrine of specific jurisdiction. The court has sustained all of the objections of the defendant's counsel to the declaration submitted in support of the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion.
