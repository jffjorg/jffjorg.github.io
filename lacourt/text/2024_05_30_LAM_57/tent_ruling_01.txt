  Case Number:  23STCV01424    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  57  Defendant Stylenquaza LLC's  motion to quash the service of the summons on Plaintiffs' complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over the Defendant is granted.  Plaintiffs have  failed to carry their  burden of demonstrating by the preponderance of the evidence that Defendant has purposefully availed itself of the benefits of this forum (California), and that Plaintiffs' claims are related to or arise out of Defendant's contacts with the forum.   This failure in proof means that the Court cannot assert personal jurisdiction over the Defendant through the doctrine of specific jurisdiction, which is the asserted basis for jurisdiction. The Court is sustaining all of the objections of Defendant's counsel to the declaration that Plaintiffs' counsel submitted in support of Plaintiffs' opposition to the Defendant's motion.  The portions of the declaration to which Defendant did not object are insufficient to carry Plaintiffs' burden of demonstrating that the Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendant through the doctrine of specific jurisdiction.
