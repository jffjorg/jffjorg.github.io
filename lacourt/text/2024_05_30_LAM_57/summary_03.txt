  - "This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered."
  - "Conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates an independent duty arising from principles of tort law."
  - "Liability for intentional or reckless torts relies on a different theory from negligence, which refers to the failure to exercise ordinary care against foreseeable harm."
```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is sustaining the demurrer to the fraud claim with leave to amend and sustaining the demurrer to the negligence claim without leave to amend. The plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC) fails to plead specific facts to show when, where, to whom, and by what means the alleged misrepresentations were made. The SAC also lacks allegations showing a duty of care and breach of that duty, which are essential elements of a negligence claim. The judge is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to clarify the relationship between the parties and the specific misrepresentations made by the defendants.
