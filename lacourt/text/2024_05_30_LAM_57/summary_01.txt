And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to quash the service of the summons, as the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate personal jurisdiction over the Defendant. Specifically, the Plaintiffs have not shown that the Defendant has purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the California forum, nor that the Plaintiff's claims are related to or arise out of the Defendant's contacts with the forum. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' evidence is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the Defendant through the doctrine of specific jurisdiction.
