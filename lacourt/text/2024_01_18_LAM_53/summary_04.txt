And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion of the defendants, Allied Subcontractors Corp. and Michael Chacon, for attorney's fees in the amount of $10,716.20. The plaintiff, Paula Radin, d/b/a JP Investments, filed the action against the defendants alleging breach of contract and fraud. The plaintiff subsequently filed three requests for dismissal of the complaint, including one with prejudice, and the action was dismissed on June 13, 2023. The defendants argue that they are entitled to attorney's fees under Civil Code section 1717 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1032. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of the action precludes the defendants from being considered the prevailing party under Civil Code section 1717. Additionally, the court finds that the attorney's fees provision in the contract is not broad enough to cover tort claims, including the cause of action for fraud. Therefore, the court denies the defendants' motion for attorney's fees.
