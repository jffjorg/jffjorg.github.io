Motion for Attorney’s Fees
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Paula Radin, d/b/a JP Investments (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Allied Subcontractors Corp. and Michael Chacon (“Defendants”) on
January 24, 2022, alleging two causes of action for (1) breach of contract, and
(2) fraud. 
On March 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal of the
Complaint.  Dismissal was not entered on
that date due to a defect with the form used. 
On March 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second Request for Dismissal of the
Complaint.  Dismissal was not entered on
that date because Plaintiff’s counsel did not sign the form.  Thereafter, on June 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a third Request for Dismissal of the Complaint, with prejudice.  Pursuant to that request, the clerk dismissed
Plaintiff’s action with prejudice on June 13, 2023.
Defendants now move the court for an order awarding them attorney’s
fees in the amount of $10,716.20 pursuant to Civil Code section 1717 and Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032.[1]
“[A] prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs in any action or proceeding.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. b).) 
Further, “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) 
First, the court denies Defendants’ request for an award of attorney’s
fees and costs pursuant to Civil Code section 1717. 
“Where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant
to a settlement of the case, there shall be no prevailing party for purposes
of” Civil Code section 1717.  (Civ. Code,
§ 1717, subd. (b)(2).)  “This rule
applies regardless of whether the action is dismissed with or without
prejudice, so long as the plaintiff voluntarily brought about the dismissal
pursuant to section 581.”  (Mesa
Shopping Center-East, LLC v. O Hill (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 890, 903.)  As set forth above, Plaintiff voluntarily
dismissed this action on June 13, 2023. 
Thus, Defendants cannot be construed to be a prevailing party in an
action on a contract (specifically, as to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for
breach of contract) within the meaning of Civil Code section 1717.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(2).)  The court has no discretion to award
attorney’s fees to Defendants pursuant to this statute.  (Ibid.; Shapira v. Lifetech
Resources, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 429, 441 [“A trial court lacks
discretion to award fees under section 1717(b)(2) where a case has been
voluntarily dismissed”].) 
Second, the court denies Defendants’ request for an award of
attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032. 
“‘If an action asserts both contract and tort or other noncontract
claims, [Civil Code] section 1717 applies only to attorney fees incurred to
litigate the contract claims.’ 
[Citation.]  As with tort claims,
the question of whether to award fees on other noncontract claims depends upon
the scope of the contractual attorneys’ fee provision.”  (Exxess Electronixx v. Heger Realty Corp.
(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 698, 713 [emphasis in original] [internal citation
omitted].)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 1032 “works in tandem with [Civil Code section 1717], by providing for
fees for other noncontract claims if the agreement is broadly phrased enough to
cover those claims.”  (Khan v. Shim (2016)
7 Cal.App.5th 49, 59.) 
As set forth above, the court has determined that Defendants cannot
recover attorney’s fees under Civil Code section 1717 for the work performed in
litigating against Plaintiff’s first cause of action for breach of
contract.  Thus, the court evaluates
whether the attorney’s fee provision in the parties’ contract is broad enough
to support an award of attorney’s fees incurred in litigating against the
second cause of action for fraud.  (Khan,
supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 59.) 
The court finds that the attorney’s fees provision in the contract is
not so broad that it covers tort claims. 
The provision states that, upon demand, the borrower (defendant Allied
Subcontractors Corp.) shall pay to the holder (Plaintiff) “the full amount of
all costs and expenses incurred by [Plaintiff] in connection with the
enforcement of [Plaintiff’s] rights and the collection of any amounts which
become due to [Plaintiff] under this Note.” 
(Compl., Ex. A, p. 3, ¶ 10.)  The court finds that this language is too
narrow to encompass tort claims and therefore finds that Defendants cannot
recover attorney’s fees incurred in connection with litigating against
Plaintiff’s cause of action for fraud.  (Khan,
supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 60 [narrower contracts typically do not use
broad phrases such as “arising from” and instead refer to the award of fees to
enforce the subject agreement]; Gil v. Mansano (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th
639, 743 [“Where a contract authorizes an award of attorney fees in an action
to enforce any provision of the contract, tort claims are not covered”].) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendants have not shown that they may
recover attorney’s fees from Plaintiff pursuant to Civil Code section 1717 or Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032 and therefore denies Defendants’ motion. 
ORDER
            The court denies defendants Allied
Subcontractors Corp. and Michael Chacon’s motion for attorney’s fees. 
            The court orders plaintiff Paula
Radin, d/b/a JP Investments to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
