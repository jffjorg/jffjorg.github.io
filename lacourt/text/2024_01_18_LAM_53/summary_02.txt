The plaintiff has submitted evidence that creates a triable issue of material fact regarding these issues, including the authenticity of certain documents and the lack of compliance with the attorney-client contingency fee agreement. The judge notes that even if the attorney-client contingency fee agreement complied with the statute, the plaintiff has still submitted evidence that creates a triable issue of material fact regarding the assertion of control and ownership of property. The judge is leaving it up to the parties to resolve these issues before the next court hearing.
