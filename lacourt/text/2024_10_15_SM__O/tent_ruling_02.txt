RULING
            Plaintiffs Miriam
Lewensztain and Shlomo Kattan’s Demurrer to the 1st–11, 13th
–28th affirmative defenses in Defendant Karamali Mohammad
Pashmforoosh Answer is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND. Defendant fails
to allege ultimate facts that would constitute the affirmative defenses in the
answer.


REASONING
 
“A demurrer to an answer may be
taken to the whole answer or to any one or more of the several defenses set up
in the answer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (b).) The party against whom
an answer has been filed may demur on the basis that the answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense or is uncertain (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.20, subds., (a) and (b).)
 
Demurrer to an answer must be
overruled if any defense to the complaint is properly alleged.  (See South
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733–734 [demurrer to
answer properly overruled based on sufficiently pled general denial].)  A
general denial contained in the answer requires that the entire demurrer be
overruled.  (See People ex rel. Becerra v. Superior Court (2018) 29
Cal.App.5th 486, 499 [discussing MJP based on failure to state facts to
constitute a defense]; Engine Manufacturers Assn. v. State Air Resources Bd.
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1034 [MJP must be denied if “defendant's pleadings
raise a material issue or set up affirmative matter constituting
a defense”].); Barasch v. Epstein (1957) 147 Cal.App.2d 439, 443 [“[w]here
the answer, fairly construed, suggests that the defendant may have a good
defense, a motion for judgment on the pleadings should not be granted”].) 
 
“An affirmative defense must be
pleaded in the same manner as if the facts were set forth in a complaint. In
other words, the general requirement of stating the ultimate facts applies and,
where particularity in pleading is necessary in a complaint, it is equally
necessary in an affirmative defense involving the issue.”  (5 Witkin, Cal.
Proc. (5th ed. 2008) Plead, § 1082; see also Timberidge
Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 879–880 [demurrer
to answer asks whether the answer raises a defense to the plaintiff's stated
cause of action].)  Pleadings are meant “to inform ... adversaries of the
nature of the cause which they state against them with sufficient particularity
to advise them of the issue they will be required to meet at the trial of the
action.”  (Lewis v. Fahn (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 95, 100.) 
Facts that establish a complete discharge of defendant's previously accrued
liability must be specially pleaded. (5 Witkin, supra, § 1082.)
 
To properly plead an affirmative
defense, an answer must set forth facts “as carefully and with as much detail
as the facts which constitute the cause of action and are alleged in the
complaint.” (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
267, 284.)
 
“In order to assert equitable
estoppel, the following four elements must be present: (1) the party to be
estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct be
acted on, or must so act that the party asserting estoppel had a right to
believe it was so intended; (3) the party asserting estoppel must be ignorant
of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his
injury.” (Sofranek v. County of Merced (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1250.)
“To establish estoppel as an element of a suit the elements of estoppel must be
especially pleaded in the complaint with sufficient accuracy to disclose facts
relied upon.” (Sofranek v. County of Merced (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1238,
1250.)
 
Waiver is an excuse for performance
of conditions precendent and must be pleaded specifically. (See Nelson v.
Specialty Records, Inc. (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 126, 140.)
 
The court may, upon a motion to
strike, “or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a)
Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiffs Miriam Lewensztain and
Shlomo Kattan (“Plaintiffs”) filed their demurrer to the answer on 5-15-24,
more than 30 days after the answer was filed on 4-3-24. Defendant Karamali
Mohammad Pashmforoosh (“Defendant”) did not raise the argument that the
demurrer was filed late pursuant to CCP § 430.40(b). “A party who has
filed a complaint or cross-complaint may, within 10 days after service of the
answer to his pleading, demur to the answer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd.,
(b).) Thus, Defendant has waived the argument. The Court will allow the late
filing due to Defendant’s waiver, and in the interest of justice. “The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, ... enlarge
the time for answer or demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) The
trial court may exercise this discretion so long as its action does “not affect
the substantial rights of the parties.” (Harlan v. Department of
Transportation (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 873 [affirming trial court's
decision to permit plaintiff to file late amendment following demurrer]; see
Code Civ. Proc., § 475.)
 
I.               
Demurrer to the 1st–11 and 13th–28th
affirmative defenses – SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND
 
Defendant fails to allege ultimate
facts that would constitute the affirmative defenses in the answer. The 1st–11
and 13th–28th affirmative defenses merely state legal
conclusions which are not sufficient to plead an affirmative defense. Additionally,
the 11th, 13th, 14th and 15th
equitable affirmative defenses have heightened pleading requirements.  Merely stating Plaintiffs have waived their
rights, Plaintiffs have unclean hands, Plaintiffs are barred by the doctrine of
laches, and Plaintiffs are barred by equitable estoppel are legal conclusions
without sufficient facts to plead the equitable defenses. 
 
Plaintiff argues some of the
Defendants 1st, 3rd, 6th and 23rd affirmative
defenses are mere denials of elements of causes of action within the complaint
and not an actual affirmative defense. Plaintiff further argues the 2nd,
4th–6th, 9th, 10th, 20th,
21st, 23rd–28th defenses are inapplicable,
irrelevant, improper, and/or duplicative and thus should be stricken from the
answer pursuant to CCP § 436(a). Plaintiff did not file a motion to strike
alongside the demurrer, and the Court does not deem striking these defenses as
proper at this stage.  
 
Thus, the Demurrer to the 1st–11
and 13th–28th affirmative defenses is SUSTAINED WITH 20
DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND.
