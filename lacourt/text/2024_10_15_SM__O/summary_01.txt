And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to compel further responses and documents submitted by Plaintiff Gina Cook and has granted the motion in part. The Defendant, Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, is ordered to provide further responses to certain requests for production and to pay sanctions in the amount of $3,160.00. The Court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to prepare a proposed order identifying the specific documents to be produced.

The Court has found that Plaintiff has met its burden to show good cause to compel production of documents relating to other customer complaints involving vehicles of the same make, model, and year. These documents are relevant to Jaguar's knowledge of the particular defect in Plaintiff's vehicle and its good faith or bad faith attempts at compliance with the Song-Beverly Act.

Defendant Jaguar has failed to demonstrate that production in response to these requests would be unduly burdensome or oppressive. The Court has also found that Jaguar has failed to demonstrate that production would include trade secret information or why such information could not be protected by a confidentiality protective order.

The Court has ordered the parties to submit a stipulated confidentiality protective order relating to any documents or information requested that Jaguar believes are confidential. Any documents withheld based on privilege shall be sufficiently identified in a privilege log to be served with the supplemental response.

The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request for a privilege log and has overruled Jaguar's objections, except for privilege. The hearing is continued to a later date for the Court's review of the order.
