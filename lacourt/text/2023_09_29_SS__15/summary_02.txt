```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion to quash the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs have not established facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over the Defendant, including whether the Defendant sold products in California during the relevant time period and whether it is a continuation of the company that existed before 1984. The Plaintiffs have had almost five months since the Defendant filed the original motion to quash to obtain discovery on the motion, but they have failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction. The complaint against the Defendant is therefore dismissed without prejudice.
