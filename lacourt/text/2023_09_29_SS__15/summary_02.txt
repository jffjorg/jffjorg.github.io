And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion to quash the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs have not established facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over the Defendant, including whether the Defendant sold products in California during the relevant time period and whether it is a continuation of the company that existed before 1984. The Plaintiffs have had almost five months since the Defendant filed the original motion to quash to obtain discovery on the motion, but they have failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction. The complaint against the Defendant is therefore dismissed without prejudice.

**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled to dismiss the case against Carborundum Grinding Wheel Co. because the plaintiffs haven't shown sufficient evidence that the company had enough business dealings in California to justify the court's jurisdiction. 

The plaintiffs alleged that Joe Martinez developed mesothelioma from asbestos exposure to Carborundum products. However,  the company argued that it wasn't doing business in California during the relevant time period when Martinez used their products. The judge agreed with the defendant, stating that the plaintiffs failed to provide enough evidence to support their claim of jurisdiction. The case is dismissed without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs can refile if they obtain new evidence.

Here is an English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of process due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiffs, Joe and Mary Martinez, have alleged that Joe developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from the defendant's products. The defendant has argued that it does not have sufficient contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction. After multiple continuances and the filing of supplemental briefs, the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant sold products in California during the time Joe Martinez was using them, or that the defendant is a continuation of the company that existed before 1984. Therefore, the judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion and dismiss the complaint without prejudice.

  Dept: "15"
  Judge's Tentative Ruling:
    - The plaintiffs, Joe Martinez and Mary Martinez, allege that Joe Martinez developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from Carborundum Grinding Wheel Co.’s products.
    - Defendant filed a motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction on May 4, 2023.
    - Plaintiffs requested more time for discovery, but the court has denied the request.
    - The court cannot continue the hearing any further as the trial date is in less than three weeks.
    - Plaintiffs have had almost five months since Defendant filed the original motion to quash to obtain discovery on the motion.
    - A court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.
    - The court may allow a motion to quash after the time to file an answer.
    - Defendant is not subject to general jurisdiction in California, but specific jurisdiction may apply if the defendant has purposely availed themselves of forum benefits, and the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum.
    - Defendant is an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio.
    - Defendant argues that it did not sell the product at issue in California during the time Joe Martinez was exposed.
    - Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Joe Martinez used Carborundum blades obtained in California from the 1970s through 1987.
    - Defendant stated that it does not do business in California and that Plaintiffs could have obtained blades marked “Carborundum” from another company doing business under that name and registered in California, Carborundum Abrasives Company.
    - Plaintiffs stated that they need evidence to establish Defendant was selling blades in California and is a continuation of the earlier Carborundum company that existed before 1984.
    - Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendant was selling blades in California, or otherwise doing business in California, during the time Joe Martinez was using them or that Defendant is a continuation of the company that existed before 1984.
    - Therefore, the motion is GRANTED and the complaint against Defendant Carborundum Grinding Wheel Co. is DISMISSED without prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (h).
    - The moving party is to give notice.

In this tentative ruling, the judge rules in favor of the defendant, Carborundum Grinding Wheel Co., in a case where the plaintiffs allege that Joe Martinez developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from the defendant's products. The defendant filed a motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction, which the plaintiffs opposed. The plaintiffs requested more time for discovery, but the court has denied the request. The court cannot continue the hearing any further as the trial date is in less than three weeks. The plaintiffs have had almost five months since the defendant filed the original motion to quash to obtain discovery on the motion.

The judge notes that a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States. The court may allow a motion to quash after the time to file an answer, which it has allowed in this case. The judge states that the defendant is not subject to general jurisdiction in California, but specific jurisdiction may apply if the defendant has purposely availed themselves of forum benefits, and the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum.

The defendant is an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. The defendant argues that it did not sell the product at issue in California during the time Joe Martinez was exposed. Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Joe Martinez used Carborundum blades obtained in California from the 1970s through 1987. Defendant stated that it does not do business in California and that plaintiffs could have obtained blades marked “Carborundum” from another company doing business under that name and registered in California, Carborundum Abrasives Company. Plaintiffs stated that they need evidence to establish Defendant was selling blades in California and is a continuation of the earlier Carborundum company that existed before 1984.

However, the plaintiffs have not shown that Defendant was selling blades in California, or otherwise doing business in California, during the time Joe Martinez was using them or that Defendant is a continuation of the company that existed before 1984. Therefore, the motion is granted and the complaint against Defendant Carborundum Grinding Wheel Co. is dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (h). The moving party is to give notice.
