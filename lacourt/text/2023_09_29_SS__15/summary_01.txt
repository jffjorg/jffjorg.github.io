Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment for the first and third causes of action, denying the motion for summary adjudication for the fourth cause of action and punitive damages. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact, as required by California law. The Judge also finds that the Defendant has presented sufficient evidence to show that it did not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, the needed evidence to establish an element of the Plaintiff's cause of action. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's deposition testimony that the Plaintiff has no knowledge of any exposure to the Defendant's products may be sufficient to shift the burden to the Plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. The Judge also notes that the evidence presented by the Plaintiff is not sufficient to show malice, fraud or oppression, as required for punitive damages.
