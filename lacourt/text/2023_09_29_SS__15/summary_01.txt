The Judge also finds that the Defendant has presented sufficient evidence to show that it did not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, the needed evidence to establish an element of the Plaintiff's cause of action. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's deposition testimony that the Plaintiff has no knowledge of any exposure to the Defendant's products may be sufficient to shift the burden to the Plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. The Judge also notes that the evidence presented by the Plaintiff is not sufficient to show malice, fraud or oppression, as required for punitive damages.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by RDM Industrial Products, Inc. and denied the motion for summary adjudication filed by Thomas Scientific, Inc. The judge found that the defendant had shown that the plaintiff, Penelope Baker, did not have and could not reasonably obtain evidence that she was exposed to asbestos from the defendant's products, thereby shifting the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact.

Regarding the third cause of action for false representation under Section 402-B of the Restatement of Torts, the judge found that the plaintiff had shown the existence of disputed issues based on public statements made by the defendant in its catalogs. The judge noted that the defendant had stated that it had a long-standing program of working closely with supplying manufacturers in their new product development projects, including "testing their products, providing detailed evaluations, making recommendations for changes," and that this statement was potentially misleading.

Regarding the fourth cause of action for intentional tort, the judge found that the plaintiff had presented evidence that the defendant knew about the hazards of asbestos by the 1960s and did not include warnings to its customers. The judge noted that this was sufficient to establish disputed issues about what the defendant knew about the dangers of exposure to asbestos from the products it sold and the lack of warnings.

Regarding the punitive damages claim, the judge noted that the higher standard of proof required for punitive damages was at play and that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was sufficient to show malice, that is, despicable conduct coupled with conscious disregard for the safety of others. The judge denied the motion for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim.

The moving parties are to give notice of the court's tentative ruling.
