 Case Number:  23STCV04276    Hearing Date:   September 29, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE]
ORDER RE MOTION TO QUASH
Plaintiffs
Joe Martinez and Mary Martinez allege Joe Martinez developed mesothelioma as a
result of exposure to asbestos from Defendant Carborundum
Grinding Wheel Co.’s products.  On May 4,
2023, Defendant filed a motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction.  At the initial hearing on June 29, 2023, the
court asked for further information and continued the hearing to July 27, 2023.  The parties then filed supplemental briefs.
In their supplemental brief,
Plaintiffs asked for more time to take discovery, so the court again continued
the hearing date to September
7, 2023 for jurisdictional discovery on whether Defendant was selling blades in
California during the time Joe Martinez was using them and whether Defendant is
a continuation of the company that existed before 1984.  The court stated Plaintiffs could file another
supplemental opposition by August 28, 2023 and Defendant could file a
supplemental reply by September 4, 2023.
In
their second supplemental brief filed on August 28, 2023, Plaintiffs stated
they needed yet more discovery.  And so at
the September 7, 2023 hearing, the court yet again continued the hearing to
September 29, 2023, with Plaintiffs to file a third supplemental opposition by
September 21, 2023 and Defendant to file a supplemental reply by September 27,
2023.  The court could not continue the
hearing any further because the trial date in this preference case is October
16, 2023, in less than three weeks.  And
in any event, Plaintiffs have had almost five months since Defendant filed the
original motion to quash to obtain discovery on the motion.  Plaintiffs did not file a third supplemental
opposition.
“A court of this
state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the
Constitution of this state or of the United States.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.10.)  “The Due Process Clause protects an
individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of
a forum with which he has established no meaningful ‘contacts, ties, or
relations.’”  (Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 471-472.)  A state court may not exercise personal
jurisdiction over a party under circumstances that would offend “traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice.” 
(Asahi Metal Industry Co., Ltd.,
v. Superior Court of California, Solano County (1987) 480 U.S. 102,
113.)  
When a defendant
moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has
the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of
jurisdiction.  (Jayone Foods, Inc. v. Aekyung Industrial Co. Ltd. (2019) 31
Cal.App.5th 543, 553.)  Once facts
showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established, the defendant
has the burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be
unreasonable.  (Ibid.)  “The plaintiff must
provide specific evidentiary facts, through affidavits and other authenticated
documents, sufficient to allow the court to independently conclude whether
jurisdiction is appropriate. 
[Citation.]  The plaintiff cannot
rely on allegations in an unverified complaint or vague and conclusory
assertions of ultimate facts. 
[Citation.]”  (Strasner v. Touchstone Wireless Repair &
Logistics, LP (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 215, 222.)
A defendant is
subject to a state’s general jurisdiction if its contacts “are so continuance
and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.”  (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014) 571 U.S.
117, 127.)  A nonresident defendant may
be subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum “if the defendant has
purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits [citation], and the
‘controversy is related to or “arises out of” a defendant’s contacts with the
forum.’  [Citations.]”  (Vons
Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 446.)  This test does not require a “causal
relationship between the defendant’s in-state activity and the
litigation.”  (Ford Motor Co. v.
Montana Eighth Judicial District Court (2021) 141 S.Ct. 1017, 1026.)  The “arise out” of standard “asks about
causation,” but “relate to” does not.  (Ibid.)  “[W]hen a corporation has ‘continuously and
deliberately exploited [a State’s] market, it must reasonably anticipate being
haled into [that State’s] court[s]’ to defend actions ‘based on’ products
causing injury there.”  (Id. at p.
1027.)  
Defendant
argues there is no general jurisdiction because it is an Ohio corporation with
its principal place of business in Ohio. 
(Motion at p. 6.)  Defendant first
suggested it does not have ongoing business contacts in California (Motion at
p. 7), but then later suggested it does do business in California.  (Supp. Reply at p. 4.)  Defendant argues Plaintiffs cannot show it
sold the product at issue in California because the company did not exist
during the time Joe Martinez was exposed. 
(Id. at pp. 8, 10.)  
Plaintiffs
argue the motion is too late because they only gave an extension of time to
file an answer, not this motion. 
(Opposition at p. 2.)  However,
the court may allow a motion to quash after the time to file an answer, which
the court stated at the last hearing it was allowing.
In
their first supplemental opposition, Plaintiffs did not contest that there is
no general jurisdiction over Defendant.  Plaintiffs
submitted evidence that Joe Martinez used “Carborundum” blades that he obtained
in California from the 1970s through 1987, and that Defendant has sold these
blades since at least 1984.  (Supp. Opp.
at p. 2; Stock Decl., Ex. B at pp. 37, 56, 70-71; 491, 621-622. 626; Ex. C.)  Defendant’s witness testified that the
original Carborundum company closed in about 1983, and then Defendant began operations
as a separate company in 1984.  (Stock
Decl., Ex. D at pp. 15-17.)  Plaintiffs
argued they need evidence to establish Defendant was selling blades in
California and is a continuation of the earlier Carborundum company that
existed before 1984.  (Supp. Opp. at p.
5.)  
In
its supplemental reply, Defendant stated it does not do business in California,
and Plaintiffs could have obtained blades marked “Carborundum” from another
company doing business under that name and registered in California –
Carborundum Abrasives Company.  (Supp.
Reply at pp. 2, 5.)  
In
their second supplemental opposition, Plaintiffs stated they deposed
Defendant’s corporate representative but he did not have information about
where Defendant sold products during the 1970s and 1980s, said Defendant did
not have comprehensive records from that time, and said there is no one left
for him to talk about the sales during that time.  (Second Supp. Opp. at pp. 2, 5.)  Plaintiffs said Industrial Holdings Corporate’s
representative would have information on those topics and that his deposition would
be taking place soon.  (Id. at pp.
2-3, 6.)  So the court continued the
hearing again.  
After
the court continued the hearing again and allowed Plaintiffs to file a third supplemental
opposition, Plaintiffs did not do so. 
Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendant was selling blades in California,
or otherwise doing business in California, during the time Joe Martinez was
using them or that Defendant is a continuation of the company that existed
before 1984.  Therefore, Plaintiffs did
not establish facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over Defendant.
The motion is
GRANTED and the complaint against Defendant Carborundum
Grinding Wheel Co. is
DISMISSSED without prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581,
subdivision (h).
The
moving party is to give notice.
