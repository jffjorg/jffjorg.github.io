And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS) and U.S. Bank NA, against the plaintiffs, Hezequias Kizito and Jennie Kizito. The demurrer challenges the plaintiffs' allegations of violations of Civil Code 2923.5, 2924(a)(1), and 2924.9, as well as unfair business practices and breach of contract.

The Court notes that the plaintiffs' allegations are based on a misunderstanding of the defendants' argument and that the defendants cured the alleged violations by subsequently approving the plaintiffs for a loan modification. The Court also finds that the plaintiffs' breach of contract claims fail to adequately allege the elements of a breach of contract cause of action.

The Judge grants the defendants' request for judicial notice and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court notes that this is the third time the plaintiffs have attempted to assert their claims against the defendants, but the Court will give the plaintiffs one more opportunity to try to cure the defects in their claims.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case #23CHCV00693

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Facts:**

* Plaintiffs borrowed $520,000 from Washington Mutual Bank, N.A. ("WaMu") in 2006, secured by a Deed of Trust on their property located at 17225 Celtic Street, Granada Hills, CA 91344.
* In 2011, Plaintiffs entered into a Loan Modification Agreement with Chase Home Finance, LLC.
* In January 2022, Defendants recorded a Notice of Default (NOD) against the property, stating the amount past due was $123,127.62. 
* Plaintiffs applied for a loan modification with SPS, which was approved.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Demurrer:** Defendants filed a demurrer arguing that Plaintiffs' original complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

**Causes of Action:**

* **Violation of Civil Code 2923.5:** Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated the Homeowners Bill of Rights by recording the NOD without contacting them to explore foreclosure prevention options.
* **Violation of Civil Code 2924(a)(1):** Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated this statute because Clear Recon Corp. had not been substituted as trustee under the Deed of Trust when the NOD was recorded.
* **Violation of Civil Code 2924.9:** Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated this statute by failing to notify them of foreclosure prevention alternatives within 5 business days of recording the NOD.
* **Unfair Business Practices - Violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.:**  Plaintiffs claim Defendants engaged in unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent business practices.
* **Breach of Contract (Two Causes of Action):** Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached the contracts by recording the NOD and failing to comply with the terms as successor in interest to the loan.

**Court's Analysis:**

* The court grants Defendants' request for judicial notice of certain facts.
* The court finds that Defendants cured any alleged violations of Civil Code 2923.5 and 2924.9 by subsequently offering Plaintiffs loan modifications.
* The court finds that the NOD was properly recorded by the authorized trustee under the Deed of Trust.
* The court finds that Plaintiffs' UCL claim fails because it is based on the preceding statutory-based claims which are deficient.
* The court finds that Plaintiffs' breach of contract claims are too vague and fail to adequately allege their own performance under the contracts.

**Ruling:**

* The demurrer is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend.


**Key Takeaways:**

The court found that Plaintiffs' complaint was deficient in several ways, primarily due to factual inaccuracies and a failure to adequately allege their claims. However, the court allowed Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to try to cure these defects.

**Tentative Ruling on Demurrer to Original Complaint**

**Case Number:** 23CHCV00693
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Dept:** F47

**Ruling:** The demurrer is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend.

**Summary of Facts and Procedural History:**

* The case involves a non-judicial foreclosure proceeding initiated by defendants against plaintiffs' property.
* Plaintiffs allege various causes of action, including violation of Civil Code 2923.5, 2924(a)(1), and 2924.9, unfair business practices, and breach of contract.
* The defendants filed a demurrer to the entire complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

**Analysis:**

* The court granted the defendants' request for judicial notice (RJN) and noted that plaintiffs seem to be addressing a different pleading than the complaint at issue in this action.
* The court found that plaintiffs' allegations of violation of Civil Code 2923.5 and 2924.9 are based on misunderstandings and that the defects were cured when the defendants reviewed and approved the plaintiffs' loan modification applications.
* The court also found that the second cause of action, alleging violation of Civil Code 2924(a)(1), is based on a misinterpretation of the facts and that the defendants' actions were permissible under the code.
* The court further found that the fourth cause of action, alleging unfair business practices, relies on the preceding causes of action, which fail to state claims.
* The court concluded that the fifth and sixth causes of action, alleging breach of contract, fail to adequately allege the elements of a breach of contract cause of action.

**Intentions:**

* The court intends to give plaintiffs one more opportunity to try to cure the defects in their claims against the defendants.

**Facts:**

* Plaintiffs obtained a loan from Washington Mutual Bank in 2006, which was secured by a deed of trust encumbering their property.

* Plaintiffs submitted applications for loan modifications to the defendants, which were approved, but they found the modifications unacceptable.

**Disputes:**

* The primary dispute is over the validity of the defendants' actions in recording the notice of default and commencing foreclosure proceedings.

* The defendants recorded a notice of default against the property, alleging that the amount past due on the loan was $123,127.62.

# Case Summary: Case Number 23CHCV00693

**Parties Involved:**

* Plaintiffs: Hezequias Kizito and Jennie Kizito
* Defendants: Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS) and U.S. Bank NA, successor trustee to Bank of America, NA, successor in interest to LaSalle Bank NA, as trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Wa Mu Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-AR12 (the Trust)

**Key Dates:**

* 8/28/06: Plaintiffs obtained a $520,000 loan from Washington Mutual Bank, N.A.
* 1/17/22: Amount past due on the loan was $123,127.62
* 1/19/22: Defendants recorded a Notice of Default (NOD) against the Property
* 3/10/23: Plaintiffs filed the instant action
* 6/6/23: Defendants filed a demurrer to the entire complaint

**Legal Issues:**

1. Violation of Civil Code 2923.5
2. Violation of Civil Code 2924(a)(1)
3. Violation of Civil Code 2924.9
4. Unfair Business Practices â€“ Violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.
5. Breach of Contract
6. Breach of Contract Two

**Ruling:**

The demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

**Background:**

This case concerns non-judicial foreclosure proceedings initiated by Defendants against Plaintiffs' property. Plaintiffs allege that they entered into a Loan Modification Agreement in March 2011, but later found the modification offered by SPS to be unacceptable. After recording a NOD, Defendants reviewed Plaintiffs' application for a loan modification and approved them for a trial loan modification. Plaintiffs previously filed a similar action (LASC Case No. 22CHCV00470) but dismissed it without prejudice.

**Court's Analysis:**

1. **Violation of Civil Code 2923.5 & 2924.9:** Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Homeowners Bill of Rights by recording a NOD without proper assessment of Plaintiffs' financial situation. However, Defendants cured the alleged violations by reviewing and approving Plaintiffs for a trial loan modification a week after recording the NOD.
2. **Violation of Civil Code 2924(a)(1):** Plaintiffs claim that the NOD was recorded by an unauthorized trustee. However, judicially noticed facts show that the NOD was recorded by the duly authorized trustee under the DOT.
3. **Unfair Business Practices:** This claim is based on the preceding statutory-based causes of action, which fail to state claims.
4. **Breach of Contract & Breach of Contract Two:** Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged how Defendants breached the loan terms or their own performance under the terms of the contracts.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Court will give Plaintiffs one more opportunity to cure the defects in their claims against Defendants.
* Plaintiffs fail to address the fact that this is the third time they have attempted to assert their claims against Defendants.
