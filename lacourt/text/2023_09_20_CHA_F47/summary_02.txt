And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS) and U.S. Bank NA, against the plaintiffs, Hezequias Kizito and Jennie Kizito. The demurrer challenges the plaintiffs' allegations of violations of Civil Code 2923.5, 2924(a)(1), and 2924.9, as well as unfair business practices and breach of contract.

The Court notes that the plaintiffs' allegations are based on a misunderstanding of the defendants' argument and that the defendants cured the alleged violations by subsequently approving the plaintiffs for a loan modification. The Court also finds that the plaintiffs' breach of contract claims fail to adequately allege the elements of a breach of contract cause of action.

The Judge grants the defendants' request for judicial notice and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court notes that this is the third time the plaintiffs have attempted to assert their claims against the defendants, but the Court will give the plaintiffs one more opportunity to try to cure the defects in their claims.
