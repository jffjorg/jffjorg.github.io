Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the ex parte application for writ of possession filed by the Referee, Michael S. Pecherer. The application was filed on September 15, 2023, seeking the issuance of a writ of execution for the property commonly known as 10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331. The Referee claimed that the application was necessary to complete the partition sale of the property, but the judge found that the application failed to comply with proper procedures.

The judge noted that the application was not accompanied by a memorandum, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1201(4). Additionally, the application failed to include the required information about the parties' attorneys, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(a). The Referee also failed to provide an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(c).

The judge further noted that the Referee failed to provide a declaration of notice accompanying the application, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1204. Instead, the Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the ex parte application and supporting documents were mailed to the Defendant on September 15, 2023.

The judge concluded that the Referee's application was denied due to the failure to comply with proper procedures. The judge noted that the Referee has failed to provide authority for the issuance of a writ of possession and/or writ of execution, and that a noticed motion would be required for the requested relief.

The Judge has denied the ex parte application for a writ of possession filed by Referee Michael S. Pecherer. The application sought to evict Defendant Juan F. Nuno from the property located at 10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331. The Judge found that the application was deficient in several respects, including the lack of a memorandum, failure to provide notice to the Defendant, and failure to establish irreparable harm or immediate danger.

The Judge noted that the Referee's reliance on paragraphs 6, 8.f, and 13 of the Judgment was insufficient to support the request for a writ of possession and/or writ of execution. The Judge denied the application and indicated that any subsequent motion would need to provide additional authority to support the requested relief.

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the ex parte application for a writ of execution filed by Referee Michael S. Pecherer. The Judge found several deficiencies in the application, including the lack of a memorandum, failure to state the name and contact information of any attorney for the parties, failure to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, and the lack of a declaration of notice. Additionally, the Judge found that it is not clear what relief is being sought and that the Referee has not established that the requested relief is appropriate. The Judge also noted that the Referee has not provided any authority that allows the eviction of Defendant from the Property through an ex parte application for writ of possession and/or writ of execution. The Judge cited Code of Civil Procedure Section 873.070 as the only authority cited in the application, but noted that such a motion would require authority to support the issuance of a writ of possession and/or writ of execution under the facts of this case.
