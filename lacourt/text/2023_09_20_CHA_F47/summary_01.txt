Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the ex parte application for writ of possession filed by the Referee, Michael S. Pecherer. The application was filed on September 15, 2023, seeking the issuance of a writ of execution for the property commonly known as 10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331. The Referee claimed that the application was necessary to complete the partition sale of the property, but the judge found that the application failed to comply with proper procedures.

The judge noted that the application was not accompanied by a memorandum, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1201(4). Additionally, the application failed to include the required information about the parties' attorneys, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(a). The Referee also failed to provide an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(c).

The judge further noted that the Referee failed to provide a declaration of notice accompanying the application, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1204. Instead, the Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the ex parte application and supporting documents were mailed to the Defendant on September 15, 2023.

The judge concluded that the Referee's application was denied due to the failure to comply with proper procedures. The judge noted that the Referee has failed to provide authority for the issuance of a writ of possession and/or writ of execution, and that a noticed motion would be required for the requested relief.
