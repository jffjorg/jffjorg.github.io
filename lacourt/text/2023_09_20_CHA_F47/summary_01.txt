The judge noted that the application was not accompanied by a memorandum, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1201(4). Additionally, the application failed to include the required information about the parties' attorneys, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(a). The Referee also failed to provide an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(c).

The judge further noted that the Referee failed to provide a declaration of notice accompanying the application, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1204. Instead, the Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the ex parte application and supporting documents were mailed to the Defendant on September 15, 2023.

The judge concluded that the Referee's application was denied due to the failure to comply with proper procedures. The judge noted that the Referee has failed to provide authority for the issuance of a writ of possession and/or writ of execution, and that a noticed motion would be required for the requested relief.

The Judge has denied the ex parte application for a writ of possession filed by Referee Michael S. Pecherer. The application sought to evict Defendant Juan F. Nuno from the property located at 10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331. The Judge found that the application was deficient in several respects, including the lack of a memorandum, failure to provide notice to the Defendant, and failure to establish irreparable harm or immediate danger.

The Judge denied the application and indicated that any subsequent motion would need to provide additional authority to support the requested relief.
