 Case Number:  23LBCV01658    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  S27 The Court heard a discovery motion
in this case on 4/18/24.  The Court, in
its final order, noted that there were four additional discovery motions
scheduled for hearing.  The Court
continued the hearing on all four motions to 7/30/24 and ordered the parties to
meet and confer in an attempt to resolve all issues, including sanctions.  
 
On 7/17/24, Defendant filed timely
opposition to the motions.  Defendant, in
the opposition papers, indicates the motions are all moot.  Any reply to the opposition was due on or
before 7/23/24.  The Court has not
received reply papers.  The Court
therefore finds the motions are moot and takes them off calendar.  
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give
notice.  
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
