And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to stay proceedings in a lawsuit filed by Jane Doe against LBUSD and Thomas Maggio for childhood sexual abuse. The defendants argue that the lawsuit should be stayed pending the outcome of two pending appellate court decisions that may resolve the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218). The judge notes that while the defendants have raised some valid concerns, they have not made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits. Moreover, the judge is not inclined to grant the motion as it would prejudice the plaintiff and the issue may still be appealed to the Supreme Court, potentially taking years to resolve. The judge has denied the motion and ordered the defendants to give notice.
