And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by the defendants, Steven Fukuto, Michael D. Redlew, and Berth 55 Landing Long Beach, Inc. The motion seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of breach of contract, breach of guarantee, and ejectment.

The Judge finds that the motion must be denied because fact 3 in the defendants' separate statement, which purports to establish that the defendants paid a $20,000 deposit, is disputed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the defendants did not pay the deposit and attaches evidence in the form of bounced check documents to support this claim.

The Judge also notes that the defendants' separate statement fails to comply with California Rules of Court 3.1350(b) by not breaking down the issues for adjudication in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, the alternative motion for summary adjudication is also denied.

Finally, the Judge notes that the defendants do not seek summary adjudication of the ejectment cause of action in their notice of motion, and the parties agree that the issue is moot. The Judge cannot adjudicate the issue because it is not noticed for adjudication.
