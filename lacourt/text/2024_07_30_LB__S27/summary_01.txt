Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendants and has made several findings. First, the court agrees that the new battery cause of action is a new and different theory and was not pled in the original complaint, and therefore is not barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. However, the court finds that the battery cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations as a survival claim. The court also finds that the plaintiffs must amend their complaint to clarify which plaintiffs are asserting which claims against which defendants and on which theory. The court orders the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within ten days, and the defendants to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
