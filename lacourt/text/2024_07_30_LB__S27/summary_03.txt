And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has seen a significant increase in motions to compel further responses and motions to compel PMK depositions in lemon law cases. The attorneys for both parties have failed to meet and confer in good faith to resolve these discovery disputes. As a result, the court has been inundated with these motions, which often take up multiple hearing slots in a week.

The court finds that the attorneys can easily resolve these issues with the assistance of the court's prior rulings. The court has ruled on similar discovery motions in other cases and expects the parties to do the same here.

The parties have a hearing on a summary judgment motion set for September 5, 2024, which is continued to that date. The court expects the parties to meet and confer before the hearing and to file a joint statement of items that remain in dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any arguments against imposition of sanctions.

The court notes that parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.
