[1] Defendant also point out that the accompanying
declaration does not discuss when the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered.  However, Plaintiff’s proposed amendment does
not turn on discovery of nGroup being Plaintiff’s employer.  This fact was known before this case was
filed, was alluded to in Plaintiff’s original Complaint, and was specifically
alleged in Defendant’s Cross-Complaint and First Amended Cross-Complaint.  The relevant issue is why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.  


[2] Defendant mentions Plaintiff’s FAC
was improperly filed because Plaintiff had not obtained leave of court.  Nor was the FAC rejected for failure to
obtain leave of court. But Defendant filed its Answer to the FAC.  No issues regarding the filing of the FAC
were raised with the Court.
