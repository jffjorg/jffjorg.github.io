Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling addresses a demurrer to the gross negligence allegations and a motion to strike punitive damages. The Court finds that the gross negligence allegations are sufficient to support the Second Cause of Action for General Negligence. However, the Court grants the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The Court also denies leave to amend. The parties are ordered to file a First Amended Complaint consistent with this order, and the Defendant is ordered to serve and file its responsive pleading within 30 days of service of the First Amended Complaint.
