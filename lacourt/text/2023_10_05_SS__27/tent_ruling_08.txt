[1] Plaintiffs argue Defendant failed
to provide sufficient notice of the demurrer and motion to strike.  Plaintiffs base this argument upon
Defendant’s service and filing of the demurrer and motion to strike on
September 15, 2023, which is only 13 court days before the hearing.  The argument lacks merit.  Defendant included the proposed demurrer and
motion to strike in his amended motion to set aside default on August 15,
2023.  It is doubtful Plaintiffs were not
provided with sufficient notice  More
importantly,  Plaintiffs submitted oppositions
which engage with the merits of the demurrer and motion to strike.  Given these facts, Plaintiffs cannot claim to
have been prejudiced by a purported lack of notice.  As such, the Court considers Defendant’s
demurrer and motion to strike herein.


[2] Defendant also argues the demurrer
to the punitive damages attachment to the form Complaint should be sustained
because malice, fraud, and oppression are not a cause of action.  Defendant again misreads the form
Complaint.  Malice, fraud, and oppression
are not alleged as a cause of action but in support of punitive damages.  (Complaint, p. 6.)  Moreover, Plaintiffs set forth the punitive
damages allegations upon attachment that has 
been approved for use by the Judicial Council of California.  A motion to strike is a better vehicle to
challenge the sufficiency of the punitive damage allegations.  Defendant has filed a motion to strike
punitive damages which the Court discusses below.


[3] The notice of the motion to strike
indicates the gross negligence allegations are also the subject of the motion.  However, as the motion to strike focuses solely
on the punitive damages allegations, the Court addresses only the punitive
damages arguments.
