[1] Plaintiff is self-represented.


[2] The notice of motion also
identifies (i) accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not have
guarded against and (ii) the verdict or other decision is against law as
additional grounds for a new trial. 
However, as Plaintiff does not submit any argument or evidence in
support of either statutory basis, the Court addresses Plaintiff’s “newly
discovered evidence” argument in the disposition of this motion.


[3] While the Court is cognizant that
Mr. Melendez is self-represented, and has offered assistance where appropriate,
the Court must still abide the rules of evidence and strictly follow the
procedural steps for making a determination on a motion for a new trial as the
Court would with any other litigant.  (See,
e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1247,
[self-represented litigants are “ ‘treated like any other party
and [are] entitled to the same, but no greater consideration than other
litigants and attorneys.’ [Citation.]”].)
 


[4] Defendants challenge the
foundation (authentication) of Plaintiff’s medical records.  True, Plaintiff did not submit his own Evidence
Code section 1401 declaration or provide a custodian’s declaration pursuant to
Evidence Code sections 1561 and 1562 attesting to the authenticity of the
documents. Even if the Court were to accept the authenticity of the documents,
Plaintiff’s failure to provide a declaration from a medical expert in support
of his contentions precludes relief.   


[5] At the very least, Dr. Franc’s
Report does not explain why Plaintiff did not provide this evidence in March
2023 when Plaintiff sought relief from the deemed admissions, or in May 2023
when the Court considered and granted Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment.
