And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge on a motion for a new trial. The plaintiff, Mr. Melendez, is self-represented and has requested a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The court notes that while Mr. Melendez is self-represented, the court must still follow the rules of evidence and procedural steps for making a determination on a motion for a new trial.

The defendants challenge the foundation of the plaintiff's medical records, citing that Mr. Melendez did not submit an Evidence Code section 1401 declaration or a custodian's declaration attesting to the authenticity of the documents. Even if the court were to accept the authenticity of the documents, Mr. Melendez's failure to provide a declaration from a medical expert in support of his contentions precludes relief.

The court also notes that Mr. Melendez's report from Dr. Franc does not explain why he did not provide this evidence earlier, when he sought relief from deemed admissions or when the court considered and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
