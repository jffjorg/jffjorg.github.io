CASE NO.:                 21STCV45120  
 





















 
MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SUPPLEMENTAL DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Mayra’s Service Cleaning, Inc., and Josue Eliseo Rodriguez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February 27, 2023, Defendants, Mayra’s Service Cleaning,
Inc., and Josue Eliseo Rodriguez, filed this motion to compel Plaintiff,
Peniel Perez-Morales, to provide responses to Supplemental Discovery consisting
of interrogatories and demands for production of documents.  Defendant does not seek sanctions.
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SUPPLEMENTAL    DISCOVERY
 
A party may propound a supplemental
interrogatory or supplemental demand for production of documents to elicit any
later acquired information bearing on all answers previously made by any
party.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.070, subd. (a), 2031.050, subd.
(a).)  Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery
requests, the court may make an order compelling responses as well as impose
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.)  Moreover, failure to timely serve
responses waives objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served
Plaintiff with the supplemental discovery requests on June 8, 2023. However, to
date, Plaintiff has not provided responses.  (See Braze Decl.) 
Therefore, all objections to the supplemental interrogatories and demands for
production are waived.  
 
As Defendant
properly served the supplemental discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to
serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff
to provide supplemental responses to all
previously propounded interrogatories and demands for production.¿  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted.  
 
Plaintiff Peniel Perez-Morales is ordered to provide
verified, objection-free responses to Defendant’s supplemental interrogatories
and supplemental demands for production within 20 days of this order.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
