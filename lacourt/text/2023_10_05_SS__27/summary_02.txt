And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to amend the pleadings and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff, Frank Perez, is seeking to correct an error in Paragraph 17 of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The defendant, Carparts.com, Inc., opposes the motion.

The judge notes that the FAC was filed on May 19, 2023, and the SAC was attempted to be filed on July 25, 2023, but was rejected for failure to obtain leave of court. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not inexcusably delay in seeking leave to file an amended pleading and that the defendant has not established prejudice.

The judge is inclined to grant the plaintiff leave to amend, but notes that the motion must be accompanied by a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.

The judge will continue the hearing to October 31, 2023, and will hear from counsel regarding the need for further briefing on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
