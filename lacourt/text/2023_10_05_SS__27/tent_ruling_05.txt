MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant/Cross-Complainant
John Ray Conley 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On March 9, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant, John Ray
Conley, filed these motions to compel Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Maria Calderon aka Jenessa Rose Aguirre, to provide responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production
of Documents, Set One.  Defendant does
not seek sanctions. 
 
            Plaintiff is presently
self-represented.[1]
 
The motions are unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
DISCOVERY
 
If a party to
whom interrogatories and inspection demands were directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely serve responses waives objections
to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served
Plaintiff with the at-issue discovery requests on December 6, 2022.  Defendant granted Plaintiff an extension to provide
responses.  However, to date, Plaintiff
has not provided responses.  (See Acker Decls.) 
Therefore, all objections to the interrogatories and demands for production are
waived.  
 
As Defendant
properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses,
the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to
provide responses to Set One of Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of
Documents.¿ 
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motions are granted.  
 
Plaintiff Maria Calderon aka Jenessa Rose Aguirre is ordered
to provide verified, objection-free responses to Set One of Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of
Documents within 15 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
