And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jaleel Melendez's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The motion was filed on July 27, 2023, and argued that Plaintiff's 2021 car accident and subsequent medical condition prevented him from responding to discovery and participating in his case. However, the judge found that Plaintiff failed to establish that the medical records regarding his 2021 car accident are newly discovered evidence within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 657, subdivision (4). The judge also found that Plaintiff did not exercise reasonable diligence in discovering and producing the evidence, and that the evidence is not material to the case. The judge's decision is based on the lack of explanation regarding when Plaintiff discovered the medical records, the lack of a sufficient medical explanation demonstrating the materiality of the Dr. Franc Report or the MRI scans, and the failure to provide a declaration from a qualified medical provider that explains the significance of the Dr. Franc Report or MRI Scans.
