And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel further responses to requests for document production (Set One) and a request for sanctions filed by Plaintiff Precise MRI Corp. against Defendants Raymond Ghermezian, PLC, and Raymond Ghermizian. The Court has denied the motion without prejudice due to the failure of the parties to file a joint statement as required by the Department's rules. The joint statement is a required document that contains four columns, including the discovery request, the response, and brief statements from each party as to why a further response should or should not be compelled. Without this document, the Court cannot make an informed decision on the motion.
