And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is related to a petition to confirm an arbitration award in the case MARC H. SHOMER, et al. v. ALAN SALZMAN, et al. (Case No. 20SMCV01681). The case involves a premarital agreement between Alan Salzman and Andrea Left, which set out the couple's rights regarding their separate properties. After their separation, Salzman filed a petition for dissolution of marriage, which was pending at the time of Left's death in June 2020.

The parties stipulated to arbitrate the action, and the arbitrator issued a Final Award in favor of the Defendants, finding that Plaintiffs shall take nothing from their causes of action and awarding the Defendants $165,346.55 in attorneys' fees and $12,724.51 in arbitrator fees and costs. The Court must select one of four courses of action: confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.

The Court finds that the Final Award satisfies the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. § 1283.4 and represents the final resolution of the arbitration. The Court awards post-judgment interest on the award of $178,071.06 in attorneys' fees and costs and awards the Defendants fees in the amount of $4,212 incurred in connection with this petition.
