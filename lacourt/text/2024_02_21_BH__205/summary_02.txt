And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant, The Regents of the University of California, has successfully demurred against the plaintiff, Elsie Coleman's, claims of whistleblower retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and Labor Code §1102.5. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot amend her complaint to cure the defects.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's FEHA claims are time-barred, meaning that they were not filed within the one-year statute of limitations. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff failed to exhaust internal grievance procedures before filing a lawsuit, as required by Labor Code §1102.5.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's claims do not meet the legal requirements for a whistleblower retaliation claim under FEHA, and that the plaintiff has not alleged any facts showing that she was discriminated against or harassed on the basis of her age or race.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's failure to exhaust internal grievance procedures bars her claim under Labor Code §1102.5, and that the University's internal grievance procedures are adequate and did not need to be discovered through discovery.
