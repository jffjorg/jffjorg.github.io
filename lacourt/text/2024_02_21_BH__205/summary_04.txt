Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of SVETLANA A. SHAPOLAVOLA vs. LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORATION AUTHORITY, et al. (Case No. 23SMCV01628). The case involves a bus accident and the plaintiff's subsequent lawsuit against the MTA. The MTA has filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred under the Government Claims Act.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's claim is indeed time-barred. The Court has also declined to grant leave to amend the complaint, as there is no reasonable possibility that the plaintiff could cure the defects associated with the statute of limitations defense.

The Judge has granted the MTA's request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the plaintiff's government claim and denial of the claim by the MTA. The Court has also ruled that the plaintiff's claim is untimely under both the Government Claims Act and the Code of Civil Procedure.
