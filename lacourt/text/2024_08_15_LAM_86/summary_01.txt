Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the first cause of action filed by Marvin Brown against the City of Los Angeles and its Department of Water and Power, and denying the motion to strike the Fourth Amended Petition. The Judge finds that Marvin Brown lacks standing to sue on behalf of Maverick Consulting Group, LLC, as a limited liability company (LLC) is a distinct entity from its members, and any injury to the members is incidental to the injury suffered by the LLC. The Judge also finds that Pandora Consulting Associates, LLC should be named as a real party in interest, although it has committed wrongdoing and should be named as a respondent. The Judge denies leave to amend the petition and orders the respondents to file an answer within 10 calendar days.
