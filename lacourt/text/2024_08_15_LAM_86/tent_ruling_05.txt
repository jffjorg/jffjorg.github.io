administrative record, attached to the opening brief filed by petitioner on May
17, 2024. 


[2]           “Under the administrative per se law,
the DMV must immediately suspend the driver’s license of a person who is
driving with .08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood.
[Citation.] The procedure is called ‘administrative per se’ because it does not
impose criminal penalties, but simply suspends a person's driver's license as
an administrative matter upon a showing the person was arrested for driving
with a certain blood-alcohol concentration, without additional evidence of
impairment.” (MacDonald v. Gutierrez (2004) 32 Cal.4th 150, 155.) 


[3]           Petitioner does not otherwise challenge the findings upon
which the decision is based, i.e., reasonable cause to believe that
petitioner was driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, lawful arrest,
and admonition on the consequences of refusing to complete a chemical test. (See
AR 6; Veh. Code § 13353(d) [listing factors necessary to trigger penalty of
suspension].)
