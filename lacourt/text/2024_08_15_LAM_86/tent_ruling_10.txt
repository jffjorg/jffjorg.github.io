Case:                           MBL Administrative
Agent II LLC v. Maurice Salter et al. (24STCV02135)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:      
 
Plaintiff MBL Administrative Agent II LLC’s Motion for Appointment
of Receiver is GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 564(b)(1),
(b)(6), and (b)(9), plaintiff MBL Administrative Agent II LLC seeks the
appointment of a receiver with respect to the real, personal, tangible, and
intangible property of defendants Motolease SPE, LLC (“Moto SPE”), Motolease
Servicing, LLC (“Moto Servicing”), Motolease Funding, LLC (“Moto Funding”),
Moto Holding, LLC (“Moto Holding”), Pico Mobility LLC (“Pico”), Westwood Group
LLC (“Westwood”), and M-Nation LLC (“M-Nation”) (collectively, “Moto Entities”).
 
Under CCP § 564(b),
a receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action is pending when a
creditor’s “right to or interest in the property or fund, or the proceeds of
the property or fund, is probable” and where “the property or fund is in danger
of being lost, removed, or materially injured.” (CCP § 564(b)(1).) The Court
may also be appointed where “a corporation is insolvent” or “in imminent danger
of insolvency.” (CCP § 564(b)(6).) A receiver may also be appointed “where
necessary to preserve the property or rights of any party.” (CCP § 564(b)(9).) 
 
A receiver should not be appointed unless absolutely
essential, because no other remedy will suffice. (City & County of San
Francisco v. Daley (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 745.) This is so because the
appointment of a receiver is recognized as a drastic, time consuming, expensive,
and potentially unjust remedy to be used as a final resort. (See Weil
& Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 9:743 et seq.; see also
Alhambra-Shumway Mines v. Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d
869, 873.) “The appointment of a receiver is a drastic remedy and is one which
should not be invoked unless there is an actual or threatened cessation or
diminution of the business.” (In re Jamison Steel Corp. (1958) 158
Cal.App.2d 27, 35.) 
 
The Moto Entities provide financing for the sale and lease
of motorcycles, ATVs, jet skis, and other recreational vehicles. (Lovy Decl. ¶
6.) On May 26, 2022, plaintiff and defendants Moto SPE, Moto Servicing, and
Moto Funding entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (“Credit
Agreement”), whereby defendants were lent money in exchange for plaintiff’s
right to collect on defendants’ accounts. (Lovy Decl. ¶¶ 10-13, 31, 34 &
Ex. 1.) Moto Servicing, Moto Funding, and Moto Holding are Guarantors under the
Credit Agreement. (Lovy Decl. ¶¶ 16, 17.) The Credit Agreement was secured by collateral
set forth in a Security Agreement, including accounts and leases. (Lovy Decl.
¶¶ 18-20 & Ex. 3.) 
 
The Moto Entities did not remit all the monies owed to
plaintiff which the Moto Entities collected. (Lovy Decl. ¶ 38.) Based on
plaintiff’s review of balance sheets, income statements, and monthly reports
from the Moto Entities showing collections received and amounts owed under
leases, as of the end of March 2024, the Moto Entities withheld $4,909,047 from
plaintiff. (Lovy Decl. ¶¶ 35-40 & Exs. 8-10.) One of the last payments
plaintiff received from the Moto Entities was on August 16, 2023 in the amount
of $267,501.23. (Lovy Decl. ¶ 41.) The value of the Moto Entities has decreased
from $17,521,160 in June 2022 to $3,296,368 in March 2024, a difference of
$13,594,792. (Lovy Decl. ¶ 38.) 
 
Based on bank records produced by the Moto Entities, since
June 2022, the Moto Entities have transferred $3,055,405.77 to themselves,
including defendants M-Nation, Pico, and Westwood, which are entities related
to and under the control of the Moto defendants. (Lovy Decl. ¶¶ 44-46 & Ex.
12.) Since the Moto Entities’ last payment in August 2023, $1,246,757.20 has
been transferred to themselves and the entities they control. (Lovy Decl. ¶ 47.)

 
In deposition on June 18, 2024, Emre Ucer, Chief Executive
Officer of the Moto Entities, testified that for about a year, the Moto
Entities’ revenues have been insufficient to cover their liabilities. (Cummings
Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 20 at 50:15-51:17.) While the Moto Entities have been
unable to cover their liabilities, they were transferring money to related
entities instead of to plaintiff to fund operations. (Cummings Decl. ¶ 5 &
Ex. 20 at 128:7-130:11, 228:4-10, 291:17-25, 292:10-20.) The Moto Entities are
no longer able to generate loan origination income, its main source of liquidity,
because it lost all outside funding. (Cummings Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 20 at 45:1-46:8,
49:25-50:2, 50:10-20, 68:10-13, 321:1-3.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, plaintiff has demonstrated that they
have a right to collect on the Moto Entities’ accounts under the Credit
Agreement but that the Moto Entities have withheld monies owed to plaintiff
because liabilities exceed revenues. “The term ‘insolvency’ has two generally
accepted definitions: (1) where there is an excess of liabilities over assets;
and (2) where one is unable to meet his obligations as they mature in the ordinary
course of business.” (California Retail Portfolio Fund GMBH & Co. KG v.
Hopkins Real Estate Group (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 849, 859-60.) Considering
the Moto Entities’ admission that their liabilities exceed their revenues, that
they have lost their main source of liquidity, and that they are using monies
owed to plaintiff to fund operations, plaintiff has demonstrated that the Moto
Entities’ property is in danger of dissipation, such that a receiver is
necessary to preserve plaintiff’s collateral. 
 
Defendants do not dispute that plaintiff has a right to
collect on defendants’ accounts or that they are insolvent. Rather, defendants
argue that plaintiff’s property is not at risk of being lost, removed, or
materially injured because the Court already granted a temporary restraining
order (“TRO”) on July 12, 2024 and because a motion for preliminary injunction
is set for August 28, 2024. (Cummings Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. 26.) However, even
with entry of the TRO or a more lasting preliminary injunction, defendants
present no evidence to meaningfully counter plaintiff’s showing that the assets
are in danger of dissipation. Defendants’ counsel only avers that “[a]lthough
it took Moto some time to comply with the order, on July 25th, 2025 [sic], Moto
confirmed that it is transferring all of the non-DACA [i.e., plaintiff’s
account where payments from Moto Entities are to be deposited] manual payments
to MBL within one business day.” (Rokita Decl. ¶ 5; Lovy Decl. ¶ 50 [defining
DACA].) This averment does nothing to indicate that the more than $13 million
diminution in plaintiff’s collateral is likely to reverse or that the Moto
Entities are likely to start earning revenues in excess of liabilities.
Further, without information from the Moto Entities gained through a receiver, it
would seem that plaintiff has no way to know or verify what collections the
Moto Entities are receiving and whether such collections are being deposited
into plaintiff’s accounts, as required under the Credit Agreement. (Lovy Decl.
¶ 54.)
 
Defendants also argue that the Credit Agreement allows
plaintiff to replace Moto Servicing with a third-party servicer. (See Lovy
Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 1 at § 5.07(e).) While that may be true, plaintiff has
sufficiently demonstrated transfer of loan servicing to a third-party is not a
viable alternative to the requested receivership in light of defendants’ failure
to meaningfully facilitate any such transfer successfully to date.  (See Cummings Decl. ¶¶ 13, 17
& Exs. 24, 27; Cummings Supp. Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 34; see also Lovy
Decl. ¶ 24.)
 
Plaintiff nominates Christopher Neilson, Managing Partner of
Trigild IVL, LLC as the receiver. Neilson’s experience as a receiver appears to
predominantly concern management of real property, and it is not clear that he
personally (as opposed to his firm) possesses the necessary experience
concerning loan servicing and management of the type of asset portfolio at
issue here. (See Neilson Decl. ¶¶ 3-6 & Ex. A.) Notably, however, defendants
do not dispute Mr. Neilson’s qualifications to serve. Defendants only object to
the $400 hourly rate proposed by Mr. Neilson. Any financial burden imposed by
the appointment of the proposed receiver is outweighed by the need for such an
appointment due to the insolvency of the Moto Entities during the past year and
failure to account for funds owed to plaintiff. 
At the hearing, the Court will hear from the parties whether Neilson’s
appointment as the Receiver in this matter is appropriate.
 
Irrespective of whom the Court appoints, the Receiver must
file an undertaking. (CCP § 567(b); Rule of Court 3.1178.) Plaintiff proposes an
undertaking of $10,000. (Proposed Order ¶ 2.) That amount appears reasonable.  Further, before signing any Order appointing
a Receiver, the Court raises the following questions and concerns regarding the
proposed order, lodged July 24, 2024:
 

Why does the proposed
     Order fail to define “Defendants” when that term is used throughout?

 

Paragraph 3: Why does the
     definition of Receivership Estate exclude property of defendants UCER,
     LLC, Pico Mobility, LLC and Focus Builders, Inc.?  What evidence supports inclusion of the
     so-called related entities and defendants Westwood, M-Nation, Ucer LLC,
     and Focus Builders, Inc. within the definition of the “Receivership Estate”
     and “Moto Entities”?

 

Paragraph 5(ii): If the
     Receiver’s powers are to include “Operating the Moto Entities,” should the
     definition of Receivership Estate include the Moto Entities
     themselves?  Alternatively, if the
     Receivership Estate is limited to the property of the Moto Entities, what
     authority does the Court have to empower the Receiver to control and operate
     the Moto Entities themselves?

 

Paragraph 7:  To whom is the Receiver required to
     “serve” the required monthly statements? 
     Why is the Receiver not additionally required to provide the Court
     with periodic reports concerning the activities and operations of the
     receiver beyond a mere reporting of “fees and administrative expenses”
     contemplated by the monthly statements? Alternatively, should paragraph
     5(viiii) be rewritten to reflect the Receivers’ duty to provide
     information to the Court as requested and deemed appropriate by the
     Court?

 

Paragraph 10: What
     authority does this Court have to order non-party banks to act?

 

Paragraph 11: Why should
     this Court blindly extend blanket judicial immunity to the Receiver when
     existing statutes and case law provide for protections from certain
     liability for a court-appointed Receiver?

 

Paragraph 15:  What is the authority for the Court to provide
     such broad, undefined and potentially impermissible “Additional Powers” to
     the Receiver?
