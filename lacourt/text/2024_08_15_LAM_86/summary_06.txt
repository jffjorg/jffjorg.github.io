And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for relief filed by Bridget Blaney, who was shot by a deputy sheriff on November 26, 2022. Blaney's claim was not filed with the County of Los Angeles until June 12, 2023, more than six months after the shooting. Blaney's counsel claims that they did not calendar the 6-month deadline to serve the government claim, but provides no further explanation or evidence to support this claim. The judge finds that Blaney's counsel did not exercise reasonable diligence in investigating and pursuing the claim, and therefore does not qualify for relief under Government Code § 946.6. The judge also finds that Blaney was not physically incapacitated and was able to retain counsel shortly after the shooting, which suggests that physical incapacity was not an impediment to making a timely government claim. The petition is denied.
