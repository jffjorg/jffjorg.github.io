FOURTH AMENDED PETITION
 
Date:               8/15/24
(9:30 AM)
Case:                           Marvin Brown v.
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (22STCP02545)

TENTATIVE RULING:
            
The Demurrer to Fourth Amended Petition filed by City of Los
Angeles by and through its Department of Water and Power (joined by Pandora
Consulting Associates, LLC) is SUSTAINED. The Motion to Strike Fourth Amended
Petition filed by City of Los Angeles by and through its Department of Water
and Power (joined by Pandora Consulting Associates, LLC) is DENIED. 
 
Respondent City demurs to the first cause of action on the
ground that petitioner Brown lacks standing to sue on behalf of Maverick
Consulting Group, LLC (“Maverick”). In the operative Fourth Amended Petition
(“4AP”), Brown is named as a petitioner. (4AP ¶ 1.) Brown asserts standing as
the “Principal Consultant,” “Owner,” and “Managing Member” of co-petitioner Maverick.
(4AP ¶¶ 1, 28; see also Verification to 4AP.) Brown argues that he is
beneficially interested under CCP § 1086. 
 
On 3/20/24, the Court (Hon. Mary H. Strobel, presiding)
sustained the demurrer to the Second Amended Petition (“SAP”) with respect to
the first cause of action for “CCP 1085, Failure to Follow Tender Process, Rule
and Procedures” on the ground that Brown lacked standing to sue on behalf of
Maverick. (3/20/24 Minute Order at 4-5.) In the SAP, Brown asserted that he was
a consultant and managing member of Maverick. (Id. at 4.) Despite Brown’s
asserted positions at Maverick, the Court concluded that he did not allege
standing to sue on behalf of Maverick, stating: 
 
“A limited liability company [“LLC”] is
an entity distinct from its members.” (Corp. Code § 17701.04(a).) As a separate
legal entity, an LLC must sue on its own behalf. If it refuses to sue, the
member may bring a derivative suit on behalf of the entity. (See PacLink
Communications Int’l, Inc. v. Superior Court (Yeung) (2001) 90 Cal. App.
4th 958, 964-965.) Here, petitioner has not brought a derivative suit on behalf
of Maverick.”
 
(3/20/24 Minute Order at 4.) Judge Strobel’s reasoning
remains equally applicable to the 4AP. Maverick, not Brown, was the entity that
submitted a bid for RFP No. 90654. (4AP ¶¶ 13, 23, 38, 49, 54, 60.) The score
sheets and fee schedules attached to the 4AP indicate that the “proposer” who
submitted the bid was Maverick and not Brown. (4AP Exs. 1, 6, 2.) It is alleged
that DWP should have selected Maverick’s bid instead of the bid of Pandora
Consulting Associates, LLC (“Pandora”). (See 4AP ¶¶ 1-84.) 
 
Brown argues that he lost income, investment, and profits
because Maverick was not selected. However, this argument ignores the separate existence
of Maverick as an LLC. When the LLC is injured, the members cannot be directly
injured; any injury to the members, i.e. the diminution of their
membership interest, is incidental to the injury suffered by the LLC. (Holistic
Supplements, L.L.C. v. Stark (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 530, 543, quoting PacLink,
90 Cal.App.4th at 964.) Consequently, Brown lacks standing to bring an
individual cause of action. 
 
In Pandora’s joinder, Pandora argues that it should not be
named as a respondent, but instead as a real party in interest. (See 4AP
at 1:13-14 [naming Pandora as part of  Respondents/Defendants”].)
On 3/21/23, Judge Strobel also sustained the demurrer to the first cause of
action on the additional ground that Pandora needed to be named in the petition
as an indispensable party. (3/21/23 Minute Order at 5-6.) As Judge Strobel held:
“Petitioner seeks a writ that would directly harm Pandora’s interests in that
recommendation and contract award. Thus, Pandora claims an ‘interest relating
to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the
action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability
to protect that interest.’” (3/21/23 Minute Order at 6, citing CCP § 389(b).) 
 
However, being a real party in interest does not preclude Pandora
from having committed wrongdoing and being named as a respondent. A “real party
in interest” can be not only “anyone having a direct interest in the result,”
but also “the other party to the lawsuit or proceeding being challenged” or
“the real adverse party…in whose favor the act complained of has been done.” (Sonoma
County Nuclear Free Zone ‘86 v. Superior Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 167,
173.) Petitioner alleges that Pandora’s proposal contained “fraudulent
misrepresentations” and did not include an “all-inclusive price proposal” that
was required by the Request for Proposal. (4AP ¶¶ 6, 17, 18, 20.) The SAP thus
contains allegations of wrongdoing committed by Pandora. The fact that leave to
amend was granted for Pandora to be added as an indispensable party does not
preclude Pandora from being named as a respondent.
 
Based on the foregoing, City of Los Angeles’ demurrer to the
first cause of action as to petitioner Marvin Brown is SUSTAINED and OVERRULED
as to Pandora Consulting Associates, LLC’s inclusion in the Fourth Amended
Petition as a respondent. City of Los Angeles’ motion to strike is DENIED. 
 
As Brown fails to demonstrate how he can ever have standing
based on injury to Maverick, no leave to amend is allowed.  
 
Respondents City of Los Angeles and Pandora Consulting
Associates, LLC shall file an Answer no later than 10 calendar days hereof.
