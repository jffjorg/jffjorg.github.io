And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering an application for a right to attach order and temporary protective order brought by HSG (HK) Trading Limited against Vanilla Bay et al. The plaintiff has presented invoices for garments and the defendant has admitted owing the plaintiff $303,665.35. The judge grants the application in part, finding that the claim is one upon which attachment may be issued and that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim. However, the judge reduces the costs from $10,000 to $2,500 and does not grant the temporary protective order as proposed. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's assertion of prejudgment interest is unclear and does not include it in the amount to be attached. Finally, the judge orders that no writ of attachment shall issue until the plaintiff has posted a bond in the amount of $10,000.
