And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the petitioner, Jason Paul Catino, who is seeking to set aside an administrative decision suspending his driving privileges. The court finds that the Hearing Officer improperly acted as both advocate and adjudicator, in violation of the California Constitution and the California Supreme Court's holding in California DUI Lawyers Association v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2022).

The court notes that the Hearing Officer introduced evidence on behalf of the DMV and ruled on objections thereto, and that the Hearing Officer asked witness Arbab to obtain documents from her attorney and continued the hearing to allow for receipt of those documents. The court finds that these actions violated the due process rights of the petitioner, as the Hearing Officer was acting as both advocate and adjudicator.

The court also notes that the DMV knew it was permanently enjoined from having its hearing officers act as advocates and adjudicators, but nonetheless conducted the hearing in the instant matter with the Hearing Officer acting as advocate for the DMV and finder of fact. Therefore, the court grants the petition for writ of mandate and orders a new hearing.
