Petitioner
Jeffery Hohman petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent Los Angeles
County Civil Service Commission (“Commission”) to set aside the termination of
petitioner and restore him to his prior position of Deputy Sheriff with back
pay and interest.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
Petitioner
was hired by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (“Department”) in
2007. (AR 1195.) In 2012 and 2013, his two evaluations prior to the incident
leading to his discharge rated him as “Very Good.” (AR 120.) Petitioner was
initially assigned to Men’s Central Jail, Custody Division. (AR 1195.) In
August 2012 through August 2013, he was on loan to the Tactics and Survival
Unit (“TAS”) of the Training Bureau. (AR 1195, 1197.) While assigned to TAS, petitioner
was part of the Sheriff’s Response Team and the Marijuana Enforcement Team. (AR
1196.)
 
On
August 27, 2013, petitioner was administratively relieved of duty pending a
separate administrative investigation concerning a use of force incident at
Men’s Central Jail. (AR 1138.) He was assigned to home but was still receiving
pay from the Department in the classification of deputy sheriff. (AR 875,
1185.) After the investigation, he was discharged, effective February 13, 2014.
(AR 724.) The Civil
Service
Commission reduced the discharge to a 30-day suspension on November 18, 2015. (AR
121, 724.) The Department investigation into the use of force incident determined
that petitioner had used unreasonable force and failed to treat an inmate in a respectful
and courteous manner. (AR 724-25.)
 
When
petitioner was relieved of duty in August 2013, he was advised in writing that
“action in the capacity of a Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff beyond the
limited duties specifically assigned, along with the carrying of a concealed
firearm, is prohibited until reinstatement to standard duty status.” (AR 742.)
He understood that he was not allowed to take police action. (AR 1258-59.) He
understood that an individual without law enforcement powers could not carry a
concealed handgun without a proper permit, which petitioner did not have. (AR
1252-53.) He understood that it was a violation of Sheriff’s Department policy
for a deputy sheriff who had been relieved of duty to carry a concealed
firearm. (AR 1265-66.)
 
On
November 1, 2013, petitioner accompanied his girlfriend at the time, Elizabeth
Sthokal, to Keck USC Hospital to undergo surgery, which was scheduled for 9:00
a.m.; they left their house at approximately 6:00 a.m. (AR 120, 1050.) That
morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m., a shooting occurred at Los Angeles
International Airport, claiming the life of a TSA officer. (AR 586.) Petitioner
became aware of this information while at the hospital. (AR 1233.) Due to his
training and experience with the TAS Unit, petitioner understood that hospitals
are often secondary targets of terrorist attacks. (AR 1233.) Concerned that the
shooting at the airport was a terrorist attack, petitioner retrieved a handgun
from his vehicle. (AR 1233.) That handgun, as well as an AR-15 rifle and
several magazines containing over 30 rounds, were in his car because petitioner
was in the process of moving to Sthokal’s house. (AR 120, 395, 605, 608, 1234.)
 
After
Sthokal was released from the hospital, petitioner drove her to her home in the
city of Sierra Madre. (AR 98.) Sthokal had a big brace and a “pain pump” that
administered morphine and other sedatives through a catheter in her neck. (AR
120, 141.) They reached Sthokal’s house at approximately 2:00 p.m., just as the
elementary school across the street was letting out. (AR 120.) A car, driven by
an individual named Mr. Wolf, who, along with his wife and younger daughter,
was picking up his older daughter from school, was blocking Sthokal’s driveway.
(AR 120, 457, 461, 1234.) Petitioner stopped his car in the street and
approached Mr. Wolf’s car; Mrs. Wolf was standing outside the car on the
passenger side. (AR 457, 538.) Petitioner asked Ms. Wolf to move the car, and
then got into what he described as a “heated discussion” with Mr. Wolf who was
sitting in the driver’s seat. (AR 1237, 1240.) The man in the car said
something rude, and Hohman “said something rude back to him.” (AR 1242; see
also AR 129, 538, 543, 1241.) Despite allegations that petitioner kicked
the Wolfs’ car, there was no damage. (AR 131.)
 
Officer
Jonathan Hare, from the Sierra Madre Police Department, was at the school to
investigate an unrelated parking complaint, noticed petitioner’s vehicle in the
street, and stopped to investigate after hearing a noise that sounded like “two
cars maybe bumped each other,” resulting in a “loud bang.” (AR 481-82, 484.)
Hare requested some help over the radio; Sgt. Joe Ortiz responded. (AR 482.)
Hare then asked for petitioner’s identification, and petitioner informed Hare
that he was a deputy. (AR 482.) Ortiz asked petitioner if he had a gun on him,
and petitioner indicated he had a gun in his waistband, which Hare removed. (AR
482.) Petitioner at some point explained that he was on administrative leave.
(AR 476, 482.) Petitioner also informed Hare that he had more firearms in his
car. (AR 482.) Petitioner was detained during the search of his car but was not
arrested. (AR 121.)
 
During
the search of the vehicle, the following items were recovered: (1) a Stag Arms
Stag-15 (AR-15 Rifle); (2) a 60-round magazine inside the AR-15 Rifle, (3) a
Smith and Wesson 5 Shot .38 Caliber loaded revolver; (4) a Glock Model 25 9mm
loaded pistol; and (5) four 30-round magazines for the AR-15 Rifle. (AR 552,
563, 605, 608.) Petitioner was at all times cooperative and professional with
the Sierra Madre police officers. (AR 139.) Four months later, on February 25,
2014, petitioner was charged with Possession of an Assault Weapon, in violation
of Penal Code section 30605(a), a felony; two misdemeanor counts of Having
Concealed Firearm in Vehicle, in violation of Penal Code section 25400(a)(1);
and one misdemeanor count of Having Concealed Firearm on Person, in violation
of Penal Code section 25400(a)(2). (AR 631-32.) Petitioner pled nolo contendere
to one misdemeanor count of Having Concealed Firearm in Vehicle, and the court
dismissed the three remaining counts. (AR 640-41.)
 
Petitioner’s
work history with the Department included four commendations and one 30-day
suspension. (AR 140, 397-98.) On August 18, 2016, petitioner was served with a
Letter of Imposition for discharge, alleging the following:
 
1.

(AR 361-64.) After two
days of hearing, the Commission’s Hearing Officer issued his “Findings of Fact,
Conclusions and Recommended Decision” on March 7, 2022. (AR 119.) The
Hearing Officer wrote that petitioner had violated the policies on which the
first and second charges were based, but the Sheriff’s Department had not
proved the truth of the third charge. (AR 135-38, 142.) The Hearing Officer
concluded that being arrested on four charges and pleading nolo contendere to
one charge “does bring discredit upon Appellant and the Department.” (AR 127.)
He also concluded that petitioner “got carried away” during his interchange
with the other driver “by expressing anger and frustration and making angry
gestures.” (AR 137.) The Hearing Officer recommended a 30-day suspension. (AR
143.)
 
The Commission rejected the
Hearing Officer’s recommendation to reduce the discharge to a 30-day
suspension. (AR 195.) It issued revised conclusions of law to explain its
determination:
 
1. It is true that the
Appellant violated MPP 3-01/030.10, obedience to laws Regulations and Orders in
the he carried a concealed firearm upon his person despite being in relieved of
duty status. It is also true that the Appellant's emotional response to the
other driver violated MPP Section 3-01/030.05, General Behavior Section
3-01/030.15, Conduct Toward Others. This behavior merits some discipline.
 
2. Appellant physically
possessed the four weapons. This conduct is uncontested as the Appellant
admitted possessing the weapons and told responding officers exactly where to
find them in his vehicle. Appellant possessed the weapons with the belief that
said possession was legal because he was in the status of Deputy Sheriff, even
if ROD [i.e., Relieved of Duty], and not a civilian. Appellant was
moving the weapons and other possessions into his new residence, his then
girlfriend's house at the scene of the incident in Sierra Madre. Department
offered no evidence to disprove this fact. It is uncontested that moving these
weapons would have been legal and appropriate for a Deputy Sheriff not on ROD
status. The Appellant, however,
was on ROD status and should not have been in possession of the weapons.
 
3. The Department has not
proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant made false, incomplete
or untruthful statements during an administrative interview. Appellant provided
a clear and consistent account of the entire incident to Internal Affairs.
Department's four witnesses provided inconsistent, incomplete, self-interested
and at times unclear testimony regarding portions of the incident that the
Department unsuccessfully attempted to weave together into a coherent whole.
 
4. The discipline imposed
by the Department is proportionate to the offense. Discharge is the appropriate discipline.
 
(AR 194, emphasis in
original.)
 


II.      Procedural History
 
             On September 14, 2023, petitioner filed a Verified
Petition for Writ of Mandate. On August 29, 2022, real parties in interest County
of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department (collectively,
“Department”) filed an Answer. 
 
            On
April 12, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On May 10, 2024, the
Department filed an opposition. On May 28, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The
Court has received a hard copy of the joint appendix and an electronic copy of the
administrative record. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because the suspension of
petitioner from his position as Deputy Sheriff concerns a fundamental vested
right, the Court exercises its independent judgment on the administrative
findings. (See Wences v. City of
Los Angeles (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”
(Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The Court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant challenges “‘the sufficiency of the
evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309,
317.)  
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the Court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The interpretation of statute or regulation is a
question of law. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush
(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 71.)
 
“The
propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter vested
in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may not be disturbed unless
there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.” (Lake v. Civil Service
Commission (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228.) If reasonable minds can differ
with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action, there is no abuse of
discretion. (County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)
 
In
considering whether an abuse of discretion occurred, the “overriding
consideration … is the extent to which the employee’s conduct resulted in, or
if repeated is likely to result in, ‘[h]arm to the public service.’
[Citations.] Other relevant factors include the circumstances surrounding the
misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.” (Skelly v. State Personnel
Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 218.)
 
“[A
peace officer’s] job is a position of trust and the public has a right to the
highest standard of behavior from those they invest with the power and
authority of a law enforcement officer. Honesty, credibility and temperament
are crucial to the proper performance of an officer’s duties.” (Talmo v.
Civil Service Com. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 210, 231.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            Petitioner argues that the
Commission abused its discretion in sustaining his termination. “Judicial
interference with the agency’s assessment of a penalty ‘will only be sanctioned
when there is an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise of
discretion by the administrative agency.’” (Kazensky v. City of Merced
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 44, 54.) 
 
After
having reviewed the record, the Court finds that reasonable minds could agree
that a discharge, as opposed to a suspension, was appropriate. 
 
            Petitioner concedes that he signed a
form indicating that he was not permitted to carry a concealed firearm while on
Relieved of Duty status. (AR 742; Opening Br. at 17:1-2.) Petitioner does not dispute
that he was carrying a concealed firearm during the November 1, 2013 incident. (AR
482.) Petitioner contends that there were mitigating circumstances, namely a shooting
occurring the same morning, which caused him to grab a handgun, as he had
previously learned as a Deputy Sheriff that hospitals were often secondary targets
of terrorist attacks. (AR 1235.) Regardless of petitioner’s reasons for
carrying a concealed weapon, the Commission was entitled to find that some
discipline was warranted for having violated Manual of Policy and Procedures
(“MPP”) 3-01/030.10, which required obedience to all
lawful orders issued by any supervisor of higher rank.  (AR 385.) 
 
            Petitioner also contends that the
“emotional response” in his dispute with Mr. Wolf was nothing more than “yelling
and frustration out of care and concern for his girlfriend,” which were
“understandable emotions,” according to the Hearing Officer. 
(AR 136,
1237, 1240.) Had the “heated discussion” with Mr. Wolf (AR 1240) been the sole
basis for discipline, discharge arguably may have been excessive. However,
petitioner was also carrying a concealed firearm, which he was not permitted to
do under Relieved of Duty Status.
 
            Moreover, petitioner had three other
weapons in his vehicle. (AR 552, 563, 605, 608.) Petitioner contends that he
was under no order banning him from possessing such weapons. Petitioner
contends that the prohibition against carrying concealed weapons does not apply
to possession of other firearms not issued by the Department, according to
Department witnesses. (AR 912, 1144, 1154-55.) However, Penal Code section
25400(a)(1) provides: “A person is guilty of carrying a concealed firearm when
the person does any of the following: [¶] (1) Carries concealed within any
vehicle that is under the person’s control or direction any pistol, revolver,
or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person….” Petitioner was
not merely possessing non-Department-issued firearms; he was carrying them
concealed in a vehicle, which he was prohibited to do. (AR 742 [Relieved of
Duty form signed by petitioner].) 
 
Citing
Cartwright v. Board of Chiropractic Examiners (1976) 16 Cal.3d 762, 773,
petitioner contends that a plea of nolo contendere may not be used as grounds
for administrative discipline. Petitioner pled no contest to having violated
Penal Code section 25400(a)(1)—Having Concealed Firearm in Vehicle. (AR 631-32,
640-41.) However, the Commission did not base its discharge based on
petitioner’s no contest plea.  Rather, it
was the conduct leading to that conviction—the occurrence of which is not
disputed (see AR 123-136 [Hearing Officer’s recitation of petitioner’s
possession of firearms])—that the Commission cited as a basis for discipline.  (See AR 194 [discussing petitioner’s
possession of weapons].)
 
            Further, MPP 3.01/030.05 General
Behavior states: “A member shall not act or behave while on or off duty in such
a manner as to bring discredit upon himself or the Department. [¶] Members’
arrests and/or referrals for prosecution are an embarrassment to the Department
and bring discredit upon the member and the Department regardless of whether a
criminal case is filed and/or ultimately results in a conviction or plea
agreement.” Petitioner’s carrying of firearms within his vehicle after having
been prohibited from carrying a concealed firearm, while at the same time
getting into an emotional and heated discussion involving yelling with another
on the public street, brought discredit upon himself and the Department. 
 
            Under the totality of circumstances
discussed above, the Commission could have reasonably found that discharge was
appropriate. Consideration of the risk to the safety of the public is paramount
in determining whether the Commission manifestly abused its discretion in
discharging petitioner. (Skelly v. State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d
194, 218.) “The public is entitled to protection from unprofessional employees
whose conduct places people at risk of injury and the government at risk of
incurring liability.” (Hankla v. Long Beach Civil Service Com. (1995) 34
Cal.App.4th 1216, 1223.) Petitioner having been relieved of duty, petitioner
was not permitted to carry firearms on his person or his vehicle. Considering
that petitioner had access to firearms during his verbal dispute with a member
of the public, the public would rightly be concerned about petitioner’s
carrying of an unauthorized weapon.
 
            Even though the applicable
Guidelines for Discipline state that the “Disciplinary Options” for carrying an
unauthorized weapon is 3-20 days, conduct on or off duty which causes
embarrassment to the Department is subject to discharge. (AR 784.) Based on the
discredit petitioner’s behavior brought to the Department, imposing a penalty
of discharge was within the Department’s discretion. 
 
In
the alternative, petitioner contends that the Commission’s decision violates Topanga.
In Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974)
11 Cal.3d 506, the Supreme Court held that “implicit in [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which renders the
challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between
the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.” (Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at
515.) The Court explained that “among other functions, … findings enable the
reviewing court to trace and examine the agency's mode of analysis.” (Id.
at 516.)
 
“Administrative
agency findings are generally permitted considerable latitude with regard to
their precision, formality, and matters reasonably implied therein.” (Southern
Pacific Transportation Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1987) 191
Cal.App.3d 938, 954; see also Oduyale v. Cal. State Bd. of Pharmacy
(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 101, 113 [Topanga “does not require the Board to
outline all the reasons it opted not to impose a lesser form of discipline. It
is only required to justify the penalty imposed, including ‘a statement of the
factual and legal basis of the decision’”].)
 
            In its Revised Conclusion of Law,
the Commission set forth its finding that petitioner carried a concealed
firearm upon his person despite being in Relieved of Duty status, petitioner
had an emotional response to the other driver, and that petitioner was moving
firearms in his vehicle despite being in Relieved of Duty status. (AR 194.) The
Commission set forth the offenses upon which it based its imposition of
discipline. The Commission also cited the policies that petitioner violated. The
decision complies with Topanga.
V.      Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), real parties in interest County of Los Angeles and County
of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department shall
prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment.
