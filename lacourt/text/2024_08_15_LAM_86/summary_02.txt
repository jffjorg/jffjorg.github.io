Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the petition for a writ of mandate filed by Bridget Blaney, alleging that the County of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department failed to disclose certain records in response to her California Public Records Act (CPRA) request. The judge finds that respondents complied with the CPRA by producing some records in response to the request and delaying production of others due to ongoing criminal investigations. The judge also finds that the petition did not motivate respondents to produce additional records, as they had already produced responsive records in accordance with the CPRA and other applicable laws. Therefore, the judge does not find a prevailing party entitled to attorney's fees and costs.
