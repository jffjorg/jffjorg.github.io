  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Jason Paul Catino petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent Department
of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) to set aside an order suspending petitioner’s driving
privileges. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.        
Relevant
Provisions of the Financial Responsibility Law 

 
The
California Financial Responsibility Law (Veh. Code § 16000, et seq.)[1]
requires drivers of motor vehicles to be self-insured, to have insurance, or to
be otherwise financially responsible for damages caused by accidents. A driver
involved in an accident having caused damages over $1,000, death, or bodily
injury must report such accident to the DMV on an approved report form. (§
16000.) The law requires the driver to show proof of financial responsibility
at the time of the accident to the satisfaction of the department. (§
16050.)  
 
Section
16070 requires the DMV to suspend the driving privilege of a driver involved in
an accident described in section 16000 who fails to provide evidence of
financial responsibility, as required by section 16020, at the time of the
accident. (§ 16070(a).)
 
 
B.        
Incident,
Hearing, and Decision
 
On
August 8, 2023, petitioner was driving on Highway 101 when he rear-ended
Shahrzad Arbab. (AR 3.) The collision caused damage to Arbab’s car. (AR 3.) At
the time of the accident, it was estimated that the damage was over $1,000 and
Arbab claimed she was injured. (AR 8.)
 
Respondent
convened an administrative hearing on November 15, 2023 to determine whether petitioner
was involved in an accident in violation of the financial responsibility
requirement of section 16020. (AR 19.) Only one hearing officer, Linda
Talton-Shakur, participated in the hearing. (AR 19, 27.)
 
Petitioner
presented no evidence at the hearing.
 
The
Hearing Officer marked two exhibits (AR 20-21), which were petitioner’s driving
record as of October 18, 2023 (AR 7) and a Report of Traffic Accident Occurring
in California, otherwise known as an SR-1 form (AR 8). Both documents purport
to show that petitioner was involved in an accident on August 8, 2023; the SR-1
additionally alleges injury and damages in excess of $1,000. 
 
The
Hearing Officer also called Arbab to testify during the hearing. (AR 21.) Arbab
testified that petitioner was driving a rental vehicle and did not provide her
with his insurance information. (AR 21.) Arbab testified that damages were
“estimated [to be] four thousand to six thousand dollars” (AR 25) and that,
after the accident, she had “a little bit of a pain . . . but it’s okay. It’s
not that bad. It went away.” (AR 25-26.)
 
The
Hearing Officer then asked Arbab to obtain documents during the following
colloquy:
 
DRIVER
SAFETY HEARING OFFICER TALTON-SHAKUR: Okay. And so, you—did your attorney ever
give you copies of the damages that was (sic) estimated? You don’t have any
physical documents to show?
 
WITNESS
ARBAB: No, no.
 
DRIVER
SAFETY HEARING OFFICER TALTON-SHAKUR: Is it possible that you can contact your
lawyer for a copy of the damages to your vehicle, the estimate?
 
WITNESS
ARBAB: I could. Do you want his phone number?
 
DRIVER
SAFETY HEARING OFFICER TALTON-SHAKUR: I can’t call him to get them. You would
have to call him to get the estimate of the damages so you could submit it to—so
you can give it to me.
.
. . .
 
WITNESS
ARBAB: Anything else you need?
 
DRIVER
SAFETY HEARING OFFICER TALTON-SHAKUR: No. No, that was—only thing I need is
just the estimates of the damages to your vehicle.
 
(AR 26,
31.)
 
The
Hearing Officer excused the witness and entertained petitioner’s objections to
the marked exhibits. (AR 32-34.) She overruled all the objections and admitted
the documents into evidence. (AR 35.) She then chose a new hearing date “to
reconvene the case so I can obtain additional discovery from Ms. Arbab for her
to send the estimate of the repairs today.” (AR 35.)
 
The
Hearing Officer reconvened the hearing on November 21, 2023 and marked as
Exhibit 3 a November 17, 2023 email message from Ms. Arbab to the Hearing Officer
containing a “Preliminary Estimate” of repairs to a 2017 Audi Q3 in the amount
of $5,014.75. (AR 9-11, 38-39.) Petitioner objected on numerous grounds. (AR
39-40.) The Hearing Officer overruled the objections and admitted Exhibit 3
into evidence. (AR 40.) Petitioner provided no proof of financial
responsibility or evidence. (AR 41-42.)
 
On
November 29, 2023, respondent, by way of the Hearing Officer, issued a Notice
of Findings and Decision regarding Financial Responsibility. (AR 5.) Based on a
review of the evidence, respondent determined by a preponderance of the
evidence, that cause exists to suspend petitioner’s driving privilege pursuant
to sections 16070 and 16072. The Hearing Officer found that petitioner was the
driver or owner of a motor vehicle involved in an accident as described in
section 16000 which did not result in bodily injury or death but did cause
damage to the property of another person over $1,000. (AR 4.) The Hearing
Officer also found that petitioner was not covered by an acceptable form of
financial responsibility as described in section 16021 at the time of the
traffic accident for the vehicle involved in the accident. (AR 4.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
December 27, 2023, petitioner filed a verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. On
March 29, 2024, respondent filed an Answer. 
 
            On
January 8, 2024, the Court granted petitioner’s ex parte application to stay the
suspension of petitioner’s driver license pending entry of judgment in the
instant matter. 
 
            On
June 14, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On July 15, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On July 29, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court has
received the administrative record lodged by petitioner. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Petitioner seeks writ
relief under both CCP § 1085 and 1094.5.
 
A.          
CCP § 1085
 
CCP
§ 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency’s action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law.” (Ideal
Boat & Camper Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301,
311, citing Pomona Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 578, 584.) In independently reviewing legal questions, “[a]n
administrative agency’s interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is
entitled to consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State
Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
B.          
CCP § 1094.5
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are
whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a
fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse
of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).) “[T]he party challenging
the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda
v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817; see also Bixby v.
Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 139.)
 
When a driver petitions for a writ of mandate
following an order suspending his or her driver’s license, the trial court is
required to determine, based on its independent judgment, whether the weight of
the evidence supports the administrative decision. (Lake v. Reed (1997)
16 Cal.4th 448, 456.) Under the
independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.” (Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations. (Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of
Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868.)  However, “[i]n exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.” (Fukuda, 20 Cal.4th at
817, internal quotations omitted.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            Petitioner seeks to set aside the
administrative decision of the DMV to suspend his driving privileges. Petitioner
argues that the Hearing Officer improperly acted as both advocate and adjudicator
in handling the case, in contravention of the Court of Appeal’s holding in California
DUI Lawyers Assn. v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 517
(CDLA II).[2]
In CDLA II, the Court of Appeal held that “combining the roles of
advocate and adjudicator in a single person employed by the DMV violates due
process under the Fourteenth Amendment and the California constitution Article
I, section 7.” (CDLA II, 77 Cal.App.5th at 532.)
 
            The Court of Appeal in CDLA II
found that a hearing officer cannot serve as both advocate for the DMV and
decision maker in the same proceeding because it creates an unacceptable risk
of bias. “Although procedural fairness does not prohibit the combination of the
advocacy and adjudicatory functions within a single administrative agency,
tasking the same individual with both roles violates the minimum
constitutional standards of due process.” (CDLA II, 77 Cal.App.5th at
532, emphasis added.) Thus, in CDLA II, the Court of Appeal ordered that
the DMV be permanently enjoined from having its hearing officers function as
advocates and finders of fact in the same adversarial proceeding.[3]
(Id. at 538.)
 
            Respondent
maintains that the Hearing Officer may collect and develop evidence, as well as
render a final decision. (Today’s Fresh Start, Inc. v. Los Angeles County
Office of Education (2013) 57 Cal.4th 197, 220 (Today’s Fresh Start)
[“[A] legislature may adopt an administrative procedure in which the same
individual or entity is charged both with developing the facts and rendering a
final decision”]; Knudsen v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2024) 101
Cal.App.5th at 207 [“[A]s recognized by [CDLA II] itself, the same
agency employee may collect and develop evidence and act as the adjudicator in
a single case without offending due process”].) While this may be true, the
Court of Appeal has determined that a DMV hearing officer must refrain from advocating
on behalf of the DMV, including by presenting the DMV’s case. (CDLA II, 77
Cal.App.5th at 533, fn. 5.)
 
            During
the financial responsibility hearing, the Hearing Officer introduced into
evidence the SR-1 form indicating that Ms. Arbab’s vehicle was damaged in an
amount over $1,000 (Exhibit 2) and the “Preliminary Estimate” indicating that
the cost of repairs would be $5,014.75 (Exhibit 3). (AR 8-9, 20-21, 38-39.)  Petitioner raised numerous objections to
those documents, and the Hearing Officer admitted them into evidence of those
objections.  (AR 32-35; 39-40.)  By introducing the evidence in the case
against petitioner on behalf of the DMV and additionally ruling on any
objections thereto, the Hearing Officer impermissibly acted as both advocate for
the DMV and adjudicator as to what evidence may properly be considered.  In CDLA II, the Court of Appeal found
an “irreconcilable conflict between advocating for the agency on the one hand,
and being an impartial decision maker on the other” where the DMV had conceded its
policy and practice that, “as ‘trier of fact’ at the APS hearings, the hearing
officer rules on the admissibility of the documentation he or she offers as
evidence as ‘advocate for the [DMV]’ in support of the DMV's position at
the APS hearing.” (CDLA II, 77 Cal.App.5th at 527, 532 emphasis added.) 
 
            Further,
here, the Hearing Officer asked witness Arbab if she had any physical documents
evidencing the estimated damages to her vehicle, and, when Arbab responded no,
the Hearing Officer asked her to obtain documents from her attorney that were
not in the DMV’s possession. (AR 26, 31.) Indeed, after petitioner’s counsel
objected that Arbab’s testimony concerning damages were only estimates and not
“any actual exchange of funds” evidencing actual damages, the Hearing Officer
overruled counsel’s objection and continued the hearing to allow for the Hearing
Officer’s receipt of documents from Arbab. (AR 34-35.) By asking for additional
documents and continuing the hearing, the Hearing Officer developed the
evidentiary record beyond what was in the possession of the DMV.  The Hearing Officer appears to have done so in
order to establish the jurisdictional requirement of more than $1,000 in damage
to Arbab’s vehicle. (See Veh. Code § 16000(a).)  In so doing, the Hearing Officer acted as an
advocate for the DMV. The Hearing Officer therefore could not also act as
adjudicator by ruling on the evidentiary objections and deciding to suspend
petitioner’s driver license. (AR 3-5, 34-35, 40.)
 
            Respondent
argues that, even if the Hearing Officer committed error, petitioner is
required to show prejudice resulting from a procedural due process violation. “[P]rocedural
due process violations, even if proved, are subject to a harmless error
analysis,” i.e., a different outcome would have resulted in the absence
of the violation. (Hinrichs v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th
921, 928.)
 
            While it may be true that ordinarily
a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice or harm to prevail on a due process
claim, the Court of Appeal in CDLA II determined that tasking the hearing
officer with advocacy and fact-finding duties creates an unacceptable risk of
bias and renders any presumption of impartiality irrelevant. (CDLA II, 77
Cal.App.5th at 532.) Simply put, the Hearing Officer’s dual role at the hearing
“violate[d] the minimum constitutional standards of due process.” (Ibid.;
see also Knudsen, 101 Cal.App.4th at 83 [“California and federal cases
either expressly recognize or appear to assume that the violation of the due
process right to an impartial adjudicator, be it through a showing of actual
bias or through a showing that a constitutionally intolerable probability/risk
of bias exists, is deemed a structural error that requires reversal without
regard to the sufficiency of the evidence or the possibility of a harmless
error analysis”].) 
 
As
of July 20, 2022 at the latest, when the California Supreme Court deemed CDLA
II final, the DMV knew it was permanently enjoined from having its hearing
officers act as advocates and adjudicators. (CDLA II, 77 Cal.App.5th at
538.) Despite the injunction, the DMV conducted the hearing in the instant
matter with the Hearing Officer acting as advocate for the DMV and finder of
fact in the hearing.  Accordingly, petitioner
is entitled to a new hearing. (See Nightlife Partners v. City of Beverly
Hills (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 81, 98.) 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition for writ of mandate is GRANTED.
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), petitioner shall prepare, serve, and
ultimately file a proposed judgment and proposed writ of mandate.
 
            Petitioner requests attorney fees
pursuant to Government Code § 800. Under the statute, complainants who
demonstrate that findings in an administrative proceeding were the result of
arbitrary or capricious action by a public entity may 


collect
reasonable attorney’s fees not exceeding $7,500. Petitioner may seek fees in a
post-judgment motion.
