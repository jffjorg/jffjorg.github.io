And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the administrative record and the opening brief filed by the petitioner. The DMV suspended the petitioner's driver's license after they were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and refused to complete a chemical test. The judge finds that the DMV followed the correct procedure under the administrative per se law, which requires the immediate suspension of a driver's license if the person is driving with .08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in their blood. The petitioner does not challenge the findings that there was reasonable cause to believe they were driving under the influence, that the arrest was lawful, and that they were admonished on the consequences of refusing to complete a chemical test.
