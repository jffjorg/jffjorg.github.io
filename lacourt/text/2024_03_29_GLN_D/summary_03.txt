And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants defendant Mueller Industries, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against A to Z Restoration and Packing, Inc. (A to Z). The cross-complaint seeks equitable indemnity and declaratory relief. The judge finds that granting the motion is in the interest of justice and would promote judicial efficiency. The cross-complaint will be filed separately and deemed served on the current parties.

The judge also grants defendant's motion to continue the trial date currently set for May 20, 2024, to August 26, 2024. The trial date is advanced to August 15, 2024, for a final status conference. The parties are cautioned that the new trial date is firm and all trial-related deadlines and discovery cut-offs will be measured from the new trial date.

The judge finds that good cause exists to continue the trial date due to the addition of a new party, A to Z, and the need for discovery and preparation for trial. The judge also notes that the parties will not suffer any prejudice due to the brief continuance.
