```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable and to produce documents at the deposition without prejudice. The court orders the parties to meet and confer within five days concerning the conduct of a person most knowledgeable (PMK) deposition and production of documents at the deposition consistent with the court's standing order regarding discovery in Song-Beverly cases. The court also notes that the parties have already exceeded the categories ordinarily permitted for PMK deposition and that the court expects the parties to comply with the order and notice regarding discovery in Song-Beverly cases. The court further notes that the parties have not complied with the requirement of the order that any additional depositions may only be noticed and taken by stipulation or court order, via a motion upon a showing of good cause. The court's ruling is subject to change pending further consideration and argument.
