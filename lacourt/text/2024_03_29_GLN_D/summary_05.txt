And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is denying the motion for reconsideration brought by the defendant, Cahit Soykat dba Roma Pizza, in the case of A&T Advisors dba Anchor Bookkeeping v. Cahit Soykat dba Roma Pizza. The motion was filed on December 19, 2023, and seeks to reconsider the court's previous ruling on a demurrer to the complaint.

The court previously overruled the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action, and sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action with leave to amend. The court found that the complaint alleged each element of the subject fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and quantum meruit causes of action, and relied on legal authority under which an exception to the economic loss rule is recognized.

The defendant's motion for reconsideration failed to comply with the requirements of California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) § 1008, which requires a declaration stating what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. The court found that the defendant's declaration failed to provide any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would warrant reconsideration of the previous ruling.

The court also noted that the defendant's argument based on the economic loss rule was not raised at the previous hearing, and that the court's previous analysis based on Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, remains good law. The court further noted that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the opinion in Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App. 5th 828, but that the opinion remains persuasive authority pending review.

The court's ruling is final and will not be reconsidered.
