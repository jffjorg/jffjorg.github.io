```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights and has found that the transferor, Charles Antuna, has failed to provide proof of service showing that the interested parties, specifically the annuity company, have received appropriate notice of the petition hearing to object. As a result, the court is denying the petition without prejudice.

The court has also raised several questions for the petitioner and transferor to address, including what efforts were made to obtain the settlement agreement and copies of documents reflecting previous transfers, whether Antuna's only dependent is his wife, and whether Antuna is aware that this may realistically be the last opportunity to transfer funds from his annuity. The court has also noted that the non-assignment clause in the annuity contract does not bar the transfer, but that the court needs to confirm that the interested parties have received notice of the petition hearing to object.

The court is continuing to conduct and encourage audio or video appearances and is providing free audio and video appearances through LACourtConnect.
