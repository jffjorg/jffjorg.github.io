And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions: one to compel responses to special interrogatories and another to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena. The plaintiff, Vehanoosh Grigorian, is seeking to compel responses to special interrogatories and to compel the deposition of third-party Robert Ter-Oganesyan. The defendants, Alex Megeredchian, Megeredchian Law, and Law Offices of Alex Megeredchian, are seeking monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her former counsel for failing to timely respond to discovery requests.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories is moot since the plaintiff has already served verified responses to the discovery requests. The judge also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions against her former counsel for failing to timely respond to discovery requests.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena and orders Robert Ter-Oganesyan to appear and give testimony at a deposition to be conducted on a mutually agreeable date and time.

The judge denies the defendant's request for a contempt order and for forfeiture under CCP ยง 1992. The judge also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her former counsel.

The judge notes that the third-party deponent and counsel preparing the opposition to the motion concerning the subpoena should put the authority and evidentiary references in the body of the document, rather than in footnotes.
