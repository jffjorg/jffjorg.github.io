And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment and a motion to seal certain exhibits in a case involving a dispute between a doctor, Hooman Melamed, and a hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and its affiliates.

The doctor alleges that the hospital retaliated against him for making reports about patient safety and care, violating California Health and Safety Code ยง 1278.5. However, the court has found that the doctor has not presented sufficient evidence to support his claim.

The court has granted the hospital's motion for summary judgment, meaning that the case will be dismissed without going to trial. The court has also granted the hospital's motion to seal certain exhibits, which were deemed irrelevant to the motion for summary judgment.

The court has sustained the hospital's objections to certain exhibits and has found that the doctor's claims lack foundation and are based on hearsay. The court has also noted that the doctor has failed to present evidence linking the non-renewal of his directorship to the safety reports he made.
