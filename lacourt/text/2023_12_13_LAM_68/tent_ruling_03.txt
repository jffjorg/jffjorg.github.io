Hooman Melamed, M.D., vs. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, et
al., 22STCV20663
Moving Parties: Defendants Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, CFHS
Holdings dba Marina del Rey Hospital, the Medical Staff of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, and the Medical Staff of CFHS Holdings dba Marina del Rey Hospital

Responding Party: Plaintiff Hooman
Melamed, M.D.

I.                  
Background
Plaintiff Hooman Melamed, M.D.,
(Plaintiff) filed this case on June 24, 2022. Plaintiff has alleged one cause
of action against Defendants Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC), CFHS Holdings
dba Marina del Rey Hospital (MDR Hospital), the Medical Staff of Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center (CSMC Medical Staff), and the Medical Staff of CFHS Holdings dba
Marina del Rey Hospital (MDR Hospital Medical Staff) (collectively Defendants).
Plaintiff’s cause of action against Defendants is an alleged Violation of
Health and Safety Code § 1278.5.
Plaintiff holds medical staff
privileges at Marina del Rey Hospital. MDR Hospital is a distinct legal entity
from CSMC. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl., ¶¶ 6, 8.) Plaintiff was previously a member
of the CSMC Medical Staff, but since 2015, Plaintiff has continuously been a
member of the MDR Hospital Medical Staff. (Romero Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff has
never been an employee of CSMC or MDR Hospital. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl., ¶ 14.)
In February 2016, Plaintiff entered
into a one-year Directorship Agreement with MDR Hospital to serve as the
Director of Scoliosis. (Laguana-Kennedy Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. A.) In August 2017,
Plaintiff and MDR Hospital entered into a new Directorship Agreement for a
two-year term. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl., ¶ 18, Ex. B.) Like the first agreement,
this one provided that it could be extended for a period of one year “but only
upon mutual written agreement of the parties.” (Id.) After a couple of
extensions provided by amendments, the Directorship Agreement was extended for
another year with an expiration of July 31, 2021. (Id., ¶ 23, Ex. D.)
The only parties to the
Directorship Agreement were Plaintiff and MDR Hospital. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl.,
¶ 31, Exs. B-D.) Under the terms of the Agreement, Plaintiff was to submit
monthly activity logs detailing his work for the directorship. (Id., ¶
20, Ex. B.) He only submitted logs for September 2017 through May 2018. (Id.,
¶ 24.) On July 1, 2021, Vice President, Hospital Operations and Chief Operating
Officer of MDR Hospital, Joanne Laguna-Kennedy was reviewing Plaintiff’s
Directorship Agreement and found that no activity logs had been submitted in
three years. (Id., ¶ 28.) She decided then to allow the Directorship
Agreement to expire and notified Plaintiff of this. (Id., ¶ 31, Ex. E.)
This was an MDR Hospital decision. CSMC, the CSMC Medical Staff, and the MDR
Hospital Medical Staff had no involvement. (Id., ¶¶ 30-31.)
Plaintiff alleges that he made 43
reports concerning patient safety and care from August 2016 through May 2,
2022. (FAC, ¶ 6.) Four reports were made in the 120 days priors to July 1,
2021. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl., ¶ 35.) Ms. Laguna-Kennedy indicates that she was either
not aware of the reports or did not consider them when making her decision to
terminate the directorship. (Id., ¶ 36.) Plaintiff also alleges that he
was subject to false accusations and threats made against him (FAC, ¶ 15), though
the negative peer reviews are the only evidence that he provides for this
allegation. 
While a member of the MDR Hospital
Medical Staff, Plaintiff has not faced any disciplinary action. (Romero Decl.,
¶¶ 6-7.)

Defendants’ Motion to Seal Certain
Exhibits
Defendants have filed a motion to
seal Plaintiff’s Exhibits 71 through 84 that were lodged conditionally under
seal with the Melamed Declaration as part of Plaintiff’s opposition. Defendants
filed this motion pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court 2.550 and 2551, Cal. Evidence
Code § 1157, Sections 14.2 and 14.3 of the MDR Hospital Medical Staff’s Bylaws,
and the May 24, 2023, Stipulated Protective Order in this case. Defendants have
filed this motion to seal on the basis that the documents contain confidential
peer review communications and were so designated under the protective order.
The Court grants Defendant’s motion
to seal, though the Court sustained Defendant’s evidentiary objections to
Exhibits 71 through 84 on the basis that they are irrelevant.
IV.            
Analysis
a.     
Standard for Summary Judgment
The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication
is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show
evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary
dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.”¿ (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)¿ 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)¿ 
When interpreting § 437c, courts have held that a
three-step analysis is required: (1) Identify the issues framed by the
pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by
establishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis
for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent’s pleading;
(2) Determine whether the moving party’s showing has established facts which
negate the opponent’s claim and justify a judgment in movant’s favor; and (3) Determine
whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material
factual issue. (AARTS Production, Inc. v. Crocker National Bank (1986)
179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065.)¿¿ 
Summary Judgment may be granted only where all the
supporting and opposition papers show there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment “as a matter of
law.” (CCP § 437c(c).)¿¿ 
As a result, the Plaintiff “must present evidence that
would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact
more likely than not—otherwise, he would not be entitled to judgment as a
matter of law but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 851, fns. omitted; Oldcastle
Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554,
562-563.)¿¿ 
The Defendant need only show the existence of a triable
issue of material fact. (Union Bank v. Super Ct. (Demetry) (1995)
31 Cal.4th 573, 590; see Lopez v. SuperCt. (Friedman Bros. Invest. Co.) (1996)
45 Cal.4th 705, 713; Leslie G. v. Perfy & Assocs. (1996) 43 Cal.4th 472, 482.) Summary
judgment would not be proper where the facts support a triable issue of fact.¿ 
b.     
Issues for Summary Judgment
                                                             
i.     
The Section 1278.5 Claim
Defendants move for summary judgment against Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action for Violation of
Health and Safety Code § 1278.5 on
the basis that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case because he has
never been subject to disciplinary action against his privileges, nor have his
privileges been materially affected. Defendants also argue that there is no
causal link between Plaintiff’s alleged reports and any claimed retaliatory
acts. Further, Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff could establish a prima
facie case, Defendants’ actions were based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory
reasons. Finally, regardless of their other arguments, summary judgment is
warranted for CSMC and the CSMC Medical Staff because neither Defendant had any
involvement in the alleged retaliatory acts.
When
analyzing a Section 1278.5 claim on a motion for summary judgment, California
courts apply the McDonnell Douglas framework set forth by the Supreme
Court. (Scheer v. Regents of the University of California (2022) 76
Cal.App.5th 904, review denied (July 13, 2022); see also McDonnell Douglas,
supra, 411 U.S. at p. 802.) Under the McDonnell Douglas
framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case. (Scheer,
at p. 910 [citing McDonnell Douglas, at p. 802].) If the plaintiff
satisfies this burden, then the burden shifts to the defendant to “articulat[e]
a legitimate reason for taking the challenged adverse . . . action.” (Id.)
If the defendant satisfies its burden, then the burden shifts back to the
plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer’s “legitimate reason is a pretext
for discrimination or retaliation.” (Scheer, at p. 910 (citing McDonnell
Douglas, at p. 804).)
To
establish a prima facie case under Section 1278.5, Plaintiff must show: (1) he
engaged in a protected activity; (2) a health facility subjected him to
“discriminatory or retaliatory treatment” as defined by the statute; and (3) a
causal link between his protected activity and the discriminatory or
retaliatory treatment. (St. Myers v. Dignity Health (2019) 44
Cal.App.5th 301, 314.)
Section
1278.5(b)(1)(A) prohibits a health care facility from “discriminat[ing] or
retaliat[ing], in any manner, against a patient, employee, member of the
medical staff, or other health care worker of the health facility because that
person” has “[p]resented a grievance, complaint, or report to the facility.”
“Discriminatory treatment” is defined under Section 1278.5(d)(2) as follows: 
“For
purposes of this section, discriminatory treatment of an employee, member of
the medical staff, or any other health care worker includes, but is not limited
to, discharge, demotion, suspension, or any unfavorable changes in, or breach
of, the terms or conditions of a contract, employment, or privileges of the
employee, member of the medical staff, or any other health care worker of the
health care facility, or the threat of any of these actions.”
(Health & Saf.
Code, § 1278.5(d)(2).)

            Plaintiff
alleges in his complaint that Defendants let his directorship expire because he
made 43 reports regarding unsafe patient care and conditions at the hospital.
Plaintiff argues that letting his directorship expire constitutes
discriminatory or retaliatory treatment. He claims that there is a link between
the expiration of the directorship and the safety reports that he made.
            First, the
Directorship Agreement was between Plaintiff and MDR Hospital. The other three
Defendants were not involved for purposes of Plaintiff’s Section 1278.5 cause
of action against Defendants for the termination of the directorship.
Therefore, summary judgment is granted in favor Defendants CSMC, CSMC Medical
Staff, and MDR Medical Staff, as they were not parties to the Directorship
Agreement.
            Next, Defendants
argue that the Directorship Agreement between Plaintiff and MDR Hospital was
for a fixed term, with the option to extend the agreement for a one-year period
“upon the mutual written agreement of the parties.” (UMF 8, 48, 111, 172, 201.)
Plaintiff argues that the agreement had an implied term of automatic renewal,
but this assertion is not supported by the evidence, as the second amendment to
the agreement, which was signed by Plaintiff, clearly states that the
directorship was for a period of one year and had an expiration date of July
31, 2021. (Defendants’ Appendix of Exs., Ex. C.) There is no evidence to
support Plaintiff’s argument that there were changes to the terms or conditions
of the Directorship Agreement. The hospital simply did not renew it. Further,
there is no evidence that the nonrenewal of the Directorship Agreement
otherwise had any impact on Plaintiff’s medical staff privileges. (UMF 79.)
            Even if the
nonrenewal of the Directorship Agreement was discriminatory conduct, Plaintiff
has presented no material evidence linking the nonrenewal to the safety reports
that Plaintiff had made. Section 1278.5(d)(1) provides a “rebuttable
presumption that discriminatory action was taken by the health facility, or by
the entity that owns or operates that health facility” if responsible staff had
knowledge of the employee’s complaint and the alleged discriminatory action
took place “within 120 days of the filing of the grievance or complaint by the
employee.” Only 4 of Plaintiff’s reports were made in the 120 days before the
expiration of his directorship. Of those, Ms. Laguna-Kennedy, who made the
decision to terminate the directorship, did not even know about three of the
reports at the time she made her decision. She did know about one of them, but
she has stated that she did not consider the email Plaintiff sent her when
making her decision about the directorship. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl., ¶ 36(d).) To
rebut the presumption that the expiration of the directorship was related to
Plaintiff’s reports, Defendants have provided evidence that MDR Hospital had legitimate
business reasons for allowing Plaintiff’s directorship to expire. Plaintiff had
not submitted a monthly activity log for the directorship since May 2018, which
was a condition of the Directorship Agreement. (Laguna-Kennedy Decl., ¶ 24.)
Plaintiff also attempts to link the
confidential peer review communications to the nonrenewal of the directorship,
but the Court found that these documents are irrelevant to the motion for
summary judgment because there is no evidence linking them to the Directorship
Agreement. Additionally, Plaintiff appears to argue that this peer reviews were
somehow a retaliatory action, but Plaintiff has provided no evidence that he
faced any negative consequences to his terms or conditions of employment based
on these peer reviews. Plaintiff also claims that Defendants blocked him from
being chief of surgery and from being on the pain committee (Melamed Decl., ¶
22), but these claims lack foundation and are based on hearsay, which is why
the Court sustained Defendants’ objections to this paragraph of the
declaration.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
has presented no evidence that there are material issues of triable fact
related to his Section 1278.5 claim against Defendants. He has failed to present
evidence that there is a sufficient nexus between the expiration of the
Directorship Agreement and the safety reports that he made. The Court grants
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.

judgment is GRANTED.
