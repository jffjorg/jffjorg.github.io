And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Bondit LLC, filed a lawsuit against defendants Logan Wood and Vertex Funding, LLC, alleging that they engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with loans made to third-party judgment debtors. The defendants demurred to all causes of action, arguing that they are immune from liability as agents of the judgment debtors.

The judge found that the plaintiff failed to plead the necessary elements of fraud, including that the defendants knew that the information they provided was false. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to plead with particularity the defendants' intent to defraud.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the fraud claims, including intentional misrepresentation, fraud by concealment, and negligent misrepresentation. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the claims under Business and Professions Code section 17200 and Penal Code section 496.

The plaintiff has 30 days to amend its complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the judge.
