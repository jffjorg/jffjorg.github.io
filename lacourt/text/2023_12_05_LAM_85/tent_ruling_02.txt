For some reason, the County set the motion to seal for hearing on February 1,
2023 even though it knew that the hearing on the motion to augment was set on
the instant date.  The court advances the
motion to seal hearing because it cannot hear the motion to augment without addressing
the sealing issue.


            [2] The
County miscite this as CCP section 1010.6(a)(4)(B).  Mot. at 9.


[3] Porterville
held that where there was no evidence
that any member of the city council consulted the city’s general plan amendment
EIR in evaluating a housing project’s MND, the EIR was inadmissible
extra-record evidence.  Id. at
894.
 


[4] Petitioners
also rely on section 21167.6(e)(7).  The County argues that provision does not
require drafts of an ordinance to be in the record.  Section 21167.6(e)(7) provides that the
record should include “[a]ll written evidence or correspondence submitted
to, or transferred from, the respondent public agency with respect to
compliance with this division or with respect to the project.” (emphasis
added).  There is no showing that draft
ordinances exchanged between the County and County Counsel were transfers to or
from the County, and Petitioners cite no authority that documents exchanged
between an agency and its attorneys must be included in the record.  Opp. at 7. 

Petitioners respond that the County wrongly assumes that
section 21167.6(e)(7) is limited to final documents and that its contention
based on transfers to in-house or outside lawyers rests on semantics rather
than reason.  Gallo v Superior Court,
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1375, 1380.  Reply
at 11-12.  
The court need not decide whether section 21167.6(e)(7) also requires inclusion of the drafts in Exhibits
1-20.

Petitioners also argue that the County cannot rely on the work product
doctrine.  Mot. at 14-15.  Although the County invoked the attorney work
product doctrine in a September 2023 email (Soghbatyan Decl., ¶29, Ex. 21, pp.
94-95), it does not rely on it now.
