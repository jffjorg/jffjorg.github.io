                [1] Burrell’s
brief in the trial notebook does not match the brief electronically filed with
the court.  The trial notebook also
contains exhibits that never were filed, and it fails to contain the City’s opposition
and request for judicial notice.  Further,
Burrell’s opening brief is unpaginated in violation of CRC 2.109.  Burrell’s counsel is admonished to follow the
CRC and the court’s directions for all future trial notebooks.

All further statutory references
are to the Government Code unless otherwise stated.


            [3]
The City requests judicial notice of (1) Burrell v. County, Case
No. 22STCV25606; and (2) the February 15, 2023 minute order in Burrell v.
County (RJN Ex. A).  The court
judicially notices the existence of Burrell v. County.  Evid. Code §452(d).  The request also is granted for the minute
order.  Evid. Code §452(d).  
            Burrell
fails to cite to any evidence in the filed version of his opening brief, which is
the only version that the court may consider. 
While the City cites the Petition, it is unverified and cannot be used
as evidence.  See CCP §446(a).  However, the facts of the case are not in
dispute, and for convenience the court will cite the evidence in the trial
notebook.
