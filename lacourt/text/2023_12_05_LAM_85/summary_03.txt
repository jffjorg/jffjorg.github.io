And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Burrell's petition for leave to present a late claim for damages against the City of Los Angeles. Burrell's claim was untimely and he failed to demonstrate that his failure to present the claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court finds that Burrell's failure to timely present his claim was not excusable and that the City would not be prejudiced by the denial of the petition. As a result, the court has denied Burrell's petition for leave to present a late claim.
