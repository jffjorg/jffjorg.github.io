And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is advancing the motion to seal hearing because it cannot hear the motion to augment without addressing the sealing issue. The County set the motion to seal hearing on February 1, 2023, despite knowing that the hearing on the motion to augment was set on the same date. The judge notes that the County miscited CCP section 1010.6(a)(4)(B) and argues that the County's interpretation of section 21167.6(e)(7) is incorrect. The judge also notes that the County invoked the attorney work product doctrine in a September 2023 email, but does not rely on it now. The judge will need to decide whether section 21167.6(e)(7) requires inclusion of drafts of ordinances in the record.
