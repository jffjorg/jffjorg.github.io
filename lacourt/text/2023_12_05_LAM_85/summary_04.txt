The judge admonishes Burrell's counsel to follow the court's directions and the rules of court for future trial notebooks. The judge grants the City's request for judicial notice of certain documents, including a minute order in a related case. The judge notes that Burrell failed to cite to any evidence in the filed version of his opening brief, but will consider the evidence in the trial notebook for convenience.
