 Case Number:  23STCP01030    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  85 
Dwayne
Burrell v. City of Los Angeles, 23STCP01030


Tentative
decision on petition for leave to file late claim: denied 




 
            
 
Petitioner Dwayne Burrell (“Burrell”) seeks leave to present
a late claim for damages against Respondent City of Los Angeles (“City”).
            The court has read and considered
the moving papers and opposition, as well as the version of Burrell’s moving
papers in the trial notebook,[1]
and renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner Burrell commenced this
action on April 3, 2023, seeking leave to present a late claim for damages against
the County.  The unverified Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On October 3, 2021, Burrell was traveling
down the street on a rideshare scooter at Harbor Transitway/37th St./USC
(“Intersection”).  He lost his balance on
concrete that was broken, defective, uneven, split, cracked, or fractured in an
uneven way.  Burrell’s injuries were
severe and likely caused permanent damage. 
The City is liable for this damage under Govt. Code sections 815.2, 820,
830, and 835.
            In February 2022, Burrell presented
a Claim for Damages to Los Angeles County. 
The County Claim was denied on April 18, 2022.
            On August 9, 2022, Burrell filed a
complaint against the County, Dwayne Burrell v. County of Los Angeles,
(“Burrell v. County”), Case No. 22STCV25606.  On August 16, 2022, the County informed him that
the City, not the County, controls the Intersection.  On August 18, 2022, at the County’s request,
Burrell filed a request to dismissal the County.  He also filed an amendment to the complaint
adding the City as a defendant.
            On February 15, 2023, the City
demurred to the complaint in Burrell v. County, for failure to bring a
timely claim under Govt. Code section 946.6. which the court sustained.  On February 16, 2023, Burrell filed a Claim
for Damages against the City.  The City
denied the claim on March 15, 2023.
            Burrell seeks leave to file a
complaint against the City within 30 days of an order to that effect.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            No proof of service for the Petition
is on file.  
 
            B. Applicable Law
            Under the Government Claims Act (the
“Act”), a plaintiff bringing suit for monetary damages against a public entity
or employees thereof must first present a claim to the public entity
(“government claim”) which must be acted upon or deemed rejected by the public
entity.  Govt. Code[2]
§§ 945.4, 950.2, 950.6(a).  To be timely,
a government claim for damages must be presented to the public entity within six
months of the date the cause of action accrued. 
§911.2. 
            If a plaintiff fails to file a
government claim within the six-month period, he or she may apply to the public
entity for permission to file a late claim. 
§911.4.  Such an application must
be presented within a reasonable time, and not later than one year after the
cause of action’s accrual.  §911.4(b).  
            If the public entity denies the
application for permission to file a late claim, the plaintiff may file a civil
petition for relief from section 945.4's requirement of timely claim
presentation prior to suit.  §946.6.  The petition must be filed within six months
after the application to the public entity is denied or deemed to be
denied.  §946.6(b). The petition must
show: (1) that an application was made to the public entity under section 911.4
and was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to timely present
the claim to the public entity within the time limit specified in section
911.2; and (3) the information required by section 910.  §946.6(b).




            The court shall grant relief only if
it finds that (1) the application to the public entity for leave to file a late
claim was made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after accrual of
the claim as specified in section 911.4(b), (2) was denied or deemed denied by
the public agency pursuant to section 911.6, and (3) one or more of the
following is applicable: (a) the failure to timely present the claim was
through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, unless the
public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the
claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of section
945.4; (b) the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss was a
minor during all of the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of
the claim; (c) the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss was
physically or mentally incapacitated during all of the time specified in
section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim and by reason of that
disability failed to present a claim during that time; or (d) the person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss died before the expiration of the
time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim.  §946.6(c).
 
            C. Statement of Facts[3]
            In both this case and Burrell v.
County, Burrell alleges that, on October 3, 2021, he was on a rideshare
scooter when he fell on broken, split, and uneven concrete at the Intersection.  RJN Ex. A.
            In
February 2022, Burrell presented a claim to the County.  RJN Ex. A. 
On March 2, 2022, the County’s insurance company sent a Notice of
Insufficiency asking for more information. 
TN Ex. 1.  On April 18, 2022, the
County denied the claim.  TN Ex. 2.
            On August 9, 2022, Burrell filed the
complaint in Burrell v. County. 
RJN Ex. A.  On August 16, 2022,
the County informed Burrell that the City controls the Intersection where his
injury occurred.  TN Ex. 4.  On August 18, 2022, pursuant to the County’s
request, Burrell dismissed the complaint against the County.  He also amended the complaint to name the
City as a defendant.  TN Exs. 4-5.  The City asked for several continuances to
file a responsive pleading.  TN Exs. 6-8.
            On January 12, 2023, the City
demurred to the complaint in Burrell v. County on the grounds that Burrell
had not presented the City with a timely claim for damages with the City under
section 911.2.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex 9.  Burrell filed an opposition.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex. 10.  He attached a copy of his County claim as
evidence, but the court could not consider it in a demurrer.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex. 10.  
            The City argued that filing a claim
with the wrong public entity was not a defense for failure to file a
claim.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex. 9.  Burrell argued that he complied with the
claims presentation requirement, and no prejudice has resulted to the
City.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex. 10.  
            On February 15, 2023, the court in Burrell
v. County sustained the City’s demurrer without leave to amend.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex. 11.  Burrell had never presented a claim to the
City and the court ruled that Burrell’s cited authority did not demonstrate
that presenting a claim to the wrong entity constitutes
substantial compliance with the claims presentation requirement.  RJN Ex. A; TN Ex. 11.  No authority suggested that the court could
relieve a plaintiff from claims presentation requirements in response to an
opposition to a demurrer.  RJN Ex. A; TN
Ex. 11.  
            On February 16, 2023, Burrell
presented a claim to the City.  TN Ex. 12.  On March 15, 2023, the City denied the claim
because it had not been made within one year of accrual on October 3, 2021.  TN Ex. 13. 
Burrell filed this Petition on April 3, 2023.  TN Ex. 14.
 
            D. Analysis
            Burrell seeks leave to present a
late claim to the City based on his injury at the Intersection.
            
            1. Accrual of the Claim
            A cause of action accrues at the
time a claim is complete with all of its elements.  Norgart v. Upjohn, (1999) 21 Cal.4th
383, 397.  An exception to this usual
rule exists where accrual is delayed until the plaintiff discovers, or has
reason to discover, the cause of action. 
Id.  A plaintiff has reason
to discover a cause of action when he or she “has reason to at least suspect a
factual basis for its elements.”  Id.             
            The parties agree that Burrell’s injury
occurred on October 3, 2021.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 1-2; Opp. at 2.  The claim accrued
on that date.
 
            2. Presentation of the Claim
            Section 911.2 mandates that claims
based on causes of action for death and personal injury must be presented “not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  To be timely, Burrell was required to present
his claim to the City within six months of October 3, 2021, or by April 3,
2022.  §911.2.
            Burrell filed the City claim on February
16, 2023, long after the April 3, 2022 deadline.  TN Ex. 12. 
Burrell did not present a timely claim to the City.
Burrell asserts that he presented a timely claim to the
County in February 2022, and that a claim to the wrong entity constitutes
substantial compliance with the claims presentation requirement.  Pet. Op. B. at 6.  This argument is frivolous. The County and
City are separate entities.  Burrell
cannot substantially comply with claim presentation requirements for the City
by presenting a claim to the County.
 
            3. Application for Leave to
Present a Late Claim
            If a plaintiff fails to file a
government claim within the six-month period, he or she may apply to the public
entity for permission to file a late claim.  §911.4. 
Such an application must be presented within a reasonable time, and not
later than one year after the cause of action’s accrual.  §911.4(b). 

            Burrell presented a claim to the
City on February 16, 2023, more than a year after the claim accrued on October
3, 2021.  TN Ex. 12.  Even if this claim is construed as an
application to present a late claim, it is time-barred.
Burrell notes that he added the City as a defendant in Burrell
v. County on August 18, 2022, which was within one year of the injury and
accrual of the cause of action.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 6.  That fact adds nothing to the
analysis.  A party must present a claim
to a government agency, which must be acted upon or deemed rejected by the
public entity, before filing suit.  §§ 945.4,
950.2, 950.6(a).
            
            4. The Petition is Timely



            If the public entity denies the
application for permission to file a late claim, the plaintiff may file a civil
petition for relief from section 945.4’s requirement of timely claim presentation
prior to suit.  §946.6.  The petition must be filed within six months
after the application to the public entity is denied or deemed to be denied.  §946.6(b).
            The City denied Burrell’s claim on
March 15, 2023.  TN Ex. 13.  Burrell filed the Petition a month later.  His Petition timely.
            
            5. The Failure to Timely Present
the Claim Was the Result of Mistake, Inadvertence, Surprise, or Excusable Neglect

            The court may grant relief if it
finds that the failure to timely present the claim was through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, unless the public entity
establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the court
relieves the petitioner from the requirements of section 945.4.  §946.6(c)(1).
            Timely compliance with the claims
presentation is a mandatory prerequisite to maintaining a cause of action
against a public entity and failure to file a claim is fatal to the claimant’s
cause of action.  Pacific Telegraph
& Telephone Co. v. County of Riverside, (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 83, 188; San
Leandro Police Officers Assoc. v. City of San Leandro, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d
553.  Ignorance of the claims filing
deadline is no excuse.  Harrison v.
Count of Del Norte, (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1, 7; Drummond v. County of
Fresno, (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1412. 
Excusable neglect is neglect which might have been the act of a
reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances.  Ebersol v. Cowan, (1983) 35 Cal.3d
427, 435.  Mere failure to discover a
fact does not constitute excusable neglect for failing to present a timely
claim; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to discover the fact
in the exercise of reasonable diligence. 
Munoz v. State of California, (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1783.  Excusable neglect is defined as an act or
omission that might be expected of a prudent person under similar
circumstances.  Department of Water
& Power v. Superior Court, (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1294.
            Burrell asserts there was no mistake,
inadvertence, disability, or excusable neglect because he filed his County claim
withing six months of accrual.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 5.  As discussed above, a
petitioner cannot demonstrate substantial compliance based on timely filing
with the wrong agency. 
            Burrell then asserts that it is the
City that made a mistake.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 7.  He added the City to Burrell v.
County within one year of the incident. 
Id.  Although the City received
the complaint in August 2022, it did not ask whether Burrell had filed a claim
against it until its February 2023 demurrer. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 7.  This was after
the one-year deadline to file a late claim application had passed.  Opp. at 3. 
As Burrell admits, the City had no duty to inform Burrell that he should
present a claim to it.  Pet. Op. Br. at
7.  
Moreover, as the City notes, Burrell presents no evidence
about any effort to determine who owns and controls the Intersection where his
injury occurred, or why he failed to know that it is owned and controlled by
the City.  Opp. at 5.  The County informed Burrell that the City controls
the Intersection, and therefore was the correct agency for a claim, on August
16, 2022.  TN Ex. 4. This was less than a
year after his October 3, 2021 injury.  While a claim against the City at that time
would have been untimely, it would not have been completely time-barred by section
911.4(b).  Yet, Burrell did nothing to
present a claim against the City until February 16, 2023. By then, it was too
late.
            Burrell asserts that no material
evidence was lost because of the delay. 
The Intersection has not changed since the injury and witnesses to the
incident are still available for interview. 
Burrell also has photographs of the Intersection from the day of the
injury.  Leave to present an untimely
claim would not prejudice the City’s ability to investigate or defend against
Burrell’s lawsuit.  Pet. Op Br. at 5, 8.
            Burrell misunderstands claims
against government agency.  The
government is immune from suit unless it waives that immunity, and the Act is a
limited waiver of the government’s immunity. 
Prejudice is only relevant to defeat a petition after the petitioner has
demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  §946.6(c)(1). 
A lack of prejudice is irrelevant if there is no excuse for the failure
to timely present the claim.  Black v.
County of Los Angeles, (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 670, 678.
            Burrell’s failure to timely present his
claim to the City was not due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The Petition for relief from claim
filing requirements is denied, both because (a) Burrell’s failure to present a timely
claim to the City was not due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect and (b) it is time-barred under section 911.4(b).
