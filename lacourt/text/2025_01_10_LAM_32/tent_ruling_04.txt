     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
advanced labs, inc.’s motion to compel
  further responses to special interrogatories (CRS# 7662)  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff Lynwood
Santa Fe, LLC (Lynwood) filed this action against Defendants Advanced Labs,
Inc. and Advanced Nutrients Ltd. for breach of lease and breach of guaranty
arising from unpaid rent.   
             On May 23, 2024, Defendants filed a
cross-complaint against Lynwood and Shaoul Levy, alleging fraud and unjust
enrichment. Defendants allege that they were fraudulently induced into signing
the commercial lease agreement by Lynwood and Lynwood’s manager (Levy), who
conspired with Defendants’ then-counsel, David Welch. 
            On December 2, 2024, Defendant
Advanced Labs, Inc. (Advanced Labs) filed the instant motion to compel Levy to
produce further responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 10, 11, and 16. Levy
filed his opposition on December 27, 2024. Advanced Labs filed its reply on
January 3, 2025.
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Advanced Labs has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement. (See Lee Decl.)
DISCUSSION            
I.
SROG Nos. 10 and 11
            SROG No. 10 asks Levy to identify
all tenants of Maywood from its inception. Levy identified Maywood L’Chaim as
the tenant. SROG No. 11 asks Levy to identify the attorney(s) who represented
each Maywood tenant in association with the tenant’s lease. Levy identified
Robert Finkle as Maywood L’Chaim’s attorney. 
            Advanced Labs argues that Levy
cannot justify his refusal to answer because his objections are without merit.
However, Levy did not refuse to answer the SROGs. He identified the tenant of
Maywood and the tenant’s attorney. Levy is entitled to assert objections to
preserve them while also providing a substantive response. 
Advanced Labs also contends that Levy did
not identify the current tenant of Maywood because an internet search revealed
that the business at the Maywood address is named “Cookies Los Angeles,” not
Maywood L’Chaim. (Lee Decl. ¶ 29, Ex. 17.) An unverified webpage is not
evidence that Levy is withholding information about the current tenant of
Maywood. Advanced Labs has no evidence that Maywood L’Chaim is not the current tenant
of Maywood.
Advanced Labs then argues, for the first
time in reply, that it is actually seeking information on a purported
assignment of the Maywood lease because Maywood L’Chaim was sold to different
owners. This information was not requested by the SROGs and was not mentioned
in the moving papers. Additionally, a change in Maywood L’Chaim’s ownership
does not change the fact that Maywood L’Chaim is the current tenant of the
Maywood property. Thus, Levy properly answered the SROGs as they were written.
If Advanced Labs seeks additional information, it should propound separate
interrogatories.    
            The motion is DENIED as to SROG Nos.
10 and 11.  
II.
SROG No. 16
             
SROG No. 16 asks Levy to “IDENTIFY all of YOUR COMPANIES in which PAPER
PLANES [Welch’s company] owns any ownership or other financial interest from
January 1, 2012 to the present time.” Levy objected to the request as
irrelevant, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and invading privacy. 
            The Court agrees that the request is
not relevant to the subject matter or reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) Advanced Labs is not
entitled to information on every venture involving Welch and Levy just because
this case involves one such venture. There is no indication that any venture
between Paper Planes and a Levy company is relevant to determining motive,
intent, knowledge, plan, or absence of mistake. (See Kirkland v. Superior
Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 

CONCLUSION
            Advanced Labs’ motion to compel
further responses is DENIED. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with
substantial justification.
