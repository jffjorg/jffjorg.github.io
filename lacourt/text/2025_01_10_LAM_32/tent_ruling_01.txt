SHAHRAM ELYASZADEH, et
  al.,
                        Cross-Complainants,
             v.
 
KRANE & SMITH, APC,
  et al.,
                        Cross-Defendants.


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 21, 2019, Krane &
Smith, APC (K&S) filed this action against Shahram Elyaszadeh (Elyaszadeh),
Yona Samih (Samih), and Lion Solar, LLC (Lion Solar), asserting (1) breach of
contract, (2) account stated, (3) open book account, (4) money due, and (5)
quantum meruit. 
            On November 13, 2019, Elyaszadeh,
Samih, Lion Solar, Sunrise Financial, LLC, and 26 Malibu, LLC filed a
cross-complaint against K&S and Marc Smith, asserting (1) legal malpractice
and (2) breach of fiduciary duty. 
            On November 13, 2024, K&S filed
the instant two motions to compel the depositions of Elyaszadeh and Samih.
Elyaszadeh and Samih filed their oppositions on December 27, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination . . . or
to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
DISCUSSION
            On October 14, 2024, counsel for
K&S emailed counsel for Elyaszadeh and Samih, inquiring as to available
deposition dates. (Brooks Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.) After this communication was
ignored, K&S issued Notices of Deposition setting the depositions for
November 14, 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. B.) Elyaszadeh and Samih objected
to the notices based on the unilaterally set date. (Id., ¶ 4, Ex. C.) On
November 5, 2024, counsel for K&S sent another email inquiring as to
alternative dates. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. D.) This communication was also
ignored. (Ibid.) This motion followed. 
            Counsel for Elyaszadeh and Samih
avers that he has met and conferred with K&S regarding the depositions and
explained that he was attempting to obtain available dates. (Kay Decl. ¶ 3.)
Mr. Kay does not deny ignoring the October 14 and November 5 emails from
K&S. Mr. Kay has attempted to obtain dates from Elyaszadeh and Samih “[o]n
numerous occasions over the past several months.” (Id., ¶ 4.) 
            The facts indicate that Elyaszadeh
and Samih have failed to appear for deposition despite being duly noticed.
Elyaszadeh and Samih have also ignored attempts to obtain their availability, and
their own counsel has been unable to ascertain any agreeable dates over the
span of several months. Thus, an order compelling the depositions is warranted.

K&S additionally requests sanctions
against Elyaszadeh and Samih. Sanctions are warranted against Elyaszadeh and
Samih as no substantial justification has been provided for their failure to appear
for deposition. Counsel for K&S claims to have spent 5 hours on both
motions at a rate of $500 per hour. (Brooks Decl. ¶ 10.) This is excessive
given the motions are simple and substantively identical. The Court finds that
3 hours at $350 per hour is reasonable. K&S also incurred a $60 filing fee.
(Id., ¶ 11.) Thus, total sanctions are $1,110.  
CONCLUSION
            Krane & Smith, APC’s motions to
compel depositions are GRANTED. Shahram Elyaszadeh and Yona Samih shall appear
for deposition on _________________, 2025. 
            The Court sanctions Elyaszadeh and
Samih in the total amount of $1,110, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
