And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Advanced Labs' motion to compel further responses from Shaoul Levy, the manager of Lynwood Santa Fe, LLC. Advanced Labs had requested that Levy provide more information in response to special interrogatories (SROGs) 10, 11, and 16. The judge found that Levy had already provided sufficient information in response to SROGs 10 and 11, and that Advanced Labs did not have evidence to support its claims that Levy was withholding information. The judge also found that SROG 16, which asked Levy to identify all companies in which Paper Planes, David Welch's company, had an ownership or financial interest, was irrelevant and overbroad. The judge concluded that Advanced Labs' motion to compel further responses was denied, and that sanctions were not warranted.
