            v.
 
NATIONAL GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et
  al., 
                        
                       Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  23STCV16760
  Hearing Date:  January 10, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions for terminating
  sanctions (CRS# 3036, 9485)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff
Adalberto Campos filed this action against various insurance companies,
asserting breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing. The complaint stems from Defendants’ alleged refusal to cover
an auto accident that Plaintiff was involved in. Specifically, Defendants
allegedly rescinded coverage based on Plaintiff’s purported failure to disclose
an additional driver (Daniel Campos) on the policy. Plaintiff alleges that
Daniel Campos was a minor at the time of the accident, was not an additional
driver, and was not driving or present at the time of the accident.  
            On October 16, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel further responses, ordering Defendants
National General Insurance Company (NGIC), Integon National Insurance Company
(Integon), and Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) to provide further
responses within 20 days. 
            On November 27, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant two motions for terminating sanctions against NGIC and
Allstate for their purported failure to abide by the Court’s October 16 order.
NGIC and Allstate filed a joint opposition on December 27, 2024. Plaintiff
filed his reply on January 2, 2025.    
LEGAL STANDARD 
The Court may impose monetary or
nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the discovery process is
defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized method of
discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a court order
for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb
misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery
process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached
that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163
Cal.App.3d 952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition
of nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court
order; and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) 
DISCUSSION
            The discovery at issue is
Plaintiff’s third set of special interrogatories. As stated above, the Court on
October 16, 2024 ordered Defendants to provide further responses to these
requests. However, Defendants actually produced supplemental responses on
October 15, 2024, the day before the ruling. (Tabone Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff’s
counsel avers that he found the amended responses to be evasive (ibid.),
but there is no indication that Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with
Defendants on the amended responses. Nor has Plaintiff filed a separate motion
to compel against the new responses. 
            Because Defendants have essentially
produced the supplemental responses ordered by the Court, there has not been an
intentional violation of a court order. To the extent the amended responses
were deficient, Plaintiff should have filed a corresponding motion to compel
after the requisite meet and confer. Terminating sanctions are only warranted
after escalating sanctions are insufficient to curb abuse. Thus, even if
Defendants had violated the October 16 order, this single violation would not
justify immediate terminating sanctions. Therefore, terminating sanctions are
unwarranted at this stage.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions for terminating
sanctions are DENIED.
