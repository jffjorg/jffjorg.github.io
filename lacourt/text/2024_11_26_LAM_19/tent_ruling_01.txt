  Case Number:  21STCV40937    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  19 SANCHEZ v.
NISSAN NORTH AMERICA 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Hearing
on Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (Res. ID: 122301378543) [Filed: 10/17/24] is
CONTINUED to February 10, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 19 of the Stanley
Mosk Courthouse.
 Counsel for
Plaintiff failed to file a declaration on mandatory judicial council form
MC-052. While a declaration of Nadia Yashar is attached to the motion papers
filed on October 17, 2024, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision
(c) requires a declaration on the mandatory judicial council form MC-052. (Cal.
R. Ct., 3.1362(c) [“The motion to be relieved as counsel must be accompanied by
a declaration on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form MC-052).”].) Moreover, the declaration
of Nadia Yashar does not state facts showing that either (1) that the service
address in the proof of service is Plaintiff’s current residence or business
address or (2) the service address is Plaintiff’s last known residence or
business address and Counsel has been unable to locate a more current address
after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of
the motion to be relieved. (Cal. R. Ct., 3.1362(d).) 
Additionally,
Section 1 of the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is
blank, and there is no indication that Counsel gave Plaintiff or Defendant
notice of the advanced hearing date. (See November 4, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
Counsel for
Plaintiff must file all new motion papers containing the new hearing date and
serve such papers on Plaintiff and all other parties in the manner prescribed
by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and to file proof of such
service.   
Counsel for
Plaintiff to give notice.
