And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel to February 10, 2025. The plaintiff's counsel failed to file a declaration on the mandatory judicial council form MC-052, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Additionally, the declaration does not state facts showing that the service address in the proof of service is the plaintiff's current or last known residence or business address. Furthermore, the notice of the advanced hearing date was not provided to the plaintiff or defendant. The plaintiff's counsel must file new motion papers with the new hearing date and serve them on all parties, and provide proof of service.
