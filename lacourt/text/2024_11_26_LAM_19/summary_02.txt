The lawsuit was related to alleged habitability violations at a rental property in Long Beach, California, where Tania and her family lived. The settlement provides for a payment of $75,000 to Tania, with $18,750 going to her attorney's fees. The judge has also approved the proposed order approving the compromise of the claim. The judge found that the settlement amount was reasonable given Tania's injuries and lack of medical expenses, and that the attorney's fees were reasonable. The court has also approved similar petitions filed by other minors involved in the same lawsuit.
