And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiff Eric West alleges claims of FEHA harassment and failure to prevent harassment against several defendants. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration of the case, citing an arbitration agreement signed by West as part of his employment. However, the judge has denied the motion, ruling that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) applies to the case. The judge found that a dispute did not arise until West filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in February 2024, which is after the EFAA's enactment date of March 3, 2022. The judge noted that the case is similar to Kader v. S. California Med. Ctr., Inc. (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 214, where the court held that a dispute did not arise until the plaintiff filed a complaint with the DFEH.
