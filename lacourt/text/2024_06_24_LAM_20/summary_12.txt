And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel arbitration is denied. The Plaintiff, Eric West, alleges claims for FEHA harassment and failure to prevent harassment against the Defendants, including Adams Hummus Bar JV, LLC, Mizlala Wine Bar, Inc., and others. The Defendants argue that the arbitration agreement signed by the Plaintiff is enforceable and that the EFAA (Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021) does not apply. The Court concludes that the EFAA applies because a dispute first arose when the Plaintiff filed his DFEH (Department of Fair Employment and Housing) complaint in February 2024, which is after the EFAA's enactment date of March 3, 2022. The Court finds that a dispute arises when one party asserts a right, claim, or demand, and the other side expresses disagreement or takes an adversarial posture.
