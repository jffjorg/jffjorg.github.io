 On December 27, 2023, Terrance Marshall, a pro per litigant, filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against numerous defendants for 1) Filing False Document; 2) Concealing Evidence; 3) Perjury; 4) Collusion; 5) Slander; 6) Libel; 7) Conspiracy; 8) Invasion of Privacy; 9) Negligence; 10) Illegal Eviction During a Moratorium; 11) Stalking; 12) Tampering of Witness; 13) Discrimination; 14) Harassment; 15) Computer Fraud. The allegations are difficult to understand, but this suit seems to primarily involve (a) a false proof of service used in furtherance of issuing a notice to vacate following an unlawful detainer action; (b) false statements made to damage Plaintiff while he was involved in a family court proceeding; (c) other improperities related to the family court proceedings.DemurrersDefendant Alissa DeVogel has filed a Demurrer to the entirety of the FAC.Defendants James Investment Partners, 5535 Carlton Way Partners, LP, CTM Apartment Services Corporation, Tracie Lackey, Andrew Gonzalez, and Bradley Boleman have filed a separate demurrer to the FAC.Because there is no opposition, the FAC is deemed abandoned.  (Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.)  The Demurrers are sustained.  The Request for Judicial Notice is granted.  Leave to amend will be discussed below. Sanctions Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against the demurring Defendants because of purportedly false statements made in connection with their meet and confer efforts. The Court has read and considered the Motions.  The Motions for Sanctions are denied.Amend Plaintiff seeks leave to file a Second Amended Complaint in which he seemingly seeks to add details to his allegations.The Court may, in the furtherance of justice, and upon any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473, 576.)  In general, California courts liberally exercise discretion to permit amendment of pleadings in light of a strong policy favoring resolution of all disputes between parties in the same action.  (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)  “[T]here is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments.”  (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.)  Pursuant to this policy, requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the Court, and the delay in seeking leave to amend will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is granted.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)  The decision on a motion for leave is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  (See generally Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶¶ 6:637 et seq.)Because this case is in its early stages and any prejudice would be minimal, the Court will allow Plaintiff to amend his pleadings.  The SAC is to be filed within ten days.  Any objections can be handled through a demurrer or other motion. The Motion is granted.DeVogel to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
