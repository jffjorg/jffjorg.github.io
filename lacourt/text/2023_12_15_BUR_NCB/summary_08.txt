And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of the plaintiffs to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case was originally dismissed on October 11, 2023 due to lack of proof of service. However, the plaintiffs' counsel, Jason Halpern, claims that the failure to respond was due to inadvertence, surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect. The judge finds that there is substantive merit to the motion and that it was timely brought within 6 months of the dismissal. Since the motion is unopposed, the judge grants the motion to vacate the dismissal. The case will be set for a Case Management Conference and OSC re: Failure to File Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint on February 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
