[1] According to the
Court’s written order on the motion to be relieved as counsel, Mr. Kolodzi
sought to be relieved as counsel because: “(1) since August 2, 2022, Defendant
and its principal Zohrab Sakrisyan failed to respond to Counsel’s request for
payment of attorney’s fees; (2) since August 2, 2022, Defendant failed to
respond to Counsel’s emails regarding the case; and (3) since September 14,
2022, Defendant failed to respond to Counsel’s request for a tendered
substitution of attorney, thus necessitating this motion.  (MC-052, §2.)”  (11/4/22 Order at p.1.)  


[2] The Court notes
that Defendant does not provide any documents with the reply brief regarding
updated Statement of Information pages. 
(Reply at p.5.)  Instead,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s evidence in opposition is insufficient to
show that the motion should be denied. 
Defendant also argues that the CSLB License pages show that Sarkisyan is
the only officer.  Finally, Defendant
argues that the information provided by Mr. Sarkisyan and his medical letters
show that there was a valid excuse for his failure to timely respond or act on
behalf of Defendant.
