Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the 1st cause of action with leave to amend. The 1st cause of action alleges that Defendant recklessly failed to ensure Decedent was not subjected to abuse and neglect, to create and update a care plan, to supervise and monitor him, to utilize alarms and put him in a bed with 2 working bed rails, to put him in the lowest position possible, to put a landing mat next to his bed, to change his position, and to send him to the emergency room. The judge found that Plaintiffs' allegations do not rise to the level of conscious or willful act of egregious neglect or abuse, and that the allegations may rise to a showing of negligence that Defendant and its staff failed to check in on Decedent regularly or provide extra precautions. The judge also overruled Defendant's demurrer to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action, which allege negligence and wrongful death, respectively. Finally, the judge took off-calendar Defendant's motion to strike the allegations requesting attorney's fees and punitive damages.
