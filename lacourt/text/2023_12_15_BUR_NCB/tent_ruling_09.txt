 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to consolidate cases



 
Defendant Gayane Sharyan (“Defendant”)
moves to consolidate cases 23BBCV01129 (Sharyan et al. v. Jones et al.)
and 23BBCV01275 (this action).  Both
cases are assigned to this Department B. 
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they
are in the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be
noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.” (Local Rule 3.3(g).) Here, the two cases have not
yet been related, which is required prior to consolidating the cases.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300.)  Rule 3.300(d) states that the “Notice of
Related Case must be filed in all
pending cases listed in the notice and must be served on all parties in those
cases.”  A Notice of Related Case was
filed in both actions. 
CCP §1048(a) provides that the Court may
order a joint trial on matters that “involv[e] a common question of law or
fact.” 
Both matters involve the same motor vehicle accident that occurred
on June 10, 2021.  The 23BBCV01129 action
was filed by Gayane Sharyan and Arsen Garibyan against Taylor Jones concerning
the subject car accident.  (The
23BBCV01129 action was dismissed with prejudice as filed by Arsen Garibyan
only.)  The 23BBCV01275 action was filed
by Taylor Jones against Gayane Sharyan only for the same accident.  Accordingly, these matters involve common
questions of law and fact such that consolidation is proper.  Thus, Defendant’s motion to consolidate is
granted.
            Pursuant to CCP § 1048, case 23BBCV01129
is consolidated with 23BBCV01275. Case 23BBCV01129 is the earlier filed case
and shall be deemed the lead case.  All
future papers are to be filed under the lead case number.  The April 24, 2025 Final Status Conference
and May 5, 2025 Jury Trial date shall now be under case number 23BBCV01129. 
Defendant Gayane
Sharyan is ordered to give notice of this order. 
 
Warning regarding
electronic appearances:  All software for remote or electronic
appearances is subject to malfunction based on system weakness and human error,
which can originate from any of the multiple parties participating each
morning. The seamless operation of the Court’s electronic appearance software
is dependent on numerous inconstant and fluctuating factors that may impact
whether you, or other counsel or the Court itself can be heard in a particular
case. Not all these factors are within the control of the courtroom staff. For
example, at times, the system traps participants in electronic purgatories
where they cannot be heard and where the courtroom staff is not aware of their
presence. If you call the courtroom, please be respectful of the fact that a
court hearing is going on, and that the courtroom staff is doing their best to
use an imperfect system. If it is truly important to you to be heard, please
show up to the courtroom in the normal way. Parking is free or reasonable
in Burbank.
