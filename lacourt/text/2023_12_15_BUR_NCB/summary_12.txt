Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company and Sunrise Ford of North Hollywood to the complaint filed by Maricela Rangel. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the 4th and 6th causes of action with leave to amend.

The Judge finds that the 5th cause of action for fraudulent concealment lacks specificity and fails to allege a duty to disclose on the part of Ford Motor Company. The Judge also finds that the 6th cause of action for negligent repair lacks specificity and fails to allege damages.

The Judge notes that the economic loss rule applies to the 6th cause of action and that Plaintiff must allege facts showing intentionality of the conduct and of the harm. The Judge also notes that the component exception may apply to the 6th cause of action, but Plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that Sunrise Ford negligently repaired or damaged a component part of the vehicle.

The Judge orders that the demurrer to the 5th and 6th causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
