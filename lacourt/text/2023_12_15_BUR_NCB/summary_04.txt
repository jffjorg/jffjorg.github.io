```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion for terminating sanctions against Nuha Barakat, as the delays in providing discovery responses were not willful and the defendant has eventually responded to the discovery requests. The judge has also denied the request for terminating sanctions based on Nuha Barakat's failure to timely pay sanctions, as the plaintiff may enforce the order through the execution of judgment laws.

The judge has granted the request for monetary sanctions against defense counsel, ordering them to pay $2,060 to the plaintiff. The judge has also ordered defense counsel to pay an additional $60 in filing fees. The judge has cautioned Nuha Barakat and her counsel to comply with discovery requests and check email folders for communications regarding this matter.

The judge has denied the motion for terminating sanctions, but has granted the request for monetary sanctions against defense counsel. The judge has also ordered defense counsel to pay an additional $60 in filing fees.
