Summary:
The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Burbank Unified School District's motion to sever the trial of each of the 10 Plaintiffs' claims and order separate trials for each Plaintiff. The Court has denied the motion, finding that the claims are not so distinct that separate trials are necessary. The Court will instead examine the order of witnesses at the final status conference to determine whether the trial should be bifurcated with respect to liability and damages. The Court has also granted Defendant's request to exceed the page limit by 20 pages for its consolidated motion for summary judgment against the 10 Plaintiffs.
