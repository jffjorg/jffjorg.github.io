BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Jamshid Nazarian, deceased
(“Decedent”), was an elder at all times relevant to this action.  Plaintiffs Carineh Nazarian and Gohar
Nazarian are the adult living daughters of Decedent.  Defendant DP Care, Inc. dba Casa Valle
(“Defendant”) is alleged to be the owner and operator of a congregate living
health facility located at 11321 Stagg Street, Sun Valley, California
91352.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant
had substantial caretaking and a custodial relationship with Decedent, assuming
significant responsibility for tending to his basic needs. 
Plaintiffs allege that on May 12, 2022,
Decedent fell and suffered a left hip displaced femur fracture and left knee
pain, such that he was admitted to Adventist Health Hospital.  He underwent total hip arthroplasty surgery
and was discharged with the diagnosis for acute kidney failure, Alzheimer’s
disease, COVID-19, dementia, fracture of neck of left femur, hemiplegia
affecting left side, hyperlipidemia, metabolic encephalopathy, and
pneumonia.  Because he needed healthcare
assistance, Carineh Nazarian selected Defendant, which only had a maximum of 6
residents at any time, to care for Decedent. 
Plaintiffs allege that Decedent was admitted to Defendant’s facility on
May 21, 2022 to receive healthcare and rehabilitative case and that Defendant
knew of his basic care needs, that he was a fall risk, had poor safety
awareness, cognitive deficits, he could not care for his own basic needs, etc.  (Compl., ¶¶15-16, 18, 20.)  Plaintiffs allege that despite this
knowledge, Defendant ignored the risk with not providing Decedent with basic
care and monitoring, and withheld care despite knowing his severe medical
conditions and reliance.  (Id.,
¶¶17, 19, 21.)  
Plaintiffs allege that on May 28, 2022, as
a result of Defendant’s withholding of care, Decedent suffered injury to his
skin on his buttocks from prolonged pressure on his skin.  (Id., ¶22.)  They allege as a result of Defendant’s
failure to provide care, he fell from his bed and fractured and dislocated his
left hip on June 2, 2022, which required two surgeries.  (Id., ¶¶23-26.)  Decedent thereafter lived in a skilled
nursing facility until his death on November 5, 2022.  (Id., ¶28.)  
The complaint, filed August 22, 2023,
alleges causes of action for: (1) statutory violation of California’s Elder and
Dependent Abuse Civil Protection Act (Wel. & Inst. Code, § 15600 et seq.);
(2) negligence; and (3) wrongful death.      
B.    
Motions on Calendar 
On October 9, 2023, Defendant filed a
demurrer and a motion to strike portions of the complaint. 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
opposition briefs.
On December 8, 2023, Defendant filed reply
briefs. 
DISCUSSION RE DEMURRER
            Defendant demurs
to the complaint, arguing that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to
establish a statutory violation for elder abuse.  
The Court of
Appeal in Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 404–405 discussed elder abuse as follows: 
The Elder Abuse Act makes certain enhanced remedies
available to a plaintiff who proves abuse of an elder, i.e., a “person residing
in this state, 65 years of age or older.” (Welf. & Inst.Code, § 15610.27.)
In particular, a plaintiff who proves “by clear and convincing evidence” both
that a defendant is liable for physical abuse, neglect or financial abuse (as
these terms are defined in the Act) and that the defendant is guilty of
“recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice” in the commission of such abuse may
recover attorney fees and costs. (Id., § 15657, subd.
(a).) On the same proof, a plaintiff who sues as the personal representative or
successor in interest of a deceased elder is partially relieved of the
limitation on damages imposed by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34 and may
recover damages for the decedent's predeath pain and suffering. (Welf. &
Inst.Code, § 15657, subd. (b).)
The Elder Abuse Act defines abuse as “[p]hysical
abuse, neglect, financial abuse, abandonment, isolation,
abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental
suffering” (Welf. & Inst.Code, § 15610.07, subd. (a), italics added); or
“[t]he deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are necessary
to avoid physical harm or mental suffering” (id., § 15610.07,
subd. (b)). The Act defines neglect as “[t]he negligent failure of any person
having the care or custody of an elder or a dependent adult to exercise that
degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would exercise.” (Id., § 15610.57, subd. (a)(1).) “Neglect includes, but
is not limited to, all of the following: [¶] (1) Failure to assist in personal
hygiene, or in the provision of food, clothing, or shelter. [¶] (2) Failure to
provide medical care for physical and mental health needs.... [¶] (3) Failure
to protect from health and safety hazards. [¶] (4) Failure to prevent
malnutrition or dehydration.” (Id., § 15610.57,
subd. (b).) In short, neglect as a form of abuse under the Elder Abuse Act
refers “to the failure of those responsible for attending to the basic needs
and comforts of elderly or dependent adults, regardless of their professional
standing, to carry out their custodial obligations.” (Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 34, 82
Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986 (Delaney ).) Thus,
when the medical care of an elder is at issue, “the statutory definition of
‘neglect’ speaks not of the undertaking of medical
services, but of the
failure to provide medical care.” (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 783, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290 (Covenant Care ); see also id. at p. 786, 11
Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290 [“statutory elder abuse may include the egregious
withholding of medical care for physical and mental health needs”].)
To recover the enhanced remedies available under the
Elder Abuse Act from a health care provider, a plaintiff must prove more than simple or even
gross negligence in the provider's care or custody of the elder. (Welf.
& Inst.Code, § 15657.2; Delaney, supra, 20
Cal.4th at p. 32, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986; Sababin
v. Superior Court (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 81, 88, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 266
(Sababin ).) The plaintiff must prove “by clear and convincing evidence”
that “the defendant has been guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or
malice in the commission of” the neglect. (Welf. & Inst.Code, §
15657.) Oppression, fraud and malice “involve ‘intentional,’ ‘willful,’ or
‘conscious' wrongdoing of a ‘despicable’ or ‘injurious' nature.” (Delaney, at p. 31, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986.)
Recklessness involves “ ‘deliberate disregard’ of the ‘high degree of
probability’ that an injury will occur” and “rises to the level of a ‘conscious
choice of a course of action ... with knowledge of the serious danger to others
involved in it.’ ” (Id. at pp. 31–32, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d
610, 971 P.2d 986.) Thus, the enhanced remedies are available only for “ ‘acts of
egregious abuse’ against elder and dependent adults.” (Id. at p. 35, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986; see
also Covenant Care, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 786, 11
Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290 [“statutory elder abuse may include the egregious
withholding of medical care for physical and mental health needs”].) In short,
“[i]n order to obtain the Act's heightened remedies, a plaintiff must allege
conduct essentially equivalent to conduct that would support recovery of
punitive damages.” (Covenant Care, at p.
789, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290.)
(Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise
Valley LLC (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 396, 404–405.) 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
allegations in the complaint fail to rise to the level of conscious or willful
act of egregious neglect, or abuse.  It
argues that Plaintiffs generally refer to Defendant’s withholding of care but
lacks specificity on a pattern of neglect and fails to plead facts at a
heightened pleading standard.  
            According to the allegations of the
complaint, Defendant knew of Decedent’s conditions regarding his hip, that he
presented a fall risk, that he had dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, and could
not care for his basic needs himself. 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant ignored the risk and withheld care,
such that he was left in a compromised state of being and at a risk of
injury.  In the 1st cause of
action, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant recklessly failed to ensure Decedent
was not subjected to abuse and neglect, to create and update a care plan, to
supervise and monitor him, to utilize alarms and put him in a bed with 2
working bed rails, to put him in the lowest position possible, to put a landing
mat next to his bed, to change his position, to send him to the emergency room,
etc.  (Compl., ¶38.)  While Plaintiffs have presented some examples
of what Defendant failed to do as a facility in general, they have not alleged
specific facts showing elder abuse or neglect in their particular care of
Decedent.  
Examples
of conduct sufficiently egregious to warrant the award of enhanced remedies
under the Elder Abuse Act include the following:
1) An 88-year-old woman with a broken
ankle was frequently left lying in her own urine and feces for extended periods
of time and she developed pressure ulcers on her ankles, feet and buttocks that
exposed bone, despite persistent complaints to nursing staff, administration,
and to a nursing home ombudsman.  (Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 41.)  
2) A physician concealed the existence of
a serious bedsore on a nursing home patient under his care, opposed her
hospitalization where circumstances indicated it was medically necessary, and
then abandoned the patient when she was dying.  (Mack v. Soung (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 966, 973.)
3) A skilled nursing facility failed to
provide an elderly man suffering from Parkinson’s disease with sufficient food
and water and necessary medication, left him unattended and unassisted for long
periods of time, left him in his own excrement so that ulcers exposing muscle
and bone became infected; and misrepresented and failed to inform his children
of his true condition.  (Covenant
Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 771, 778.)
4) A skilled nursing facility failed to
provide adequate pressure relief to a 76-year-old woman with severe pain of her
left leg and identified as at high risk for developing pressure ulcers, dropped
the patient, left her in filthy and unsanitary conditions, and failed to
provide her the proper diet, monitor food intake and assist her with
eating.  (Country Villa
Claremont Healthcare Center, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 426, 430, 434-435.)
5) The staff of a nursing home failed to
assist a 90-year-old, blind, and demented woman with eating, used physical and
chemical restraints to punish the elder and prevent her from obtaining help,
and physically and emotionally abused the elder by bruising her, withholding
food and water, screaming at her, and threatening her.  (Benun v. Superior Court (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 113, 116-117.)
6) A 78-year-old man admitted to a
skilled nursing facility was abused, beaten, unlawfully restrained, and denied
medical treatment.  (Smith v.
Ben Bennett, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1507, 1512.)  
7) A facility caring for a dependent
adult with a known condition causing progressive dementia, requiring nutrition
and hydration through a gastrostomy tube, and subjecting her to skin
deterioration, ignored a medical care plan requiring the facility to check the
dependent adult’s skin on a daily basis and failed to notify a physician when
pressure ulcers and other skin lesions developed.  (Sababin v. Superior Court (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 81, 83-87, 90.)
(See Carter, supra, 198 Cal. App. 4th at 406-407.)  Plaintiffs have alleged facts regarding two
incidents: (1) Decedent developed pressure sores on his skin and (2) his
fall.   (See Compl., ¶¶22-23.)  However, they have not alleged specific
facts showing how these incidents occurred and whether they were the result of
intentional, reckless, and/or egregious behavior.  At most, the allegations may rise to a
showing of negligence that Defendant and its staff failed to check in on
Decedent regularly or provide extra precautions.
            At
this time, the Court sustains the demurrer to the 1st cause of
action with leave to amend.  
            Based
on the notice of the demurrer, it appears that Defendant intended to demur to
the entirety of the complaint.  However,
the demurrer focuses solely on the 1st cause of action.  In addition, the reply brief argues that
Plaintiffs’ allegations are conclusory and amount to mere negligence.  Otherwise, Defendant does not make arguments
in the demurrer about the 2nd cause of action for negligence and the
3rd cause of action for wrongful death.  As such, to the extent Defendant intended to
demur to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action, the demurrer
is overruled.  
DISCUSSION
RE MOTION TO STRIKE
            Defendant moves to strike the
allegations at page 14, Items 4 and 5, which request attorney’s fees pursuant
to Welfare & Institutions Code, § 15657(a) and for punitive damages.  The attorney’s fees and punitive damages are
requested in connection with the 1st cause of action.  (See Compl., ¶¶42-43.)  
            In light of the ruling on the
demurrer, the motion to strike is taken off-calendar.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Defendant’s
demurrer to the 1st cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.  To the extent Defendant
intended to demur to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action,
the demurrer is overruled. 
            Defendant’s
motion to strike is taken off-calendar as moot in light of the ruling on the
demurrer.  
Defendant shall give notice of
this order.
