 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion for order setting aside and vacating its prior order of
  dismissal and for entry of judgment pursuant to stipulation of the parties
 



 
BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations

Plaintiff Bank
of America, N.A. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on June 12, 2019, alleging a
single cause of action for common counts against Defendant Jean Pierre Nguyen
(“Defendant”).  Plaintiff alleges that
within the last 4 years of filing the complaint, Defendant became indebted to
FIA Card Services, N.A. (predecessor in interest to Plaintiff) on an open book
account in the amount of $101,842.99.  
B.     Relevant
Background
On June 1, 2021,
the Final Status Conference and Non-Jury Trial came for hearing.  At the hearing, Plaintiff informed the Court
that the parties had settled and signed a Stipulation and Order for Dismissal
and Retention of Jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6 (“Stipulation”).  Pursuant to Plaintiff’s oral request, the
complaint was dismissed without prejudice and the Court retained jurisdiction
to make orders to enforce any and all terms of the settlement, including
judgment, pursuant to CCP § 664.6.  That
same day, the Court signed the Order of Dismissal Without Prejudice Pursuant to
C.C.P. § 664.6.  
C.     Motion
on Calendar 
On October 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment
pursuant to the stipulation of the parties.
The Court is not
in receipt of an opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
moves to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant pursuant
to CCP § 664.6 and the terms of the Stipulation. (Zarco Decl., Ex. 1
[Stipulation].)  
            The Stipulation provides in relevant
part:
·        
Defendant
stipulates to the entry of judgment in favor of Defendant for the principal sum
of $101,842.99 and $555.38 in court costs, for a total judgment amount of
$102,398.37.  (¶¶1-2.) 
·        
Defendant agrees
to pay Plaintiff a minimum of $2,125 by the 15th of each month
commencing June 15, 2021 through May 15, 2025 and then a final payment of
$398.37 by June 15, 2025 until Defendant has paid the judgment amount.  The consecutive monthly installments totaling
$102,398.37, timely received, shall constitute full satisfaction of the
judgment amount.  If Defendant timely
makes 24 of 49 installment payments when due ($51,000), Defendant may deduct
the remaining payments ($51,398.37) from the remaining balance then due.  If Defendant fails to make full and timely
payment, then Defendant will not be entitled to any deduction and the full
remaining balance will be due, Plaintiff shall be entitled to enter judgment
for the judgment amount plus any motion/order fees less credit for payments
made. (¶4.) 
·        
The parties
request that the Court retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.  In the event of a default, Plaintiff will
provide notice to Defendant to cure the missed payment and if Defendant fails
to cure the default, Plaintiff shall be entitled to request that the Court
vacate the dismissal and enter judgment. 
(¶7)
In support of
the motion, Plaintiff’s counsel, Gloria Zarco, provides her declaration.  Counsel states that Defendant defaulted on
the terms of the agreement by failing to make the payment as required under the
terms.  (Zarco Decl., ¶6.)  Counsel states that the last payment made by
Defendant was on December 24, 2022.  (Id.,
¶6, Ex. 2 [Payment History].)  Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the principal sum of $101,842.99, plus $555.38 in court costs, $20
in order fee, $20.47 in e-filing fee, $60 for motion fee, less $40,375 for
payments made to date.  (Id.,
¶7.)  Total, Plaintiff seeks a judgment
sum of $62,123.84.  (Id.)
Thus, the motion to set aside the
dismissal and enter judgment based on the Stipulation is granted.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff Bank
of America, N.A.’s motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment based
on the Stipulation and Order for Dismissal and Retention of Jurisdiction
pursuant to CCP § 664.6 is granted.  Judgment shall be
entered in the amount of $62,123.84 against Defendant
Jean Pierre Nguyen.

 Plaintiff
shall
give notice of this order.  
 
Warning regarding
electronic appearances:  All software for remote or electronic
appearances is subject to malfunction based on system weakness and human error,
which can originate from any of the multiple parties participating each

is dependent on numerous inconstant and fluctuating factors that may impact
whether you, or other counsel or the Court itself can be heard in a particular
case. Not all these factors are within the control of the courtroom staff. For
example, at times, the system traps participants in electronic purgatories
where they cannot be heard and where the courtroom staff is not aware of their
presence. If you call the courtroom, please be respectful of the fact that a
court hearing is going on, and that the courtroom staff is doing their best to
use an imperfect system. If it is truly important to you to be heard, please
show up to the courtroom in the normal way. Parking is free or reasonable
