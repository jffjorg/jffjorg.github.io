And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Plumbers on Demand's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them in the amount of $207,893.39. The default judgment was entered after Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff Deep Green Housing and Community Development's communications and eventually defaulted on the case. Defendant argues that they were unable to respond due to mental health issues and the withdrawal of their original counsel, and that they are now represented by new counsel. The judge finds that there is merit to granting the motion and sets a case management conference for May 15, 2024.
