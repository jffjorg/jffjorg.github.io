And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is based on the written order on the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Mr. Kolodzi. The Defendant, Sarkisyan, failed to respond to Mr. Kolodzi's requests for payment of attorney's fees, emails regarding the case, and a request for a tendered substitution of attorney. Despite this, the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's evidence in opposition is insufficient to show that the motion should be denied. The Court notes that the Defendant failed to provide updated Statement of Information pages with its reply brief. The Court will consider these factors when making its final ruling on the motion.
