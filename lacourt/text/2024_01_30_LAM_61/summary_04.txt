And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for terminating sanctions filed by plaintiff FML Management against defendant Ninfa Cruz. The motion was filed due to defendant's failure to comply with the court's prior discovery order. The court has previously ordered defendant to respond to discovery requests, but defendant has failed to do so. As a result, the court has ordered terminating sanctions, which include striking defendant's pleadings and dismissing the action. Alternatively, the court has granted plaintiff's request to prevent defendant from presenting any facts, persons, or damages in relation to their claims. The court has also awarded plaintiff $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions, representing seven hours of attorney work at $200 per hour plus a $60 filing fee.
