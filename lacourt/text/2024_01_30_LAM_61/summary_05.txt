Summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge grants FML Management Corp.'s motion for terminating sanctions against Cross-Complainant Luis Herrera. The motion is granted because Herrera failed to comply with the court's prior discovery order, and FML Management Corp. has demonstrated this failure. The judge notes that terminating sanctions are justified when there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance. In this case, FML Management Corp. seeks an order of terminating sanctions, or alternatively an order preventing Herrera from presenting any facts, persons, or damages in relation to their claims. Alternatively, FML Management Corp. seeks $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions.
