```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff FML Management Corp.'s motion for attorney fees in the amount of $2,000.00. The motion is granted because Plaintiff has shown entitlement to fees under the lease agreement and has demonstrated that the $2,000.00 sought was actually incurred and reasonable. The judge uses the lodestar method to calculate the fees, which involves multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the reasonable hourly rate. The judge notes that a reasonable hourly rate must reflect the skill and experience of the attorney. The Plaintiff's counsel charged a flat fee of $2,000.00 for prosecuting the present action, and the actual compensable hours spent on the matter would yield a figure greater than $2,000.00. No opposition to the motion has been filed.
