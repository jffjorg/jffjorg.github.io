 Case Number:  BC692058    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  61 Defendant Permacity Construction
Corp.’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $18,660.90., leaving a
total costs award of $49,435.97.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO TAX COSTS
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum
was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1).) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) [],
guarantees prevailing parties in civil litigation awards of the costs expended
in the litigation: ‘Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.’” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist. (“Williams”) (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 100.).
 
“If the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges,
they are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein
listed were necessarily incurred.” (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) Although
individual cost items are ordinarily challenged by a motion to tax costs, no
cost-item is effectively put in issue by “mere statements” claiming them to be
unreasonable. (Ibid.) However, where
“it cannot be determined from the face of the cost bill whether the items are
proper,” “the mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’
to an item.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, 132.)
 
Prevailing Plaintiffs Daniel Sherlock and Jason Blaylock
(Plaintiffs) have filed a memorandum of costs seeking $68,096.87 in costs.
Defendant Permacity Construction Corp. (Defendant) has filed a motion to tax
these costs, reasoning as follows. Eight other defendants were dismissed or
settled out of this case prior to trial, and the costs sought must be
apportioned such that Defendant bears only those reasonably necessary to
prosecute the action against itself. (Motion at pp. 2–3.) Defendant identifies
the following specific costs which should be taxed:
 
·        
$456.66, representing seven-eighths of the
initial filing fee for the complaint;
·        
$254.40 for unrelated Doe amendments and ex
parte applications;
·        
$1,387.65 for motions to compel that were
ultimately taken off-calendar;
·        
$8,692.20 in deposition costs related to other
defendants;
·        
$3,775.78 in deposition costs for witnesses who
never testified at trial;
·        
$1,900.25 for service of process for witnesses
who did not appear at trial;
·        
$16,506.25 for court reporter fees the parties
agreed to share, including $3,468.75 for reporter transcripts not ordered by
the court, and $442 for a date on which no hearing was held;
·        
$8,728.59 in other costs, including parking
fees, mileage fees, courtcall costs, and mediation fees.
 
(Motion at pp. 4–7.)
 
Defendant is correct that the
costs incurred in a multi-party action ought to be apportioned, so far as
possible, between costs related to dismissed or settling defendants and those
defendants against whom plaintiffs have ultimately prevailed. (Heppler v.
J.M. Peters Co. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1297.) Costs need not be
apportioned between multiple parties, however, where the issues are
“inextricably intertwined.” (Id. at p. 1297.) Here, the costs sought are
sufficiently specific to allow Defendant to object to particular costs that
were incurred in prosecuting claims for other defendants.  
Costs related solely to other defendants include $254.40 in
filing fees for unrelated Doe amendments and ex parte applications.  Plaintiffs argue that $8,692.20 in deposition costs
incurred for each defendant are recoverable against all of them, as each
defendant tried to limit their scope of liability by apportioning fault to the
other. (Opposition at pp. 6–7.) This argument is persuasive. Further, Defendant
is not entitled to taxing of the costs associated with the filing of the
complaint, since those same filing fees would have been incurred had Plaintiffs
filed suit against Defendant alone.
Defendant is correct that Plaintiff is not entitled to
court reporter fees, as the parties agreed to share these costs without express
provision for subsequent reimbursement to the prevailing party. (Motion at pp.
5–6.) “[W]here, as in this case, the parties agree to share costs during
litigation, the courts will enforce those agreements as written under the
principles that when the language of a document is unambiguous, we are not free
to restructure the agreement, and if the parties wanted to allow recovery of
the apportioned fee by the prevailing party as an item of cost, they were free
to spell this out in their agreement,” but such a provision will not be read
into the agreement.” (Anthony v. Xiaobin Li (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 816,
824, internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.) Here, the parties each
“agree[d] to pay half of the court reporter costs,” without provision for
subsequent recovery via costs memorandum. (Motion Exh. I.) These fees are
properly taxed.
The $1,900.25 for service of process fees are also properly
taxed, as they were incurred for subpoenas to witnesses who did not appear at
trial. Plaintiff’s case for the inclusion of the costs is because Defendant
objected to the admissibility of a report authored by the witnesses so subpoenaed.
(Opposition at p. 8, Exh. Q.) This evidence suggests that Plaintiffs’ efforts
to obtain the testimony of these witnesses was belated, and ultimately rendered
unnecessary by the testimony of others at trial. (Opposition at p. 8.)
Plaintiffs’ remaining costs are properly preserved,
however. The costs sought in relation to the motions to compel are proper, as
the fees were taken off-calendar after Defendant provided tardy responses,
after the motions were filed. Plaintiff’s argument concerning the $3,775.38 for
deposition costs related to Defendant’s witnesses who never testified is also
persuasive, as the costs were incurred after Defendant changed its person most
knowledgeable, or else incurred in a deposition taken by Defendant. (Opposition
at pp. 9–10.) Plaintiffs’ $8,728.59 in other costs was also reasonably
incurred, and is supported by the declaration of counsel. (Bederman Decl. ¶¶
24–25, Exh. R.) 
The motion to tax costs is therefore GRANTED in the amount
of $18,660.90, leaving a total costs award of $49,435.97.
