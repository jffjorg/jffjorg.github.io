Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants FML Management Corp.'s motion for terminating sanctions against Cross-Complainants David Alvarado and Silvia Herrera. The motion is granted because the Cross-Complainants failed to comply with the court's prior discovery order. The judge finds that the Cross-Complainants have a history of abusing the discovery process and have failed to respond or pay the sanctions directed. The judge concludes that terminating sanctions are justified in this case, and orders the Cross-Complainants to give notice. The judge also allows FML Management Corp. to seek $1,460.00 in monetary sanctions, representing seven hours of attorney work and a filing fee.
