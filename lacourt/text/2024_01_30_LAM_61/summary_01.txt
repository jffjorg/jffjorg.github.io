And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication against the complaint of the plaintiff, County of Los Angeles. The defendants, Sina and Azadeh Mardani, had argued that the settlement agreement they entered into with the County in 2013 was unenforceable because it required them to install a backwater valve on their private sewer line, which would cost more than $50,000 to install. They also argued that the County had failed to disclose the true cause of the sewage overflow that led to the settlement and that the County's failure to disclose this information was inequitable.

The judge found that triable issues of fact existed as to whether the settlement agreement was unenforceable and as to whether the County had failed to disclose the true cause of the sewage overflow. The judge also found that the defendants' arguments as to the adequacy of consideration and the reasonableness of the requirement to install the backwater valve did not require judgment as a matter of law. Finally, the judge found that triable issues existed as to whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel and unclean hands applied to the case.
