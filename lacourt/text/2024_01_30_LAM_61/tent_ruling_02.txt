[1] Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that Defendants’
breached the agreement “by not installing the backwater valve within a
reasonable time and/or contemporaneously to plaintiff’s payment of the monies
set forth in the agreement.” (Complaint ¶ 24.) Defendants’ assertion in the
present motion and reply papers that Plaintiff is bound to a contractual theory
requiring instantaneous installation of the backwater valve upon signing the
settlement agreement is based on a strained reading of the Complaint (Reply at
pp. 11–12.)
