I.                  
MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
The court may impose
terminating sanctions, include an order striking pleadings, and order
dismissing an action, or an order rendering judgment by default against a
party, for conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030.) This conduct include “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) 
Ultimate discovery
sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a
history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with discovery rules. 
(Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  Dismissal
is a drastic measure, and terminating sanctions should only be ordered when
there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a
less severe sanction would not be effective. 
(Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1326.)  “[A] penalty as severe as
dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is
caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.”  (Brown
v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)
Plaintiff FML Management
moves for terminating, issue, or evidentiary sanctions against
Cross-Complainants Wilber Chinchilla and Sara Zelaya. Plaintiff argues that
Cross-Complainants have failed to comply with this order by providing responses
or paying the sanctions directed. (Ebel Decl. ¶¶ 3–4.) Plaintiff seeks an order
of terminating sanctions, or alternatively an order preventing
Cross-Complainants from presenting any facts, persons, or damages in relation
to their claims. (Motion at p. 7.) Alternatively, Plaintiff seeks $1,460.00 in
monetary sanctions, representing seven hours of attorney work at $200 per hour
plus a $60 filing fee. (Ebel Decl. ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff has
demonstrated that Defendant failed to comply with this court’s prior discovery
order. Cross-Complainants have failed to file an opposition to this motion. 
The motion for
terminating sanctions is GRANTED.
