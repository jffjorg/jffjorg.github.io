```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for terminating sanctions brought by FML Management Corp. against Cross-Complainants Wilber Chinchilla and Sara Zelaya. The motion was filed due to the Cross-Complainants' failure to comply with a discovery order, including failing to provide responses or pay sanctions as directed. The judge found that the Cross-Complainants had failed to file an opposition to the motion, and that the Plaintiff had demonstrated that the Cross-Complainants had failed to comply with the court's prior discovery order. As a result, the judge granted the motion for terminating sanctions, which will likely result in the dismissal of the Cross-Complainants' claims.
