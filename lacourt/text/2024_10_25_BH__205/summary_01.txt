And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Nide LP's motion for an assignment order and restraining order against Shlomo Meiri and Mino Meiri (the Debtors). Nide LP obtained a judgment against the Debtors on November 30, 2023, in the amount of $166,715.30, and has not received payment. The Debtors made a settlement payment of $40,000, but Nide LP seeks to assign this payment to pay the outstanding judgment. The Court grants Nide LP's motion, ordering the Debtors to assign their right to payment of the $40,000 settlement to Nide LP to pay for the outstanding Judgment. The Court also orders that the Debtors cannot assign or dispose of the right to payment that is being assigned, as this would undermine Nide LP's ability to collect on the judgment. The restraining order is necessary to ensure that the right to payment will be available to be applied to the Judgment.
