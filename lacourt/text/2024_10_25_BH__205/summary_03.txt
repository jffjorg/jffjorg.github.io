And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions of defendants Vahid Zand and Niyousha Eternadieh (Moving Defendants) to set aside the default judgment entered on August 23, 2024. The Moving Defendants argued that they did not file a response to the complaint because they had an understanding with Plaintiff's former counsel that they would be dismissed from the complaint. However, the judge found that the Moving Defendants failed to attach a copy of the proposed responsive pleading with their motions, as required by Code of Civil Procedure §473.5(b). The judge denied the motions without prejudice, allowing Moving Defendants to renew their motions with the proper submissions.
