And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are barred by contract and that the alleged acts do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff has failed to allege extreme and outrageous conduct and that the plaintiff cannot recover tort damages based on obligations arising from contract. The judge also agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff has not alleged a breach of fiduciary duty because the alleged acts do not violate the governing documents or relevant statutory requirements.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and the breach of fiduciary duty claim, with 20 days' leave to amend.
