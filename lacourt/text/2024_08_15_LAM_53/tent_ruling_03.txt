The court notes that there is another entry dated February 5, 2024, showing
0.20 hours of work.  (Roven Decl., Ex. 1,
p. 2.)  However, the billing statement
does not include a full description of the work performed, such that the court
cannot make a determination that those hours were expended as a result of
Defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement.  (Ibid. [stating “Draft correspondence
to client re Respondent position on”].)
