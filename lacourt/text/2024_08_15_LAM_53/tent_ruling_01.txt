  Order RE:
 
petition for approval of compromise of claim
  for minor claimant nani esmeralda martinez
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner Yahaira Gutierrez  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Claimant Nani
Esmeralda Martinez
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed.  
DISCUSSION
Petitioner Yaharia Gutierrez (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval of
the settlement made on behalf of minor claimant Nani Esmeralda Martinez (“Minor
Claimant”) in this action.
The compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only
after it has been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.¿
(Prob. Code, § 3500.)¿ The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise, and must be prepared on Judicial Council form
MC-350.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿¿ 
Defendants Mar Vista Fund, LLC, Mar Vista Entitlement Fund, LLC,
Manuel Cara Edralin, Jr., individually and as trustee of the Edralin Manuel C
2005 Trust, J&S Properties Enterprises, Inc., and Beach City Capital
Management, LLC have agreed to pay a total of $2,000,000 to settle this action,
of which $41,461.09 is allocated to Minor Claimant.  (MC-350, ¶¶ 10-11, Attachment 11b(5).)  Of the $41,461.09 allocated to Minor Claimant,
$10,365.27 will be paid to counsel for attorney’s fees and $640.28 will be paid
to counsel for litigation costs. 
(MC-350, ¶¶ 13, 16.)  The
remaining $30,455.54 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity,
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  (MC-35, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(3).)
The court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be
fair and reasonable, and in the best interest of Minor Claimant.  The court further finds that the declaration
of David Campbell Smith is sufficient to support the request of $10,365.27 in
attorney’s fees, which represents 25 percent of the total $41,461.09
settlement.  (Smith Decl., ¶¶ 3, 8, 9.)  The court therefore grants Petitioner’s
petition. 
ORDER
            The court grants petitioner Yahaira
Gutierrez’s petition for approval of compromise of claim on behalf of minor
claimant Nani Esmeralda Martinez.
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re: proof of purchase of annuity (as to minor claimant Nani Esmeralda
Martinez) for hearing on October 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders petitioner Yahaira
Gutierrez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
