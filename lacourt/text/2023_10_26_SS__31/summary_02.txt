And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Michelle C. Kim has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Evan Solanki and Wendy Kadi (Plaintiffs) vs. Kathy Mitsuye Kozai and Gerald Kozai (Defendants). The case concerns a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant Kathy, which argues that Gerald is now deceased and that the Plaintiffs have not complied with Probate Code section 9370. The Judge has denied the motion, but has set an OSC (Order to Show Cause) to require the Plaintiffs to substitute the personal representative of Gerald's estate into the action. The Judge has also warned that if the Plaintiffs' counsel fails to appear at the OSC and fails to provide a reasonable timeline for substituting the personal representative, the Court may dismiss the action as to Defendant Gerald.
