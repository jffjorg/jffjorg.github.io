Summary of Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike allegations and prayer for punitive damages in a motor vehicle accident case. The court finds that paragraphs 16 and 17 of the complaint are not pertinent in support of punitive damages against Defendant Singh and grants the motion to strike these allegations. However, the court denies the motion to strike the remaining allegations, finding that they are directly related to the incident and sufficient to support a prayer for punitive damages. The court orders the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement or submit on the tentative ruling.
