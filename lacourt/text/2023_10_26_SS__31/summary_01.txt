And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo a neurological examination. The plaintiff claims to have suffered neurological injuries from a motor vehicle incident, and the defendant seeks to determine the extent of these injuries through an examination by a board-certified neurologist. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the examination, and that the plaintiff has put his claimed injuries at issue through his testimony at deposition. The judge orders the plaintiff to appear for an examination with Dr. Edwin C. Amos, M.D. on November 14, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. The scope of the examination will be limited to an "interview of the Plaintiff, to palpitate, to look for muscle spasms, determine range of motion, test reflexes, sensation, and motor function." Expert discovery is continued for one day to allow for the completion of the examination.
