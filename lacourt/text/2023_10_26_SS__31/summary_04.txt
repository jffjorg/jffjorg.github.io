Summary: This tentative ruling denies Lyft's motion for a Protective Order to quash Plaintiffs' notice of deposition of Katye Coombs. The Court finds that Coombs' deposition may be relevant to the case and that Lyft has not demonstrated good cause for the protective order. The Court also notes that the parties should meet and confer to try to reach an agreement before the hearing date.
