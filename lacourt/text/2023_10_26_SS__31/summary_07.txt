And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the defendant's motion to consolidate two cases, 22TRCV01251 and 22STCV28585, which arose out of the same automobile accident. The defendant contended that the cases involve the same question of law and fact and should be consolidated. However, the court found that the motion does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.350, which requires a copy of the notice of motion to be filed in each case sought to be consolidated. The court's records show that the notice of motion was not filed in the lead case, 22STCV28585. The denial is without prejudice to the defendant refiling the motion after complying with all rules of court.
