And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Starbucks Corporation's demurrer to Augustine Rotibi's second amended complaint, which alleges a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that Rotibi will not be allowed to refile his complaint with additional allegations. The judge has also denied Starbucks Corporation's motion to strike portions of the complaint as moot, as the demurrer has already been sustained. The judge has ordered Starbucks Corporation to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment per statute. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Rotibi has failed to provide sufficient facts to support his claim of discrimination, and that he has not alleged intentional discrimination or facts that would support liability against Starbucks Corporation for the actions of its cashier. The judge has given Rotibi two opportunities to amend his pleading, but he has failed to do so and has instead continued to rely on the same facts.
