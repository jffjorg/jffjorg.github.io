vs TIMIOS TITLE
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Plaintiff Gina Davidson’s Motion to Approve Private Attorneys General Act
Settlement Agreement and Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, General Release
Fee, and Settlement Administration Costs is GRANTED.
Introduction
Plaintiff Gina Davidson
(Plaintiff) moved to have her Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) settlement
agreement and her request for fees and costs approved.  Defendants Timios
Title, Timios, Inc., and Timios Holdings Corporation (collectively, Defendants)
did not file an opposition, which was due on July 18, 2024.
Plaintiff filed two separate
motion for approval.  The first was filed on June 20, 2024 (Reservation
ID: x8754).  The second was filed on June 24, 2024 (Reservation ID:
x0538).  The two motions are verbatim copies of each other.  Because
the two motions are identical, the Court treated the two motions as a single
motion.
Discussion
The settlement of a PAGA claim
requires court approval pursuant to the operative PAGA  statute, which
states that the "[t]he superior court shall review and approve any
settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part."  (Lab.
Code sec. 2699(l)(2).)  Settlement was reached during the second mediation
wherein both parties’ counsels conducted arms’ length negotiations before
Attorney Paul Grossman.  (Arman Marukyan (Marukyan) Decl. pars. 13-14 and
20.)  Plaintiff provides that the gross settlement amount is
$400,000.00.  (Marukyan Decl. par. 11.)  Of this amount, $192,000.00
is designated for attorneys’ fees ($152,000.00) and costs (up to
$40,000.00.)  Attorneys’ fees represent 38% of the Total Settlement
Amount.  (Marukyan Decl. pars. 2-6, 11, 21-22.)  Plaintiff is only
seeking $29,360.10 of the $40,000.00 allocated for costs.  The balance of
the allocation of costs is to be part of the Net Settlement Amount. 
(Marukyan Decl. par. 23.)  Plaintiff is to be paid $10,000.00 for the
General Release Payment.  (Marukyan Decl. pars. 11, 24.)  Settlement
Administration Costs of up to $5,000,00 is to be paid to the PAGA Settlement
Administrator.  (Marukyan Decl. par. 11.)  The balance of $203,639.90
is to be distributed to Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) and
Aggrieved Employees.  (Id.) LWDA is to receive 75% which totals
$152,729.92 and the Aggrieved Employees is to receive 25% which totals
$50,909.98.  (Id.) With 240 Aggrieved Employees, the approximate distribution
to each Aggrieved Employee is about $212.12.  However, the Court noted
that the payments to each Aggrieved Employee will be divided in pro rata shares
per the Settlement Agreement, section 7 and the distribution will not be equal
sums. 
Counsel further provides that
informal discovery was conducted in order to make an informed decision
regarding the strength and value of the claims.  (Marukyan Decl. pars.
12-20.)   The settlement agreement was further negotiated and endorsed
by Mr. Marukyan, who attests to his experience in this field.  Mr.
Marukyan’s declaration further attests to his background to support his request
for attorneys’ fees and costs.  (Marukyan Decl. pars. 2-5, 24-34.) 
Based upon a review of the above
facts, the Court finds that the settlement agreement is fair, adequate, and
reasonable. 
The motion for approval is
GRANTED.  Ordinarily the court does not allow distribution of fees until
the money is distributed to the PAGA recipients.
The court sets the matter for
review on distribution of funds on __________________, 2024 at _________ a.m.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
