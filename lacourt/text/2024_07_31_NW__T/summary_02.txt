And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel the plaintiff to sign an authorization for tax information. The motion has been denied without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled. The judge ruled that the moving parties did not provide any legal authority in California that would allow the court to order an authorization to be signed. The judge did note that the court can make discovery orders and issue consequences for failure to comply with those orders, but this motion was not the proper way to obtain the tax records. If the records are demanded through discovery and the producing party refuses to produce them, the propounding party can seek a discovery sanction, such as monetary sanctions, issue or evidence sanctions, or even terminating sanctions.
