 Case Number:  22VECV01480    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01480 Inconthievable v Champion
Tentative ruling: Motion to compel plaintiff to sign an authorization for tax information-Denied without prejudice.  Moving parties cite to no legal authority in California authorizing the court to order that an authorization be signed.  The court can make discovery orders and issue consequences for failure to comply with discovery orders.  For example, if a party claims damages which require tax records to prove those damages, if the records are requested by a discovery request, the propounding party can seek an order compelling production, and if an order is issued and the documents are not produced, the propounding party can see a discovery sanction ranging from monetary sanctions, issue or evidence sanctions, or even terminating sanctions.  This motion is not the proper way.  The question is, were these documents demanded by discovery, was there a refusal to produce them, and was a motion made to compel production.
