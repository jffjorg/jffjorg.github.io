 Case Number:  23STCV10759    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  14 Ramos v. AmericanCase Background
 
This is a lemon law case. Plaintiff
Maria Ramos sued defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. on May 12, 2023. Plaintiff
claims she purchased a 2016 Honda Odyssey (“Vehicle”) on or around January 1,
2016. The Vehicle subsequently exhibited substantial defects during its
warranty period, and Defendant failed to provide replacement or restitution
when Defendant failed to repair the Vehicle after a reasonable number of
attempts.
 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff moved
for an order compelling Defendant to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s
first set of requests for production of documents (“RPDs”).
 
On June 17, 2024, Defendant
opposed.
 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff
replied.
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to RPDs (Set One)
 
Meeting and Conference
 
            A motion to
compel further RPD responses requires a meet and confer declaration that
satisfies Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b)(2).) Plaintiff’s counsel submits a declaration attesting to
numerous conferences with Defendant’s counsel and multiple extensions for
Defendant to provide supplemental responses. (See Beck Decl., ¶¶ 26-57.) Sections
2031.310(b)(2) and 2016.040 are satisfied.
 
Timeliness
 
            A motion to
compel further responses must be brought within forty-five days of the opposing
party’s most recent supplemental response or before any later date agreed upon
in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) Here, the parties agreed in
writing that Plaintiff would have until May 24, 2024 to file. (Beck Decl., ¶ 55
and Exh. 27.) Plaintiff filed on May 22, 2024, two days prior. The motion is
timely.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED IN PART as to Requests Nos. 16, 18-23, and 41.
 
            The motion
is DENIED as to Requests Nos. 17 and 56.
 
Discussion
 
            Substance of Requests
 
            Plaintiff moves for further
responses to her RPDs Nos. 16-23, 41, and 56.
 
            The Court paraphrases Plaintiff’s
RPDs as follows:
 



16


Documents “concerning any internal analysis or investigation” of
  transmission defects in vehicles of the same year, make, and model of the
  subject Vehicle (“equivalent vehicles”). (PSS, 3:27-4:8.)




17


Documents “concerning or relating to any communications” Defendant
  “ha[s] had” regarding engine defects in equivalent vehicles. (PSS, 15:5-8.)




18


Documents “concerning or relating to any decision” decisions to issue
  “notices, letters, campaigns, warranty extensions, technical service
  bulletins and recalls” concerning transmission defects in equivalent
  vehicles. (PSS, 26:2-10.)




19


Documents “concerning” customer complaints, reported failures, and
  warranty claims “related to” the transmission defect in the Vehicle. (PSS,
  37:2-7.)




20


Documents “concerning failure rates” in equivalent vehicles “as a
  result of” the transmission defect in the Vehicle. (PSS, 48:2-4.)




21


Documents “concerning or relating to any fixes for” the transmission
  defect in equivalent vehicles. (PSS, 59:1-3.)




22


Documents which “refer to, reflect, or relate to” any technical service
  bulletin for equivalent vehicles. (PSS, 69:13-15.)




23


Documents which “refer to, reflect, or relate to” any recall issued, or
  in the process of being issued, for equivalent vehicles. (PSS, 79:9-10.)




41


All Vehicle Warranty History Reports for equivalent vehicles
  repurchased or replaced due to the transmission defect in Plaintiff’s
  Vehicle. (PSS, 88:25-27.)




56


“All written agreements with any person concerning the management,
  oversight, coordination, and handling of [Defendant’s] customer service call
  center.” (PSS, 108:27-28.)



 
Although Defendant provided partial responses to each RPD, each response
was accompanied by various boilerplate objections including overbreadth,
vagueness, undue burden, seeking information outside the bounds of
discoverability, failure to identify categories of documents with
particularity, intrusion on confidential information, and attorney-client or
attorney work-product privilege.
 
            Plaintiff’s requests are standard
lemon law discovery. Most of Defendant’s objections lack merit. And Defendant’s
partial responses and lengthy meet-and-confer efforts demonstrate it is willing
and able to respond.
 
Defendant has also not provided any clear statement that conforms to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.240.
 
            That said, the Court finds
Defendant’s overbreadth and vagueness objections well-taken in several
instances, and so a limited order is warranted.
 
            Scope of Order
 
            The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion
in part, on the following terms:
 
            As to RPDs Nos. 16, 18-23, and 41,
Defendant’s objections are overruled in part, and Plaintiff’s motion granted
only as to equivalent vehicles sold within the state of California. With each
response, Defendant must provide a sworn statement stating its compliance
according to sections 2031.220, 2031.230, or 2031.240 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.
 
            As to RPDs Nos. 17 and 56,
Defendant’s objections are sustained in their entirety, and Plaintiff’s motion
is denied.
 
            Sanctions
 
            A party unsuccessfully opposing a
motion to compel further responses – as Defendant has here – must ordinarily be
subject to monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(h).) But
Plaintiff has requested none here. The Court awards no sanctions.
 
Conclusion
 
            The motion
is granted in part as to Requests Nos. 16, 18-23, and 41.
 
            The motion is denied as to Requests
Nos. 17 and 56.
