And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a decision on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) in a lemon law case. The case involves Plaintiff Maria Ramos, who purchased a 2016 Honda Odyssey with defects and sued Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. for failure to provide replacement or restitution. The Plaintiff moved for an order compelling Defendant to provide further responses to RPDs, which Defendant opposed. The Judge granted the motion in part, ordering Defendant to provide further responses to RPDs Nos. 16, 18-23, and 41, but denied the motion as to RPDs Nos. 17 and 56. The Judge also awarded no sanctions to the Plaintiff, despite Defendant's unsuccessful opposition to the motion. The Judge's decision is based on the parties' meet-and-confer efforts, the timeliness of the motion, and the merits of the objections raised by Defendant.
