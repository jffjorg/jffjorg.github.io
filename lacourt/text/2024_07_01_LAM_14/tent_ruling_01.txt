DISCUSSION
 
This
case is brought by Defendant-Tenant’s former Landlord who is Plaintiff in the
instant case. On January 10, 2022, the Court provided that the Clerk’s judgment
could not be entered on the Complaint because the relevant Complaint concerns a
Commercial Lease Agreement. Plaintiff was instructed to submit for Court
judgment. Thus, on January 10, 2023, Default was entered. 
 
On
November 22, 2023, this Court issued a Minute Order reminding Plaintiff that
pursuant to Court Order dated October 13, 2023, Plaintiff was instructed to
follow California Rules of Court 3.1800 and submit a Request for Default
Judgment. As of the date of November 22, 2023, the Court stated it had yet to
receive the Request for Default Judgment and scheduled the corresponding
hearing for February 2, 2024. 
 
On
December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed new documents in his Request for Default
Judgment. 
 
On
February 2, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s Request for Default for failure
to comply with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1800. Thus, the hearing was
continued to April 30, 2024.
 
On
April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a new CIV-100, JUD-100, and Memorandum of Costs
(MC-010).
 
On
April 18, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a CIV-130 which the Court rejected.
 
On
April 30, 2024, the Court continued the OSC for Default Judgment to July 1,
2024, along with the OSC Re: Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute Case.
 
On
June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Declaration for Default Judgment by Court
(UD-116), along with attached exhibits of the “3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or
Quit,” Plaintiff’s written receipt of lawsuit, along with a copy of the
commercial lease that Plaintiff alleges Defendant Camacho violated. There were
also notices of “Rent Increase Reminder” attached for the dates of January 20,
2019, and January 25, 2020. 
 
 
 
Damages 
 
Plaintiff seeks $31,821.86 in damages which represents
Defendant Camacho’s past due rent of $4,132.71 per month in excess of seven
months. (Compl., pg. 17; 6.24.24 UD-116, pg. 3.) Plaintiff also advances exhibits
of (1) the copy of the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit; (2) the rent ledger;
(3) and the Commercial Lease Agreement that was violated.  (6.24.24 UD-116.) 
 
However, there does not appear to be an attached
Declaration or Proposed Judgment in the most recent papers filed for Default.
 
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff also requests $1,285 in
costs according to Plaintiff’s UD-116 submitted on June 24, 2024. However,
Plaintiff’s most recent Memorandum of Costs was submitted on April 15, 2024, and
only designates $750 in costs without specifying a breakdown. The costs are
listed next to item 16 as “other” and thus, are unspecified. Given this
inconsistency between the April 15 Memorandum and the June 24 UD-116, the Court
cannot grant costs. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly,
the Court must DENY Plaintiff’s Request for Default for failure to comply with
the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1800.
