Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the default judgment application filed by Plaintiff Farokh Moghadam against Defendant Christina Camacho. The case involves a breach of contract related to a commercial lease. The Court had previously entered default against the Defendant on January 10, 2023, but the Plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, which governs the submission of a request for default judgment. The Court had previously denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment on February 2, 2024, and again on April 30, 2024. The Plaintiff has since filed additional documents, including a Declaration for Default Judgment by Court, but the Court still finds that the request is deficient. Therefore, the Court must deny the default judgment application.
