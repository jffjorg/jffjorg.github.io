And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel compliance with a subpoena for production of records issued by Plaintiff ZhenGYAN ZHANG against Defendant Dong Chen and others. The motion was filed in response to Defendant's objections to the subpoena. The Court finds that the subpoena is procedurally defective because Plaintiff failed to serve the instant motion on National General Premier Insurance Company, but the Court considers the motion on the merits. The Court orders National to produce documents responsive to Request 3 and limits the production of documents responsive to Requests 1, 2, 6, and 7 to those related to raised insurance rates, speeding tickets, insurance claims, and/or correspondence for use of either the 2020 Tesla Model Y or 2020 BMW. The Court also orders National to produce documents responsive to Request 5, but limited to only the applicable period providing insurance coverage for the date of the incident, February 21, 2021. The request to compel compliance with Request 4 is denied.
