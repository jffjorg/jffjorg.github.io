The case involves a dispute over discovery requests, which were propounded by the Defendant on October 19, 2022.

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motions and ordered the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests, without objections, within 20 days. The Judge has also imposed sanctions on the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,080, which includes attorney fees and costs. The sanctions are mandatory and must be paid by the Plaintiff within 20 days.
