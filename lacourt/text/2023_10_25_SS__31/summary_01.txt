And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses filed by Defendant Kathy Mitsuye Kozai against Plaintiff Wendy Kadi. The case involves a lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs Evan Solanki and Wendy Kadi against Defendants Kathy Mitsuye Kozai and Gerald Kozai for damages arising from an automobile collision. The Judge notes that the parties did not participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the motion being heard, and therefore the motion is premature and must be continued to a new date. The parties are ordered to participate in an IDC as required by the Court's Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures. The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve outstanding issues and submit a joint statement of items in dispute if necessary.
