And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion by the plaintiffs to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) to add the Estate of Lisa Kahn Mazzarella and Jeffrey Paul Mazzarella as defendants. The plaintiffs seek to add these defendants as parties to the action, alleging that they were involved in a motor vehicle collision that caused damage to the plaintiffs. The motion is unopposed, and the court has granted the motion. The plaintiffs are ordered to file a separate copy of their proposed FAC within 10 days of the date of the order and to give notice. The court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement.
