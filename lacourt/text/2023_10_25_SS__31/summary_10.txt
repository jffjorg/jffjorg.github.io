The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to transfer the venue of the case from the Los Angeles County Superior Court to the San Diego County Superior Court. The plaintiff filed the case against the defendants Jose Javier Delgado Rivas, Gerardo J. Diaz, and Jorge Manuel Mojica for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident that occurred in Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico. The plaintiff alleges that Diaz is actually a resident of San Diego County, and the judge has found that to be true. The judge has concluded that Los Angeles County is not the proper venue for the case, and has ordered the transfer of the venue to San Diego County. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, they must appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
