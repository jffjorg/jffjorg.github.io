And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, filed by Claimant Peter Yorck and others. The Court previously approved the settlement between the Plaintiffs and Defendants, and also approved the attorney's fees for Claimant's settlement. However, Claimant demanded payment from the Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Carrier, USAA, for the difference between the coverage limit and the previously approved settlement. The Court rejected the petition because it was filed using the incorrect form, MC-350EX, and the settlement amount is not the insurance policy limit. The Court orders the Petitioner to file a new petition using the correct form, MC-350, and to demonstrate that the settlement represents the insurance policy limits. The Court also excuses the personal appearance of the Claimant and the guardian ad litem, and allows Counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
