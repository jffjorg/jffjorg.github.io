 Case Number:  21STCV30090    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 10/25/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 21STCV30090 PETER YORCK, et al. vs SHAHRAD MIZRAHI, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Lillian Yorck, Age 3 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  The Court previously reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise for the settlement between Plaintiffs and Defendants and found it fair and reasonable. The Court also found the attorney’s fees in the amount of 25% for Claimant’s settlement to be fair and reasonable.  Thereafter, Claimant demanded payment from Claimant’s Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Carrier, USAA, for the difference between the coverage limit and the previously approved settlement.   Petitioner now files a separate expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor pertaining to the settlement with Claimant’s Underinsured Motorist (“UIM”) claim with the insurance carrier, USAA. The Court previously rejected the petition because an expedited petition is permissible only if the total settlement is less than $50,000 or represents the insurance policy limits. (Min. Order, July 17, 2023.) Petitioner must either show the settlement represents the insurance policy limits, or not use an expedited petition form. (Ibid.)  In the renewed petition, Petitioner has not demonstrated that the $60,000 settlement amount is the policy limit. Rather, Petitioner provides that the UIM coverage limit is $100,000. Therefore, the use of MC-350EX is improper.   Petitioner must file a new petition and make use MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2021], instead of MC-350EX.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
