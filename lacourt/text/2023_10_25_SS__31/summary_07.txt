And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial date from November 30, 2023, to May 2, 2024. The defendant's counsel substituted into the case on June 9, 2023, and needs additional time to conduct discovery, including noticing depositions of the plaintiff's family members, treating providers, and police officer who authored the traffic collision report. The judge finds good cause to continue the trial date to allow the defendant sufficient time to complete discovery prior to trial. The defendant's motion is granted, and all related dates, including the November 16, 2023 Final Status Conference, are continued.
