The Petitioner, Leticia Respicio, requests 40% of Claimant's settlement for attorneys' fees. The Court is satisfied with the efforts in this case to justify such a high fee.

The proposed trust instrument is for a minor's settlement trust, which will become revocable at Nalaya Meza's 18th birthday. The trust will be funded with $734,078.87 and will be invested in various annuities. The Court grants the Petitioner's request for authority for the trustee to invest in mutual funds and bonds with maturity dates greater than five years.
