And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint (FAC) is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Jane Doe C.J., alleges childhood sexual abuse and damages against the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and others.

The judge found that the plaintiff's FAC fails to establish compliance with the statutory requirements of CCP section 340.1, which sets the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse actions. The plaintiff must rely on the discovery provision of section 340.1 to assert her claim, but she has not alleged facts that show she filed her complaint within 5 years of discovering the abuse.

The judge also found that the plaintiff has not alleged her claims with sufficient particularity, as required by the law. However, the judge did not place a nearly insurmountable hurdle on plaintiffs to allege specific facts at the pleading stage.

The judge ruled that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's fourth cause of action relies on sections of the Penal Code that only apply to individuals is incorrect. The plaintiff's claim is premised on a theory of vicarious liability, and the defendant is vicariously liable for the neglect of its employees so long as the neglect occurred within the course and scope of employment.

Finally, the judge declined to take up the question as to whether or not the retroactivity provision of AB 218, which extended the statute of limitations in child sexual abuse cases, is unconstitutional. The judge noted that the case Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415 addressed the claims presentation requirement after section 340.1 was amended and expanded, and found that the removal of the claims presentation requirement for child sexual abuse cases was constitutional.
