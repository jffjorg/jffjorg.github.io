The tentative ruling grants Defendant Redwood's motion to have its Requests for Admission (RFAs) deemed admitted against Plaintiff Gold Point Towing. The motion is unopposed, and Gold Point failed to respond to the RFAs. The Court finds no substantial justification for this failure and sanctions Plaintiff, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400. The ruling is based on the facts that Gold Point had until June 21, 2023, to respond to the RFAs and has not provided any responses to date.
