GHAZAR SHABAZYAN, et al. 
 
        
  vs.
 
BERKSHIRE
  HATHAWAY HOMESTATE INSURANCE COMPANY, 
et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV23508 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: December 11, 2023



            
Defendant’s
motion to have its RFAs deemed admitted is GRANTED. Plaintiff is sanctioned,
jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400, payable within 30 days.
 
            On
7/20/2022, Plaintiffs Ghazar Shabazyan and Gold Point Towing, Inc.
(collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit against Berkshire Hathaway Homestate
Insurance Company, Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance Company (Redwood), and
Coverhound LLC dba Coverhound Insurance Solutions, alleging: (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing; (3) insurance broker
negligence. 
 
            Now,
Defendant Redwood (Defendant) moves to have its Requests for Admission (RFAs)
deemed admitted against Plaintiff Gold Point Towing (Gold Point).
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
On 5/17/2023,
Defendant served its RFAs on Gold Point. Accordingly, Gold Point had until
6/21/2023 to respond. To date, no responses have been provided, and Gold Point
failed to oppose this motion.
 
            Given
Gold Point’s non-opposition, it has not offered any substantial justification
for this failure.  
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to have its RFAs deemed admitted against
Plaintiff granted. Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel,
$1,400.00. ($350/hr x 4 hr.) 
 
It is so ordered.
