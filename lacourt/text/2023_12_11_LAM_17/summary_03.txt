And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Timothy Jang, M.D., is seeking equitable relief after being denied a promotion to Senior Physician at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, the County of Los Angeles, violated his rights under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and Labor Code section 1102.5. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff on both of his retaliation claims and awarded him damages for past and future lost earnings and emotional distress.

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for equitable relief and finds that it cannot grant the requested relief. The court notes that the plaintiff has not presented evidence that there is a Senior Physician item available, and that creating a new position would require the court to assume the role of a substitute Legislature. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant has continued to retaliate against him, and that the requested relief would not be necessary.

The court denies the plaintiff's motion for equitable relief, citing the reasons above. The court notes that the plaintiff has already been awarded damages for past and future lost earnings and emotional distress, and that the jury's award indicates that they did not find the damages to be speculative. The court also finds that the requested relief of 96 shift relief credits is impossible, as the shift relief program no longer exists, and that awarding these credits would impose a burden on other physicians.
