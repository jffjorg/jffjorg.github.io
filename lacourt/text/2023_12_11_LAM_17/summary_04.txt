And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to tax the defendant's costs. The defendant is the prevailing party, having obtained a net monetary recovery, and is entitled to recover costs pursuant to his CCP section 998 offer to compromise. The court is unpersuaded by the plaintiff's arguments that the deposition costs are excessive or unnecessary, as the defendant's attached invoices corroborate the costs claimed. The court also finds that the service of process fees for members of the LAPD were reasonably incurred, as the defendant was required to serve new subpoenas for each new trial date. Overall, the court has denied the plaintiff's motion to tax the defendant's costs.
