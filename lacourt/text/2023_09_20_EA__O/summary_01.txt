```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to Plaintiff Wendy Lin's Verified Third Amended Complaint and a motion to strike the same complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be allowed to revise and refile the complaint. The court has also granted the motion to strike the complaint without leave to amend, which means that the plaintiff will not be able to seek punitive damages.

The court has determined that the fraud and quiet title causes of action are again conclusively pled, and that the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient facts to support these claims. The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's reliance on the joint venture agreement and arbitration agreement is insufficient to support the claims.

The court's ruling is based on the pleadings and the law. The court has cited several statutes and cases in support of its ruling, including Code of Civil Procedure section 760.020, Code of Civil Procedure section 761.020, Code of Civil Procedure section 764.010, Evidence Code section 662, and Civil Code §3294.

The court's ruling is significant because it sets a precedent for the treatment of quiet title actions and the pleading requirements for fraud and quiet title causes of action. The ruling is also significant because it affects the rights and obligations of the parties to the lawsuit.

## English Text Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a quiet title action filed by Plaintiff Wendy Lin against Defendant Bo Sun regarding three properties. The court has sustained Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint (TAC) in its entirety without leave to amend.

The court found Plaintiff's claims for fraud and quiet title to be insufficiently pleaded. Specifically, Plaintiff's allegations regarding fraud relied on conclusory statements and failed to meet the specificity requirements for pleading fraud.  

The court also held that Plaintiff, as the owner of an equitable interest, cannot bring a quiet title action against Defendant, who holds the legal title to the properties.

Finally, the court granted Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, finding that the allegations lacked sufficient support for such a claim.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22PSCV00580, in which Wendy Lin is suing Bo Sun for breach of fiduciary duty, quiet title, fraud, and other claims. The court has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint in its entirety, without leave to amend. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's third amended complaint, without leave to amend.

The court's ruling is based on its finding that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are conclusory and insufficiently pled, and that the plaintiff has failed to provide specific facts to support its claims. The court has also held that the plaintiff's attempt to assert an equitable title claim is based on an expectation of title, rather than an actual legal interest in the property.

The court has further held that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages are unsupported, as the alleged fraud is insufficiently pled. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's third amended complaint, as the plaintiff's allegations are based on information and belief, rather than facts.

The court's ruling is tentative, pending any further briefing or argument from the parties.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wendy Lin vs. Bo Sun, sustaining the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint without leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and quiet title were not properly pled, and that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient facts to support her claims. The court also granted the defendant's motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages were unsupported. The court concluded that the plaintiff's complaint was largely based on information and belief, rather than facts, and that permitting the plaintiff to proceed with her claims without facts would undermine the purpose of the judicial system. The case involves a dispute over the ownership of several properties, including the Monte Cristo Property, the Derringer Lane Property, and the Skyline Drive Property, and the plaintiff's allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and fraud. The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient specificity in her allegations, and the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's claims are not supported by the facts.

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer without leave to amend for the plaintiff's Verified Third Amended Complaint and grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's Verified Third Amended Complaint. The case is a quiet title action regarding properties located at Monte Cristo Property, Derringer Lane Property, and Skyline Drive Property. The plaintiff, Wendy Lin, filed the complaint against Bo Sun, All Persons Unknown, and Does 1 through 20 for various claims, including Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud, and Quiet Title. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike on August 3, 2023, and the plaintiff filed her opposition on September 7, 2023. The disputes include the defendant concealing the fact that he had no intention of placing the plaintiff's name on title to the Derringer Lane Property and the defendant's misrepresentation that the loan was safe. The judge finds that the plaintiff's fraud cause of action is premised upon conclusory allegations, and the owner of an equitable interest cannot maintain an action to quiet title against the owner of the legal title. Additionally, punitive damages are unsupported, and the gist of the TAC is that the defendant allegedly failed to repay money, which does not support malice, oppression, or fraud.
