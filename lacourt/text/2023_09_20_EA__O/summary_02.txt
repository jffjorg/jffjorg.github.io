And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the opposition to a motion and has some concerns. The opposition consists mainly of reciting various laws without providing a thorough analysis. The defendant notes that the plaintiff has added new allegations and made inconsistent claims, but the court does not find these allegations to be "sham pleadings" that would require the court to consider the original pleadings. The plaintiff's opposition also disputes the defendant's citations, but the court finds that the defendant's definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud undermine the plaintiff's claims of fraud. The judge will not elaborate on the inconsistencies and will make a final decision on the motion at a later date.

## English Text Summary

The Judge has reviewed Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fraud claims and Plaintiff's opposition to that motion. The Judge finds Defendant's motion lacks sufficient legal analysis and Plaintiff's opposition does not adequately address Defendant's arguments.  

The Judge notes that Plaintiff has made new allegations and some seemingly inconsistent claims. However, the Judge does not believe these inconsistencies rise to the level of "sham pleadings" that would require the previous pleadings to be disregarded. 

The Judge also points out that Defendant's definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud  undermine Plaintiff's conclusory allegations of fraud.  Essentially, the Judge is not convinced by either party's arguments at this stage and will likely require more detailed legal analysis from both sides before making a final ruling.

The judge finds that the opposition is largely based on reciting various laws without providing an adequate analysis. The defendant has pointed out that the plaintiff has added new allegations and made inconsistent allegations, but the judge does not find that these allegations amount to "sham pleadings" that would require the court to consider earlier pleadings. The judge also notes that the defendant's motion provided definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud, which undermine the plaintiff's conclusory allegations of fraud. Based on these findings, the judge intends to deny the plaintiff's opposition and allow the defendant's motion for leave to amend.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Defendant. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion is largely a recitation of law without adequate analysis. The Defendant had noted that the Plaintiff has added new allegations and pleaded inconsistent allegations, but the Judge does not find that these allegations amount to "sham pleadings". The Plaintiff takes issue with the Defendant's citations, but the Judge notes that the Defendant's motion provides definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud that undermine the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud. The Judge does not find the Defendant's citations to be persuasive, but rather finds that the definitions provided by the Defendant are sufficient to undermine the Plaintiff's allegations. Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Plaintiff's opposition is not well-supported and that the Defendant's motion has raised significant doubts about the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud.
