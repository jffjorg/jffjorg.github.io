And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the opposition to a motion and has some concerns. The opposition consists mainly of reciting various laws without providing a thorough analysis. The defendant notes that the plaintiff has added new allegations and made inconsistent claims, but the court does not find these allegations to be "sham pleadings" that would require the court to consider the original pleadings. The plaintiff's opposition also disputes the defendant's citations, but the court finds that the defendant's definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud undermine the plaintiff's claims of fraud. The judge will not elaborate on the inconsistencies and will make a final decision on the motion at a later date.
