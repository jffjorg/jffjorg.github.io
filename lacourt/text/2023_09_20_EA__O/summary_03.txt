And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to temporarily abate the plaintiffs' action until all potential plaintiffs are properly joined as parties. The motion has been granted in part, with the wrongful death cause of action being abated, but the survival causes of action are not abated.

The court has also ordered Daniel Munoz, the heir of the decedent, to be named as either a plaintiff or nominal defendant. The court finds that the language of the wrongful death statute does not permit the construction that plaintiffs asked the court to consider, which is that Daniel Munoz may be named as a nominal defendant but not a plaintiff.

The court notes that the parties stipulated to add Daniel Munoz as a nominal defendant, but the stipulation was not implemented. The court admonishes counsel for not stipulating to add Daniel Munoz as a nominal defendant.

The court also finds that the survival causes of action are not abated, as they are governed by a different statute. The decedent's successor-in-interest, Jenny Macias, is entitled to enforce the decedent's survival causes of action for elder abuse, negligence, and willful misconduct without regard to the abatement of the wrongful death cause of action.

In this tentative ruling, the court grants Dr. Badday's motion to temporarily abate the plaintiffs' action until all potential plaintiffs are properly joined as parties, but only for the wrongful death cause of action. The main dispute in the ruling is whether Daniel Munoz, an heir of the decedent, must be joined to the action. The court relies on Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg and Salmon v. Rathjens to support their decision that Daniel Munoz must be named as either a plaintiff or nominal defendant. The court also states that survival causes of action and wrongful death cause of action are governed by different statutes and that the court does not have discretion to abate the survival causes of action. The ruling concludes that the motion is granted in part, and the wrongful death cause of action is abated, but the survival causes of action are not abated.

* Jalal Badday, M.D.

**Key Events:**

* Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit alleging elder abuse, negligence, willful misconduct, and wrongful death. 

**Legal Issues:**

* **Mandatory Joinder of Heirs in Wrongful Death Actions:** Dr. Badday argued that Daniel Munoz, Ms. Munoz's son, must be joined as a party to the wrongful death lawsuit due to California's "one action rule" (CCP § 377.60). 
* **Survival of Causes of Action:** Plaintiffs argued that their survival causes of action (elder abuse, negligence, and willful misconduct) should not be abated even if the wrongful death action was abated.

**Court's Ruling:**

* **Partial Grant of Motion:** The court granted Dr. Badday's motion to abate the wrongful death cause of action, finding that Daniel Munoz must be joined as either a plaintiff or a nominal defendant.
* **Survival Actions Remain:** The court ruled that the survival causes of action were not abated and could proceed. 

**Reasons for Ruling:**

* The court cited California case law (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg) emphasizing the mandatory joinder of all heirs in wrongful death actions, even if they choose not to participate.

Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Number**: 23PSCV00365
**Hearing Date**: September 20, 2023
**Dept**: O

**Tentative Ruling**

The motion of Defendant Jalal Badday, M.D. to temporarily abate the Plaintiffs' action until all potential plaintiffs are properly joined as parties is GRANTED in part; only the wrongful death COA is abated.

**Background**

This is an elder abuse case involving the death of Evangeline Munoz, a resident of Casa Colina Hospital from March 27, 2022 to April 22, 2022.

**Facts**

* Evangeline Munoz was a resident of Casa Colina Hospital for approximately 1 month before her death on September 11, 2022.
* She suffered from poor appetite and required one-on-one supervision to ensure she adequately ate.
* She was diagnosed with depression and prescribed medication, which reduced her appetite severely.
* Her physicians discussed the possibility of a G-tube insertion due to her lack of eating.
* On April 14, 2022, Dr. Abidali performed a G-tube placement, but it was later determined that the tube was improperly placed, leading to an infection.
* After an emergency surgery, Evangeline Munoz suffered at least one additional stroke, leading to her becoming severely impaired and being placed in a semi-vegetative state.

**Legal Standard**

The court will apply California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 377.60, which provides that a cause of action for wrongful death may be asserted by the persons who would be entitled to the property of the decedent by intestate succession.

**Discussion**

The court finds that Daniel Munoz, the son of Evangeline Munoz, must be joined to the action as an heir of the decedent.

**Ruling**

* The wrongful death cause of action is abated, but the survival causes of action (elder abuse, negligence, and willful misconduct) are not abated.
* Daniel Munoz must be named as either a plaintiff or nominal defendant in the action.

**Significant Statements**

* The court finds that the language of the wrongful death statute does not permit the construction that Plaintiffs ask the court to consider.
* The court admonishes Counsel for not stipulating to add Daniel Munoz as a nominal defendant, which could have avoided the motion.

**Legal Claims:**

- Elder Abuse
- Negligence
- Willful Misconduct
- Wrongful Death

**Motions:**

- Dr. Badday's motion to temporarily abate Plaintiffs' action is granted in part; only the wrongful death COA is abated.
- Plaintiffs' opposition to Dr. Badday's demurrer and motion to strike is granted.
- Casa Colina's motion to strike is granted.

**Laws and Statutes:**

- California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 377.60 (one action rule)
- Welfare and Institutions Code § 15600, Et Seq. (Elder Abuse)

**Significant Statements:**

- "The wrongful death statute is ‘a procedural statute establishing compulsory joinder and not a statute creating a joint cause of action.’" (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801)
- "An action by a portion only of heirs is not the action authorized by our statute. All the heirs should therefore, join as plaintiffs in an action by heirs, and, if the consent of any one who should be so joined cannot be obtained, he may be made a defendant." (Salmon v. Rathjens (1907) 152 Cal 290)
- "Unlike a wrongful death claim, the survival statutes do not create a cause of action but merely prevent the abatement of the decedent's cause of action and provide for its enforcement by the decedent's personal representative or successor in interest." (Adams, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 79)

The court has ruled that Dr. Badday's motion to abate the wrongful death cause of action is granted, but survival causes of action will not be abated.
