And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to temporarily abate the plaintiffs' action until all potential plaintiffs are properly joined as parties. The motion has been granted in part, with the wrongful death cause of action being abated, but the survival causes of action are not abated.

The court has also ordered Daniel Munoz, the heir of the decedent, to be named as either a plaintiff or nominal defendant. The court finds that the language of the wrongful death statute does not permit the construction that plaintiffs asked the court to consider, which is that Daniel Munoz may be named as a nominal defendant but not a plaintiff.

The court notes that the parties stipulated to add Daniel Munoz as a nominal defendant, but the stipulation was not implemented. The court admonishes counsel for not stipulating to add Daniel Munoz as a nominal defendant.

The court also finds that the survival causes of action are not abated, as they are governed by a different statute. The decedent's successor-in-interest, Jenny Macias, is entitled to enforce the decedent's survival causes of action for elder abuse, negligence, and willful misconduct without regard to the abatement of the wrongful death cause of action.
