Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint and a motion to strike the same complaint. The demurrer is sustained in its entirety without leave to amend, and the motion to strike is granted. The court finds that the fraud cause of action is conclusively pled but insufficiently pled, and the quiet title cause of action is insufficiently pled. The court also rejects the plaintiff's claims of unjust enrichment and constructive trust. The court's decision is based on the lack of specificity in the plaintiff's allegations and the failure to provide legal authority to support the claims.
