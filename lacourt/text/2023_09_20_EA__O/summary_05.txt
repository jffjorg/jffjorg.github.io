**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wendy Lin against BO Sun. The ruling sustains Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, finding that the claims for fraud and quiet title are not sufficiently pled. 

The judge previously sustained demurrers to earlier versions of the complaint, giving Plaintiff multiple opportunities to amend. This time, the court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are still based on information and belief rather than facts, and therefore denies leave to amend further.

The court also grants Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, stating that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for malice, oppression, or fraud.

As for the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the Plaintiff's verified third amended complaint is sustained in its entirety without leave to amend. Additionally, the Judge grants Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's verified third amended complaint. The ruling is based on the court's previous holdings that the complaint is unintelligible, the fraud cause of action is conclusively pled, and the quiet title cause of action is insufficiently pled. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud and quiet title are based on conclusory allegations and lack specificity. The Judge also grants the motion to strike because the punitive damages are predicated upon the allegation of fraud, which is insufficiently pled. The ruling is intended to prevent the Plaintiff from proceeding with the causes of action without facts, which would undermine the purpose of the judicial system.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wendy Lin vs. Bo Sun, case number 23PSCV00895. The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint without leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff's complaint was largely similar to the previous complaints and still lacked sufficient facts to support the causes of action. The court also granted the defendant's motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court noted that the plaintiff's complaint was based on information and belief, rather than facts, and that permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the causes of action without facts would undermine the purpose of the judicial system. The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to properly plead the causes of action for fraud and quiet title, and the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike were therefore sustained.

The court's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer without leave to amend for the fraud and quiet title causes of action in Plaintiff Wendy Lin's Third Amended Complaint against Defendant Bo Sun. The fraud cause of action is not adequately pled, and the quiet title action cannot be maintained by the owner of an equitable interest against the owner of the legal title. The court also grants Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages due to insufficiently pled fraud.
