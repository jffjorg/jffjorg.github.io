And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will consider Casa Colina's motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC, despite the fact that the hearing is scheduled for November 9, 2023. The court finds that the parties' failure to stipulate and file a non-opposition to the motion is a violation of the Civility Guidelines. The court also notes that Jenny Macias, the plaintiff, is suing individually and as a successor in interest, and is not acting as the personal representative of the decedent. The court is uncertain as to what interest Jenny Macias would be representing.

The court will also address the issue of abatement, as Casa Colina's motion is based on the theory that the court should abate the action due to the settlement of one of the heirs. The court finds that the declaration by Defense Counsel Stosuv is inconsequential to the issue of abatement. The court will consider the law governing the issue, including CCP section 425.13 and the cases of Adams, Exarhos, Smith, and Gonzales.
