And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will consider Casa Colina's motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC, despite the fact that the hearing is scheduled for November 9, 2023. The court finds that the parties' failure to stipulate and file a non-opposition to the motion is a violation of the Civility Guidelines. The court also notes that Jenny Macias, the plaintiff, is suing individually and as a successor in interest, and is not acting as the personal representative of the decedent. The court is uncertain as to what interest Jenny Macias would be representing.

The court will also address the issue of abatement, as Casa Colina's motion is based on the theory that the court should abate the action due to the settlement of one of the heirs. The court finds that the declaration by Defense Counsel Stosuv is inconsequential to the issue of abatement. The court will consider the law governing the issue, including CCP section 425.13 and the cases of Adams, Exarhos, Smith, and Gonzales.

## English Summary:

The Judge is considering two motions: one by Casa Colina to strike punitive damages from the Plaintiff's lawsuit and one by Dr. Badday to abate (stop) the lawsuit. 

Casa Colina's motion is partially successful because the Plaintiff has agreed not to seek punitive damages against Casa Colina. However, the Judge criticizes the Plaintiff for not stipulating to the motion, wasting judicial resources.

Dr. Badday's motion to abate argues that there is an additional heir who should be part of the lawsuit. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff is suing individually and as successor in interest to the decedent, but it is unclear if she represents the interests of the additional heir. The Judge is also unconvinced by Dr. Badday's argument that the additional heir's absence requires abatement.


Ultimately, the Judge is likely to deny Dr. Badday's motion to abate the lawsuit but may rule on Casa Colina's motion to strike punitive damages in a more detailed ruling.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Casa Colina to strike punitive damages from the FAC (complaint) because the plaintiff did not obtain leave of court before seeking punitive damages against a healthcare provider. The plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition to striking punitive damages, but the judge is concerned that this is a violation of the Civility Guidelines, which encourage parties to stipulate to motions rather than forcing each other to make motions and not oppose them.

The judge notes that the plaintiff, Jenny Macias, is suing individually and has her mother's successor in interest, but is not acting as the personal representative of the decedent. The judge is uncertain as to what interest Jenny Macias is representing.

The judge also considers the issue of abatement, noting that the one-action rule prevents multiple prosecutions against the same defendant, but a defendant who settles with less than all known heirs waives the right to face only a single wrongful death action. In this case, the defendant, Dr. Badday, has actual knowledge of an additional heir, Jenny Macias' brother, but has not named him as a plaintiff or nominal defendant. The judge concludes that failure to make a plea of abatement risks multiple suits against Dr. Badday and prevents settlement negotiations.

The judge will consider the parties' citations and will address the issue of abatement at the hearing on November 9, 2023.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Casa Colina's motion to strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The judge notes that the plaintiff, Jenny Macias, did not obtain leave of court to seek punitive damages against a healthcare provider, as required by CCP section 425.13. The defendant, Casa Colina, has filed a motion to strike the punitive damages, and the plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to stipulate to the motion is a violation of the Civility Guidelines.

The judge also addresses the issue of abatement, which was raised by the defendant, Dr. Badday. The defendant argues that the action should be abated because there is an additional heir, Daniel Munoz, who is not a party to the action. The judge notes that the one action rule prevents multiple prosecutions against the same defendant, but that a defendant who settles with less than all known heirs waives the right to face only a single wrongful death action.

The judge finds that the declaration submitted by Dr. Badday is inconsequential to the issue of abatement and that the parties' citations overlap and do not dispute the law that governs the issue. The judge is uncertain as to what interest Jenny Macias would be representing, and finds that the failure to make a plea of abatement risks multiple suits against Dr. Badday.

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling addresses Casa Colina's motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC due to the plaintiff not obtaining leave of court pursuant to CCP section 425.13. The plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition to striking punitive damages from the prayer for relief as to Defendant Casa Colina. However, the plaintiff's failure to stipulate yet file a non-opposition is a violation of the Civility Guidelines. The judge also discusses the issue of abatement, distinguishing it from the case of Adams. The judge finds Dr. Badday's declaration inconsequential to the issue of abatement. The one action rule prevents multiple prosecutions against the same defendant, but a defendant who settles with less than all known heirs waives the right to face only a single wrongful death action.
