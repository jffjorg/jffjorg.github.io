[1] The opposition is largely a recitation of various law
without an adequate analysis.  
 


[2] Defendant notes that Plaintiff has added new
allegations and pleads inconsistent allegations. As the court does not find the
allegations amount to sham pleadings such that the previous pleadings must be
considered nor has Defendant provided an analysis as to how certain
inconsistences amount to sham pleadings and exceed scope of leave to amend, the
court will not elaborate on the point. 


[3] Plaintiff’s opposition largely takes issue with
Defendant’s citations in that the cases are inapposite. However, Defendant’s
motion provided the definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud, which the
definitions in and of themselves undermine Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations
of fraud.
