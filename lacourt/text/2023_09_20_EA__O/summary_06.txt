The Court will not elaborate on the inconsistencies in the Plaintiff's allegations. The Judge intends to dismiss or strike certain allegations and to analyze the opposition.

## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by the Defendant to dismiss the Plaintiff's claims. The judge finds that the Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's allegations are inconsistent and constitute "sham pleadings" is not well-supported. The judge also notes that the Defendant provided definitions of legal terms (malice, oppression, fraud) which, according to the judge, weaken the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud.  


The judge does not elaborate further on these points, suggesting they will be addressed in more detail at the upcoming hearing.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the opposition to the defendant's motion and finds that it is largely a recitation of various laws without adequate analysis. The defendant has also pointed out inconsistencies in the plaintiff's pleadings, but has not provided sufficient explanation for why these inconsistencies amount to "sham pleadings" that would require the court to consider the plaintiff's prior pleadings. The judge notes that the defendant's motion provided definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud, which undermine the plaintiff's conclusory allegations of fraud. The judge will not elaborate on the issue of sham pleadings, but will consider the defendant's motion based on the definitions provided.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Defendant. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion is largely a recitation of law without adequate analysis. The Defendant had noted that the Plaintiff has added new allegations and pleaded inconsistent allegations, but the Judge does not find that these allegations amount to "sham pleadings". The Plaintiff takes issue with the Defendant's citations, but the Judge notes that the Defendant's motion provides definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud that undermine the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud. The Judge does not find the Defendant's citations to be persuasive, but rather finds that the definitions provided by the Defendant are sufficient to undermine the Plaintiff's allegations. Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Plaintiff's opposition is not well-supported and that the Defendant's motion has raised significant doubts about the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud.

English text:
The Judge has reviewed the Defendant's opposition to the Plaintiff's allegations and found that it is largely a recitation of various law without an adequate analysis. The Defendant has noted that the Plaintiff has added new allegations and pleaded inconsistent allegations, but the court does not find these to be sham pleadings or exceed the scope of leave to amend. The Plaintiff's opposition takes issue with the Defendant's citations, but the court finds that the definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud provided by the Defendant undermine the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud. Therefore, the court will not consider the sham pleadings or exceed scope of leave to amend, and the Defendant's definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud undermine the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud.

## English Summary 

The Judge has reviewed the arguments presented by both parties in this case. The Judge is not convinced by Defendant's arguments, finding them to be largely a recitation of legal principles without proper analysis. 

The Judge also does not agree with Defendant's claim that Plaintiff's amended complaint contains "sham pleadings" (meaning intentionally misleading allegations).  

Furthermore, the Judge notes that Defendant's provided definitions of key legal terms, such as "malice," "oppression," and "fraud," weaken Plaintiff's argument that these terms apply to the situation.
