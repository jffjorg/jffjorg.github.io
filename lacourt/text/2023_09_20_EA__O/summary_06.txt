And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing. The opposition to the Defendant's motion is lacking in analysis and is largely a recitation of various laws. The Defendant notes that the Plaintiff has added new allegations and pleads inconsistent allegations, but the Court finds that these allegations do not amount to sham pleadings. The Plaintiff's opposition also takes issue with the Defendant's citations, claiming they are inapposite, but the Defendant's motion has provided definitions of malice, oppression, and fraud that undermine the Plaintiff's conclusory allegations of fraud. The Court will not elaborate on the inconsistencies in the Plaintiff's allegations. The Judge intends to dismiss or strike certain allegations and to analyze the opposition.
