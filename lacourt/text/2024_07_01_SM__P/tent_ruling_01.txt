Tabibiazar et al. v. Fadia et al., Case No. 23SMCV04829
Hearing date July 1, 2024
Defendant Fadia’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Tabibiazar and Yashar’s
Demurrer and Motion to Strike
 
Plaintiffs Tabibiazar and Yashar sue neighbor defendant
Fadia for nuisance; intentional and negligent trespass/encroachment; injunctive
and declaratory relief. Plaintiffs allege defendant built an unpermitted wooden
fence and concrete wall and planted ficus trees, all of which are alleged to
have damaged plaintiffs’ retaining wall. Complaint ¶13-17.
 
Defendant Fadia cross-complained alleging negligence; breach
of CC&Rs; slander of title; and permanent trespass. Defendant alleges the
retaining wall was not build in compliance with the CC&Rs, and plaintiffs
failed to maintain the wall. Cross-Compl. ¶14-17. Fadia demurs and moves to
strike.
 
 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Tabibiazar and Yashar’s
Demurrrer
 
Nuisance
 
Fadia argues the claim is barred by the statute of
limitations, as the alleged nuisance was in existence as of July 2020, when he
purchased the adjacent property, so the statue expired July 2023, per Civ. Code
§§3490, 338. The complaint alleges the wall was built in 2022 or 2023. See Compl.
¶28. Even if the wall was built and ficus trees were planted in 2020, the
complaint alleges continuing nuisance, so the statute is extended. Compl. ¶14; Beck
Dev. Co. v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App 4th 1160, 1216-1217.
OVERRULED. 


Intentional and Negligent Trespass and Encroachment
Fadia argues these causes of action are uncertain. Per Code
of Civil Procedure §430.10(f) such demurrers are disfavored and will only be
sustained where the pleading is so bad that one cannot reasonably respond. Khoury
v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616. This is not the
case here. Fadia argues the claims have not been sufficient alleged, arguing
there are no allegations he intruded on plaintiffs’ property. Plaintiffs allege
the ficus roots intruded and the wall encroached. Compl. ¶ 14. As to
intentional trespass, Fadia argues there are no allegations he intended to
encroach or trespass. Plaintiffs alleged intent. Compl. ¶ 29. As to negligent
trespass, the elements have been alleged. Compl. ¶¶ 39-40. OVERRULED. 
 
Injunctive Relief and Declaratory Relief
Fadia correctly argues injunctive and declaratory relief are
remedies, not independent causes of action. Wong v. Jing¿(2010) 189
Cal.App.4th 1354, 1360 fn. 2. Nevertheless, the designation of the requested
relief as a cause of action or remedy does not precludes the claim. McDowell
v. Watson¿(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160. Artus v. Gamercy Towers
Condominium Ass’n. (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 923, 930. OVERRULED. 
 
 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Tabibiazar and Yashar’s
Motion to Strike
Fadia moves to strike: (1) financial damages as to the first
cause of action; (2) punitive damages as to the second and fourth causes of
action; and (3) damages according to proof as to the third cause of action. 
 
Fadia argues the financial damages on the first cause of
action are vague because the complaint fails to plead the requisite
jurisdictional amount for unlimited civil. If Fadia asserts this action has
been misclassified, the proper motion is one to reclassify. DENIED.
 
Fadia argues punitive damages are not pled with the
requisite specificity. Punitive damages require more specific allegations than
mere commission of a tort. Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d
890, 894-95. Hillard v. A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374,
391-392. Plaintiffs allege defendant “knew” the fill and wall would encroach.
Complaint, para. 35. This allegation is insufficient to establish malice, fraud
or oppression or willful or conscious disregard. 
 
Fadia argues punitive damages in connection with the
injunctive relief claim should be stricken because money damages are excluded
from equitable relief. Donovan v. Poway Unified School Dist. (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 567, 594-595. GRANTED. 
 
Fadia argues the claim of damages according to proof is
vague and uncertain. DENIED. 
 
 
Defendant Fadia’s Demurrer
Permanent Trespass 
An action for permanent trespass damaging real property is
governed by the three-year statute of limitations in Code Civ. Proc. §338(d). Holdgrafer
v. Unocal Corp. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 907, 925. The wall was erected in
2009 or 2010, so the three year statute expired in 2012/13. SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Slander of Title
Slander of title requires “disparagement of another’s land
which is relied upon by a third party and which results in a pecuniary loss.” Smith
v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 625, 630. The
elements are: (1) publication; (2) without privilege or justification; (3) that
is false; and (4) causes pecuniary loss. M.F. Farming, Co. v. Couch
Distributing Co. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 180, 198-199, overruled in other
part by Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 381.

Fadia alleges plaintiffs made certain statements to
contractors, but cites no authority that these alleged statements form the
basis for a slander of title claim. Fadia does not allege that the statements
were false or allege pecuniary loss. SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Tabibiazar and Yashar’s Motion to Strike
Cross-Complaint
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code §3294,
a plaintiff must allege malice, oppression, or fraud. Smith, supra, 10
Cal. App. 4th at 1042.
 
Plaintiffs argue no facts alleging malice, fraud or oppression
justifying punitive damages were alleged, nor were facts alleged that identify
a legal basis for treble damages.
 
Plaintiffs’ alleged false statements to contractors or
alleged negligent maintenance of the wall are insufficient to plead malice or
oppression. Fadia does not allege a basis for treble damages.
 
Fadia does not oppose. GRANTED.
