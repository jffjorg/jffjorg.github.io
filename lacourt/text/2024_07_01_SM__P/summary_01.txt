And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has reviewed the pleadings and motions filed by the parties and has issued a tentative ruling on the following issues:

* Defendant Fadia's demurrer to the complaint: OVERRULED
* Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Tabibiazar and Yashar's demurrer to the cross-complaint: OVERRULED
* Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Tabibiazar and Yashar's motion to strike: DENIED
* Defendant Fadia's motion to strike: GRANTED
* Defendant Fadia's cross-complaint: SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND
* Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Tabibiazar and Yashar's motion to strike the cross-complaint: GRANTED

In essence, the court has found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged claims for nuisance, intentional and negligent trespass, and encroachment, and that the defendant's demurrers and motions to strike are without merit. The court has also found that the defendant's cross-complaint is valid, but that the plaintiffs' motion to strike it is granted. The court has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages, but has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' claim for damages according to proof.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further argument and evidence presented at the hearing.
