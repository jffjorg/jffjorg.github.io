[1]           Admittedly, as argued by
Plaintiff, this determination is generally a question of fact. (Yoon v. Lululemon
USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2021) 549 F.Supp.3d 1073, 1081.) Nonetheless, adequate
facts must still be alleged to state a claim. (See e.g., Byars v. Hot Topic,
Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2023) 656 F.Supp.3d 1051, 1068 [“Without alleging a single
specific fact in support of the contention that the third party “harvest[s]
data for financial gain,” the allegation is a mere conclusion disregarded under
Twombly and Iqbal.”].)
 


[2]           Data such as IP
addresses, location, browser types and operating systems are not “content”
under Section 631, subdivision (a). (Yale v. Clicktale, Inc. (N.D.Cal.
Apr. 15, 2021) 2021 WL 1428400, at *3 [“[T]he plaintiff
predicates her claim in part on information — such as IP addresses, locations,
browser types, and operating systems — that is not content.”].) “[T]he
term ‘contents’ refers to the intended message conveyed by the communication,
and does not include record information regarding the characteristics of the
message that is generated in the course of the communication.” (Saleh v.
Nike, Inc. (C.D.Cal. 2021) 562 F.Supp.3d 503, 517.)
