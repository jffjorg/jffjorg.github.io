And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery. The plaintiff had served a demand for production of documents set one on March 14, 2023, but the defendant had not responded to date. The judge has granted the motion, ordering the defendant to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the motion was unopposed. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(a) and (b), which state that a party who fails to serve a timely response to a discovery request may be compelled to do so, and that a party who fails to serve a timely response waives its objections to the request.
