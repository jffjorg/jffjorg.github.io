And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Levonna Lacy vs. Long Beach Public Transportation. The defendant has moved to compel responses from the plaintiff regarding a supplemental request for identification and production of documents, as well as a supplemental interrogatory. The judge has granted the motion, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days of notice of the ruling. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions, as the motion was unopposed. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(a), 2030.290(b), and 2031.300(a), which state that a party who fails to serve a timely response to a discovery request waives any objections to the request.
