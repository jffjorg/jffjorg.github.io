Request for Sanctions is denied. Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONDefendant served Request for Special Interrogatories Set No. One on August 29, 2023, and to date has not received responses (Almodovar Decl., ¶ 5.) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290(b).) A party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290(a).) The Court declines to award sanctions because the motion is unopposed.
