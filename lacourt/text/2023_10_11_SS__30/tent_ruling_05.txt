 Case Number:  21STCV39770    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  30 MICHAEL BURKE vs JIA YUAN USA CO., A CORPORATION, et alRe: Motion for Order Substituting Successor-in-InterestTENTATIVEEdith Burke’s motion for order substituting successor in interest is GRANTED.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONEdith Burke moves for a court order substituting herself as successor-in-interest for Plaintiff Michael Burke who passed away on February 9, 2023. (Edith Decl. ¶4; Exhibit B – Copy of Death Certificate.)Edith Burke has submitted a declaration form that sets forth the required affirmations pursuant to CCP section 377.32(a). (See Burke Decl. ¶ 2-7.) The declaration does not contain the exact language as provided in the statute, such as the statement: “No other person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or to be substituted for the decedent in the pending action or proceeding.” However, Ms. Burke declares that she is “[Plaintiff’s] surviving spouse, and therefore am entitled to priority in appointment as personal representative in his estate pursuant to Probate Code section 8461.” The Court finds this to be sufficient. Ms. Burke has also submitted a certified copy of Plaintiff’s death certificate. (Burke Decl. ¶ 4, Exhib. B.) Edith Burke has thus complied with CCP section 377.32.
