And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of MARGARITA CARDOSO, et al. vs CITY OF LONG BEACH, granting the Plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena for Erik Lee. The deposition subpoena was issued on March 30, 2023, and Erik Lee was personally served on April 6, 2023. Despite this, Erik Lee failed to appear at the deposition on April 26, 2023. The Court has ordered Erik Lee to appear at deposition on November 16, 2023, or within 30 days of the ruling. The Plaintiff had also requested monetary sanctions of $1,050.00 against Erik Lee for his nonappearance, but the Court has denied this request. The Court has deemed that the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is not justified at this time, as there was no violation of a prior court order or "flouting" of the discovery process.
