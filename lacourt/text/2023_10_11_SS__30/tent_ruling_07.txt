 Case Number:  22STCV19607    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  30 LORETTA TURNER KLEIN vs MARIA ESTER QUINTEROS FLORESRe: Motion to Compel Discovery (not "Further Discovery")TENTATIVEPlaintiff's Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents Set One is granted. Defendant is ordered to serve verified responses, without objections, within 20 days. The Request for Sanctions is denied. Moving Party is ordered to give notice. DISCUSSIONPlaintiff served Demand for Production of Documents Set One on March 14, 2023, and to date has not received responses (Szabo Decl.,¶  3,6.) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290(b).) A party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290(a).) The Court declines to award sanctions because the motion is unopposed.
