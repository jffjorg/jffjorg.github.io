 Case Number:  20STCV48745    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  30 MICHAEL MOORE vs MARY LOU DORGALLI, et al.Re: Motion to Compel DepositionTENTATIVEDefendant/Cross-Complainant/Cross-Defendant Mary Lou Dorgalli and Sam Dorgalli’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) of Cross-Complainant/Cross-Defendant Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority is GRANTED.  The request for sanctions is GRANTED. Cross-Complainant/Cross-Defendant Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,285.00, within 30 days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.DISCUSSIONThe Court has read and considered the moving and opposing pleadings.  The Court finds that Defendants’ Motion to Compel Deposition of Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) of MTA is warranted.  Although MTA filed a timely objection to the notice of deposition, Defendants have provided sufficient evidence to support that (1) they have attempted to meet and confer to schedule a deposition date regarding categories 1-4 with no response received and (2) information sought in category 5 may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence relevant in this present case. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Compel Deposition of Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) of MTA is GRANTED.Pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(g)(1), “If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(g)(1).)  The Court grants Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions.  Here, Defendants’ request monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,535.00 for (1) 5.0 hours for this motion and meet and confer efforts at an hourly rate of $225.00; (2) 4.0 hours reviewing MTA’s opposition and preparing the Reply brief; (3) anticipating 2.0 hours preparing and appearing at the hearing on this motion for a total of 11.0 hours; and (4) $60.00 filing fee.  The Court shall award sanctions for (1) 3.0 hours for this motion and meet and confer efforts at an hourly rate of $225.00; (2) 2.0 hours reviewing MTA’s opposition and preparing the Reply brief; and (3) $60.00 filing fee. Thus, the Court imposes sanctions against MTA and in favor of Defendants, in the amount of $1,285.00 = (5.0 hours) x ($225.00) + ($60.00).
