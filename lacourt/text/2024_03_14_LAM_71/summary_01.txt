Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for change of venue to transfer the case to Lake County. The defendants, Radiant Revolution Enterprises, LLC and Valerie Peng, had moved to change the venue from Los Angeles County to Lake County or Napa County. The plaintiff, Joey Franco, had argued that venue was proper in Los Angeles County, but the judge found that the defendants had met their burden to defeat the presumption that the plaintiff had selected the proper venue.

The judge also granted the motions of counsel for Radiant Revolution Enterprises, LLC and Valerie Peng to be relieved as counsel. The judge found that the motions were properly noticed and that there was no prejudice to the clients.

The case will now be transferred to Lake County, and the parties will need to provide notice of the change of venue.
