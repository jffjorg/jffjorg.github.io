And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant/Cross-Complainant Gideon Fridman's Motion to Tax Costs. The motion is granted in part.

The court finds that Plaintiff's counsel verified its costs memorandum, establishing a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper. However, the burden shifts to Defendant to introduce evidence to support its claim that the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to carry out the litigation.

The court agrees to tax the trial exhibits costs by $1000, finding that the expense was caused by Plaintiff's office's disorganized maintenance of the records and election to include the entire Wells Fargo case record, without determining which exhibits would actually be relevant and admissible.

The court also strikes the travel costs for $59.16, finding that routine expenses for local travel are not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

Finally, the court strikes the online skip trace for $111.51, finding that without specific information about the cost and how it accrued, it is impossible to determine if the cost is permitted or reasonable under Section 1033.5(c)(2) or (c)(3). The court also strikes the ACME pick up docs and delivery costs for $80.00 each, finding that without specific information about the cost and how it accrued, it is impossible to determine if the cost is permitted or reasonable.

The total amount of costs struck is $1059.16.
