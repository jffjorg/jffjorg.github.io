BACKGROUND
 
On March 21, 2013, Plaintiff Glenn
Stern (“Stern”) and Defendant Gideon Fridman (“Fridman”) entered into a
Retainer Agreement in which Fridman retained Stern to represent Fridman in connection
with litigation matters, including an action against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(“Wells Fargo Case.”) Stern alleges that Fridman owes Stern the sum total of
$168,227.50 for legal services rendered for work during trial and through the
conclusion of the Wells Fargo Case. On May 23, 2017, Stern filed a Complaint
against Fridman alleging: 1. Breach of Contract; 2. Common Count—Account
Stated; 3. Common Count—Goods and Services Rendered; and 4. Common Count—Open
Book Account
 
On November 29, 2018, Fridman filed a
cross complaint. Fridman alleges that sixteen weeks prior to the start of
trial, Stern told Fridman the fees would be $55,000 through trial. The parties
negotiated the amount to $50,000 and Mr. Fridman paid the amount. Fridman
stated he never was provided with any outstanding invoices, demands for
payments, etc., putting him on notice of any outstanding balance. He alleges he
did not know about outstanding fees until he was served with this lawsuit. He
never saw invoices for the claimed amounts until such invoices were produced in
discovery. Fridman terminated Stern shortly after the conclusion of the Wells
Fargo Case, yet Stern, knowing Fridman is elderly and has suffered a stroke, is
attempting to charge him fees for 2 years after the litigation was concluded. 
 
The cross-complaint asserts causes of
action for: 1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing 3. Elder Abuse 4. Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress 5. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress 6. Violation
of B&P Code 17200 and 7. Fraud
 
On May 17, 2019, the court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the fourth and fifth
causes of action without leave to amend. Defendant withdrew its third cause of
action. 
 
The action proceeded to trial and on
June 3, 2024, judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor in the amount of
$242,180.66. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Gideon Fridman’s Motion to Tax Costs
is GRANTED, in part. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Gideon Fridman moves this court for an
order striking the Memorandum of Costs filed by Plaintiff pursuant to Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1). 
 
Generally, the “prevailing party” is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).) The losing party may dispute any or all of the
items in the prevailing party’s memorandum of costs by a motion to strike or
tax costs. (CRC, rule 3.1700(b).) A motion to strike challenges the entire
costs bill whereas a motion to tax challenges particular items or amounts.
Verification of the memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s attorney
establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper. (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) To overcome that prima
facie showing, the objecting party must introduce evidence to support its claim
that the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to carry out the
litigation. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
256, 266.)
 
“Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “Allowable costs shall be
reasonable in amount.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(3).
 
There is no dispute that Plaintiff is
the prevailing party for costs purposes and is therefore entitled to recover
its reasonably necessary costs. Plaintiff’s counsel verified its costs
memorandum. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Defendant.
 
Item 12
 
Defendant moves to strike the $2,000.00
in costs for exhibits. Defendant argues the claim for exhibits of $2,000.00
seems unreasonable and is not substantiated by Plaintiff and therefore should
be taxed or reduced appropriately.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues there
were 1,474 pages for the initial set of Exhibit books and an additional 13,420
pages for Exhibit 50 (the underlying Wells Fargo case) wherein $2,200 was
incurred. As such, it is clear how reasonable and necessary the $2,000 was for
exhibit costs. 
 
In reply, Defendant argues the exhibits
were vastly duplicative, not properly identifiable and were overall not
organized. The court agrees that the expense of the trial exhibits was caused
by plaintiff’s office’s disorganized maintenance of these records and election
to include the entire Wells Fargo case record, without determining which
exhibits would actually be relevant and admissible.  Few of those records were actually used at
trial.  Accordingly, the court taxes the
trial exhibits costs by $1000.  
 
Item 16
 
Defendant moves to strike the online
skip trace on 5/24/18 for $111.51, travel roundtrip on 4/5/19 for $59.16, ACME
pick up docs on 11/2/18 for $80.00 and ACME delivery for $80.00. Defendant
contends without stating what each reimbursement being sought is for and
specifically how each cost accrued, it is impossible for the court and
Defendant to determine if the costs are permitted or reasonable under Section
1033.5(c)(2) or (c)(3). Moreover, a skip-trace and travel expenses are not
allowed and should be taxed in total. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues the
on-line skip trace is an acceptable cost since computerized research expenses,
including even legal research costs, are recoverable (Plumbers &
Steamfitters, Local 290 v. Duncan (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1099.)
Moreover, messenger service charges are allowable as costs. (see Bussey v.
Affleck (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1162.) It is unclear from the opposition what
the travel costs are for. 
 
The court strikes the travel costs for
$59.16.  It is unclear from the
opposition what the travel cost is for, but it seems it was to travel to their
office. (Frank Decl. ¶12.) Routine expenses for local travel are not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation. 
 
Accordingly, the court strikes costs in
the amount of $1059.16.
