Summary: The judge denied the plaintiff's motions for summary adjudication, finding that the plaintiff failed to meet its initial burden of showing that the opposing cross-defendants owed a duty to defend. The judge held that the subcontractors' indemnification provision, Section 27.1, requires that the claim must result from the subcontractors' performance and, in addition, arise from, in part, on the subcontractors' negligence. The plaintiff failed to provide competent evidence to support this contention.
