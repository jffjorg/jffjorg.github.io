And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which adds new causes of action and allegations against Tesla Motors, Inc. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have adequately complied with the rules of court and provided sufficient explanations for the proposed amendments. The judge also denies the applications of attorneys Conor Flynn and David William Terry to appear as counsel pro hac vice for the plaintiffs, as they failed to pay the required fee to the State Bar of California.
