  - "Section 473.5 requires that the motion to set aside the default judgment be accompanied by 'an affidavit showing under oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect' and 'a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.'" (Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi)
```

And here is the text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant ADIRC Capital LLC's Motion to Set Aside the Entry of Default. The motion was filed by the defendant, who claims that they were not aware that a default had been entered against them. The defendant, Joseph Lee, is an immigrant from China who speaks limited English and was not aware of the default until after it was entered. The court has considered the defendant's claims and has found that the defendant's lack of actual notice in time to defend was not caused by their avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The court has also granted leave to file and serve a new answer and will continue the trial.
