And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the second amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse and violation of Insurance Code section 2695.7 are not sufficient to state a cause of action. The plaintiff's complaint fails to allege any cause of action against the defendants. The defendants' motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint is deemed moot. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, and therefore leave to amend is denied.
