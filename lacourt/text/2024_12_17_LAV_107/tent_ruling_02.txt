I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On December 2, 2020,
Plaintiff Mary Howard (“Plaintiff”) was injured after she fell in El Camino
Shopping Center’s parking lot. (Complaint p. 4.) On November 10, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants El Camino Shopping Center, LLC
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10, alleging a premises liability cause of action.
(Complaint p. 4.)
 
On August 13, 2024,
Defendant  filed four discovery motions:
(1) a Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Appear for a Deposition (“Motion to Compel
Second Deposition”); (2) a Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One (“Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories”); (3) a Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Response to Request of
Production of Documents, Set Two (“Motion to Compel Response to Request for
Production”); and (4) a Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Response to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two (“Motion to Compel Response to Special
Interrogatories”). Plaintiff filed no oppositions.
 
On October 2, 2024,
the parties appeared at, but did not participate in, an informal discovery
conference. (10/02/24 Minute Order.) The court informed both sides that participation
would in an IDC would be necessary, but neither side scheduled one. Nevertheless,
the court addresses the motions as set forth below.
 
II.            
MOTION TO COMPEL SECOND DEPOSITION
 
a.     Legal
Standard
 
“Once any party has
taken the deposition of any natural person, including that of a party to the
action, neither the party who gave, nor any other party who has been served
with a deposition notice pursuant to Section 2025.240 may take a subsequent
deposition of that deponent.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.610(a).)
 
However, “for good
cause shown, the court may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition, and the
parties, with the consent of any deponent who is not a party, may stipulate
that a subsequent deposition be taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.610(b).)
 
b.     Discussion
 
On June 7, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with a notice of
deposition. (Zade Declaration ¶
8.) 
The notice of deposition requested Plaintiff appear
and produce documents for the deposition. (Zade Declaration Ex. B; Zade
Declaration ¶ 7.) The deposition was scheduled for June 10, 2024. (Zade
Declaration ¶ 8.) Plaintiff did not object to the notice of deposition. (Zade
Declaration ¶ 8.) Plaintiff produced no documents at the deposition. (Zade
Declaration ¶ 9.) However, Plaintiff confirmed during the deposition that
responsive documents existed. (Zade Declaration ¶ 10.) 
 
Defendant’s counsel states that, at the deposition,
“Plaintiff testified to relevant prior injuries and preexisting conditions
which were not disclosed in written discovery.” (Zade Declaration ¶ 10.) This
includes Plaintiff’s “claims she suffered an aortic aneurysm, among other
injuries, as a result of this trip and fall” and “a prior,
previously-undisclosed blood clot [Plaintiff attributed] to the 2015 Porter
Ranch gas leak.” (Zade Declaration ¶ 10.) Defendant’s counsel further states
that “Plaintiff’s current counsel represented Plaintiff in the 2015 Porter
Ranch litigation” and “Plainitff confirmed documents reflecting relevant
medical treatment existed and would be provided to her counsel, Ms. Kruger, to
be turned over to Defendant’s counsel.” (Zade Declaration ¶ 10.)  
 
The parties suspended the deposition and agreed
Plaintiff would attend a second deposition. (Zade Declaration ¶ 12.) The next
day, Defendant’s counsel and Plaintiff’s counsel agreed that Plaintiff would
“provide the medical records from the 2015 Porter Ranch claim” and “produce the
questionnaire completed and produced as discovery in the Porter Ranch claim and
any other medical records reflecting prior claims, such as the ‘fender benders’
Plaintiff testified to during deposition yesterday.” (Zade Declaration ¶ 13.)
During a July 17, 2024, status conference, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that “a
search had been conducted and no documents had been found.” (Zade Declaration ¶
17.) 
 
The court may grant
leave to allow a second deposition if there is good cause. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.610(b).) Defendant has shown good cause exist because Plaintiff
indicated at the first deposition that responsive documents exist but failed to
produce any responsive documents at that deposition. Further, although
Plaintiff’s counsel purportedly represented at a status conference that no such
responsive documents exist, Defendant should have the opportunity at a second
deposition to inquire about Plaintiff’s representation that responsive
documents existed. 
Thus,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Second Deposition is granted.
Plaintiff is ordered to appear at a second deposition and produce responsive
documents within thirty (30) days’ notice of this court’s order.
 
c.      Sanctions
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in
the sum of $2,370.00. (Motion to 
Compel Second Plaintiff’s Second Deposition p. 7.) This
includes the $60.00 motion filing fee and 
7.7 hours of attorneys’ fees for preparing the Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Second Deposition, 
reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and attending
the hearing. (Zade Declaration ¶¶
20
22.) 
 
Defendant argues sanctions are warranted under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2023.030 and 2023.010, which reference sanctioning a
person engaging in a misuse of the discovery process. (Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Second Deposition p. 6.) 
 
Defendant also cites section 2025.450(g)(1), which
authorizes sanctions when a party, “without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice[.]” (Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Second Deposition p. 6.)
 
This court is not convinced that Plaintiff engaged in
a misuse of the discovery process as described in Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010. Further, given Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel have given
inconsistent representations regarding whether responsive documents exist, this
court also declines to award sanctions under section 2025.450(g)(1).
 
III.          
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES
 
a.      Timeliness
 
“Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(c).) This deadline is
jurisdictional, and courts are without authority to grant untimely motions.¿ (Vidal
Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)¿When
verifications are provided electronically, the deadline is extended by two
court days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)
 
Plaintiff served verified responses
to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories on January 23, 2024. (Zade Declaration Ex.
B p. 14.) On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff agreed to provide supplemental responses,
and executed a verification to the supplemental Form Interrogatories. (Zade
Declaration Ex. C.) 
 
Although Plaintiff agreed to
provide supplemental responses, there is no evidence in the record 
that the parties agreed to extend
Defendant’s deadline to file the Motion to Compel Further 
Responses to Form Interrogatories.  Accordingly, Defendant was required to file
this motion
within forty-five days after
Plaintiff served the supplemental verified responses on June 11, 2024, plus an
additional two court days because it was served electronically.
 
Forty-five days after June 11,
2024, was July 26, 2024. Two court days after July 26, 2024, was 
July 30, 2024. Defendant filed the
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories 
on August 13, 2024. 
 
Accordingly,
the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories was untimely
filed.
 
IV.          
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION
 
a.    
Meet
and Confer
 
“Unlike
a¿motion¿to¿compel¿further¿responses, a¿motion¿to¿compel¿responses is not
subject to a 45–day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet¿and¿confer’
requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)
 
Thus, Defendant was not required to
file a meet and confer declaration for the Motion to Compel Response to Request
for Production.
 
b.    
Legal
Standard
 
“I]f a party to whom¿a¿demand¿for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling¿is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it,… [t]he party to whom the¿demand¿for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling¿is directed waives any objection to the demand [and]…[t]he
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to
the¿demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2031.300.) “The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that . . . (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. [and] (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).) 
 
“[T]he court shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300(c).
 
c.      Discussion
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with the Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. (Zade
Declaration ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s responses were due on July 29, 2024. (Zade
Declaration ¶ 4.) Plaintiff did not serve Defendant with responses. (Zade
Declaration ¶ 9.) 
 
Thus, Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Response to Request for Production is granted. Plaintiff is 
ordered to serve Defendant with
responses within thirty (30) days’ notice of this order.
 
d.     Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks $1,380.00 in
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. (Motion to Compel Response to Request for
Production p. 4.) Defendant’s declaration combines the time spent on this
Motion with the Motion to Compel Response to Special Interrogatories.
Accordingly, this court addresses the sanctions relating to the Motion to
Compel Response to Request for Production below.
 
V.             
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSE TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES
 
a.     Timeliness
 
There
is no time limit to file a motion to compel when no responses have been served.
(Sinaiko
Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 411 
[“The 45-day limit . . . applies
only to motions to compel further responses to interrogatories under § 2030.300
. . . Section 2030.290 contains no such limitation[.]”])
 
b.     Meet
and Confer
 
“Unlike
a¿motion¿to¿compel¿further¿responses, a¿motion¿to¿compel¿responses is not
subject to a 45–day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet¿and¿confer’
requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
 
Thus, Defendant was not required to
file a meet and confer declaration for the Motion to Compel Response to Special
Interrogatories. Regardless, Defendant’s counsel’s declaration states counsel
sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter, but Plaintiff’s counsel did
not respond. (Zade Declaration ¶¶ 6-7.)
 
c.      Legal
Standard
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [that party] waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290.)
“The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) “The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(a).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).)
 
d.     Discussion
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories, Set Two. (Zade Declaration ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff’s responses were due on July 29, 2024. (Zade Declaration ¶ 4.) Plaintiff
did not serve Defendant with responses. (Zade Declaration ¶ 9.) 
 
Thus, Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Response to Special Interrogatories is granted. Plaintiff is 
ordered to serve Defendant with
responses within thirty (30) days’ notice of this order.
 
e.      Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks $1,380.00 in
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for the Motion to Compel response to
Special Interrogatories. (Motion to Compel Response to Special Interrogatories
p. 4.) In combination with the Motion to Compel Response to Request for
Production, this includes a $60.00 motion filing fee, 4.5 hours of attorneys’
fees for preparing the two motions and supporting documents, and 4.5 hours for
reviewing the oppositions, preparing replies, and appearing at the hearing on
these motions. (Zade Declaration ¶¶ 10-12.)
 
This court finds that Plaintiff did
not act with substantial justification and no other circumstances make imposing
sanctions unjust. 
 
This court further finds that 4.5
hours for preparing two boilerplate discover motions is excessive, and attorneys’
fees for reviewing the oppositions and preparing replies are not warranted
because no oppositions or replies were filed.
 
Accordingly, this court grants
Defendant’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $960.00, reflecting a
$60.00 motion filing fee, two hours for preparing the two motions and related
documents, and one hour for attending the hearing on these motions, at $300.00
per hour.
 
VI.          
CONCLUSION
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court grants the Motion to Compel Second
Deposition, Motion to 
Compel Response to Request for Production,
and Motion to Compel Response to Special Interrogatories. This court also
grants Defendant’s request for sanctions relating to the Motion to Compel
Response to Request for Production and Motion to Compel Response to Special
Interrogatories in the reduced amount of $960.00. 
 
This court denies the Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories because it is untimely.
