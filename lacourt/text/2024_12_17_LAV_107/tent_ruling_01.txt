COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Petition for Release
  from Property Lien                         



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: Denied.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On or about January 1, 2021, Plaintiff Jubilio
Escalera (“Plaintiff”) executed a written credit application and agreement for
the conversion of an existing garage to an ADU. (Complaint ¶ 13.) Defendants
Sergio Miramontes, Rosa Miramontes, and Does 1 through 10 were the owners or
reputed owners of the construction project. (Complaint ¶¶ 7-8.) Plaintiff
supplied materials for the project. (Complaint ¶ 14.) Defendants failed to
remit payment to Plaintiff. (Complaint ¶ 16.) 
 
On May 11, 2022, Plaintiff recorded a mechanics lien
against the project for the sum of $35,000.00. (Complaint ¶¶ 17-18.) On August
12, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Sergio Miramontes,
Rosa Miramontes, and Does 1 through 50, alleging a single cause of action for
foreclosure of mechanics lien. 
 
On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff orally moved to dismiss
the complaint without prejudice. (08/19/24 Minute Order.)
 
On October 2, 2024, Defendants Sergio Miramontes and
Rosa Miramontes (“Defendants”) filed a petition for release of property lien.
On November 7, 2024, this court denied that petition. (11/07/24 Minute Order p.
6.)
 
On December 2, 2024, Defendants filed an amended
petition for release of property lien (the “Amended Petition”). No opposition
has been filed.
 
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The owner of property or the owner
of any interest in property subject to a claim of lien may petition the court
for an order to release the property from the claim of lien if the claimant has
not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time provided
in Section 8460.” (Civ. Code § 8480(a).) Under section 8460, “[t]he claimant
shall commence an action to enforce a lien within 90 days after recordation of
the claim of lien. If the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the
lien within that time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.”
(Civ. Code § 8460.)
 
“An owner of property may not
petition the court for a release order under this article unless at least 10
days before filing the petition the owner gives the claimant notice demanding
that the claimant execute and record a release of the claim of lien. The notice
shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 2 (commencing with Section
8100) of Title 1, and shall state the grounds for the demand.” (Civ. Code
§ 8482.)  The notice shall be given
by personal delivery, mail in the manner provided in Section 8110, or leaving
the notice and mailing a copy in the manner provided in Section 415.20 of the
Code of Civil Procedure for service of summons and complaint in a civil action.
(Civ. Code § 8106.)
 
Under Civil Code section 8102, the
notice must include: 
 
(1)   The name and address of the owner
or reputed owner.
 
(2)   The name and address of the direct
contractor.
 
(3)   The name and address of the
construction lender, if any.
 
(4)   A description of the site
sufficient for identification, including the street address of the site, if
any. If a sufficient legal description of the site is given, the effectiveness
of the notice is not affected by the fact that the street address is erroneous
or is omitted.
 
(5)   The name, address, and relationship
to the parties of the person giving the notice.
 
(6)   If the person giving the notice is
a claimant:
 
(A)  A general statement of the work
provided.
 
(B)  The name of the person to or for
whom the work is provided.
 
(C) A statement or estimate of the
claimant's demand, if any, after deducting all just credits and offsets.
 
(Civ. Code § 8102(a).)
 
The clerk shall set a hearing date
not more than thirty days after the filing of the petition. (Civil Code
§ 8486(a).) “The petitioner
shall serve a copy of the petition and a notice of hearing on the claimant at
least 15 days before the hearing. Service shall be made in the same manner as
service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, addressed to the claimant as provided in Section 8108.”
 (Civ. Code § 8486(b).) “Notwithstanding Section 8116,
when service is made by mail, service is complete on the fifth day following
deposit of the petition and notice in the mail.” (Civ. Code § 8486(c).)
 
A petition to release a mechanic’s
lien must be verified and allege all of the following:
 
(a)  
The date of recordation of the claim of
lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the petition.
 
(b)  
The county in which the claim of lien is
recorded.
 
(c)  
The book and page or series number of the
place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
 
(d)  
The legal description of the property
subject to the claim of lien.
 
(e)  
Whether an extension of credit has been
granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and
that the time for commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
 
(f)   
That the owner has given the claimant
notice under Section 8482 demanding that the
claimant execute and record a release of the lien and that the claimant is
unable or unwilling to do so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
 
(g)  
Whether an action to enforce the lien is
pending.
 
(h)  
Whether the owner of the property or
interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is another
restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to enforce the
lien.
 
(Civ.
Code § 8484.)
 
“At the hearing both (1) the
petition and (2) the issue of compliance with the service and date for hearing
requirements of this article are deemed controverted by the claimant. The
petitioner has the initial burden of producing evidence on those matters. The
petitioner has the burden of proof as to the issue of compliance with the
service and date for hearing requirements of this article. The claimant has the
burden of proof as to the validity of the lien.” (Civ. Code § 8488(a).) “If
judgment is in favor of the petitioner, the court shall order the property
released from the claim of lien.” (Civ. Code § 8488(b).) “The prevailing party
is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.” (Civ. Code § 8488(c).)
 
III.          
DISCUSSION

 
Plaintiff recorded the mechanics lien on May 11, 2022.
(Complaint ¶¶ 17-18.) (The
Mechanics Lien is dated 05/02/22, (Complaint Ex. A) but the complaint states it
was recorded 05/11/22. Regardless, the complaint was filed more than 90 days
after the lien was filed.) Ninety
days after May 11, 2022, was August 9, 2022. Plaintiff filed the complaint on
August 12, 2022. Accordingly, Plaintiff did not file the complaint within the
time permitted under Section 8460 and Defendants may petition this court for an
order releasing the property from the claim of lien.
 
On June 4, 2024, Defendants notified Plaintiff by
FedEx overnight delivery that they would be filing a petition to expunge the
lien. (Kohler Declaration ¶ 10; Ex. D.) Under section 8482, notice must be
given at least ten days before filing the petition. (Civ. Code § 8482.)
When notice is given by mail, “[s]ervice is complete at the time of the deposit, but any period of notice and any
right or duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date
certain after service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed
by statute or rule of court, shall be extended five calendar days, upon service
by mail, if the place of address and the place of mailing is within the State
of California.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013(a); Civ. Code
§ 8116(b).) Defendants filed the Amended Petition on December 2, 2024.
December 2, 2024, is more than fifteen days after June 4, 2024. Thus,
Defendants gave Plaintiff timely notice.
 
Defendants attach a Demand for
Release of Claim of Lien, dated June 4, 2024. The notice contains Defendants’
names and address. (Kohler Declaration Ex. D p. 1.) It also contained the name
and address of the contractor, Santa Fe General Construction, Inc., c/o Jublio
Escalera. (Kohler Declaration Ex. D. p. 1.) Further, the notice contains the
property’s address, which is sufficient to identify the site. (Kohler
Declaration Ex. D p. 1.) Finally, the notice was signed by Defendants’ attorney
and the notice identified him as such. (Kohler Declaration Ex. D p. 1.)
Accordingly, the contents of Defendants’ notice is sufficient. (See Civ. Code
§ 8102(a).)
 
The hearing is set for December 17, 2024. The Amended
Petition was filed on December 2, 2024. 
Thus, Civil Code section 8486’s requirement that the hearing date
be set for a date not more than thirty days after the filing of the petition is
satisfied.
 
Defendants attach proofs of service
showing Defendants served Plaintiff with the amended notice of hearing on
November 12, 2024, and Amended Petition on November 19, 2024. (Notice of
Hearing on Petition filed 11/12/24; Proof of Service filed 11/19/24.)  The petitioner must serve a copy of the
petition and notice on the claimant at least fifteen days before the hearing.
(See Civ. Code § 8486(b).) “Notwithstanding Section 8116,
when service is made by mail, service is complete on the fifth day following
deposit of the petition and notice in the mail.” (Civ. Code § 8486(c).)
These dates are more than twenty days before December 17, 2024. Thus,
Defendants timely served Plaintiff with the amended notice and Amended
Petition.
 
Civil Code section 8486 also provides that “[s]ervice shall
be made in the same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the claimant as
provided in Section 8108.” (Civ. Code § 8486(b).) A summons may
be served to a party in California by personal delivery, delivery to someone
else at the party’s usual residence or place of business, by mail coupled with
acknowledgement of receipt, or by publication. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 415.10,
415.20, 415.30, 415.50.) 
 
Defendants served Plaintiff with the amended notice of
the hearing via first class mail by placing the documents “in the United States
mail in a sealed envelope with postage fully prepaid . . .” and by email.
(Notice of Hearing on Petition filed 11/12/24.) The Amended Petition was served
via FedEx envelope, and that proof of service states that a “[s]ignature [was]
not required.” 
 
Civil Code section 8486 permits serving the notice and
petition in the same manner as a service of summons. “A summons may be served by mail as provided in this section.
A copy of the summons and of the complaint shall be mailed (by first-class mail
or airmail, postage prepaid) to the person to be served, together with two
copies of the notice and acknowledgment provided for in subdivision (b) and a
return envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the sender.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
415.30.) The proofs of service
here do not comply with these requirements because they contain no indication
Plaintiff was also served with two copies of the notice and acknowledgement
provided for in subdivision (b) or that a return envelope was provided.
Thus, Defendants did not give Plaintiff proper notice of the hearing and
Amended Petition.
 
The Amended Petition alleges the claim of lien was
recorded on May 11, 2022. (Amended Petition ¶ 7.) A certified copy of the
Mechanic’s Lien is attached to the Amended Petition. (Amended Petition Ex. A.) 
 
The Amended Petition also alleges the claim of lien
was recorded in the County of Los Angeles and identifies the document number as
“Document No. 20220514463.” (Amended Petition ¶ 7.) The Amended Petition
alleges Defendants gave Plaintiff notice by demanding Plaintiff execute and
record a release of the lien on May 6, 2024, June 4, 2024, and August 22, 2024.
(Amended Petition ¶¶ 11-12, 16.) The Amended Petition also alleges Plaintiff
refused to execute the Release of Mechanics Lien following Defendants’ June 4,
2024, demand. (Amended Petition ¶ 13.) Further, the Amended Petition alleges
Defendants received no response to their August 22, 2024, demand. (Amended
Petition ¶ 16.)  Further, the Amended
Petition states Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his complaint to foreclose the
mechanics lien on August 19, 2024, and “Defendants had filed no action, nor
sought relief under any law governing bankruptcy, and there was no restraint to
prevent Plaintiff from timely filing a Complaint to Foreclose on the Mechanic’s
Lien[.]” (Amended Petition ¶¶ 14, 16.) Finally, the Amended Petition is
verified by the Defendants. (Amended Petition pdf pp. 6-7.)
 
Defendants’ service of the amended notice of hearing
and Amended Petition did not comply with Civil Code section 8486. Accordingly,
this court denies Defendants’ Amended Petition.
 
Defendants seek $12,964.75 in attorneys’ fees.
(Petition p. 5.) Defendants have not prevailed, so this court denies the
request. (See Civ. Code § 8488(c).)
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Amended
Petition is denied, without prejudice.
