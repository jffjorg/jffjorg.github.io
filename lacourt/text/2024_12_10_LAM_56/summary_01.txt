And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ricardo Alberto Alvarez vs. Abdul Oil Corporation and Abdul Wahab Hidayatulla. The case involves allegations of discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful termination by the defendants against the plaintiff, who is seeking damages and penalties.

The defendants have moved to set aside the default judgment entered against them, arguing that their failure to respond to the complaint was due to a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants were properly served and that their failure to respond was intentional.

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to vacate the default judgment, finding that the defendants have not shown that they were not properly served. However, the Judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment, finding that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to support his claims.

The Judge has also ordered the defendants to pay $750 in civil penalties for failing to permit the plaintiff to inspect their personnel and payroll records. The case is set for further hearing on December 10, 2024.
