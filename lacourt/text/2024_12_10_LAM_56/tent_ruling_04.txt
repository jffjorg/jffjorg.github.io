BACKGROUND
            This is an employment discrimination
action. On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff Juan Manuel Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendants alleging causes of action for:
(1) Discrimination in Violation of Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; (2)
Retaliation in Violation of Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; (3) Failure to
Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of Government Code §§ 12940(k);
(4) Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of Government
Code §§ 12940 et seq.; (5) Failure to Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process
in Violation of Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; (6) For Declaratory Judgment;
(7) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy; (8) Failure to Pay
Wages [Cal. Labor Code §§ 201, 1182.12, 1194, 1194.2]; (9) Failure to Pay
Minimum Wages [Cal. Labor Code §§ 1182.12, 1194, 1194.2, 1197]; (10) Failure to
Pay Overtime Compensation [Cal. Labor Code §§ 510, 1194]; (11) Failure to
Provide Meal Periods [Cal. Labor Code §§ 226 et seq.; (12) Failure to Provide
Itemized Wage and Hour Statements [Cal. Labor Code §§ 226 et seq.; (13) Waiting
Time Penalties [Cal. Labor Code §§ 210-203]; (14) Failure to Permit Inspection
of Personnel and Payroll Records [Cal. Labor Code §§ 1198.5]; and (15) Unfair
Competition [Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.]. 
 
            On September 9, 2024, Defendants
filed this demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the Complaint. On November 20, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (the “FAC”). Proof of service
indicates that the FAC was served on Defendants on November 20, 2024 via email.
 
 
DISCUSSION
            “A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the
parties.” (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 472, subd. (a).) “All papers
opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on
each party at least nine court days … before the hearing.” (CCP § 1005, subd.
(b).) “[T]he filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior
complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477; see also Sylmar
Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [“The filing of [a] first amended complaint render[s] [a
movant’s] demurrer moot since “‘an amendatory pleading supersedes the original
one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading”’” (citations
omitted)].) Accordingly, a “demurrer [directed to the original pleading] should
[be] taken off calendar” when an amended complaint is filed. (People ex rel.
Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.) 
 
This
right is limited, however, to the amendment of a complaint initiating an action
into a first amended complaint; otherwise stated, a party cannot amend an
already amended complaint as a matter of course even though a demurrer has been
directed to the operative and already amended pleading. (Hedwall v. PCMV,
LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564, 572-579.) Further, one defendant’s filing of
an answer did not divest the plaintiff of the right to amend the complaint with
respect to the causes of action brought against other demurring defendants. (Barton
v. Kahn (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1219-1221.) 
 
            Pursuant to CCP section 472,
subdivision (a), Plaintiff was entitled to, as a matter of right, file a first
amended complaint as of November 25, 2024, nine court days prior to this
hearing. Plaintiff filed the FAC on November 20, 2024. Thus, Plaintiff’s filing
the FAC renders the subject demurrer moot. (CCP § 472 subd. (a); JKC3H8, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at
477.)
 
            Defendants’ Demurrer to the Complaint
is OVERRULED as MOOT. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 10th day of December 2024
