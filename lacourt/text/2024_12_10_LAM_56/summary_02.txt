And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to set aside default and the opposition to the motion. The motion is denied without prejudice because it does not include a copy of the answer proposed to be filed. The Court also denies the application for default judgment without prejudice. The Court finds that the entry of default was proper based on the Defendants' failure to answer the Complaint. The Court also finds that the motion to set aside default is not supported by the evidence presented.

The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.

The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, which allows a party to relieve themselves from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Court also relies on Labor Code Sections 98.6, 1102.5, 1194.2, 226, 226.3, 201-203, and 1198.5, which provide for penalties and damages for various labor code violations.
