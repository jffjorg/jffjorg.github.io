BACKGROUND
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
complaint against Defendants. Plaintiff’s complaint arises from Plaintiff's
employment with Defendants and alleges causes of action for: (1) discrimination;
(2) retaliation – Gov't Code §§12940 et seq.; (3) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation; (4) failure to
provide reasonable accommodations; (5) failure to engage in good faith
interactive process; (6) declaratory judgment; (7) retaliation – Lab. Code §98.6;
(8) retaliation – Lab. Code §§1102.5, 1102.6); (9) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy; (10) failure to pay wages; (11) failure to pay
minimum wages; (12) failure to pay overtime compensation; (13) failure to
provide meal and rest periods; (14) failure to provide itemized wage and hour
statements; (15) waiting time penalties; (16) failure to permit inspection; and
(17) unfair competition.
 
On
April 4, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. 
 
On
June 4, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s default judgment application without
prejudice for a) failure to submit a signed memorandum of costs and
disbursements; b) failure to submit a signed declaration of nonmilitary status
for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; c) failure to obtain
dismissal of Does 1 through 20; d) failure to present exhibits to substantiate
damages and penalties. 
 
On
August 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second request for entry of default judgment.

 
On
August 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal as to Does 1 through
20. Dismissal was entered on August 21, 2024. 
 
On
August 30, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to set aside default and
default judgment. Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 14, 2024. 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Motion to Set Aside Default
The court is empowered to relieve a party or
their legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect. (CCP § 473, subd. (b).) Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. (Id.) The law favors a trial
on the merits and courts therefore liberally construe section 473. (Bonzer
v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1477.) Doubts in
applying section 473 are resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default. (Id. at 1478.)
 
Defendants contend that their failure to timely
respond before default was entered was reasonable and not their fault. (Motion, p. 10.) Hidayatulla argues
that he was not properly served with the Complaint, Summons or other related
papers as Plaintiff’s purported substitute service of the Summons and Complaint
is highly suspect. (Id.) In support of this argument, Hidayatulla declares that he was out
of the country when the complaint was served onto an employee of his business
who was not authorized to accept service. (Hidayatulla Decl., ¶ 8.) Hidayatulla
states that he left the United States for India on Monday January 1, 2024,
and left his employees to
run their schedules while he continued to monitor the business from abroad with
the occasional visit by family members that stayed behind. (Id., ¶ 3.) Hidayatulla declares that he did
not know about this lawsuit until his son notified him that there was a lawsuit
filed against him by a former employee. (Id.) Once Hidayatulla was notified, he declares
that he immediately reached out to his attorney in June of 2024. (Id., ¶
4.) Defendants claim that they attempted to stipulate for relief from the
default but Plaintiff refused. (Motion, p. 2.)
 
In
Opposition, Plaintiff argues that Hidayatulla was the registered agent for
service of process and had to be available during business hours to accept
service but failed to do so as he was out of the country. (Opposition, p. 4.) Plaintiff
contends that Defendants were properly served by substituted service when
Plaintiff left summons with a person apparently in charge at Defendant’s
office, such that any failure to respond is the result of Defendants’
inexcusable neglect. (Id., p. 5.) Plaintiff also argues that Hidayatulla
was on notice of the lawsuit as early as January 18, 2024, based on one of his
employees contacting Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the lawsuit. Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that someone named Alicia Galavan called their office on
January 18, 2024, identifying themselves as one of Defendants’ employees and
Plaintiff’s former coworkers. (Karapetyan Decl., ¶ 8.) Galvan allegedly urged
Plaintiff’s counsel to dismiss the lawsuit and threatened to report Plaintiff
to law enforcement unless the lawsuit was withdrawn. (Id.) Plaintiff
also contends that after Hidayatulla’s attorney reached out to Plaintiff’s
counsel, the parties agreed to engage in informal negotiations to settle this
matter but months went by without any substantive settlement communications
from Defendants, necessitating the filing of the request for default judgment.
(Karapetyan Decl., ¶ 14.)
 
The
Court finds that Defendants have adequately shown that the entry of default
based on their failure to answer the Complaint was the result of Hidayatulla’s
mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect in being out of the country and
failing to have an employee notify them of service. The application for relief
is made no more than six months after April 4, 2024, when default was entered. Although,
the Motion is not accompanied by a copy of the answer proposed to be filed, or
a declaration from Defendants’ counsel. Accordingly, the Court DENIES WITHOUT
PREJUDICE the instant motion to vacate default for failure to include a copy of
the answer proposed to be filed.  
 
Plaintiff
argues in opposition that Defendants should be required to pay compensatory
legal fees in the amount of $4,000, representing ten (10) hours of attorney
time at $400 an hour for preparing the opposition, reviewing Defendant’s
expected reply, and attending the hearing. (Karapetyan Decl., ¶¶ 17-19).  CCP § 473(b) states that “[t]court shall,
whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties…” Here, there is no attorney affidavit of fault. The failure
to answer was based on Hidayatulla’s
own fault rather than his attorney’s. Thus, Plaintiff’s request for compensatory
legal fees is DENIED.  
 
Application for Default Judgment
Plaintiff seeks judgment to be entered in the
amount of $183,393.60, consisting of $158,451.20 as the demand of complaint,
$10,461.81 in interest, $672.59 in costs, and $13,808.00 in attorney fees. 
 
Plaintiff seeks $50,000 for emotional
suffering and distress. (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 32.) Plaintiff declares that, as a
result of Defendants’ retaliation and wrongful termination, Plaintiff suffered from
emotional distress, anxiety, stress, depression, headaches, tension, and
insomnia. (Id.) Plaintiff declares that whenever he thinks about what he
was subjected to while employed by Defendants, he becomes emotionally sad,
discouraged, and low-spirited. (Id.) Plaintiff did not seek any medical
treatment or attention for emotional distress. (Alvarez Supp. Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Plaintiff seeks $23,560.00 in lost wages. (Alvarez
Decl., ¶ 33.) Plaintiff declares that as a result of Defendants wrongfully
terminating Plaintiff, he was unable to find new employment until on or around
November 9, 2023. (Id.) His weekly earnings with Defendants were
approximately $620.00 ($15.50 per hour x 40 hours = $620 per week) and he was
out of work approximately 38 weeks. (Id.)
 
Plaintiff seeks civil penalties totaling
$20,000, $10,000 each for Defendants’ violations of Labor Code §§98.6 and
1102.5 in retaliating against Plaintiff for complaining about unpaid wages.
(Alvarez Decl., ¶ 34.)  
 
Plaintiff seeks unpaid minimum wages totaling
$13,992 for various periods where Plaintiff was paid below the requisite
minimum wage rate. (Alvarez Decl., ¶¶ 35-36.) 

 
Plaintiff seeks liquidated damages pursuant
to Labor Code §1194.2 in an amount equal to the minimum wages unlawfully unpaid
as previously alleged, an additional $13,992.00, plus interest thereon. (Alvarez
Decl., ¶ 37.)  
 
Plaintiff seeks unpaid overtime wages
totaling $5,972.20. (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 39.) 

 
Plaintiff seeks $22,465.00 [$11,232.50 +
$11,232.50= $22,465] for payment of meal and rest period compensation, pursuant
to Labor Code §§ 226.7 and 512. (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 42.)  
 
Plaintiff seeks $4,000 for failure to provide
itemized wage and hour statements under Labor Code §226. (Alvarez Decl., ¶
43.)  
Plaintiff seeks $12,250 for failure to
provide itemized wage and hour statements under Labor Code §226.3. (Alvarez
Decl., ¶ 44.)  
 
Plaintiff seeks $3,720 for waiting time
penalties under Labor Code §§ 201-203. (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 45.)  
 
Plaintiff seeks $750 in civil penalties under
Labor Code §1198.5 for failure to provide personnel and payroll records or
permit Plaintiff to view those records after making a written request on
February 20, 2023. (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 46.) 

 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s application
meets a majority of the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 as
it contains interest computations, a memorandum of costs and disbursements, a
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought, a proposed form of judgment, and a request for attorney fees. Plaintiff
also filed a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought. 
 
Although, the application does not contain exhibits
in support of the judgment requested. In Plaintiff’s declarations, Plaintiff
requests various forms of relief that would require exhibits, such as Plaintiff’s
paystubs, to establish Plaintiff’s hourly rate of pay, hours worked, and lack
of meal and rest periods at various times. Plaintiff submits his declaration of
conclusory statements alone to substantiate his claims, which is insufficient
at this stage. The only exhibit proffered that supports any of Plaintiff’s
claims is Plaintiff’s Counsel’s February 20, 2023, letter to Defendants demanding
inspection of Plaintiff’s personnel and payroll records, which Plaintiff
declares was ignored. (Karapetyan Decl., Ex. 1; Alvarez Decl., ¶ 46.) This
exhibit coupled with Plaintiff’s declarations are sufficient to entitle
Plaintiff to $750 in civil penalties against Defendants for failure to permit
inspection of personnel and payroll records under Labor Code §§ 226(c), 1198.5.
Therefore, Plaintiff fails
to present exhibits to substantiate damages and penalties for the majority of
his claims.
 
RULING
The
Court, therefore, DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendants’ motion to vacate default
for failure to include a copy of the answer proposed to be filed.  
 
Plaintiff’s application for default judgment
is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
