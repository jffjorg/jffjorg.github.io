MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Patriot Environmental Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None.

 
            The Court has considered the moving reply
papers. No opposition or reply has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from remediation
services allegedly provided by Plaintiff after a boat fire that occurred at the
marina located at 1970 Taylor Road, Bethel Island, CA 94511, known as Anchor
Marina. Plaintiff alleges that Anchor Marina Inc. (“AMI”) failed to pay Patriot’s
outstanding invoice of over $400,000 for services rendered. Plaintiff filed
this action against AMI on October 1, 2021.  On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which named BI Properties, Inc., Kevin
Davidson (“Davidson”) and Allen Wagner (“Wagner”) as additional defendants. The
FAC asserts causes of action for: 1) Breach of Contract; 2) Common Count: Goods
and Services Rendered; 3) Intentional Misrepresentation (Fraud); 4) Promissory
Fraud; 5) Negligent Misrepresentation; 6) Fraudulent Inducement; and 7) Violation
of Business & Professions Code Section 17200.
 
On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for
Production (Set No. 1) from
Defendant Kevin Davidson and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for
Production (Set No. 1) from Defendant Allen Wagner (the “Motions”). No
opposition has been filed. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (Both Motions, Astarabadi Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
DISCUSSION
Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
            A motion to compel a response is
used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to
interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission. (Code Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
403.) 
 
CCP section 2031.320 subdivision (a)
provides that “[i]f a party filing a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's statement of compliance,
the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.”¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
“Unless notice of this motion is given
within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding
party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.”¿ (CCP §
2031.310 subd. (c).)¿¿
 
            Plaintiff propounded Requests for
Production (Set No. 1) on Wagner and Davidson on May 28, 2024 via mail. On July
17, 2024, Plaintiff filed six discovery motions, including motions to compel
responses to requests for production (Set No. 1) from both Davidson and Wagner.
Wagner and Davidson served their responses on September 17, 2024. The responses
included objections and a statement that the “[r]esponding party will produce
all responsive non-privileged documents in his possession, custody or control.”
(Both Motions, Korenaga Decl., Ex. 2.)   The
matter came for hearing on October 3, 2024. The Court granted the motions and
ordered that the objections in the responses be stricken. (10/3/2024 Minute
Order.) 
 
            Plaintiff asserts that, to date, no responsive
documents have been produced. Moreover, neither Wagner nor Davidson have
opposed the Motions, leaving no evidence before the Court to suggest that
Plaintiff is not entitled to the production of the requested documents.  Thus, Plaintiff’s Motions are GRANTED. 
 
Request for
Sanctions 
Except in certain circumstances involving
electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with
a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2031.320, subd. (b).) 
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).) 
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at p.
409.)
 
            Plaintiff requests sanctions for the
Motions in the total amount of $4,860, or $2,430 per Motion, based upon
counsel’s rate of $540/hour for: (1) 5.0 hours preparing and drafting the
Motions and (2) 4.0 hours to review and opposition, draft replies, and prepare
for and attend the hearing. 
 
            Because no opposition or reply has
been filed and the Motions are largely duplicative of each other, a 4.0 hour
reduction is appropriate. Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $2,700, allocated as $1,350 per Motion.  
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production (Set No. 1) from Defendant Kevin Davidson
is GRANTED. Davidson is ordered to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or things requested within 20 days of this Order. Davidson is
also ordered to pay $1,350 in sanctions to Plaintiff within 20 days of this
Order. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to
Requests for Production (Set No. 1) from Defendant Allen Wagner is GRANTED. Wagner
is ordered to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or
things requested within 20 days of this ruling. Wagner is also ordered to pay
$1,350 in sanctions to Plaintiff within 20 days of this Order.
 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
