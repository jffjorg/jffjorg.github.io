And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendants is moot due to the filing of the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff had the right to file a first amended complaint without leave of the court, and the filing of the amended complaint supersedes the original complaint. Therefore, the demurrer directed to the original complaint is no longer valid. The Judge orders that the demurrer be overruled and taken off calendar. The parties are directed to submit any further statements on the tentative ruling to the court via email.
