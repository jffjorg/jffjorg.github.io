  Case Number:  21STCV23690    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Marina Perez’s  Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and
Enter Judgment
Plaintiff
Marina Perez moves to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement and to enter
judgment against defendant Nates Market, Inc. pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6.  
Entry
of Judgment    
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6(a) provides, “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the
court... for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion,
may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  
            Plaintiff establishes that the
parties agreed in writing to settle the case. 
(Danelon Decl., ¶ 4 & Notice of Lodging.)  The agreement provides that plaintiff would
release all claims, defendant would release all cross-claims, and defendant
would pay plaintiff $30,000.  (Id.,
¶¶ 1-4.)  The court therefore has the
power to enter judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  
Plaintiff
also presents evidence that defendant did not pay the $30,000 as agreed.  (Danelon Decl., ¶ 20.)  Defendant sent two checks that “did not clear
for insufficient funds.”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff’s counsel further states, “[N]o
payments have been received.”  (Id.,
¶ 22.)  
Prejudgment
Interest
            Plaintiff seeks $3,838.74 in prejudgment
interest.  “A person who is entitled to
recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and
the right to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is
entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day.”  (Civ. Code, § 3287(a).)  Under the settlement, defendant was required
to pay plaintiff $30,000 “[w]ithin Fifteen (15) calendar days after
[defendant’s] receipt of a signed copy of this Agreement from Perez and the tax
documents specified below.”  (Settlement,
¶ 1.)  Plaintiff therefore was entitled
to recover certain damages: $30,000.  
            Plaintiff’s calculation of interest,
however, begins too early.  She seeks
interest beginning February 28, 2023, because she executed the settlement
agreement 15 days earlier on February 13, 2023. 
But defendant did not execute it until March 14, 2023.  (Settlement, p. 6.)  Defendant could not have been obligated to
pay the settlement amount before it agreed to the settlement in the first
place.  Interest therefore began to
accrue on March 14, 2023.  Plaintiff is
entitled to recover prejudgment interest at a rate of 10 percent on the
principal of $30,000 ($8.22 per day) for 454 days from March 14, 2023, to the
date of judgment, June 10, 2024, for a total of $3,731.88.
Attorney
Fees
            Finally, plaintiff moves for
$5,061.50 in attorney fees and expenses incurred making this motion.  The settlement agreement provides, “The
prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to
attorney’s fees and costs.”  (¶ 16.)  Plaintiff is therefore entitled to expenses
including reasonable attorney fees.  
She
did not, however, reasonably incur $5,000 in attorney fees.  Plaintiff’s counsel states he spent 10 hours drafting
the motion, plus anticipated another 2 hours reviewing the opposition and
attending the hearing, at $500 hourly.  (Danelon
Decl., ¶ 25.)  This simple motion did not
reasonably require 10 hours of work. 
Defendant did not file an opposition. 
The court finds plaintiff reasonably incurred 6 hours of attorney fees
at $500 hourly ($3,000), plus other expenses of $61.50.  
Disposition
            Plaintiff Marina Perez’s motion to
enforce settlement and enter judgment is granted.  The court will modify plaintiff’s proposed
judgment by striking unnecessary provisions and enter judgment against
defendant Nates Market, Inc. in the amount of $36,793.53.
