  - "a defendant who is voluntarily dismissed, with or without prejudice, after filing a section 425.16 motion to strike, is nevertheless entitled to have the merits of such motion heard as a predicate to a determination of the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs under subdivision (c) of that section."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the defendant's special motion to strike and dismiss the action with prejudice. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice on May 15, 2024, and therefore the court cannot rule on the special motion to strike. The court cannot dismiss the action with prejudice, as this would be a direct ruling on the merits of the proceeding. The court's jurisdiction is limited to considering the merits of the motion in order to determine whether the defendant is entitled to attorney fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c).
