Significant Statements:
* The court generally adheres to certain, consistent guidelines for its cases: an approach allowing discovery into the relevant make and model year for all impacted systems or parts, without opening the door for a general inquiry into any and all lemon law claims filed against vehicle manufacturers for all makes and models, including varying individual and potential system defects.
* The court finds the general request for “warranty repairs” overbroad in that a warranty repair can cover any number of items well beyond the scope of the subject matter.
* The court declines to allow open ended broad based discovery phrased like the subject items.
* The court orders FCA US LLC to provide responsive information in regards to the subject defect(s) for the make, model and year.
