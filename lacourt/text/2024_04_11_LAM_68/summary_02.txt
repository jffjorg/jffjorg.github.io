Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to compel arbitration filed by Sunlight Financial LLC and Cross River Bank. The court finds that the loan agreement is not enforceable due to the lack of a valid electronic signature. The court also declines to enforce the arbitration agreement due to the failure to establish a valid and enforceable agreement. The court further declines to compel arbitration due to the possibility of piecemeal adjudication and the intertwined nature of the claims. The court orders the moving defendants to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
