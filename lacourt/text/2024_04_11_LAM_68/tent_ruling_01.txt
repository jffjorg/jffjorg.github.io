Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Reina Garcia alleges a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicle suffers from unspecified
defects. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Violation of
Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express Warranty of Merchantability, and Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act—Civil Code section 1793.2. On June 21, 2023, FCA US LLC
answered the complaint.
 
RULING: Granted
Plaintiff Reina Garcia moves to compel further responses to
request for production of documents, numbers 45-46. Plaintiff alleges
unmeritorious objections. Plaintiff submitted a notice of non-opposition and
the court electronic filing system shows no filed opposition at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
Number 45 states: All DOCUMENTS evidencing
complaints by owners of the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicle regarding any of
the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented to YOUR or YOUR
authorized repair facilities for repair during the warranty period.
 
Number 46 states: All DOCUMENTS evidencing
warranty repairs to 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles regarding any of the
components that YOU or YOUR authorized repair facilities performed repairs on
under warranty.
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, “[a] plaintiff pursuing
an action under the Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a
nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the
use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the
vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the manufacturer of
the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or
his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number
of repair attempts (the failure to repair element). (Civ.Code, § 1793.2; Ibrahim v. Ford Motor Co.
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886–887, 263 Cal.Rptr. 64.)” (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)
 
Due to the increasing volume of filed Lemon Law cases
in this courtroom and presumably countywide, and the pending decisions from the
California Supreme Court potentially impacting whether cases proceed to
arbitration or remain in trial courts, with de rigueur motions to compel
further document production, this court generally adheres to certain,
consistent guidelines for its cases: an approach allowing discovery into the
relevant make and model year for all impacted systems or parts, without opening
the door for a general inquiry into any and all lemon law claims filed against
vehicle manufacturers for all makes and models, including varying individual
and potential system defects. The goal is to facilitate robust adjudication of
the case, without imposing any burden on defendant to determine the cause of
the purported defects, while also allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to
investigate. The court in no way doctrinally adheres to this policy. The court
established this policy based on established practice standards common among
counsel in this field based on standards established and reviewed by practice
and reviewed at least in party by appellate courts. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153-154; Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc., supra,
90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1104-1105.) No doubt other courts may take different
approaches. The court in no way seeks to invite comparisons with other
courtrooms. The court only notes its reasoning behind its policy.
 
On
the specific requests, the court notes the request already limits the request
to the make and model, but the request lacks any indicated area of failure or
attempted repair(s). The complaint itself lacks any information, though the
court assumes the parties are familiar with the factual basis of the dispute.
Assuming familiarity between the parties, the court still finds the general
request for “warranty repairs” overbroad in that a warranty repair can cover
any number of items well beyond the scope of the subject matter. As stated in
the guidelines above, the court declines to allow open ended broad based
discovery phrased like the subject items. 
 
While
it remains unclear whether and what information has been provided relative to
the same alleged defects within the same year, make and model, the court orders
FCA US LLC to provide responsive information in regards to the subject
defect(s) for the make, model and year. If said documents were already
produced, FCA US LLC may represent as such.
 
The
unopposed motion is therefore GRANTED limited to the identified conditions
within the make, model and year.
 
The
minimum amount of sanctions for each motion to compel production of documents
increased to $1,000 per motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (a)(1).)
Sanctions in the amount of $1,000 joint and severally imposed against both
counsel and FCA US and payable within 30 days of this order. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2023.050, subd. (a)(1), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.

Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express Warranty of Merchantability, and Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act—Civil Code section 1793.2. On June 21, 2023, FCA US LLC
answered the complaint. RULING: Granted.Plaintiff Reina Garcia moves to compel further responses to special
interrogatories, numbers 45-48. Plaintiff alleges unmeritorious objections. Defendant
in opposition challenges the sufficiency of the meet and confer effort, the
overbroad nature of the requests without sufficient tailoring the alleged
defects at issue, and challenges any recovery of sanctions. Plaintiff in reply reiterates
the basis for production. Number 45 states: At the time of release
for the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles, state your anticipated range for
repairs per thousand vehicles sold (R/1000). Number 46 states: State the repairs per
thousand vehicles sold (R/1000) for 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles. Number 47 states: Identify in order the five symptoms
with the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee
vehicles, and the corresponding repairs per thousand. Number 48 states: Identify in order the five
components with the highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2018 Jeep Grand
Cherokee vehicles, and the corresponding repairs per thousand. Under the Song-Beverly Act, “[a] plaintiff pursuing
an action under the Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a
nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the
use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the

the specific requests, the court notes the request already limits the request

assumes the parties are familiar with the factual basis of the dispute.
Assuming familiarity between the parties, the court still finds the general
request for “anticipated range of repairs,” “repairs,” “five symptoms,” or
“components” “with the highest repairs” and “warranty repairs” overbroad in
that a warranty repair can cover any number of items well beyond the scope of
the subject matter. As stated in the guidelines above, the court declines to
allow open ended broad based discovery phrased like the subject items.  While
it remains unclear whether and what information has been provided relative to
the same alleged defects within the same year, make and model, the court orders
FCA US LLC to provide responsive information in regards to the subject
defect(s) for the make, model and year. If said applicable responses were
already produced in prior responses, FCA US LLC may represent as such. The
motion is therefore GRANTED. Sanctions not requested by FCA US LLC, and
denied as to Plaintiff. The court finds the scope of the requests overbroad and
the objections valid. The court declines to impose sanctions based on the
subject dispute.  Plaintiff
to give notice.
