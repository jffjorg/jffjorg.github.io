And here is the text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to compel the deposition of Mark Berendt, a prisoner currently incarcerated in Mule Creek State Prison. The court finds that the deposition is justified, as the witness is available to testify and the deposition is necessary for the plaintiff's case. The court also invites the parties to consider a single joint deposition with all plaintiffs and LAUSD appearing, rather than potential piecemeal motions. The court sets an OSC re: Status of the Deposition for April 29, 2024, and invites the parties to provide updates on potential dates and methods for conducting the deposition. The court also notes that the parties may discuss options including audiovisual interface or even conducting the deposition through writing.
