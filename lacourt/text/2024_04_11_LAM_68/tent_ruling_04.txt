RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff,
Jane RS Doe moves to compel the deposition of Mark Berendt, a person currently
incarcerated in Mule Creek State Prison, Ione, CA for 23 counts of lewd acts on
a minor and sentenced to 25 years. Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition
and the court electronic filing system shows no responsive document from Mark
Berendt as of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A
court order is required to compel the deposition. 
 
“If the witness be a prisoner, confined in a jail within
this state, an order for his examination in the jail upon deposition, or for
his temporary removal and production before a court or officer may be made as
follows:
1. By the court itself in which the action or special
proceeding is pending, unless it be a small claims court.
2. By a justice of the Supreme Court, or a judge of the
superior court of the county where the action or proceeding is pending, if
pending before a small claims court, or before a judge or other person out of
court.
 
“Such
order can only be made on the motion of a party, upon affidavit showing the
nature of the action or proceeding, the testimony expected from the witness,
and its materiality.”


(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1996.)
 
“If the
witness be imprisoned in a jail in the county where the action or proceeding is
pending, his production may be required. In all other cases his examination,
when allowed, must be taken upon deposition.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1997.)
 
To
the extent Jane RS Doe action seeks the deposition of Barendt, and Barendt
faces a potential threat to personal interests in the form of a civil judgment,
the court must consider the due process rights of Barendt. The court finds
justification in allowing the deposition to proceed. Barendt may rely upon this
deposition in defense of the action, if requested. (Wantuch
v. Davis (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 786, 792–795;
See Yarbrough v. Superior Court (1985) 39 Cal.3d 197, 207.) 
 
The court therefore grants the order allowing the deposition to
proceed. The
court and the parties must still craft a solution for obtaining the deposition
in cooperation with the Department of Corrections. (Payne
v. Superior Court (1976) 17 Cal.3d 908, 924–925.) An OSC re:
Related Cases remains set for April 29, 2024. Because the majority, if not all
cases subject to the related case hearing arise from the conduct of Mark
Berendt, the court invites the parties to consider a single joint deposition
with all plaintiffs and LAUSD appearing, rather than potential piecemeal
motions. 
 
The
court invites consideration of this option, and consultation with the
Department of Corrections for a determination of the protocols and means for
conducting prisoner depositions. The parties may discuss options including
audiovisual interface, or even through writing. The court sets an OSC re: Status
of the Deposition with an invitation for supplemental briefing providing
updates on potential dates and methods for April 29, 2024.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
