Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to transfer and consolidate the cases. The plaintiff, William Manuel, sought to transfer the case to the Los Angeles County Superior Court and consolidate the actions. The defendant, Cesar Segovia, opposed the motion, arguing that the motion fails to comply with procedural requirements and constitutes an improper collateral challenge to the unlawful detainer action. The judge found that the motion lacked sufficient legal support for transferring an action involving real property in another county and declined to consider the unlawful detainer action.
