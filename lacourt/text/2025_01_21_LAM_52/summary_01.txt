And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion for a protective order preventing the deposition of William Walrath is granted. The judge finds that deposing Walrath would result in unwarranted annoyance and undue burden, and that the burden on Walrath substantially outweighs the value of the testimony he could give. The judge also finds that Walrath has no knowledge of anything particular to this case and that the defendants have presented more convenient and less burdensome means of discovering information about Farmers in general, such as deposing current employees. The judge orders the plaintiff to pay the defendants $3,000 in sanctions within 20 days and orders the plaintiff and her counsel to be jointly and severally liable for the sanctions.
