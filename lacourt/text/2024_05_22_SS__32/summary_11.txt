The court grants the defendant's motion to compel plaintiff to serve verified responses to requests for production of documents, set two. The responses were due March 18, 2024, but none have been served. The court also awards the defendant $500 in monetary sanctions against plaintiff's counsel for failure to counsel that conduct. The court finds that the defendant's counsel failed to demonstrate that they did not counsel the conduct resulting in sanctions. The court orders the plaintiff to serve the verified responses within 10 days and the counsel for the defendant to receive the monetary sanctions within 30 days.
