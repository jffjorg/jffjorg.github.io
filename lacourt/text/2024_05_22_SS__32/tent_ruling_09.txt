MOTION
 
            On June 29, 2022, Plaintiff Guzyaliya
Mannanova (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Trader Joe’s
Company Inc., dba Trader Joe’s, and Trader Joe’s East Inc., dba Trader Joe’s,
alleging a cause of action for negligence, arising out of a slip and fall on
fruit at a Trader Joe’s location. 
 
             Defendant Trader Joe’s Company (“Defendant”)
now moves to compel the second physical examination of Plaintiff. Defendant
also separately moves to continue trial. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant
replies to each motion. 
 
            The motion to continue trial was
originally scheduled on May 8, 2024. However, upon reviewing the motion, the
Court determined it was not ripe since the basis for continuing relied on the
motion to compel the second physical examination. (Min. Order, 5/8/24.) As a
result, the Court continued the motion to continue to May 22, 2024 so that the
motion to compel could be heard first. 
 
            Further supplemental briefing was
permitted to be filed at least five court days from the hearing.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
            The complaint was filed on June 29,
2022. Trial was originally set for December 27, 2023. (Notice of Case
Assignment, 6/29/22.) 
 
            Defendant’s answer was filed on
August 15, 2022. 
 
            On August 10, 2023, the Court
granted in part Defendant’s motion to continue trial to April 3, 2024.
Expert-related deadlines were continued with the new trial date. The minute
order was silent as to the fact discovery cut-off. (Min. Order, 8/10/23.) 
 
            On December 6, 2023, pursuant to
stipulation, the Court continued trial to June 5, 2024. The discovery and
motion cut-off dates were not based on the new trial date. 
 
            Based on the information above, the
fact-discovery cutoff attached to the December 27, 2023 trial date, and the
expert discovery cut-off attached to the April 3, 2024 trial date. Therefore, all
discovery is currently closed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Motion
to Compel Second Physical Examination
 
“In any case in
which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any defendant may
demand one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The examination does not include any diagnostic
test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive. (2) The
examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the
examinee.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
 
“If any
party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that
described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental
examination, the party shall obtain leave of court.  A motion for an examination under subdivision
(a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Civ. Proc., §
2032.310, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
“The court
shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section
2032.310 only for good cause shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd.
(a); see also Sporich v. Superior Court (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 422, 427
[“the good cause which must be shown should be such that will satisfy an
impartial tribunal that the request may be granted without abuse of the
inherent rights of the adversary”].) A showing of good cause generally requires
“that the party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the
inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v.
Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.)  And “[a] party who chooses
to allege that he has mental and emotional difficulties can hardly deny his
mental state is in controversy.”  (Id. at p.
839.)   
 
The examination
will be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc. §2032.020(a).)¿ This means the examination must be directly related
to the specific injury or condition that is the subject of the litigation.¿ (Roberts
v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 337.)¿ Often, a party's pleadings
put his or her mental or physical condition in controversy ... as when a
plaintiff claims continuing mental or physical injury resulting from
defendant's acts: “A party who chooses to allege that he has mental and
emotional difficulties can hardly deny his mental state is in controversy.”¿
(See Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 837, wherein the
plaintiff claimed ongoing emotional distress from sexual harassment by former
employer.)¿ Discovery responses can also frame the issues regarding the
injuries and damages alleged.¿¿ 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Kristin Mathis states that she advised Plaintiff’s
counsel that Defendant was entitled to a second physical examination of
Plaintiff. (Mathis Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff did not agree to the second
examination, thereby, necessitating this motion. Therefore, even though it does
not appear Defendant made a robust effort to meet and confer, it appears a good
faith attempt was made to resolve the issue. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant seeks to compel the second
physical examination of Plaintiff with Dr. David C. Hay, M.D., a hand/wrist
specialist on May 30, 2024, at his medical office. Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s new medical records reveal she will need left wrist and hand
surgery. The first physical examination was conducted on October 11, 2023 by
Dr. Ronald S. Kvitne, an orthopedic doctor, and was limited to her spinal,
shoulder, and hip injuries. 
 
However,
the discovery motion cut-off in this case is closed. Any party shall be
entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before
the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard before
the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the
action. (Code Civ. Proc.§ 2024.020 (a).) Additionally, any party shall be
entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings pertaining to expert
witnesses on or before the 15th day, and to have motions concerning that
discovery heard on or before the 10th day, before the date initially set for
the trial of the action. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.030.)¿A trial court abuses its
discretion in hearing a discovery motion past the deadlines in Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.020 when it does not require the party to file a motion
for leave to reopen discovery under section 2024.050. (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc.¿(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1588.)¿¿
 
As
noted above, the fact discovery cut-off attached to the December
27, 2023 trial date and the expert discovery cut-off attached to the April 3,
2024 trial date. Since this motion is being heard on May 22, 2024, it is untimely. No
motion to reopen discovery has been granted. The motion to compel the second
examination does not cite section 2024.050, or separately move to reopen
discovery in order to hear the instant motion and provide for the second
examination. 
 
Additionally,
the motion to continue trial also does not move to reopen discovery under
section 2024.050. Therefore, both motions are denied. 
 
The
Court notes that Defendant has filed a motion to reopen discovery that is set
to be heard on June 4, 2024, the day before the trial. On May 15, 2024, the
Court denied Defendant’s ex parte application to shorten time/specially set the
motion to reopen discovery. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Second Physical Examination of Plaintiff is DENIED.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial Date, Final Status Conference and
Expert Discovery Cut-off Dates is DENIED. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof
of service of such.
