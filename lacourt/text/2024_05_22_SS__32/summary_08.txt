And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motion filed by Plaintiff Trenna Jones's counsel, Devin A. Cutting/Bish & Cutting, APC, to be relieved as counsel. The court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a valid reason for withdrawal. Although the court previously denied the motion due to the proximity to the trial date, the trial has since been continued, and the court no longer finds that Plaintiff would be prejudiced. The court grants the motion and orders counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of such.
