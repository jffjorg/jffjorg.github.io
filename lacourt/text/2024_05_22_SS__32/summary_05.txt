And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint and request to continue trial. Uber is ordered to file and serve its proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of this order. The request for a trial continuance is denied. The court finds that Uber fails to show that it requires additional time to conduct discovery, as it has already conducted some discovery with the Lombard defendants. The court also notes that there is still roughly two months to conduct discovery.
