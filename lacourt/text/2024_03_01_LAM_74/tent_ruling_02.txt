 Case Number:  BC597857    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  74 SoCal Diesel, Inc. v. Extrasensory
Software, Inc., et al.
 
Plaintiff SoCal Diesel Inc.’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One)
from Defendant Extrasensory Software, Inc. and Request for Sanctions
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a dispute
over alleged misappropriation of trade secrets.
            In October 2015, Plaintiff SoCal
Diesel, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Robyn Emus, Ira Emus, and
ExtraSensory Software, Inc. (Defendant).
            On May 19, 2023, Plaintiff
propounded requests for production of documents on Defendant. 
            On July 7, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with its responses. Plaintiff was dissatisfied.
            On July 28, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with supplemental responses. Plaintiff was still dissatisfied.
            The parties met and conferred to no
avail.
            On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this motion to compel further response to RFP Nos. 6-16, 61, 62, 65, 123,
and 124.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to a
demand for inspection if the propounding party deems that an answer or
statement of compliance is evasive or incomplete, or that an objection is
“without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause for the discovery sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further response to
RFP Nos. 6-16, 61, 62, 65, 123, and 124. As a preliminary matter, the court
finds that the parties have sufficiently met and conferred. Moreover, Plaintiff
has demonstrated good cause for the requested discovery, as much of the
information is relevant to Defendant’s costs, which are needed to calculate
damages and Defendant’s alleged unjust enrichment. Accordingly, the court will
address the disputed RFPs in turn:
RFP Nos. 6-11
            These requests seek documents that
identify costs Defendant incurred when it developed, manufactured, assembled,
and marketed the FT switch from 2018 to 2023. After Plaintiff filed this
motion, Defendant produced responsive documents. If those documents are
insufficient, Defendant has invited Plaintiff to review its QuickBooks files at
Defendant’s counsel’s office. Further response is not necessary.
RFP Nos. 12-16
            These requests concern documents
Defendant gave to all persons for the preparation of, or advice regarding,
Defendant’s California State and United States Federal tax returns for the
following years: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. During the meet-and-confer
process, the parties agreed to limit the scope of these requests to documents
that demonstrate Defendant’s gross revenues and costs derived from sales of the
switches. Moreover, Defendant agreed to produce those documents in its
supplemental responses. After agreeing to produce those documents, Defendant
belatedly invoked the tax-return privilege. Generally speaking, a party cannot
raise in a supplement response a new objection not asserted in the original response.
(See Stadish v Superior Court (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1130,
1140.) But a waiver of the tax-return privilege must be voluntary – which necessarily
means a knowing waiver – not one of inadvertence or oversight. (Fortunato v.
Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 475, 481-482.) And although Plaintiff
does not seek the tax returns themselves, the requests indirectly seek
information concerning entries in Defendant’s tax returns. (See Sav-On
Drugs, Inc. v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 1, 7.) Accordingly, further
response is not necessary.
RFP Nos. 61, 62, and 65
            RFP No. 61 seeks all documents
between Defendant and resellers related to FT switches from January 1, 2018,
until present. RFP No. 62 requests all documents between Defendant and
resellers related to SoCal switches from September 2013 until December 31,
2017. And RFP No. 65 seeks documents between Defendant and resellers related to
EFILive products from January 2018 until the present. Defendant claims it has
produced all the responsive documents in its possession. (Opposition, p. 6-7.)
Further response is not necessary.
RFP Nos. 123 and 124
            RFP No. 123 seeks documents related
to Defendant’s agreements, licenses, leases, contracts, or permits for “Condo
No. 5.” And RFP No. 124 seeks documents related to Defendant’s agreements,
licenses, leases, contracts, or permits for “Condo No. 6.” In its revised supplemental
responses, Defendant stated it would comply with these requests but then
claimed it does not possess responsive documents. To the extent such documents
exist, further response is necessary.
Sanctions
            Because
Defendant opposed Plaintiff’s motion with substantial justification, the court denies
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.
CONCLUSION
                The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses in part. Defendant shall provide further,
Code-compliant responses to RFP Nos. 123 and 124 by March 11.
                Plaintiff shall give notice.
