And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Titan Offices, Inc. on November 15, 2023. The defendant argues that the service of the summons and complaint was defective and that the plaintiff did not make a good faith effort to personally serve the defendant. However, the court finds that substitute service on a corporation does not require a good faith effort at personal service, as long as the service is made in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure. In this case, the plaintiff left the summons and complaint with the defendant's receptionist, who was apparently in charge of the premises. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to quash and orders the plaintiff to give notice.
