PARTY:     Plaintiff Ralph Fahnestock
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff Ralph Fahnestock
(“Fahnestock” or “Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Leonard Fenton
(“Fenton” and “Defendant”) for (1) Harassment [Gov. Code § 12940(j)], (2)
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy, (3) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress, (4) Misclassification as Independent Contractor, (5)
Failure to Compensate for All Hours Worked, (6) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages,
(7) Unpaid Minimum Wages, and (8) Failure to Provide Breaks.  This action arises from Plaintiff’s employment
by Defendant as Defendant’s in-home personal caregiver.  
 
On March 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Personal
Service showing that Defendant was personally served with the Summons and Complaint
by registered process server on February 7, 2023.
 
On March 16, 2023, the clerk entered default against
Defendant.  
 
On July 26, 2023, Defendant, as a self-represented litigant,
attempted to file a motion to vacate judgment and dismiss suit.  However, the filing was rejected because
Defendant did not include his address.
 
On October 11, 2023, after retaining counsel, Defendant
filed a motion to set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b).  The hearing for the motion was scheduled for February
6, 2024.
 
On January 30, 2024, Defendant filed an Ex Parte
Application: (1) To Continue Hearing on Motion to Set Aside Default; and (2) To
Set Hearing On Motion to Quash.  
 
On February 1, 2024, the court granted the Ex Parte.  The hearing for the Motion to Set Aside was
continued to March 26, 2024, and the Motion to Quash was specially set for the
same day.  On March 26, 2024, the court
continued Defendant’s motions to May 1, 2024 due to the court’s  unavailability.
 
On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed the Motion to Quash
Service of Summons.
 
            Plaintiff
filed an opposition to the Motion to Quash. 
Defendant replied.
 
            Because the
court finds that the Motion to Quash is meritorious, the court does not reach
the merits of Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
FOR QUASHING SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
            Personal
service may be accomplished by personally delivering a copy of the summons and
complaint to the person to be served.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) 
If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be
personally delivered to the person being served, substitute service may be
effected by leave a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s “dwelling
house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address
... in the presence of ... a person apparently in charge ... and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class mail ... to the
person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) 
 
A defendant must file a motion to quash service of summons
on or before the last day on which the defendant must plead unless the time is
extended by stipulation or by a judge’s order for good case.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  Although the notice of motion must
designate a hearing date not more than 30 days after the notice is filed,
scheduling a hearing date beyond the 30-day time period does not deprive the
court of jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion.  (Olinick
v. BMB Entertainment (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1295-96.) 
 
Filing a proof of service by a registered process server
creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code,
§ 647 [“The return of a process server registered pursuant to ... the Business
and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a presumption,
affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the
return”].)  However, the presumption only arises if the proof of service
complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.  (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-42.) 
Proof of service of summons may be impeached by evidence that contradicts it.  (City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951)
105 Cal.App.2d 726, 731.)  
 
When a defendant moves to quash service of summons, the
plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court
jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.”¿  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
Proof of Personal Service indicates Defendant was personally served with those
documents on February 7, 2023 at 8244 4th Street, Los Angeles, California 90048.  (See Proof of Personal Service, 3/6/23.)  However, Defendant argues he was not properly
served with the Summons and Complaint.  Defendant
explains that he never received the documents because he was residing in New
York at the time and pursuing graduate studies at the Julliard School.  In support, Defendant submits email
correspondence which show his attempts to schedule meetings with his
instructors in the week of February 7, 2023. 
(Fenton Decl., ¶ 6, Exs. A, B, and C.) 
Fenton also submits receipts of grocery deliveries to an undisclosed
address in New York.  (Fenton Decl., Ex.
D.)  Further, Fenton states he had a
medical procedure on February 5, 2023 at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York which
prevented him from traveling for a few days after the procedure.  (Id. at ¶ 10.)  For these reasons, Defendant seeks an order
quashing the service of summons.
 
            Plaintiff attempts
to refute Defendant’s evidence regarding his New York residency.[1]
 For example, Plaintiff points out that Fenton’s
New York address nor or any proof of residency is provided in Fenton’s motion.  Plaintiff also questions whether Fenton is a
full-time, in-person student because none of Fenton’s email correspondence
included Fenton’s email address as a student at Julliard. 
 
            Additionally,
Plaintiff attempted to have Fenton served again at 8244 W. 4th St, Los Angeles
CA 90048 on February 12, 2024.  Plaintiff’s
registered process server was unable to serve Fenton but noted that Fenton
still received mail at that address.  (Seemen
Decl., Ex. F.) 
 
 In reply, Fenton
provides the lease agreement for his New York residence.  (Reply, Fenton Decl., Ex. A.) The lease period
stated in the agreement was September 22, 2022 to September 30, 2023.  (Id. at ¶ 5, Ex. A.)  Fenton still resides at that apartment.  (Id.)  Fenton also includes several more emails
which bear his email address at Julliard. 
(Id. at ¶¶ 6, 7, Ex. B.)  As
to Plaintiff’s assertion that 8244 W. 4th St. is Fenton’s residence, Fenton
further explains that he co-owns the 8244 W. 4th St. with his brother and
previously lived in the downstairs unit. 
Most of his mail is forwarded to his New York address through USPS mail
forwarding request or via commercial mail forwarding service.  (Id. at ¶ 3.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court finds that Defendant
rebuts the presumption that he was personally served with the Summons and
Complaint.  Plaintiff does not provide
any evidence to the contrary.[2]
            
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Defendant Leonard Fenton’s Motion To Quash is GRANTED.  Having found that Plaintiff was not properly
served with the Summons and Complaint, the court further finds that the default
entered against Defendant is defective. 
Accordingly, the default entered against Defendant Leonard Fenton on March
16, 2023 is VACATED.   
 
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment
is MOOT.
 
The court sets an OSC re: Service of Summons for June 3,
2024 at 9:00 a.m.
 
Dated:   May 1, 2024
