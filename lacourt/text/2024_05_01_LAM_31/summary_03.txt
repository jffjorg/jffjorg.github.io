And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses Fenton's Motion to Quash the default. The plaintiff argues that the motion is moot because Fenton made a general appearance in the action by filing a Motion to Set Aside Default. However, the judge finds that Fenton complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 by filing the motions to set aside the default and quash separately, and therefore did not make a general appearance. The judge also notes that Fenton's challenge to the default has merit.
