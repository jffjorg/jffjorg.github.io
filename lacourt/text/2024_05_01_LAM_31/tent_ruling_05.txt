RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On January 18, 2024, Arbitrator Mark Burstein (“Arbitrator
Burstein”) issued an arbitration award in favor Petitioner Directors Guild of
America, Inc. (“Petitioner”) and against Respondents Bontempo Productions, LLC
(“Bontempo”), Cayman Filing Holdings Limited (“Cayman”), CAPCO Group, LLC
(“CAPCO”), and Capitol Films Limited (“Capitol”) (collectively, “Respondent”) in
the principal sum of $62,686.06 ($37,511.25 in residuals and $25,174.71 in late
charges). The arbitration arose out of Respondents’ failure to report activity
and pay residuals for the exploitation of the theatrical motion picture titled Love
Ranch in supplemental markets, on free television, and via new media in all
markets worldwide.  The arbitration award
also directs Respondents to pay accrued interest at the rate of $12.33 per day
until the residuals are paid in full and to pay half of the Arbitrator’s fees
and expenses of $650.
 
On February 8, 2024, Petitioner filed a Petition for Confirmation
of Arbitration Award and for Entry of Judgment in Conformity Therewith (the
“Petition”) against Respondents.
 
            On February
22, 2024, Petitioner filed a Notice of Hearing on its Petition.  Petitioner seek a total judgment of
$62,686.06, consisting of $37,511.25 in residuals and $25,174.71 in late charges).  Petitioner also seeks interest in the sum of $12.33
per day from January 18, 2024 until the residuals are paid in full.
 
            The Petition
is unopposed. 
             
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Once arbitration is concluded,
“any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the
superior court.”¿ (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107¿Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)¿ Any of the parties may file a petition with the
court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§¿1285, 1286; EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood,¿Inc. (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)¿“It is well settled that the scope of judicial review
of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California Faculty Assn. v.
Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)¿ “Neither the trial court,
nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency
of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an
award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on
the award’s face.”¿ (EHM Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Petitioners
seek an order confirming the arbitration award issued on January 18, 2024.
 
An arbitrator’s award is enforceable only after being
confirmed by a court of law. (O’Hare, 107 Cal.App.4th at p. 278.)¿ “An
award that has not been confirmed or vacated has the same force and effect as a
contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1287.6.)¿ Thus, the court must first evaluate and confirm the initial
arbitration award.¿        
            
A.   
Filing
Requirements (CCP § 1285.4)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition

existence of such an agreement. 
b.     
Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
c.      
Set forth or have attached a copy of
the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
Here, Petitioners submit the written Final Award issued by
Arbitrator Burstein.  (Pet., Ex. B.)  Petitioners also submit a copy of the
arbitration agreement between the parties. 
(Pet., Ex. A.)  Petitioners have

¿¿ 
B.    
Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party
to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided
in the agreement.”¿ In addition, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§
1288, 1288.4.)¿ 
¿ 
Here, Petitioners submit proof of service showing the Final
Award was served by Arbitrator Burstein by certified mail on January 18, 2024.  (Pet., Ex. B.)  This Petition followed on
February 8, 2024.  The Petition is timely. 
 
C.    
Service of
the Petition, and Notice of Hearing (CCP § 1290.4)¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, the statute
governing proper service of this motion states, in pertinent part:¿¿ 
¿ 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time
and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition
is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement
for the service of such petition and notice.¿ 
¿ 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be
made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been
served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State
shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action.¿ 
¿ 
Here, Petitioners served Respondents with a copy of this Petition
and notice of Petition on February 22, 2024 by first-class mail and certified
mail which is consistent with the manner service of summons in this State.  Petitioner demonstrates that the Petition was
properly served.¿

for Entry of Judgment is GRANTED.
