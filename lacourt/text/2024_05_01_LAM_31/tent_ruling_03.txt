[1] Plaintiff also argues that the
Motion to Quash is moot because Fenton has already made a general appearance in
this action by filing a Motion to Set Aside Default.  Not so.  Section 418.10 of the Code of Civil Procedure
states, in relevant part, “No default may be entered against the defendant
before expiration of his or her time to plead, and no motion under this
section, or under Section 473 or 473.5 when joined with a
motion under this section, … , shall be deemed a general
appearance by the defendant.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 418.10, subd. (d).)  Here,
Fenton filed his Motion to Set Aside Default prior to filing his Motion to
Quash.  Thereafter, Fenton joined his
motions so that they would be heard on the same day.  Subdivision (d) expressly  provides that motion to set aside a default
will not be considered a general appearance if it is joined with a motion to
quash.  Fenton complied with Code of
Civil Procedure section 418.10, subd. (d). 
Fenton has not made a general appearance in this matter.


[2] The court notes that Plaintiff
opposes the Motion to Quash by pointing to other unrelated cases in which
Fenton is the named defendant.  Plaintiff
argues that in the other matters Fenton did not claim to be a resident of New
York City. (Opp., pp. 6:6-7:4.)  Maybe
so, but Fenton makes that point here and submits supporting evidence.  As discussed above, Fenton’s challenge has
merit.
