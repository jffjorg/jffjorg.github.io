Arian, Dept 27¿ ¿ MOTIONS TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONSHearing Date: 6/6/24¿ CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV29720 TULLULA MAMIKUNIAN vs CHRISTOPHER ROBERT ALIGHIREMoving Party: Defendant Christopher AlighireResponding Party: Plaintiff Notice: Sufficient¿ Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED.  Legal Standard  A defendant may make a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time. Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer requirements.¿¿ ¿¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)   A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)DiscussionOn January 17, 2024, Defendant served his Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, Set Ones, on Plaintiff. On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff requested and was granted a 20-day extension to provide verified responses to the discovery, setting the new due date as March 18, 2024. As of March 21, 2024, Defendant had not received any discovery responses and now moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests at issue.It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not file timely responses. No opposition was filed or any other documents indicating that the discovery responses at issue were served prior to the hearing. Thus, the present motions are GRANTED, and Plaintiff is ordered to serve full and complete discovery responses without objections within 20 days of today.Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $570 for each motion to compel initial responses. Since Defendant’s motions to compel are granted, sanctions are mandatory, and the Court did not find Plaintiff to have acted with substantial justification. The Court finds the amount of sanctions requested to be reasonable. Consequently, the Court sanctions Plaintiff in the amount of $1710. Plaintiff and her counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $1710 to Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
