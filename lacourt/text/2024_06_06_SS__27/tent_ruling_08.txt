Hearing Date: 6/6/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV07720 HOPE GOLDEN vs
LYNWOOD J.H LLC 
Moving Party: Defendants
Responding Party: Unopposed 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER¿AND FOR SANCTIONS IS GRANTED 
 
Background
 
On September 14, 2023, Defendants propounded
their first set of special interrogatories on Plaintiff who is appearing in pro
per. On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff served her discovery responses, which were
untimely. Defendants attempted to meet and confer but received no responses. On
April 19, 2024, Defendants moved the Court to compel further responses. On May
31, 2024, Defendants attended an informal discovery conference (IDC) concerning
the discovery responses at issue; however, Plaintiff did not attend the IDC and
the Court allowed Defendants’ Motion to Compel Further to be heard.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff served her responses on March 4,
2024 through electronic service, and Defendants filed and served the present
motion on April 19, 2024, within the statutory deadline. Defendants attempted
to meet and confer with Plaintiff but received no responses, thereby fulfilling
its meet and confer obligations. Defendants attended an informal discovery
conference (IDC), but Plaintiff did not attend, and the Court allowed Defendants’
motion to be heard. All the preliminary requirements for the Court to hear the
present motion have been met.
 
Special Interrogatories 12, 24, 26, 27:
 
GRANT. Plaintiff’s responses are
unintelligible or non-responsive, e.g., “[Blank.]”. A party has a duty to
answer the interrogatories as completely and straightforwardly as possible
given the information available to it. (C.C.P. § 2030.220.) Plaintiff needs to
provide full and complete responses that are as straightforward as possible to
the questions asked, including all subparts. If a responding party does not
know the answer to a particular discovery response, the party must make a
reasonable inquiry and investigation to acquire the knowledge or information
from all sources under the responding party’s control. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at 782.) If the responding party lacks personal knowledge sufficient
to respond, he or she may so state, but only after making a reasonable and good
faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other persons or
organizations (Regency Health Services, Inc. v. Superior Court, (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1504.)
 
Special Interrogatories 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20,
21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35:
 
GRANT. Plaintiff did not timely respond to
Defendants’ discovery requests and therefore has waived all of her objections.
(CCP § 2030.290(a)). Plaintiff needs to provide full and complete responses to
the requests at issue without objections, including all subparts.
 
 
SANCTIONS
 
Defendants have requested sanctions of $3200
in relation to the present motion. Given that the Court is granting the present
motion, sanctions are mandatory. However, because no opposition was filed and
attending the hearing will most likely not take two hours, the Court exercises
its discretion and lowers the amount of sanctions to $2000. Thus, the Court
grants sanctions against Plaintiff in amount of $2000, to be paid within 30
days of today’s date.
