Legal Standard
 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time. Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (a).) A plaintiff may
make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without
leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or
appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs
first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020,
subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number,
but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action
and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to
the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd.
(a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)   A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)
 
Discussion
 
On December 21, 2023,
Defendant Silvia Garcia served her Form Interrogatories, Request for
Production, and Special Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff Abraham Galvez.
Plaintiff did not serve discovery responses by the statutory due date of
January 23, 2024. On April 8, 2024, Defense counsel served Plaintiff’s counsel
with a formal meet and confer letter advising that Plaintiff's responses were
overdue and requesting verified responses by April 22, 2024, to avoid the need
to bring this motion. No responses were served, nor was there any communication
indicating any intent to comply. Defendant now moves the Court to compel
initial responses to the discovery requests at issue.
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not file timely
responses. No opposition was filed or any other documents indicating that the
discovery responses at issue were served prior to the hearing. Thus, the
present motions are granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to serve full and
complete discovery responses without objections within 20 days of today. 
Defendant did not request sanctions.
