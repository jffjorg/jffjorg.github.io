The Court has ruled that summary adjudication is granted on the fifth affirmative defense as to the dog bite cause of action. This means that the Plaintiff's strict liability claim will proceed to trial. The Court has also denied the motion for summary adjudication on the issues of comparative negligence, mitigation, and trespass. The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to meet his burden to establish that no triable issue exists as to the Defendants' affirmative defenses of comparative negligence, mitigation, and trespass.
