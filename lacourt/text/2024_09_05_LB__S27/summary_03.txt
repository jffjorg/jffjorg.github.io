The judge is requiring the parties to meet and confer in good faith to resolve outstanding issues related to the demurrer and motion to strike. The judge has identified several specific issues that need to be addressed, including the lack of specificity in the fraud, concealment, and negligence causes of action, and whether certain allegations are properly pled. The judge has also identified a problem with the plaintiff's attorney failing to communicate and address issues in a timely manner, and has admonished the attorney to improve their performance. The hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike is continued for six weeks, and the parties are required to file any new papers in connection with the hearing.
