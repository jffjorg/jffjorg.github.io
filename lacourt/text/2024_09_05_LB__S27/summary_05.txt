And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to deem RFAs admitted and the motion to compel responses to RPDs. The motion to deem RFAs admitted was filed by the Plaintiff on May 21, 2024, and the Defendant filed opposition on June 27, 2024. The Judge continues the hearing on the motion to deem RFAs admitted to September 3, 2024, to be heard concurrently with the motion to compel responses to RPDs. The Judge notes that the Defendant has three attorneys listed on the opposition papers, and that the Clark Hill law firm has 700 attorneys. The Judge encourages the parties to attempt to resolve the issues without the need for a hearing.

The Judge denies both motions, finding that the Plaintiff did not properly serve the RFAs on the Defendant and that the Defendant established that the discovery was not properly served. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not file a reply to the opposition, and that if the requests were never served, then the motion should simply be denied. The ruling is without prejudice to the Plaintiff's right to re-serve the discovery at the proper email address if they choose to do so.
