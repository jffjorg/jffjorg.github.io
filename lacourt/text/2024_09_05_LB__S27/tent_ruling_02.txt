 Case Number:  22LBCV00731    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  S27 Per CCP §437c(b)(4), reply papers
were due “at least” five days prior to the hearing.  The Court understands that §12a extends the
time to complete acts until the following business day when the last day to
perform the act falls on a weekend or holiday. 
It does not appear §12a would apply where, as here, the statute
specifies “at least.”  Defendant filed
reply papers on Tuesday, 9/03/24 for a Thursday, 9/05/24 hearing.  As of noon on Tuesday, 9/03/24, Defendant’s
objection, separate statement, and notice of lodging have been entered into the
Court’s e-filing system.  Any reply
memorandum of points and authorities is not yet available for viewing.
 
The Court wishes to review all
documents filed in connection with the motion and to give the case the time and
consideration it deserves.  The hearing
on the motion is therefore continued from 9/05/24 to 9/12/24 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department S27.  In the interest of
judicial efficiency, the hearing on the motion to compel deposition is also
continued from 9/05/24 to 9/12/24.  
 
If 9/12/24 is not an available date
and time for the parties, they must meet and confer to agree on a mutually
available date and time for the continued hearing date and must contact the
judicial assistant to move the hearing.  
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
