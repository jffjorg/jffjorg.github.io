 Case Number:  24LBCV00697    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Bonifacio Gonzalez seeks
an order permitting Douglas R. Williams to appear pro hac vice in this
action.  CRC 9.40(d) provides:
(d) Contents of application
The application must state:
(1) 
The applicant's residence and office address;
(2) 
The courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice and the
dates of admission;
(3) 
That the applicant is a licensee in good standing in those courts;
(4) 
That the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court;
(5) 
The title of each court and cause in which the applicant has filed an
application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding
two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted; and
(6) 
The name, address, and telephone number of the active licensee of the
State Bar of California who is attorney of record.
 
Williams declares his office and
residential addresses are in Washington State. 
He lists the courts to which he has been admitted, but does not list his
dates of admission.  He states that he is
in good standing in each of those courts, and has not been suspended or
disbarred.  He fails to include
information about any prior cases in which he has sought to appear pro hac
vice.  He fails to state the contact
information from the active licensee who is attorney of record.
 
Because information required by the
Rules of Court is missing from the application, it is denied without
prejudice.    
 
The parties are reminded
there is a Case Management Conference on calendar concurrently with the hearing
on the above motion.  The Court asks the
parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the
motion.
