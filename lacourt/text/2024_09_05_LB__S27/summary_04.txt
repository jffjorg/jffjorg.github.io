As for the summary in English text, here it is:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23LBCV01725, regarding a discovery dispute between the Plaintiffs, Angelica Arreguin-Aguilar and Jose A. Arechiga-Perez, and the Defendant, Joan M. Attwell. The Plaintiffs filed an action against the Defendant for damages arising out of an automobile accident, and the Defendant filed motions to compel further responses to discovery requests.

The Court found that the Plaintiffs' responses to the discovery requests consisted solely of boilerplate objections, which are insufficient to justify their objections. The Court granted the Defendant's motions to compel further responses, and ordered the Plaintiffs to serve further responses to all subject discovery, without objections, within ten days.

The Court also found that the Defendant's attempts to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs were sufficient, and that the Defendant's motions were timely filed. The Court declined to impose sanctions on the Plaintiffs, as they took their position in good faith and with substantial justification.

The parties are required to notify the Court if they intend to submit on the tentative ruling, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
