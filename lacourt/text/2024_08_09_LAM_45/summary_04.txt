Here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer to the complaint. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, and the defendant filed an answer after the entry of default. The court finds that the defendant's answer was filed too late and is therefore improper. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain documents and orders the plaintiff to submit a default judgment packet for evaluation.
