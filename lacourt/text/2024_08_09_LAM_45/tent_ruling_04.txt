Background
Factual and Procedural Background
            On
August 29, 2023, Thuong Luong (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Veronika
Mikhaylova (Defendant) alleging a single cause of action for breach of written
contract. After the deadline for an answer had passed, Plaintiff filed a
Request for an Entry of Default, which was entered on April 15, 2024. On May
21, 2024, Defendant filed an Answer. 
            The
motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike Defendant’s Answer
(the Motion). No opposition was filed.   
Meet and Confer
            “Before filing a motion to
strike…the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§435.5.) Plaintiff presents no evidence that any meet and confer efforts took
place. However, per Code Civ. Proc. §435.5(a)(4), “A determination by the court
that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant
or deny the motion to strike.” Therefore, the Court will now turn its attention
to the Motion.   
 
Request for Judicial Notice 
            Accompanying
the Motion, Plaintiff files a Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) and asks the
following to be judicially noticed:
1.     
The Clerk’s Notice of Voiding of
Filing of Defendant Veronika Mikhaylova’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons
filed on November 1, 2023. 
2.     
The substitution of attorney by
Defendant’s attorney on March 21, 2024. 
3.     
Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of
Default/Judgment of Defendant filed on April 15, 2024. 
4.     
The Court’s Minute Order for the
hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons filed on April 16,
2024. 
5.     
Plaintiff’s Second Request for
Entry of Default/Judgment of Defendant filed on May 16, 2024.
6.     
The Declaration of Thuong Luong
Pursuant to C.C.P. § 585 in Support of Entry of Default/Judgment of Defendant
filed on May 16, 2024. 
7.     
Defendant’s Answer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint filed on May 21, 2024. 
 
            The RJN is denied as to items two
and six. Although permitted by Evid. Code § 452(d), “There is, however, a
precondition to the taking of judicial notice in either its mandatory or
permissive form—any matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a
material issue.”  (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. (2000)
24 Cal.4th 415, 422 fn. 2.) However, items one, three, four, five, and seven
are judicially noticed. 
 
Discussion
Legal Standard
            The
court may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (CCP § 436, subd. (a).) The court may also strike all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (CCP § 436.)
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by
way of judicial notice. (CCP § 437.)
 
Analysis
            Plaintiff
contends the Motion should be granted because Defendant’s Answer was filed
after the entry of default on April 15, 2024. The entry of the default cuts off
the
opportunity to plead, unless default is
vacated. (6 Witkin, Cal. Proc. 6th PWT § 215 (2024). Also see Sass v. Cohen
(2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 882.) As of this date, the Court does not
possess a motion to vacate a default entry in its record filed by Defendant.
Therefore, the filing of Defendant’s Answer is inappropriate, subject to a
motion to strike, and shall be struck. 
            The
Court notes Plaintiff additionally requests that a default judgment be entered.
A Motion to Strike is not the proper vehicle to request a default judgment. A
default judgment packet has been submitted, and the Court will evaluate the
submission to determine whether a default judgment is appropriate.
 
Conclusion
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike Defendant’s Answer is GRANTED.
 
            It
is so ordered.
