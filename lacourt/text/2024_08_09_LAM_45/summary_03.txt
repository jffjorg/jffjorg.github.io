The judge has considered the motions and papers submitted by the parties and has ruled on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Hassan Mohammadkhanighiy Asvand to the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the cross-complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for assault. The judge has considered the allegations of intent, threat, and harm, and has found that the cross-complaint has properly pled the elements of assault, including the defendant's intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, the plaintiff's reasonable belief that they were about to be touched, and the harm suffered by the plaintiff. The judge has also considered the lack of consent and the substantial factor of the defendant's conduct in causing the harm. The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Alen Manookian, and has denied the demurrer.
