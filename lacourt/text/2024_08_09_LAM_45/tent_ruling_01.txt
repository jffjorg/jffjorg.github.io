Background
            On January 6, 2023, Plaintiffs Cahuenga Professional
Building, LLC and Narek Kazarian (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Emil
Akopian; David Issaians; Emil Akopian and David Raphael Issaians dba Alliance
Partners; First Core Group Inc. dba Keller William Real Estate Services; 3623
Cahuenga LLC; Ming Sze Fong; Studio Caregivers, Inc.; Ming Sze Fong dba Studio
City Caregivers Cooperative, Inc. (“Defendants”); and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive.
            The motions now before the Court are (1) the Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents to Plaintiff
Narek Kazarian, Set 1 and (2) the Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Cahuenga Professional
Building, LLC Set 1 (the Motions). The Motions were filed by Defendant
Studio City Caregivers, Inc. (Studio City). Plaintiff Narek Kazarian (Kazarian)
opposes the Motion filed against them, and Plaintiff Cahuenga Professional
Building, LLC (Cahuenga) opposes the Motion file separately against them
(hereinafter, Kazarian and Cahuenga will be referred to as “Responding Parties”).
Studio City files a reply to both opposition. Because the parties’ contentions
surround the same issues in both Motions, both will be addressed here.
 
Discussion
Legal Standard
            The
propounding party may bring motions to compel further responses to
interrogatories or requests for production if it believes (1) the responses
received are evasive, or (2) incomplete, or (3) if the objections raised are
meritless or too general. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a).) A
respondent has the burden to justify objections in response to a motion filed
to compel further responses. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000)
22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)   
            The
court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(d).)
 
Analysis 
            The
Parties Arguments
            In
their moving papers, Studio City puts forth the Request for Production (RFPs)
at issue are RFPs Nos. 1-16. On February 23, 2024, Studio City served Responding Parties with RFPs, and on April 5, 2024, Responding Parties served
responses. (Declaration of Giandominic Vitiello, hereinafter Vitiello Decl.,
¶¶3-5.) In those responses Responding Parties provided no documents, but solely
objections. Studio City contends that these objections are unjustified,
generalized, and boilerplate. 
            Upon
opposition, Responding Parties contend the Motion is moot because Responding
Parties produced responsive documents on July 18, 2024. (Opposition Papers,
3:8-9.) Additionally, Responding Parties argue that although the objections
based on attorney-work product and attorney-client privilege were asserted in
each objection, the assertions are limited to communications between attorneys
and their clients and not information that is responsive. (Opposition Papers,
3:17-19.) Finally, Responding Parties claim the objections based on documents
being equally available and the requests being too broad are valid because
there are certain communications that were exchanged between defendants that Responding
Parties may not have and Responding Parties state that demands asking for “all”
documents is not a demand that can be complied with because “Plaintiff cannot
know all responsive documents until he is able to full conduct discovery in
this matter.” (Opposition Papers, 4:4-5.)      
            Upon
reply, Studio City argues the responses served on July 18, 2024 were unverified
and contained many of the same meritless objections. As explained further
below, the Court agrees, grants the instant Motion, and awards sanctions to
Studio City. 
            Responding Parties February 23,
2024 Responses
            As
an initial matter, “Unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Therefore, the July 18,
2024 responses are invalid and will not be addressed further. 
            The
primary inquiry therefore is whether the initial February 23, 2024 responses
were code compliant, valid responses. The Court answers this inquiry in the
negative. As argued by Studio City and as shown in Studio City’s Separate
Statement supporting this Motion, the response to each and all of the 16 RFPs
was the nearly identical, boilerplate objection. The objections are not
specific nor detailed, but simply designed to encompass any and all objections
that could be possible. 
            For
example, the objection based on an RFP being overbroad is made to each RFP, and
no explanation for why the RFP is overbroad is provided. Indeed, many of the
RFPs are specific for example, RFP No. 3 requests all documents regarding Responding Parties’ respective offers to purchase real
property located at 3623, 3625, 3629, 3631 Cahuenga Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
90068 (the Subject Property). Responding Parties fail to provide any
justification for an objection based on overbreadth for this RFP. The same
pattern persists through the majority of the RFPs, including RFP Nos. 1, 2, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, & 9.    
            A
second example is Responding Parties failing to
provide explanation for how the RFPs invade attorney-client privilege. For
example, RFP No. 4 requests documents between Responding
Parties and Minge Fong, Studio City, and Studio
City Caregivers Cooperative, Inc. However, attorney-client privilege is one of
the basis for objection to RFP No. 4. “The attorney-client privilege, set forth
at Evidence Code section 954, confers a privilege on the client ‘to refuse to
disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication
between client and lawyer....’” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court,
(2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 740.) However, RFP No. 4 is asking for
communications between Responding Parties and certain
defendants. Responding Parties provide no
explanation for how the attorney-client privilege applies here, and the Court
sees none.
            One
final example is Responding Parties’ arguments that
the documents requested are equally as available to Studio City as they are to Responding Parties. RFP Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
all ask for documents regarding communications between Kazarian and other
defendants that are not Studio City. Again, Responding Parties
provide no explanation for how this objection is relevant. 
Sanctions
            Defense
counsel provides the following calculations inclusive of both Motions:
·        
Counsel’s hourly rate is $550.00
·        
Counsel’s office support staff rate
is $185.00
·        
Counsel states that their office
expended 19.83 hours of attorney time and 2.0 hours of support staff time
·        
Counsel incurred a $60.00 filing
fee for each Motion
·        
Counsel incurred a cost of $30.96
in mailing meet and confer correspondence
·        
Counsel totaled the incurred fees
and costs at $11,248.54[1].
Counsel additionally requests $2751.46 across both Motions for reviewing
opposition papers, submitting reply papers, and attending the hearing. However,
it is unclear how Counsel calculated the additional $2,751.46. 
·        
This amounts to a total of $14,000
in sanctions for both Motions, which equates to $7,000 for each Motion.
 
            Noting
arithmetical error in the above calculations, the Court will calculate the
sanctions as follows:
·        
$550.00 attorney billing rate x
19.83 hours = $10,906.5
·        
$185 support staff billing rate x
2.0 hours = $370.00
·        
$60.00 filing fee x 2 Motions =
$120.00
·        
Add $30.96 in mailing costs for
meet and confer correspondence = $30.96
·        
1 hour reviewing opposition papers,
plus 1 hour drafting reply papers, plus 1 hour for attending the hearing, all
at Counsel’s $550.00 billing rate = $1,650
·        
Therefore, the total amount of
sanctions across both Motions amounts to $13,077.46. Therefore, the amount of
monetary sanctions imposed on Plaintiff Narek Kazarian and Plaintiff Cahuenga
Professional Building, LLC each is $6,538.73.  
Conclusion
            The
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Narek Kazarian, Set 1 filed
by Defendant Studio City Caregivers, Inc. and the Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Cahuenga Professional
Building, LLC Set 1 are GRANTED.
Additionally, the Court will impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Narek
Kazarian and Plaintiff Cahuenga Professional Building, LLC, and award them to
Defendant Studio City Caregivers, Inc. in the amount of $6,538.73 on
Plaintiff Narek Kazarian and $6,538.73 Plaintiff Cahuenga Professional
Building, LLC each. Code compliant responses and monetary sanctions are due
within 15 days of this order.   
 
            It
is so ordered.
