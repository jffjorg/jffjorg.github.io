 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to quash summons and complaint 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff OZH Holding 1 LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed
an unlawful detainer complaint against Defendant Rajeeyah Muhammad
(“Defendant”) on August 3, 2023.  The
property at issue is located at 11058 Chandler Blvd., #3026, North Hollywood,
CA 91601.  Plaintiff alleges that it
entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant on October 1, 2022.  Plaintiff alleges that it served on Defendant
a 3/30 Day Notice to Pay or Quit on July 21, 2023.  Plaintiff seeks possession of the premises,
costs incurred in this proceeding, past due rent of $3,992.35, reasonable
attorney’s fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and damages at the rate of $116.63
per day since July 1, 2023. 
B.    
Motion on Calendar and Relevant Background
On September 1,
2023, Defendant (a self-represented litigant) filed a motion to quash service
of the summons and complaint. 
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition
brief.
On September 14, 2023, the Court granted
the ex parte application to advance the hearing date on Defendant’s motion from
October 6, 2023 to September 26, 2023.  
DISCUSSION
A.    Proof of Service
The proof of
service of the summons (filed September 12, 2023) states that Defendant was
served on August 23, 2023 at 4:02 p.m. by leaving the documents with “JOHN DOE
(REFUSED TO GIVE NAME), Competent member of the household” (Race: black; Sex:
male; Age: 45; Height: 5’10”; Weight: 185; Hair: black) at the subject
property.  The documents were thereafter
mailed on August 23, 2023.  Service was
effectuated by Rigoberto Tellez, a registered California process server.  A declaration of diligence is attached,
showing that Mr. Tellez attempted to effectuate service on August 12, 14, 16,
18, 19, 21, and 23 at different times of the day at the subject location.  
On September 12,
2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service of the summons and complaint with
respect to All Other Occupants in Possession, stating that service was
completed by substituted service on August 23, 2023 at 4:02 p.m. on a John Doe
at the subject premises.  The documents
were thereafter mailed. 
B.     Discussion of Merits 
Defendant moves to quash the service of
the summons and complaint, arguing that he was never served.  He argues that he only received notice of the
unlawful detainer mailed from the Court. 
He argues that no notice to terminate tenancy was filed with the Los
Angeles Housing Department pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code § 151.09.C.9
and 165.05.B.5.  He requests that the
action be dismissed.  
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s motion includes substantive arguments regarding the truth of the
allegations and that the motion to quash is not a demurrer nor an answer.  Plaintiff argues that the motion should be
denied because it properly served Defendant with the use of a registered
process server.  
The Court denies Defendant’s motion to
quash.  As pointed out by Plaintiff,
Defendant cannot dispute the merits of the complaint unless he is choosing to
generally appear in the action.  
In addition, filing a proof of service
that complies with statutory standards creates a rebuttable presumption that
service was proper.  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441.)  Plaintiff
filed the proof of service of the summons and complaint after Defendant filed
his motion to quash.  The proof of
service shows that Defendant was served by substituted service at his home and
that the documents were thereafter mailed. 
In the moving papers, Defendant does not argue that service was
improper, that he was not home at the time of service, and that he did not
receive the documents from substituted service or by mailing. Defendant only
provides two pages of arguments in his motion, but does not provide a
declaration in support of his motion. 
Based on the documents before the Court, service appears to have been
properly effectuated.  Whether the 3/30
day notice was properly served or whether Plaintiff complied with the Municipal
Code will have to be determined at a later stage.  A motion to quash is not the proper method to
make such arguments. 
For these reasons, the motion to quash is
denied. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Defendant Rajeeyah Muhammad’s motion
to quash the service of the summons and
complaint is denied.  Defendant is
ordered to file a responsive pleading within 5 days of this order. 
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
