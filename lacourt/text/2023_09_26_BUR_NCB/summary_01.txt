```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of the summons and complaint. The defendant had argued that he was never served with the summons and complaint, and that no notice to terminate the tenancy was filed with the Los Angeles Housing Department. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the defendant was properly served with the use of a registered process server. The judge found that the plaintiff's proof of service complied with statutory standards, creating a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. The judge also noted that the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to dispute the merits of the complaint, and that a motion to quash is not the proper method to raise such arguments. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion and ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 5 days.
