And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of the summons and complaint. The defendant had argued that he was never served with the summons and complaint, and that no notice to terminate the tenancy was filed with the Los Angeles Housing Department. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the defendant was properly served with the use of a registered process server. The judge found that the plaintiff's proof of service complied with statutory standards, creating a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. The judge also noted that the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to dispute the merits of the complaint, and that a motion to quash is not the proper method to raise such arguments. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion and ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 5 days.

**Case Number:** 23BBCV01780
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Plaintiff:** OZH Holding 1 LLC
**Defendant:** Rajeeyah Muhammad
**Property:** 11058 Chandler Blvd., #3026, North Hollywood, CA 91601
**Issue:** Motion to quash summons and complaint

On August 3, 2023, OZH Holding 1 LLC filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Rajeeyah Muhammad. The property in question is located in North Hollywood, CA. Plaintiff served Defendant with a 3/30 Day Notice to Pay or Quit on July 21, 2023. Defendant filed a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint on September 1, 2023.

The proof of service shows that Defendant was served on August 23, 2023, by leaving the documents with a competent member of the household. Defendant argues that he was never served and that no notice to terminate tenancy was filed with the Los Angeles Housing Department. However, Plaintiff properly served Defendant with the use of a registered process server.

The Court denies Defendant’s motion to quash. Filing a proof of service that complies with statutory standards creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. Defendant does not argue that service was improper or that he did not receive the documents. Based on the documents before the Court, service appears to have been properly effectuated.

**Order:** Defendant Rajeeyah Muhammad’s motion to quash the service of the summons and complaint is denied. Defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 5 days of this order. Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
