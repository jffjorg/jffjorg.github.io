Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Koulax Enterprises, the defendant, to the first amended complaint filed by Breann Howard, the plaintiff. The demurrer alleges that the plaintiff has waived her right to bring a class action and that the class action waiver in the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. The judge has also reviewed the motion to strike the class action allegations in the first amended complaint.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is without merit and has overruled it. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the class action allegations. The judge has found that the first amended complaint has pleaded adequate facts to support the plaintiff's class claims and that the waiver of the plaintiff's right to a class action is a question of fact that cannot be resolved on demurrer.

The judge has also granted the requests for judicial notice filed by both parties, which relate to exhibits and docket entries in the case. The judge has also denied the defendant's request to take judicial notice of the Brito settlement, which is a prior class action settlement between Koulax Enterprises and another plaintiff.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to file objections and the judge has had a chance to review them.
