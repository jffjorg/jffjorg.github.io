And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the case management statement filed by the Defendant and has taken note of the lack of a case management statement filed by the Plaintiff. The Court continues the case management conference to February 3, 2025, and orders the parties to comply with California Rules of Court and the Court's Local Rules. The Defendant's demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, and the motion to strike is denied as moot. The Court finds that the complaint does not sufficiently plead intent to induce reliance and that the "unfair" section of the fifth cause of action is inadequately pleaded. The Court grants the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint and orders the moving party to give notice unless waived by the parties.
