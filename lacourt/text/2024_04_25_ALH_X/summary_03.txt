And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling regarding a motion to quash service of summons and vacate judgment-unlawful detainer filed by defendants Cultiva Group and Qirong Lin. The plaintiff, 5623 PECK ROAD, LLC, had filed an unlawful detainer case against the defendants in May 2023, seeking past-due rent and other damages. The defendants argue that the service of the summons and complaint was improper, while the plaintiff claims that service was properly executed in accordance with statutory requirements. The court finds that the plaintiff has established a rebuttable presumption of proper service, and the defendants fail to demonstrate that the service was improper. As a result, the motion to quash service of summons and vacate judgment-unlawful detainer are denied.
