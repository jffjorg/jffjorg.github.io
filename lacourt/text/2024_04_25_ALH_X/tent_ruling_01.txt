RELIEF REQUESTED  
 
Plaintiff moves for an order granting
summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants Min Yi Jiang and
Sung Ho Suh as to Plaintiff’s two causes of action for Breach of Promissory
Note and Declaratory Relief on the grounds that there are no triable issues of
material fact. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
 This case arises out of Plaintiff
Nengde Xu’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants Sung Ho Suh (‘Suh”) and Min Yu
Jiang (“Jiang”) (collectively “Defendants”) failed to repay Plaintiff in the
amount of $250,000. Plaintiff alleges that he loaned $200,000 to Defendants
according to a promissory note entered into around January 2019 and an
additional $50,000 after a verbal agreement around March 2019. Plaintiff
alleges that around March 2020, Defendants provided Plaintiff with a check for
$17,500, which bounced due to insufficient funds. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants have not repaid the money owed. 
 
Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint on May 23, 2022, alleging two causes of action for (1) breach
of contract, and (2) declaratory relief.  
 
On November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Summary Judgment. On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed amended papers.  No opposition has been filed as of April 22,
2024. 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff Nengde Xu’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a
mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether,
despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826,
843.) “A party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it
is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding.” (Code of Civil Procedure section 473c subd. (a)(1).) “The motion for
summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code of Civil Procedures section
473c subd. (c).)  
 
¿Where the
plaintiff has also moved for summary judgment that party has the burden of
showing there is no defense to a cause of action.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a).) That burden can be met if the plaintiff “has proved each element of
the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) If the plaintiff meets this burden, it
is up to the defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (S.B.C.C.,
Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 383,
388.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of
the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) 
 
As to the first element—the existence of a contract—Plaintiff sets forth
in the separate statement that “[o]n or about January 2019, Defendants agreed
to borrow $250,000.00 from Plaintiff. A Promissory Note depicts an agreement
for $200,000.00, but an additional verbal agreement exists for an additional
$50,000.00. Per the original terms of the aforesaid agreements, Defendants were
required to pay all borrowed monies in full to Plaintiff by August 1, 2019.”
(Separate Statement, p. 2, UMF Nos. 1-3.) In UMF Nos. 1-3, Plaintiff
incorporates by reference Exhibit A of the Declaration of Xu in Support of
Motion for Summary Judgment, which is the aforementioned Promissory Note. The Promissory
Notes appears to be signed by Defendants and states: “Min Yi Jiang and
Sung H Suh owe Nengde Xu $200,000.00. This will be used for the operation of
Galaxy Promoter, Inc. Jiang + Suh will pay back full amount by August 1st,
2019.” Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of
persuasion and establish the existence of a contract between the parties. 
 
As to the second element— plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance—Plaintiff sets forth in the separate statement that (1)
“[b]etween January 29, 2019 and February 1, 2019, Plaintiff caused a sum
totaling no less than $140,000.00 to be transferred to Defendants”; (2) [o]n or
about January 30, 2019, Plaintiff brough and gave to Defendants a Cashier’s
Check of a sum totaling no less than $60,000.00”; and (3) “[o]n or about March
21, 2019, Plaintiff transferred a sum totaling no less than $50,000.00 to
Defendants.” (Separate Statement, p. 3, UMF Nos. 4-6.) Plaintiff further sets
forth in the separate statement that “Plaintiff has performed all conditions,
covenants, and promises required on his party to be performed in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the agreements.” (Separate Statement, p. 3,
UMF No. 7.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of
persuasion and make a prima facie showing that Plaintiff performed under the contract. 
 
As to the third element— defendant's breach—Plaintiff sets forth in the
separate statement that “Defendants have failed to pay the amount due and
owning pursuant to the agreements” and “[d]espite repeated efforts by Plaintiff
to collect owed monies, Defendants breached the agreements through their
failure to pay the amount due and owning pursuant to the agreements.” (Separate
Statement, pp. 4, UMF Nos. 8-9.) Given that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of
persuasion with regard to the performance under the contract, the Court finds
that Plaintiff satisfies its burden of persuasion and make a prima facie
showing that Defendants breached the contract because Defendants have not paid
the amount due and owing. 
 
As to the fourth and final element—the resulting damages to the
plaintiff— Plaintiff sets forth in their separate statement that Plaintiff has
been damaged in a sum no less than $250,000.00 and, “Plaintiff has suffered and
will continue to suffer consequential damages in an amount according to proof.”
(Separate Statement, p. 13, UMF Nos. 43-44.) The Court finds that Plaintiff
satisfies its burden of persuasion and makes a prima facie showing that
Plaintiff was damaged by Defendants’ breaches. 
 
Defendants offers no opposition to the motion and,
as such, have not presented evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff Nengde Xu’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
It
is so ordered. 
 
 Moving
Party to give notice.
