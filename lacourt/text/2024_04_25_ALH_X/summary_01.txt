And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Nengde Xu, is seeking judgment against the defendants, Sung Ho Suh and Min Yi Jiang, for breach of a promissory note and declaratory relief. The court finds that the plaintiff has established the existence of a contract, the plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, the defendant's breach, and the resulting damages to the plaintiff. The defendants have failed to pay the amount due and owing under the contract, and the plaintiff has suffered damages as a result. The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied its burden of persuasion and makes a prima facie showing that the defendants breached the contract. Since the defendants have not presented any opposition to the motion, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
