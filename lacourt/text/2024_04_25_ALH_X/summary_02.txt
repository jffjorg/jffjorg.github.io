And here is a brief summary in English:

The tentative ruling sustains Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's third cause of action for fraudulent inducement based on concealment. The ruling also grants Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. The court finds that Plaintiff's allegations fail to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement based on concealment, and that Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages is unsupported by sufficient factual allegations.
