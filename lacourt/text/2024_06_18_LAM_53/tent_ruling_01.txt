  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Joe Jennum           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Clark Maloney
Motion for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on plaintiff
Clark Maloney’s evidentiary objections, filed April 15, 2024, as follows:
            Objections
Nos. 1-3 are overruled. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Joe Jennum (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order (1)
dismissing all causes of action alleged against Defendant by plaintiff Clark
Maloney (“Plaintiff”) in his Complaint, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff and his attorneys in the total amount
of $75,696.06, consisting of $73,087.50 in attorney’s fees and $2,608.56 in
costs.  Defendant moves for this relief
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 on the grounds that
Plaintiff’s claims are without legal merit and his Complaint was filed for an
improper purpose. 
The court finds
that Defendant has not met his burden to show that he complied with the
mandatory safe harbor provision set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section
128.7.  (Li v. Majestic Industry Hills
LLC (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 585, 594 [“Because compliance with the safe
harbor is a prerequisite to recovering sanctions, the burden is appropriately
placed on the party seeking the sanctions to ensure the full safe harbor is
provided”].) 
“Notice of [a]
motion [for sanctions under section 128.7] shall be served as provided in
Section 1010, but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless,
within 21 days after service of the motion, or any other period as the court
may prescribe, the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or
denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd (c)(1).)  “[T]he law requires strict compliance with the
safe harbor provisions.  [Citation.]  Failure to comply with the safe harbor
provisions ‘precludes an award of sanctions.’ 
[Citations.]”  (Transcon
Financial, Inc. v. Reid & Hellyer, APC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 547, 551
[internal citations omitted].) 
Defendant
has presented evidence establishing that he served this motion on Plaintiff by
email on February 13, 2024.  (Walsh
Decl., ¶ 2; Walsh Decl., Ex. A, p. 1 [February 13, 2024 email attaching motion
for sanctions].)  Twenty-one days from
February 13, 2024, excluding the date of service of the motion, was March 5,
2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 12 [“The time
in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the
first day, and including the last . . . .”]; Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured
Asset Sales, LLC (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 596, 599 [“When calculating the
earliest possible day that a motion for sanctions can be filed, section 12
applies such that the day the motion was served is excluded and the last day is
included”].)  The safe harbor period was
thereafter extended by two court days for electronic service, i.e., to March 7,
2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B) [“any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any
period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time
period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended
after service by electronic means by two court days”]; Transcon Financial,
Inc., supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 551 [finding that section 1010.6
extended the safe harbor period by two court days].)  
Thus, the court
finds, for an electronic service date of February 13, 2024, that (1) the safe
harbor period expired on March 7, 2024, and therefore (2) the first day that Defendant
could have filed his motion for sanctions was March 8, 2024.  (Broadcast Music, Inc., supra, 75
Cal.App.5th at p. 605 [“A sanctions motion cannot be filed until the 22nd day
after service of the motion, i.e., after the 21-day safe harbor period
expires”].)  Defendant filed his motion
for sanctions on March 6, 2024, before the safe harbor period expired. 
For the
reasons set forth above, the court finds that Defendant has not met his burden
to show that he complied with the mandatory safe harbor period set forth in
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 and therefore denies Defendant’s
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7 subd.
(c)(1); Li, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 594; Transcon
Financial, Inc., supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 551.) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Joe
Jennum’s motion for sanctions.
            The court orders plaintiff Clark
Maloney to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
