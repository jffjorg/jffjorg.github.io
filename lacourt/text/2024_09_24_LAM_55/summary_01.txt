Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff had failed to file an opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss, which was granted on June 7, 2024. The plaintiff had substituted a new attorney, Tony Blain, on May 29, 2024, but failed to pay the remaining retainer balance until after the opposition deadline. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to file an opposition was due to excusable neglect, as he had mistakenly believed that his new attorney would be able to get a continuance of the hearing date. The court has set aside the previous order granting dismissal and will set a new hearing date for the defendant's motion to dismiss.
