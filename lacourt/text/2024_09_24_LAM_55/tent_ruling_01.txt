  Case Number:  23STCV14415    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate
Dismissal
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal is
granted.  
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed this action, in pro per, against
Defendant William M. Lengyel alleging breach of contract. 
On March 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion to
Dismiss. The hearing was set for June 7, 2024, with an opposition deadline of May
24, 2024. Plaintiff failed to file an opposition. 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff substituted Tony Blain as
his counsel.  
On June 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application for an order continuing the hearing date on the motion.  The Court denied the ex parte application.
On June 7, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s
unopposed motion, dismissing the case with prejudice.
On August 16, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration of the June 7 order.
Now before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion for an
order for relief from the June 7 order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 473(b). Defendant opposes the motion. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
The court has discretion to grant a party relief from
a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against that party through the
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473 subd. (b). “Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of
the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein1, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” Code Civ. Proa, § 473, subd. (b). The court has wide
discretion to grant relief under the statute authorizing relief from a
proceeding taken against a party through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. v. Morgan Creek
Productions, Inc. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1111. “Section 473 enables a
plaintiff who has failed to oppose a motion to dismiss through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect to file a belated opposition to
such motion.” Wilcox v. Ford (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1170, 1176. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The Court grants Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial
Notice of two court documents.
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff’s motion is timely filed and includes his
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. 
Plaintiff argues that the Court should grant relief
from dismissal because Plaintiff’s failure to file an opposition to Defendant’s
Motion to Dismiss was the result of his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s failure to file an
opposition was not excusable neglect.  
“Within the context of section 473(b) neglect is
excusable if a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances might have
made the same error.” Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 918, 929. “The very purpose of section 473 is to give a party
the opportunity of repairing the damage done because of his failure or that of
his counsel to make the showing he could have made, provided, of course, that
that failure is due either to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.”
Stephens v. Baker & Baker Roofing Co. (1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 765,
771. “‘[T]he provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure are to be
liberally construed and sound policy favors the determination of actions on
their merits.'" Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002)
28 Cal.4th 249, 256 (quoting Riskin v. Towers (1944) 24 Cal.2d 274, 279).
Plaintiff met with his former counsel, Attorney Blain,
in April 2024, to discuss representation in this matter. Declaration of Justin
Beimforde (“Beimforde Decl.”) ¶ 2. On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff emailed Attorney
Blain about the pending Motion and the June 7 hearing date. Beimforde Decl. Exhibit
A. The terms of their retainer agreement stated that Plaintiff would pay $10,000,
of which the initial $7,500 was due on May 15, 2024, with the remainder due
upon execution of the agreement. Beimforde Decl. Ex. C.  On May 14, 2024, Attorney Blain received and
deposited Plaintiff’s retainer fee in the amount of $7,500. Beimforde Decl. Ex.
B. Plaintiff executed the retainer agreement on May 23, 2024, but did not sign the
substitution of attorney form until May 25, 2024.  Also on May 25, 2024, Plaintiff sent Attorney
Blain “the USPS tracking Info” for the remaining $2,500 installment. Plaintiff
mistakenly believed that his former counsel would be able to get a continuance
of the hearing on the motion to dismiss, allowing counsel to file an opposition.
Beimforde Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. E. 
At the time the Court denied the ex parte request to
continue the June 7 hearing, the Court was unaware that Plaintiff had
endeavored to retain an attorney in April 2024, which should have left
Plaintiff and his new attorney with sufficient time to file an opposition to
the motion. The retainer agreement between Plaintiff and his former attorney plainly
states that the agreement does not take effect until Plaintiff paid the entire
retainer. Beimforde Decl. Ex. C. Plaintiff failed, however, to pay the $2,500
retainer balance until after the opposition deadline had passed. Beimforde
Decl., ¶¶ 8-9. Plaintiff’s explanation for the delay in payment—that he was
traveling—rises to excusable neglect when considered in the context of his misguided
understanding that his attorney would be able to get a continuance of the June
7 hearing after he had paid the full retainer. Beimforde Decl., ¶ 9. In this
context, Plaintiff’s failure to timely pay the retainer to ensure the timely
filing of an opposition meets the standard of excusable neglect, especially
considering the policy of deciding cases on their merits. Accordingly, the
Court sets aside its previous order granting dismissal.  
The Court will set a new hearing date for Defendants’
motion to dismiss at the hearing on 9/24/2024, which will include a briefing
schedule for Defendants to file a reply brief to the opposition submitted with
the motion to set aside. 
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate dismissal is
granted.
