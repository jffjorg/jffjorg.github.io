Summary:
The judge has denied Defendant Choi's motion for sanctions, which was filed prior to the setting aside of default. The judge found that the motion was procedurally defective and that Choi failed to demonstrate bad faith or frivolity in the Plaintiffs' claims. The judge also noted that the Plaintiffs' allegations were not obviously false and that Choi's arguments were not supported by evidence. The judge further declined to award Plaintiffs' request for attorney fees and costs.
