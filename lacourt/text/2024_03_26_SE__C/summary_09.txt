And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Sam Nordean, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Valerie Naranjo. The motion was unopposed and good cause exists to grant it based on the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge cites Rule 3-700(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which allows an attorney to withdraw if the client insists on presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law or if the client seeks to pursue an illegal course of conduct. The judge finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down and that the best interests of the client will be served by the withdrawal of Sam Nordean as counsel. The motion is granted, and Plaintiff's Counsel is required to give notice.
