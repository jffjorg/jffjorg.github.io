 Case Number:  23NWCV02312    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  C Higgins,
et al v. LBJ Healthcare Partners, Inc., et al., Case No. 23NWCV02312
 
This
is a wrongful death action. Decedent Nicole Lacea Higgins walked away from a
residential care facility, was struck by a motor vehicle, and died. Plaintiffs
move ex parte for an order granting them leave to file their fourth amended
complaint. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiffs
assert that the next available date for a noticed motion is January 16, 2025.
(Decl. Harper, ¶ 6, Ex. 2.) They further assert that they will be prejudiced
because they will not be able to promptly prosecute this action. (Decl. Harper,
¶ 8.) 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1) states that an amendment may
be permitted after giving notice to adverse parties, except to change names or
correct a mistake,. Plaintiffs have not stated or otherwise indicated what
kinds of changes they want to make to the complaint. 
 
Thus,
the Court denies the ex parte application.
