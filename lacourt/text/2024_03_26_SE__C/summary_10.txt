And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lozano regarding a lemon law case involving a certified pre-owned 2018 Jaguar XJ purchased by plaintiff Jessica Lozano and distributed by Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC. The plaintiff alleges that the vehicle has nonconformities that were unable to be repaired within a reasonable number of attempts, and that the defendant violated the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The plaintiff had filed a motion to compel further responses to requests for production, set one, which was denied as to requests 1-15, moot as to requests 16-31, and granted as to requests 32-37. The joint statement filed by the parties outlined the disputed issues and the parties' positions.

The court found that the plaintiff had fulfilled the meet and confer requirement and that the defendant had failed to provide adequate responses to discovery requests. The court also noted that the parties had reached a compromise on requests 16-31.

The court granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests 32-37, which sought information establishing the defendant's knowledge of similar defects in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model. The court limited the requests to Customer Relations Center Cases concerning 2018 Jaguar XJ vehicles sold in California.
