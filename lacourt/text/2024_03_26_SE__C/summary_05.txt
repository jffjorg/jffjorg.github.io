The judge has granted the motion of Morey & Upton, LLC, to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Nyree Brown. The motion was unopposed as of March 18, 2024. The judge finds good cause for the motion based on Rule 3-700(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which allows an attorney to withdraw if it is unreasonably difficult to carry out the employment effectively. The attorney declaration states that there is a conflict between the plaintiff and the firm, making it difficult for the attorney to continue representing the plaintiff. The judge notes that the attorney has been unable to confirm the client's current address and has made multiple attempts to contact the client without success.
