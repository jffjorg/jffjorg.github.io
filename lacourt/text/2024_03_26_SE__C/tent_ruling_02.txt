Tentative Ruling 
Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED. 
Defendants Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
is MOOT. 
Defendants to give notice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff Henry Aguila
(“Aguila”) filed this lawsuit against Defendants Joseph Shabani, Kamyar D.
Shabani, Mercury Bowl, LLC, Green Rivera LLC, Optimus Properties, LLC and Pico
Rivera Holdings LVT, LLC (“Defendants”). 
The operative Second Amended Complaint alleged: 1) Interference with
Prospective Advantage, 2) Negligence, 3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, and 4) Breach of Contract. 
Defendants’ demurrer to the first and third causes of action were
sustained without leave to amend.  All
that remains is the second cause of action for Negligence and the fourth cause
of action for Breach of Contract.
 
It is
undisputed that on February 13, 2006, Pico Rivera Plaza Co., LP and Thee
Aguila, Inc. (“TAI”) entered into a reciprocal easement agreement (“REA”). (SS,
¶1.) The two properties subject to the REA are commonly known as 8825
Washington Boulevard in Pico Rivera, California (the “Property”) and 8909-8917
Washington Boulevard in Pico Rivera, California. (SS, ¶2.) TAI defaulted on its
loan secured by a deed of trust on the Property and its lender, Pico Rivera
First Mortgage Investors, LP, ("Pico Rivera") foreclosed on the
Property in 2017. (SS, ¶3.) Pico Rivera subsequently sold the Property to
Defendants Mercury Bowl, LLC, and Green Rivera, LLC with the grant deed
transferring the Property to Mercury Bowl, LLC and Green Rivera, LLC recorded
on November 20, 2019. (SS, ¶4.) Plaintiff disputes the validity of the sale and
contends that on June 1, 2020, Plaintiff Henry Aguila entered into a 50-year
lease for the Property listing TAI as Landlord and Plaintiff as the tenant. (SSO,
¶5.) Defendants contend that as of June 1, 2020, TAI did not own the Property.
(SS ¶6.)
 
Defendants move for summary
judgment on the basis that Plaintiff lacks standing to sue, among other
grounds.

Legal Standard 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A defendant moving for summary judgment “has
met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the
party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot
be established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2).)  “Once the
defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . .
to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the
cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Id.)  “If the
plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.”  (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.”  (Avivi, supra, 159
Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) 
Discussion 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring
suit because he was not a party to the 2006 reciprocal easement agreement which
Plaintiff accuses Defendants of violating. 
“Someone who is not a party to [a] contract has no standing to enforce
the contract.” (Gantman v. United Pac. Ins. Co., (1991) 232 Cal. App. 3d
1560, 1566.) “Because a corporation exists as a separate legal entity, the
shareholders have no direct cause of action or right of recovery against those
who have harmed it.” (Grosset v. Wenaas, (2008) 42 Cal. 4th 1100, 1108
(2008).) This is true even where the injured shareholder is the sole
shareholder. (Vinci v. Waste Management, Inc., (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th
1811, 1815.) It is undisputed that the REA was between Pico Rivera Plaza Co.,
LP and TAI. (SS, ¶1.) As such, Defendants have made a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact. 

The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue
of material fact.  
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that on June 1, 2020, he
acquired a leasehold interest in the Property by entering into a 50-year lease
with TAI, intending to run the Property as an entertainment venue, and thus
binding him to the terms of the REA.  However,
it is undisputed that TAI defaulted on its loan and the lender foreclosed on
the Property in 2017, three years before Plaintiff claims he entered into a
50-year lease with TAI. (SS, ¶ 3.) Plaintiff further argues that the sale of
the property to Defendants was conducted in violation of a Bankruptcy Court
stay.  However, this argument has already
been rejected by the Court of Appeal. (Aguila v. Pico Rivera First Mortgage Investors,
LP, 2d Civ. No. B323391, Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. F, pp. 5-6,
12-14).  Since TAI was incapable of
providing lease rights to Plaintiff in 2020, the lease could not bind Plaintiff
to the terms of the REA.  Therefore, Plaintiff
lacks standing to make a valid claim against Defendants. 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED.
