Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Jessica Lozano’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, is DENIED as to Request
Nos. 1-15, MOOT as to Request Nos. 16-31 and GRANTED as to Request Nos. 32-37.   
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
This is a lemon law case involving a certified pre-owned
2018 Jaguar XJ (the “vehicle”) purchased by Plaintiff Jessica Lozano
(“Plaintiff”) and distributed by Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC
(“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges there are nonconformities in the vehicle that Defendant’s
repair facilities were unable to repair within a reasonable number of attempts,
and as such, Defendant violated the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  
Previously, Plaintiff argued that Defendant served
boilerplate objections and inadequate responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, which seek documents directly related to the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claims, including documents relating to: (1)
Plaintiff’s own vehicle (Request Nos. 1-15); (2) Defendant’s warranty and
repurchase policies, procedures, and practices (Request Nos. 16-31); and (3)
Defendant’s knowledge of the same or similar defects in other vehicles of the
same year, make, and model (Request Nos. 32-37). (Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 3.)
In a ruling on January 2, 2024, the Court was not persuaded
that counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the
Code. Counsel was ORDERED to make further efforts to resolve the issues
presented. The Court ruled that if, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. The Court also ruled that if counsel are unable to
informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit
a JOINT STATEMENT outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is
required. The joint statement was filed on March 19, 2024.
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and
confer requirement after filing the joint statement with Defendant. 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030.
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The joint statement addresses the following: 
Request Nos. 1-15: 
Request Nos. 1-15 relate to the Subject Vehicle. Plaintiff
seeks further documents relating to the warranty repairs performed on the
Subject Vehicle and documentation available to Defendant in its evaluation of
the Subject Vehicle for repurchase. 
Defendant maintains that it produced all documents within
its possession, custody, or control pertaining to Plaintiff’s ownership of the
Subject Vehicle. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Response to
Request Nos. 1-15 is DENIED. 
Request Nos. 16-31: 
The parties have reached a compromise as to Request Nos.
16-31. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Response
to Request Nos. 16-31 is MOOT. 
Request Nos. 32-37:
Request Nos. 32 through 37 seek information that
establishes Defendant’s knowledge of the same or similar defects in other
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiff’s vehicle, including
documents relating to internal investigations and analysis into the cause of
the problems in Plaintiff’s vehicle as reported by Plaintiff, including
documents reviewed, written/oral reports created summarizing or otherwise
reporting the results of such investigations, and memorandum or e-mails drafted
regarding Plaintiff’s repurchase request and/or Defendant’s investigation and
response thereto.
Defendant argues that the requests for the Customer
Relations Center Cases as to all owners of 2018 Jaguar XJ vehicles is unduly
burdensome as Defendant will have to read and review the cases to redact all
private and confidential information of the third parties contained within the
cases, which would require an inordinate amount of time. 
These requests
are overbroad because they seek documents related to vehicles worldwide.
Therefore, the requests will be limited to Customer Relations Center Cases
concerning 2018 Jaguar XJ vehicles sold in California.
