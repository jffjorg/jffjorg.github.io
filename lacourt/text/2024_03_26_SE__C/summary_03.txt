And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs. The plaintiff's counsel, Joseph Kaufman, has provided detailed billing records for the work performed on the case. The court has reviewed the contested entries and finds the fees associated with them are reasonable.

The plaintiff seeks attorney's fees in the amount of $43,187.00 and costs in the amount of $896.21. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the rates are unreasonable and excessive. The court finds that the hourly rates requested by the plaintiff are reasonable and commensurate with rates charged by attorneys with comparable skill and expertise.

The court also finds that the lodestar multiplier is not appropriate in this case. The plaintiff's counsel accepted the case only on a contingency basis, and the court finds that such considerations and risks are already included within the lodestar amount.

Finally, the court awards the plaintiff's costs in the amount of $896.21. The total award for attorney's fees and costs is $44,083.21. The court grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in part, as described above.
