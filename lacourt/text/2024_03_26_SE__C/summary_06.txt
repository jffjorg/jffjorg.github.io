And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, RG SG Market LLC, has filed a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the cross-defendant, Chedraui USA. The court has granted the motion, finding that the proposed cross-complaint is a compulsory cross-complaint that arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant's counsel discovered that one of the current tenants was responsible for the common areas of the premises where the alleged ADA violations occurred, and the defendant has potential indemnity and contribution claims against Chedraui USA that arise out of the common area of the premises. The court finds that the defendant has acted in good faith and that granting the motion will not prejudice the plaintiff.
