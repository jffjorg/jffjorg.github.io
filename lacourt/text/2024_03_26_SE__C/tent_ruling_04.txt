Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is MOOT.  The Requests for Sanctions are DENIED.
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
This is a lemon law case. Plaintiff Yolisma Martinez
(“Plaintiff”) purchased a 2021 Honda CR-V (the “Subject Vehicle”) which was
distributed and warranted by Defendant Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”).
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that the parties have satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030.
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff seeks to compel further
responses to special interrogatories as follows:
Special Interrogatory 14 
If YOU contend that the SUBJECT VEHICLE does not qualify
for repurchase under the provisions of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act,
please state all facts supporting YOUR contention.
Special Interrogatory 43
State all facts supporting YOUR contention that YOU
maintain a qualified third-party dispute resolution process in California.
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses was filed on
December 15, 2023.  Defendant provided
further responses on January 16, 2024.  
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
is MOOT.
Sanctions 
The court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or demand for production
of documents unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Both parties submit requests for sanctions against the
other. Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $2135.00 because Defendant
produced further responses only after Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of
$2160.00 for abuse of the discovery process. 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff served 247 discovery requests, and after
AHM responded, Plaintiff demanded further response to 104 discovery requests in
boilerplate correspondence.  Given Defendant’s
late responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 14 and 43, the number of discovery
requests propounded by Plaintiff and Defendant’s voluntary compliance, the
Court declines to issue sanctions against either party.  
 
Accordingly, the requests for sanctions are DENIED.
