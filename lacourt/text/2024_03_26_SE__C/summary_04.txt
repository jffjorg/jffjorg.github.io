And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case between Yolisma Martinez and American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The plaintiff, Martinez, had filed a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the defendant. However, the judge finds that the defendant has already provided further responses, making the motion moot. The judge also declines to grant sanctions to either party, finding that the number of discovery requests and the parties' voluntary compliance justify the lack of sanctions.
