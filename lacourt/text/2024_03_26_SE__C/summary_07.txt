And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to conduct financial discovery into the Defendant's financial condition. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant, Claudio Gomez, sexually abused her while she was in foster care, and the abuse continued from when she was 9 years old to when she was 18 years old. The Plaintiff seeks punitive damages and argues that there is a substantial probability that a jury will find in favor of her on her claim. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has met the requirements for financial discovery, which includes showing that there is a substantial probability that the Plaintiff will prevail on her claim for punitive damages. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's guilty plea to 15 counts of Lewd and Lascivious Acts with a Minor is admissible in the civil case and shows that the Defendant acted with malice or oppression. Therefore, the Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for leave to conduct financial discovery, subject to a protective order agreed upon by the parties.
