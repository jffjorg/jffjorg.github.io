Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant hospital and its staff acted within the standard of care in treating the plaintiff, Raul Raygoza. The judge found that the plaintiff's expert declaration, submitted by Tyla DiMaria, R.N., was inadmissible because it did not disclose the material relied on in forming the opinion. The plaintiff's own declaration, which alleged assault and battery by hospital staff, was inconsistent with his deposition testimony and therefore not credible. As a result, the judge found that the plaintiff had not raised a triable issue of material fact as to the allegations of assault, battery, medical negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
