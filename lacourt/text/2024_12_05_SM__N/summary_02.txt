And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the defendant's special motion to strike the complaint as a Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP). The complaint is deemed a SLAPP because it is based on protected activity, namely the defendant's conduct in a judicial proceeding. The defendant has met the threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The plaintiff must establish a likelihood of prevailing on the claim, but the plaintiff's complaint is devoid of facts and provides only opinions about the defendant's conduct. The Court finds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the litigation privilege, and therefore the anti-SLAPP motion is granted. The defendant is ordered to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment.
