[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion TO VACATE THE CONDITIONAL
  DISMISSAL AND FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
  SECTION 664.6 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations of Complaint 
Plaintiff American Express National Bank
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant Kay Wade (“Defendant”) became indebted to
Plaintiff within the last four years on an open book account for money due. Plaintiff
alleges that it extended credit to Defendant pursuant to two American Express
credit card accounts. According to the complaint, Defendant owes an outstanding
balance of $35,179.85. 
            The complaint, filed on April 26,
2022, alleges a cause of action for common counts against Defendant.  
B.    
Relevant Background 
On June 10, 2022, Defendant filed an
answer to the complaint.   
On July 18, 2022, pursuant to a
stipulation between the parties, the Court dismissed this matter without
prejudice and retained jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6 to enforce the
terms of the settlement between the parties and enter judgment in the event of
default. 
C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and for entry of judgment pursuant
to CCP § 664.6. 
As of December 10, 2024, the motion is
unopposed. Any opposition was required to have been filed and served at least
nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks an order vacating the
conditional dismissal and entering judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant “on the grounds that Defendant has failed to make payments consistent
with the settlement agreement and that this Court has jurisdiction to enter a
judgment consistent with the agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant . . . .”
(Not. of Mot. at p. 1:24-28.) 
A.    Legal Standard
            “Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides a summary procedure to enforce a
settlement agreement by entering judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.) “[I]f
the parties to pending litigation enter into a settlement either in writing
signed by the parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” (Ibid.) “The
court retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even after
a dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of jurisdiction
before the dismissal.” (Ibid.) “Such a request must be made either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” (Ibid.)  
“A court ruling on a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement.” (Ibid.) “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms.” (Ibid.) “The court ruling on the motion may consider the
parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties
agreed to.” (Ibid.) “If the court determines that the parties entered
into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” (Ibid.) Code Civ.
Proc. § 664.6 “expressly provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.” (Id. at p. 1183.) “It is widely recognized
that the courts are not at liberty to revise an agreement under the guise of
construing it.” (Series AGI Est Linn of Appian Group Investors DE, LLC v.
Eves (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 164.)        
B.    
Evidence in Support of the Motion

Plaintiff’s counsel, Scott D. Dyle
(“Dyle”), provides a declaration in support of the 
motion. Mr. Dyle states the following:
Plaintiff filed this suit on or about April 26, 2022. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 2.)
Thereafter, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”)
on or around July 12, 2022. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 3.) The parties signed the
Agreement, and it was filed with the Court, and the Court entered a conditional
dismissal. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. A.) 
            Defendant
agreed that he was indebted to Plaintiff in the amount of $22,286.51 on
Defendant’s account ending in 7001 and $12,893.34 on Defendant’s account ending
in 1008, for a total of $35,179.85. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 5.) Paragraph 5 of the
Agreement states that the Court can enter judgment for $35,179.85 less credits
for any payments made if Defendant fails to make payments consistent with the
Agreement. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 6.) The Agreement set forth a repayment schedule in
Paragraph 6 therein; however, Defendant has failed to comply with the repayment
schedule and has not made a payment since March 26, 2024 on the accounts. (Dyle
Decl., ¶ 7.) A cure letter was sent to Defendant on July 18, 2024. (Dyle Decl.,
¶ 8; Ex. B.) Defendant has not cured his default. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 9.) 
            According
to Mr. Dyle, “Defendant has made payments totaling $13,429.85 since the start
of this agreement.” (Dyle Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff is requesting a judgment of
$22,325.00, which represents the $35,179.85 stipulated judgment amount plus
$575.00 in costs minus credits for payments made in the sum of $13,429.85.
(Dyle Decl., ¶ 10.) 
C.        Analysis
            The
Court finds that it has authority to enforce the Agreement pursuant to Hines
v. Lukes, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. The Agreement provides
that if Defendant failed to comply therewith, the Court “can enter a judgment
against Defendant in the amount of $35,179.85 plus costs” and that “Defendant
shall receive a credit for any payments made under this agreement.” (Dyle
Decl., Ex. A at ¶ 5.) The Court also has jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement
as the Court entered an order pursuant to stipulation that it retained
jurisdiction under CCP § 664.6. Further, the Court finds that the parties
entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement. 
            The
Court, however, notes an error in Plaintiff’s proposed judgment form.
Plaintiff’s proposed judgment form indicates that Plaintiff is requesting a
total judgment of “$22,32500,” which the Court notes is a typographical error.
(See 09/12/24 Proposed Judgment at p. 1:26.) The Court will correct this
typographical error. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Plaintiff
American Express National Bank’s motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and
for entry of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 is
GRANTED. 
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
this order.
