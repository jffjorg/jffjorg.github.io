  No.: 23BBCV02064
 
  Hearing Date:  December 13, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses of defendant gayane akopyan;
  MOTION TO DEEM RFA ADMITTED; requests for sanctions
 



 
On October 7,
2024, Plaintiff Chen Avneri (“Plaintiff”) filed motions to compel initial responses
from Defendant Gayane Akopyan (“Defendant”) for: (1) Form Interrogatories
(“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set one; and (3) Request
for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one. Plaintiff also filed a motion to
deem the Requests for Admissions (“RFA”), set one, as admitted. 
On March 8, 2024,
Plaintiff served on Defendant the discovery requests. Plaintiff granted several
extensions such that responses were due by May 22, 2024.  Plaintiff states that Defendant did not
provide responses, such that Plaintiff’s counsel sent correspondence to request
that Defendant provide discovery responses. 
Plaintiff states that in September 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel spoke with
defense counsel’s paralegal, David Rosenblum, about the discovery responses,
and provided more extensions for the discovery. 
Despite providing time for Defendant to respond to the discovery,
Plaintiff states that as of the filing of the motions, Plaintiff has not
received responses from Defendant. (Gardella Decl. ¶ 31)
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300. Defendant is ordered to provide verified
responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests, without objections,
within 20 days of notice of this order.   

Plaintiff’s unopposed motion
to deem the RFA, set one, as admitted is granted pursuant to CCP § 2033.280.
Defendant has not served Plaintiff with any response or filed an opposition. Since
Defendant has failed to provide any response prior to the hearing on this
matter, the Court must grant the motion. (CCP § 2033.280.)
Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant and his attorney in the amount of $1,260 for each
motion (= 1.5 hours to prepare the motion + 1.5 anticipated hours to review the
opposition, prepare the reply, and attend the hearing at $400/hour, plus $60 in
filing fees). The requests are granted but in the reasonable amount of $1,200
total for these relatively simple and identical unopposed motions, plus $180 in
filing fees. Defendant and
his counsel of record, jointly and severally, are
ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,380 to Plaintiff, by
and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
