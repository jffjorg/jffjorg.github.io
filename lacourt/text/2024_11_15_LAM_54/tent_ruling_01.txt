BACKGROUND
                
This is a lemon law action arising out of
Plaintiff purchase of a 2017 Kia Niro manufactured and distributed by Defendant
Kia America, Inc.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The moving party on a motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) must submit
“specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.”  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(1).)  If the moving party has
shown good cause for the RPDs, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections.  (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)  
 
After an unsuccessful informal
discovery conference, Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to RPDs, set
one. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has provided meritless, boilerplate
responses to each request and further responses are warranted. 
 
The RPDs seek information relating to (A) The Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7); (B) Internal
Knowledge and Investigation related to the Engine and Transmission Defects in
2017 KIA Niro vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 15, 16, 23, 24, 27, 28, 37, 38, 49, 50,
59, 60, 65, 66, 69, 70) (C) Summaries, Memoranda, Power Points related to the
Engine and Transmission Defects in 2017 KIA Niro vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 71,
72, 78, 79) (D) Policies and Procedures related to the Song Beverly Act (i.e.
RFP Nos. 86, 88, 90, 99); (E) Communication With Governmental Agencies and
Suppliers related to the Engine and Transmission Defects in 2017 KIA Niro
vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118); (F) Production of
Documents and Deposition Testimony in Class Action(s) (i.e. RFP No. 130, 132);
and (G) Other Documents Related To The Subject Vehicle’s Defect (i.e. RFP No.
137, 138).
 
Defendant objects to the requests on the grounds that they are vague,
overbroad, and seek irrelevant information. Defendant represents that it supplemented its responses on October 29,
2024. As Plaintiff may recover civil penalties for Defendant’s willful failure
to comply with the Song-Beverly Act, the requested documents are relevant. Further
response is necessary. Defendant, however, need not produce documents again
that have already been produced. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further is
GRANTED. Plaintiff’s request for Sanctions is DENIED as Plaintiff does not
state the sanctions amount in the title or notice of motion.
