Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Northrup Grumman Systems (Petitioner) and Triumph Aerostructures, LLC (Respondent). The Petitioner petitioned the Court to confirm an arbitration award, while the Respondent cross-petitioned to vacate the award.

The Judge found that the arbitrators did not exceed their authority in interpreting the contract. The contract, which was entered into in 2000, limits the Petitioner's liability for pre-closing contamination to $12,000,000.00. The arbitrators correctly interpreted the contract to limit the Petitioner's liability and awarded damages to the Petitioner for post-2020 remediation costs.

The Respondent argued that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by rewriting the contract, but the Judge found that the arbitrators' interpretation was plausible and did not exceed their authority. The Judge denied the Respondent's cross-petition to vacate the arbitration award and granted the Petitioner's petition to confirm the award.
