And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Garcia Legal v. Esperanza Molina as Trustee of the Esperanza Molina Trust, et al. (Case No. 19STCV05642). The case involves a dispute over legal fees owed by Esperanza to Garcia Legal, as well as claims for declaratory relief and common counts.

The Judge has granted Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint, which will re-add a claim for declaratory relief and add a new cause of action for common counts. The Judge found that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper, and that it will not add new facts or issues to the case.

The Judge noted that the Forest Lawn Action, which was the basis for the declaratory relief claim, has settled, and that the proposed amendment is now ripe. The Judge also found that the proposed cause of action for common counts is based on the same legal services rendered in the Forest Lawn Action.

The Judge's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court, and cites several cases to support its ruling. The Judge has ordered Plaintiff to file and serve the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the order.
