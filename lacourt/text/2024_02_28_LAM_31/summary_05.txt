Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration in a case involving Libra Securities Holdings, LLC and its CEO, Jess Ravich, suing Jennifer Robles for damages and injunctive relief. The judge is reviewing the language of the arbitration provision in the Employment Agreement and Release signed by Jess Ravich and Jennifer Robles, as well as the severability clause, to determine whether the parties clearly and unmistakably agreed to commit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. The judge finds that the language and ambiguity are virtually identical to that in a previous case, Parada v. Superior Court, and concludes that the delegation clause does not clearly and unmistakably reserve to the arbitrator the issue whether the agreement is enforceable. Therefore, the court must decide the enforceability of the arbitration agreement. The judge also notes that two matters require further briefing: (1) Robles' opportunity to respond to Ravich's declaration and exhibits, and (2) Plaintiffs' opportunity to respond to Robles' argument that they failed to initiate the arbitration with JAMs as required by recent case law.
