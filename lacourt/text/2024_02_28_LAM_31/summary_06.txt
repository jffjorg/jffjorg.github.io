And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the case and has decided to not consider the plaintiffs' sur-reply, which was filed late and without permission. The judge will consider the plaintiffs' reply and the declaration filed in support of it, as well as the opportunity for Robles to respond to the new evidence included in the reply. The judge also notes that Robles has challenged the enforceability of the delegation clause, contrary to the plaintiffs' contention that Robles did not do so. The judge will resolve this challenge and may consider the language of the agreement and the relevant laws and cases, such as Rent-A-Center and Parada, to guide their decision.
