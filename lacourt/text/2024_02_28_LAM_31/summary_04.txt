And here is a summary in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Navigators Insurance Company, the defendant/cross-complainant. The motion seeks an order permitting Navigators to interplead the sum of $7,500 from a Contractor's Bond and be discharged from liability. The motion also seeks to sever Navigators' Cross-Complaint for indemnity.

The court finds that Navigators is entitled to an order permitting the interpleading of the Bond funds because Navigators has incurred a claim arising out of the execution of the Bond and there are no further claims made against Navigators. The court also finds that severing Navigators' Cross-Complaint will be conducive to expedition and economy in handling the litigation.

The court grants Navigators' motion and orders that Navigators be permitted to interplead the Bond funds and be discharged from liability, and that Navigators' Cross-Complaint be severed from the instant action.
