 Case Number:  21STCV28372    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed by Defendant June Roberts, by and through
her Guardian Ad Litem, James Apted.
 
Tentative
The Demurrer is overruled.
Background
On August 2, 2021, Plaintiff Gary Gstohl (“Gstohl”) filed the complaint
in this action against June Roberts (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10, asserting
causes of action for strict liability, negligence, and premises liability,
arising out of a dog bite that occurred on March 22, 2021, when Gstohl was (he
alleges) on Defendant’s property to clean the pool.  Defendant filed
her answer on November 16, 2021.
Gstohl died on November 13,
2023.  
On March 12, 2024, the Court
issued an order for Linda Moye and Earl Gsthol (“Plaintiffs”) to continue this
action as be substituted for Gstohl and granting leave for Plaintiffs to file
an amended complaint.
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
In the FAC, Plaintiffs assert three causes of action: (1) a survival
claim for strict liability; (2) a survival claim and a wrongful death claim for
negligence; and (3) a survival claim for premises liability.
On April 16, 2024, Defendant, by and
through her Guardian Ad Litem, filed this Demurrer to the FAC, challenging the Second
Cause of Action for a wrongful death and survival claim based on
negligence.  Defendant also filed a
Request for Judicial Notice.  
 
Plaintiffs filed their opposition on May
24, and Defendant filed her reply on May 30.
 
Legal
Standard
A party may object to a pleading by demurrer
on the ground that (among other things) the pleading “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action,” the court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the person who filed the pleading “does not have the legal
capacity to sue,” or the pleading is “uncertain.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (a), (b),
(e), (f).)  
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
complaint or other pleading.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the Court accepts as true “all
material facts properly pleaded,” along with “matters that may be judicially
noticed.”  (Centinela Freeman
Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1 Cal.5th
994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court need not, however, accept the truth
of contentions or conclusions of law contained in the pleading.  (Centinela, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p.
1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)  
A demurrer may address only defects that appear on the face of
the pleading; other than judicially noticeable facts, no other extrinsic
evidence may be considered.  (Blank,
supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Guardian North
Bay, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.)
It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the
truthfulness of the properly pleaded allegations of the complaint.  The Court accepts as true “even improbable
alleged facts” as a demurrer is not the correct procedural posture to address
“plaintiff’s ability to prove the factual allegations.”  (Marina Pacific Hotel and Suites v.
Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 96, 104-105; accord Hacker
v. Homeward Residential (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280.)  
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading with a view to
substantial justice between the parties” and must “give the complaint a
reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Marina Pacific, supra, 81
Cal.App.5th at p. 105.)
A demurrer may be sustained only if it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
“When the ground of demurrer is based on a
matter of which the court may take judicial notice …, such matter shall be
specified in the demurrer, or in the supporting points and authorities for the
purpose of invoking such notice ….” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.70.)
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party
must meet and confer with the opposing party to determine “whether an agreement
can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a).)
Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendant
requests judicial notice of the following:
Exh. A. The First Amended Complaint.
Exh. B. Plaintiffs’ ex parte application for order
substituting Linda Moye and Earl Gstohl as successors-in-interest, including
the Death Certificate attached as Exhibit 1 thereto. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request
for judicial notice as these records are in the Court’s file.
 
Discussion
The meet and
confer requirement for this Demurrer is satisfied.  (Baurac Decl., ¶ 4.) 
Defendant demurs to the Second Cause of Action
on two grounds: that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action and that it is uncertain. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) & (f).)  
Does Not State Facts Sufficient to
Constitute a Cause of Action
In the Second Cause of Action, Plaintiffs
assert a survival and wrongful death claim for negligence.
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)  In a
complaint, a plaintiff need allege only the ultimate facts, not each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof.  (C.A. v. William S. Hart High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872; Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)  There are
sufficient allegations of each of these elements in the FAC to constitute a survival
cause of action for negligence.  (FAC, ¶¶ 1-3,
11-14, 20-23, 25-27.)
Turning now to the wrongful death cause of action
for negligence, “[t]he elements of a cause of action for wrongful death are a
tort, such as negligence, and resulting death.” (Lopez v. City of Los
Angeles (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 675, 685.)  Here, Plaintiffs allege the elements of
negligence, and they then allege that the dog bite at issue was a proximate cause of Gstohl’s death.  (FAC, ¶ 24.) 
The causation allegation is succinct, but causation
may be pleaded in general terms.  (Hoyem
v, Manhattan Beach City School Dist. (1978) 22 Cal.3d 508, 514.)
Plaintiffs question whether a dog bite in
March 2021 could have been a substantial factor in Gstohl’s death in November
2023.  But at the pleading stage, the
Court must accept the allegations in the FAC as true.  On demurrer, the Court is not concerned with
how likely it may or may not be that Plaintiffs will ultimately be able to
prove their allegations.  (Marina
Pacific, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105; Hacker, supra, 26
Cal.App.5th at p. 280.) 
Nor is the causation allegation disproven by any judicially
noticeable fact.  The Court may take
judicial notice of Gstohl’s death certificate, but not the truth of the matters
stated therein, and, in any event, the death certificate states that the cause
of action is “deferred.”  It is unclear
what that means, other than perhaps the person preparing the certificate was
unable to state the cause of death with any degree of certainty; that does not
preclude Plaintiffs from attempting to gather factual evidence to show proximate
causation in this litigation proceeding.
In sum, as a matter of pleading, the FAC states facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action for wrongful death.  The demurrer on this ground is OVERRULED.
Uncertain
 
Defendant also demurs on the ground that
the pleading is uncertain.  Demurrers for
uncertainty are “disfavored” and will be sustained “only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.”  (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors
(2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)  A
complaint need not be “a model of clarity” and must only contain sufficient
allegations to put the defendants on notice of the claims against them.  (Ibid.)  As the Court of Appeal has observed, “where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, … ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  
 
The FAC
is sufficiently certain to withstand a demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure
430.10, subdivision (f).  The FAC puts
Defendant on notice of the claim against her, and any uncertainty in the
pleading can be fully addressed through discovery.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer for uncertainty is OVERRULED.
 
Conclusion
The Court OVERRULES
Defendant’s Demurrer
Moving Party is ordered
to give notice.
