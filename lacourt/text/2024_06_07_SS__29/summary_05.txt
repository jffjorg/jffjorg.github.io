  - "The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's orders. It is not to punish."
  - "A discovery sanction should not create a 'windfall' for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court's orders and the Civil Discovery Act."

Here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted in part and denied in part Defendant Jason Fladlien's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Nancy Michelle Simon Perez. The Judge has denied Fladlien's request for an order to comply with a prior order, as one order is sufficient. The Judge has also denied Fladlien's request for terminating sanctions, as there is no showing of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser sanctions. The Judge has granted Fladlien's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,190, as Perez and her counsel have engaged in serious misuse of the discovery process that has caused Fladlien to incur expenses, including attorney's fees.
