And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Defendant argued that it had no duty to Plaintiff or any other invitee of the tenant, but the Judge found that there are disputed issues of fact. Specifically, the Judge found that the Defendant had a duty to inspect the premises to determine whether they were reasonably safe at the start of the tenancy and each time the lease was renewed. The Judge also found that the term "improvements" in the Lease Agreements includes the internal staircase at issue, which is a disputed issue that may require the introduction of parol evidence at trial.
