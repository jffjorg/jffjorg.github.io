 Case Number:  22STCV15599    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant Jason Fladlien’s Motion for Sanctions Against
Plaintiff Nancy Michelle Simon Perez
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted in part and denied in
part.
 
Background
 
These four consolidated cases
all arise out of a motor vehicle accident on January 1, 2021, near the
intersection of Sierra Highway and Golden Valley Road in Santa Clarita.
In Case No. 22STCV15599, on
May 10, 2022, Plaintiff Gary Trent Stephens filed his complaint against Jason
Fladien, Alexis Woodford, and Does 1 through 30. On October 17, 2021, Plaintiff
Stephens amended the complaint to name Molly Fladlien as Doe 1.
In Case No. 22CHCV01468, on
December 21, 2022, Nathan Pratt, a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem
Andrea Rocha, filed a complaint against Alexi Jean Woodford, Jason Fladlien,
Gary Trent Jong Sou Stephens, Nancy Michelle Simon Perez, and Does 1 through
100.
In Case No. 22CHCV01484, on
December 23, 2022, Nancy Michelle Simon Perez filed a complaint against Alexis
Jean Woodford, Jason Fladlein, and Does 1 through 20.
In Case No. 23CHCV02027, on
July 11, 2023, Elsa F. Martinez filed a complaint against Alexis J. Woodford, Jason
Fladlien, and Does 1 through 100.
On September 28, 2023, the four
cases were consolidated with 22STCV15599 as the lead case.
As it relates to this
motion, on June 6, 2023, Defendant Jason Fladlien (“Fladlien”)
served Plaintiff Nancy Michelle Simon Perez
(“Perez”) with Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Wilcoxson Decl., ¶ 5-8 & Exhs.
A-C.)  Perez never responded.  (Id., ¶¶ 9, 12.)
On March 19, 2024, the
Court granted Fladlien’s motion to compel and ordered Perez to respond to Requests
for Production (Set One) within 21 days of notice.  
 
On April 16, 2024, the
Court granted Fladlien’s motion to compel and ordered Perez to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 14 days
of notice.  As ordered by the Court, Fladlien
gave notice.  (Wilcoxson Decl., ¶ 14-18
& Exhs. E-F.)  
Perez did not comply with
these orders.
On May 7, 2024, Fladlien filed this motion for monetary
sanctions as well as issue, evidence, and terminating sanctions against Perez.  Fladlien also asks the Court to order Perez
to comply with a prior order.  
Perez filed an opposition that was timely served on May
24 but untimely filed on May 28.  In the
opposition, Perez reports that the discovery responses were (belatedly) served
on May 22.  (Bral Decl., ¶ 2.)
Fladlien filed a reply that was timely served on May 31
but untimely filed on June 3.
Legal Standard
When a party fails to obey a
court order compelling further responses to interrogatories or requests for
production, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction
under Chapter 7 ….  In lieu of, or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.300, subd. (e), 2031.310, subd. (i).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Action, section 2023.030,
subdivisions (a)-(d), authorizes monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence
sanctions, and terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is
a “misuse of the discovery process.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  In
section 2023.010, a “misuse of the discovery
process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act
provides for an escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York,
Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should
be appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater
sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant
incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb
the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions
should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p.
992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority
to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to
obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is
not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
The Court will exercise its discretion to
consider the timely served but untimely filed opposition and reply.
As a threshold matter, the Court DENIES Fladlien’s
request to order Perez to comply with the Court’s prior order.  One order is enough; an order to comply with
a prior order is not necessary. 
Moreover, it does appear that Perez has now (belatedly) provided the required
responses.
Moving
on to Fladlien’s other requests, Perez’s failure to provide the discovery
responses within the time period set forth in the Civil Discovery Act is a substantial
misuse of the discovery process.  Perez’s
failure to comply with the Court’s order to provide the discovery responses
within the time periods set forth in the orders is an additional substantial
misuse of the discovery process.  Serious
sanctions are warranted for this discovery abuse.  Moreover, Perez’s failures to comply with her
obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and this Court’s orders have
substantially slowed the progress of this case toward resolution.
For
terminating sanctions, however, a party must present evidence of repeated and
willful misuse of the discovery process, as well as evidence that less
severe sanctions have not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the
discovery rules.  Fladlien has not, on
this record at this time, made such a showing. 
There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions.  Fladlien’s request for
terminating sanctions is DENIED.
Fladlien’s
request for an evidence or issue sanction is also DENIED.  A discovery sanction should not create a
“windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have
been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the
Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, the requested non-monetary sanctions would create such a windfall for Fladlien.
Fladlien request for monetary sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a), section 2030.300, subdivision (e), and section 2031.310,
subdivision (i) is GRANTED.  Perez and
her counsel have engaged in serious misuse of the discovery process that had
caused Fladlien to incur expenses, including attorney’s fees.  Perez and her counsel have not acted with
substantial justification.  The
imposition of sanctions on Perez and her counsel would not be unjust.
The Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $1,190, calculated based on 6 hours of attorney
time, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $195 per hour, plus a $20 filing
fee.  (Wilcoxson Decl., ¶¶ 19-20.)
Having imposed this monetary sanction under
the Civil Discovery Act, the Court exercises its discretion at this time to
decline to impose an additional monetary sanction, payable to the Court, for
the violation of the Court’s prior orders.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
Defendant Jason Fladlien’s requests for an order to comply with a prior order,
for a terminating sanction, for an issue sanction, for an evidence sanction,
and for a sanction or penalty payable to the Court.
The Court GRANTS
Defendant Jason Fladlien’s request for a monetary sanction. 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Nancy Michelle
Simon Perez and her counsel of record, Bral & Associates, jointly and
severally, to pay Defendant Jason Fladlien monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act in the amount of $1,190 within 30 days of notice.
Moving Party is
ordered to give notice.
