Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to continue the trial. The plaintiffs, Maria Botham, Georgia Botham, and Lucia Botham, filed a complaint against the defendants, including Josue Alcaraz, the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, the State of California, and others. The plaintiffs amended the complaint and filed a First Amended Complaint. The court previously dismissed the County and State without prejudice, and Alcaraz with prejudice. The plaintiffs now request a trial continuance, citing that the City of Los Angeles has yet to respond to the First Amended Complaint. The judge finds that good cause has been shown for the continuance and grants the motion. The trial date is continued to a date on or after January 14, 2025, and the Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset accordingly.
