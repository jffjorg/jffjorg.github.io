```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The motions to compel further responses to discovery are denied. The motions are untimely, as they were filed months ago and the hearing date is too close to the trial. Additionally, there has been no Informal Discovery Conference, which is a required step in the discovery process. The defendant failed to seek an earlier hearing date or schedule an Informal Discovery Conference, which has resulted in the denial of the motions.
