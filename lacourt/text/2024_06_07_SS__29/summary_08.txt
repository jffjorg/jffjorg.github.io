Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for an order deeming the plaintiff's responses to requests for admission as true. The defendant served the requests for admission on March 15, 2024, and the plaintiff did not respond. The judge finds that the plaintiff waived all objections by not responding to the requests for admission. The judge also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $412.50, which is calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work and a reasonable billing rate of $235.00 per hour. The judge orders the plaintiff to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice.
