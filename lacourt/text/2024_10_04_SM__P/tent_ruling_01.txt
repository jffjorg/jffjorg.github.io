Utica Leaseco v. Hicks, et al, Case
no. 22SMCV02025
Hearing date October 4, 2024
Defendant
Apex Solutions’ Motion to Quash Second Service of Summons and Complaint
Defendant Apex Solutions’ Motion to Vacate Default
Plaintiff
Florida company Utica Leaseco sues defendants Apex Solutions, Benson and Hicks
for breach of a lease agreement. Defendant Apex moves to quash service of
summons and complaint and to set aside default. The court previously granted
defendants Benson and Hicks’ motions to quash service and set aside default.
Plaintiff opposes defendant Apex’s motions.
 
Defendant Apex’s Motion to Quash
Second Service of Summons
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: To quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(a)(1). Where service is challenged, the burden is on
plaintiff to prove effective service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s
personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’” Summers v.
McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also Lebel
v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.
However,
filing of a proof of service that complies with statutory standards creates a
rebuttable presumption that service was proper. See Dill v.
Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-42; see also Floveyor
Int’l. Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795; Evid.
Code sec. 647. “[A] sworn return of service of a summons may be impeached by
evidence that contradicts it.” City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951)
105 Cal.App.2d 726, 731.
Plaintiff
argues defendant Apex is a suspended corporation, so its motion must be denied
because it cannot appear in court to defend itself. Rev. and Tax Code §23301.
While Apex cannot sue or defend itself generally, it receives the same
protections of proper service as any other party. The court cannot exercise
jurisdiction over a party if it is not properly served, suspended or not.
 
Plaintiff
filed three proofs of substitute service on defendant Apex. The first service
occurred on November 28 and December 27, 2022. The second service occurred on
April 14, 2024, via service on “John Doe” Benson, which plaintiff alleges is
defendant Benson and which defendants deny. 
 
The
court has already heard from and agreed with defendant Benson that the April 14
service was ineffective. Specifically, defendant Benson successfully rebutted
the presumption of proper service by offering his own declaration stating he
was not at home on the day of alleged service, and no other men with the name
“Benson” were present at his property. Decl. Benson para. 3.
 
Defendant
Benson is the acknowledged agent for service of process for defendant Apex.
Decl. Benson para. 1. For plaintiff’s second service on defendant Apex to have
been successful, it would have had to have been served on defendant Benson.
Plaintiff asserts they did serve defendant Apex via defendant Benson on the
same April 14, 2024 service. Decl. Martinez para. 5. Therefore, if defendant
Benson was not properly served on April 14, then neither was defendant Apex.
 
Plaintiff
argues that even if service on defendant Apex was not effective on April 14,
2024, it subsequently served defendant Apex a third time via registered process
server on September 10, 2024. Plaintiffs therefore argue they cured any service
issues related to defendant Apex,and so the motion should be denied. Plaintiff
is incorrect, however, as defendant Apex is moving to quash the prior service
and its related default. 
 
If
the prior service and its subsequent default were faulty, plaintiff cannot cure
that issue after the fact with an effective service. Defendant Benson has
successfully rebutted the presumption of effective service on April 14, 2024.
Therefore, so too has defendant Apex. GRANTED.
 
Defendant Apex’s Motion to Vacate
Default
"The
court ... may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set
aside any void judgment or order." Code Civ. Proc. §473(d). “'[C]ompliance
with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction. [Citation.] Thus, a default judgment entered against a
defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute
is void.'" Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540,
544.
 
Default
against defendant Apex was entered January 10, 2023 pursuant to the first
service of November 28 and December 27, 2022. Defendant Apex was served via
substituted service on defendant Benson, which the court ruled was not
effective. If a default is entered against a defendant that was not properly
served, that default is void. Plaintiff subsequently served defendant Apex a
third time on September 10, 2024 in an attempt to cure previous service issues.
This third service cannot cure the fact that the default was entered prior to
that successful third service against defendant Apex, however, and as such is
void.
 
Furthermore,
California has a strong preference for resolving issues on their merits instead
of through default judgements. This public policy, coupled with the fact that
the default is void, means the court must GRANT defendant Apex’s motion to set
aside the default. .
