Here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by defendants Apex Solutions, Benson, and Hicks. Apex Solutions has moved to quash service of summons and complaint, and to vacate the default judgment entered against it. The judge has granted Apex Solutions' motion to quash service of summons. The judge found that the second service of summons on April 14, 2024, was ineffective because defendant Benson successfully rebutted the presumption of proper service. The judge also found that the third service of summons on September 10, 2024, cannot cure the fact that the default judgment was entered prior to that service.

The judge has also granted Apex Solutions' motion to vacate the default judgment. The judge found that the default judgment was entered against a defendant who was not properly served, and that California has a strong preference for resolving issues on their merits instead of through default judgments.
