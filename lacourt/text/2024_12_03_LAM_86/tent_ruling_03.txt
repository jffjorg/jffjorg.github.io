SECTION 800

Case:                           Jason Paul Catino v. Department
of Motor Vehicles (23STCP04618)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Jason Paul Catino’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Under Government Code Section 800 is GRANTED.
 
On 8/15/24, the Court granted petitioner’s petition to set
aside an order suspending his driving privileges on the ground that the Hearing
Officer acted as advocate and finder of fact during the administrative hearing,
in violation of the holding in California DUI Lawyers Assn. v. Department of
Motor Vehicles (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 517 (“CDLA II”). The Court
found that petitioner was entitled to a new hearing. (8/15/24 Ruling at 7.) Petitioner
now moves for an award of $5,250 in attorney fees pursuant to Government Code §
800.
 
Government Code § 800(a) states, in relevant part: “In any
civil action to appeal or review the award, finding, or other determination of
any administrative proceeding under this code or under any other provision of
state law…if it is shown that the award, finding, or other determination of the
proceeding was the result of arbitrary or capricious action or conduct by a
public entity or an officer thereof in his or her official capacity, the
complainant if he or she prevails in the civil action may collect from the
public entity reasonable attorney’s fees, computed at one hundred dollars
($100) per hour, but not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars
($7,500), if he or she is personally obligated to pay the fees in addition to
any other relief granted or other costs awarded.” 
 
For the purposes of section 800, “arbitrary or capricious” “encompasses
conduct not supported by a fair or substantial reason [citation], a stubborn
insistence on following unauthorized conduct [citation], or a bad faith legal
dispute [citation].” (Halaco Engineering Co. v. South Central Coast Regional
Com. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 52, 79.) “Attorney fees will not be awarded simply
because the agency's action was erroneous, or even ‘clearly erroneous.’
[Citation].” (Gilliland v. Medical Bd. of California (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th
208, 220-21.) 
 
The Court finds that the administrative proceeding leading
to the decision to suspend petitioner’s driving privileges was the result of
arbitrary or capricious action by the Hearing Officer for respondent Department
of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”). During the hearing, the Hearing Officer asked
witness Shahrzad Arbab, whose vehicle petitioner rear-ended, if she had any
physical documents evidencing the estimated damages to her vehicle. (8/15/24
Ruling at 6, citing AR 26.) Arbab responded no. (8/15/24 Ruling at 6, citing AR
26.) The Hearing Officer asked Arbab to contact her attorney to obtain
documents evidencing the estimated damages and then continued the hearing. (8/15/24
Ruling at 6, citing AR 26, 31, 34-35.) 
 
When Arbab asked if the Hearing Officer wanted her
attorney’s telephone number, the Hearing Officer stated that she could not call
the attorney. (8/15/24 Ruling at 6, citing AR 26.) The Hearing Officer appears
to have been aware that a line separated her capacity as an adjudicator and an
advocate, which she attempted not to cross by having the witness obtain the
necessary evidence. Nevertheless, by eliciting additional evidence,
specifically evidence necessary to establish the jurisdictional requirement of more
than $1,000 in damage to Arbab’s vehicle (Veh. Code § 16000(a)), the Hearing
Officer impermissibly acted as advocate in addition to adjudicator.
 
The hearing was held on November 15, 2023, and November 21,
2023. (8/15/24 Ruling at 2-3.) The California Supreme Court deemed CDLA II
final on July 20, 2022. Despite having known that its hearing officers could
not act as advocates and adjudicators (CDLA II, 77 Cal.App.5th at 538),
the DMV, by way of its Hearing Officer, ignored that ruling, instead arguing
that hearing officers may collect and develop evidence. (8/15/24 Ruling at 6.)
Indeed, in opposition to the instant motion, the DMV maintains that its hearing
officers may develop the facts and collect evidence. (Opp. at 8-9, citing CDLA
II, 77 Cal.App.th at 533, fn. 5 and Knudsen v. Department of Motor
Vehicles (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 186, 193.) The DMV thus demonstrated and
continues to demonstrate “a stubborn insistence on following unauthorized
conduct” during the administrative hearing, which qualifies as arbitrary and
capricious conduct under Government Code § 800(a). (Halaco Engineering,
42 Cal.3d at 79.) 
 
The DMV asserts that it changed its Driver Safety Manual, training,
and procedures to reflect CDLA II’s holding that hearing officers are to
act as neutral triers of fact. (Dill Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.) The DMV also asserts that
the Hearing Officer was trained not to advocate on the DMV’s behalf. (Dill
Decl. ¶ 5.) Yet, as discussed above, its Hearing Officer acted as both advocate
and adjudicator notwithstanding any such purported training, which evidently is
far from sufficient to address the ongoing arbitrary and capricious actions of
DMV hearing officers acting contrary to established law.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the suspension
of petitioner’s driving privileges resulted from arbitrary and capricious
conduct. Accordingly, the motion for attorney fees is GRANTED. 
 
Petitioner is legally obligated to pay for his counsel’s
work. (Gould Decl. ¶ 2.) Respondent did not dispute the reasonableness of
petitioner’s request for fees. Pursuant to Government Code § 800(a) and based
on counsel for petitioner’s declaration, the Court finds that petitioner is
entitled to an award of $5,250 in fees, based on 52.5 hours of work at $100 per
hour. (Gould Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)
