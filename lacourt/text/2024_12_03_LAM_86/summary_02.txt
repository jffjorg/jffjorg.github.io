And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the petitioner claims they did not understand that waiving notice of an order would mean they would not receive the briefing schedule in their post office box. The judge is citing case law to argue that the petitioner is held to the same standard as an attorney and must know the effect of waiving notice after a hearing. The judge is suggesting that the petitioner's claim of not understanding the consequences of waiving notice is not valid, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 1019.5 and several court cases. The judge is indicating that the petitioner's argument is flawed and that they are responsible for knowing the effect of their actions.
