[1]           Petitioner claims he did not understand that, by waiving
notice, he would not receive the briefing schedule in his post office box.
(Reply at 6:9-11.) Code of Civil Procedure “section 1019.5 specifically
recognizes that one acquires knowledge of the order by being present when it is
announced. One cannot waive notice of the order…then claim no knowledge of the
order for the reason he was not given the very notice he had waived.” (In re
Imperial Ins. Co. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 290, 301.) Even though petitioner
is self-represented, he is held to the same standard as an attorney, including
knowing the effect of waiving notice after a hearing. (Kobayashi v. Superior
Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543, citing Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 985.)
