As for the summary text, here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the petitioner's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $5,250. The petitioner, Jason Paul Catino, had his driving privileges suspended after an administrative hearing, which the court found was conducted in a way that was arbitrary and capricious. The hearing officer acted as both an advocate and an adjudicator, eliciting additional evidence and ignoring the California Supreme Court's ruling in CDLA II. The court found that the DMV's actions were a "stubborn insistence on following unauthorized conduct" and thus qualifies as arbitrary and capricious conduct under Government Code § 800(a).
