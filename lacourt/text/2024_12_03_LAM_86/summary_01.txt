And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for writ of mandate brought by Mark Williams, Executive Director of Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles (CCSCLA). The petition seeks to regain control of CCSCLA and its property, including keys, computer passwords, and bank accounts, from Respondent Noreen McClendon, who is a Board member of CCSCLA. The petition also seeks to enjoin Respondent from evicting tenants from an affordable housing complex operated by CCSCLA.

The judge found that Petitioner failed to meet his burden of proof by failing to file an opening brief and lodge a record in support of his claims. The judge also declined to consider Petitioner's untimely filed opening brief and noted that Petitioner bears the burden of proof in a mandate proceeding.

The judge concluded that Petitioner's petition is denied due to his failure to demonstrate any entitlement to the relief he seeks. The judge emphasized that a trial court has broad discretion to refuse to consider late-filed papers and that a reviewing court will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal.
