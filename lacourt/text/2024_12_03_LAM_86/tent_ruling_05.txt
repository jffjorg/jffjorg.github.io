[1]           The pleadings and minute orders refer
to petitioner as plaintiff and respondent as defendant. As Stoppelman is
seeking a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5, he is
referred to herein as petitioner, and the Appeals Board is referred to as
respondent. (See CCP § 1094.5.) 


[2]           The Court notes respondent’s
contention that petitioner’s opening brief did not cite the administrative
record or contain any factual allegations, legal analysis, or references to the
underlying decision that should be overturned. (Opp. at 4:21-28.) The opening
brief contains petitioner’s principal contentions concerning his entitlement to
federal pandemic unemployment compensation and income that was not considered
during the administrative hearing. The Court resolves these issues on the
merits. 


[3]           During the administrative hearing, petitioner also sought
to backdate his claim to April 2021, when he purportedly tried to file his
claim. (AR 20-21 [HT 9:14-10:8], 23.) Based on a backdated claim date of April
2021, plaintiff sought to have $500 earned in 2019 considered as wages. (AR 20
[HT 9:6-16].) Petitioner did not address this contention in the opening brief
or reply. The Court
cannot evaluate arguments that are not made in the briefs and cannot make
petitioner’s arguments for him. (Nelson v. Avondale HOA (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 857, 862-63 [argument waived if not raised]; Pfeifer v.
Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].)
Accordingly, the Court does not consider any wages earned in 2019.
