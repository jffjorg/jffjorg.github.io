[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



            Petitioner Mark Williams petitions
for writ of mandate directing respondent Noreen McClendon turn over property of
non-profit organization Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles
(“CCSCLA”), including keys, computer passwords, and bank accounts to legitimate
CCSCLA Board authority. Petitioner also seeks an order enjoining respondent
from evicting tenants of an CCSCLA affordable housing complex.
 
I.       Factual Allegations
 
            This
proceeding concerns control over Concerned
Citizens of South Central Los Angeles, a nonprofit public benefit corporation that
seeks to “promote social and economic empowerment, environmental justice,
educational advance [sic], political equity, principled prison reform, and the
general welfare in South Central Los Angeles, California and beyond.” (First
Amended Petition (“FAP”) ¶¶ 1, 6.)  The
First Amended Petition alleges as follows: 
 
Petitioner
Mark Williams is the Executive Director of CCSCLA. (FAP ¶¶ 1, 15.) Petitioner
was also a CCSCLA founding Board member. (FAP ¶ 8.) In 2018, petitioner
demanded a financial audit of CCSCLA pursuant to the Bylaws. (FAP ¶ 8.)
Petitioner did not receive any audit. (FAP ¶ 8.) Instead, respondent Noreen
McClendon and the other Board members voted petitioner off the Board, locked
him out of the CCSCLA business office, and terminated his 29-year employment as
a resident manager for an affordable housing building operated by CCSCLA. (FAP
¶ 8.) 
 
In
2023, community and organization stakeholders voted in a new Board, which
appointed petitioner as Executive Director. (FAP ¶¶ 13, 15.) Respondent refuses
to recognize the reconstituted Board’s authority. (FAP ¶¶ 16, 34.) Respondent refuses
to return CCSCLA’s keys, property, and computer passwords. (FAP ¶¶ 17, 34.)
Respondent accesses organizational bank accounts and uses CCSCLA’s resources
without authority. (FAP ¶ 18.) Respondent is allegedly operating CCSCLA for her
personal benefit, including by redirecting millions of dollars to her personal
friends and associates. (FAP ¶¶ 7, 12.) 
 
Respondent
has also allowed CCSCLA’s affordable housing complexes to fall into disrepair.
(FAP ¶ 19.) Respondent is attempting to evict tenants from an affordable
housing complex operated by CCSCLA without cause or authority. (FAP ¶¶ 20-22,
35.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
May 17, 2023, petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate. On March 28, 2024,
petitioner filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate. On May 21, 2024,
respondent filed an answer to the first amended petition. 
 
            On
June 6, 2023, the Court set the hearing on the writ petition for December 3,
2024. (12/6/24 Minute Order.) The Court ordered petitioner’s opening brief to
be filed sixty days prior to the hearing date, i.e., October 4, 2024. 
 
            No
opening brief was filed. On November 4, 2024, respondent filed an opposition.
On November 21, 2024, petitioner filed a reply to the opposition.  Four days later, on November 25, 2024,
petitioner filed “Petitioners Opening Trial Brief.” 
 
III.     Analysis
 
Petitioner
refers to CCP § 1085 in the operative First Amended Petition. (FAP at 1:16.) “There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.) “The
petitioner always bears the burden of proof in a mandate proceeding brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.” (California Correctional Peace
Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)
 
A
memorandum of points and authorities is required for a noticed motion,
including for mandamus. (See California Rules of Court (“CRC”)
3.1113(a); Local Rule 3.231(b) [describing noticed motion procedure for
prerogative writs].) The absence of a memorandum is an admission that the
motion or petition is not meritorious and may be denied. (CRC 3.1113(a).) 
 
On
June 6, 2024, the Court held a trial setting conference. (6/6/24 Minute Order.)
The Court ordered petitioner to serve and file the opening brief 60 days prior
to the hearing date of December 3, 2024. (Ibid.) Petitioner was ordered
to lodge the record on the same day the reply brief was filed. (Ibid.)  Petitioner was present during the trial
setting conference on June 6, 2024, where the deadline to file an opening brief
was set. (Ibid.) Petitioner also waived notice of the briefing schedule.[1]
(Ibid.) 
 
Despite
having been ordered to file his opening brief and the record in accordance with
the schedule set by the Court, petitioner failed to timely file his opening
brief.  Moreover, petitioner has filed no
record to support his claims, timely or otherwise. Petitioner has thus failed
to meet his burden to demonstrate how he is entitled to an order for respondent
to turn over CCSCLA property or stop eviction proceedings. (Prayer for Relief
¶¶ 39, 40.)
 
Rather,
in response to the opposition brief in which respondent pointed out that
petitioner did not meet his burden by failing to file an opening brief (Opp. at
3-4), petitioner filed a reply brief in which he sought leave until November
24, 2024 to file an opening brief. (Reply at 6.) Petitioner, however, presented
no good cause for an extension of the deadline to file an opening brief and offered
no meaningful explanation for having failed to seek an extension earlier.
 
Furthermore,
without leave of Court, petitioner untimely filed “Petitioners Opening Trial
Brief” on November 25, 2024, which still fell after the extended deadline petitioner
sought.  Under the circumstances, the
Court declines to consider the untimely opening brief.  “A trial court has broad discretion under
rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules of Court to refuse to consider papers served and
filed beyond the deadline without a prior court order finding good cause for
late submission.” (Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 755,
765; see also CRC 3.1300(d) [“If the court, in its discretion, refuses to
consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate”].)
In
any event, the untimely opening brief would not change the outcome.  The “Petitioners Opening Trial Brief” does
not meaningfully cite to or discuss any pertinent legal authority, does not
cite to any record evidence to support petitioner’s claims, and largely argues
that respondent has failed to produce evidence (see Opening Br. at 6-8),
even though petitioner bears the burden. 
An opening brief “must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement
of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes,
cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (See CRC
3.1113(b).)  Rule of Court 3.1113 “rests
on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing the trial court from
being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party’s theories”. (Quantum
Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927,
934.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal
and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the
record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox
v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) The Court cannot evaluate
arguments that are not made in the briefs and cannot make the parties’
arguments for them. (Nelson v. Avondale HOA (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857,
862-63 [argument waived if not raised]; Pfeifer v. Countrywide Home Loans,
Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].)
 
For
all of the foregoing reasons, petitioner fails to meet his burden to
demonstrate any entitlement to the relief he seeks.
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED.
