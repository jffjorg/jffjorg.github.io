And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Stoppelman against the Appeals Board. Stoppelman is seeking a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1094.5, challenging an administrative decision. The judge notes that Stoppelman's opening brief did not cite the administrative record or contain factual allegations, legal analysis, or references to the underlying decision that should be overturned. The judge has resolved the issues on the merits. Stoppelman also sought to backdate his claim to April 2021, when he purportedly tried to file his claim, and sought to have $500 earned in 2019 considered as wages. However, the judge cannot evaluate arguments that are not made in the briefs and cannot make Stoppelman's arguments for him. Therefore, the judge does not consider any wages earned in 2019.
