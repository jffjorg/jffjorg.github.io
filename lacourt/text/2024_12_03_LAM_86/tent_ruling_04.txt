Respondent.
 







 

 



 


 


 


 

 


Plaintiff
David Stoppelman petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent California
Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board to set aside its decision affirming the
denial of unemployment benefits and grant unemployment benefits to petitioner. 
 
I.       Factual
Background
 
            On
5/1/22, petitioner filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits. (AR 2, 20
[HT 9:17-19].) Based on a standard base period from 1/1/21 to 12/31/21 or an alternate
base period from 4/1/21 to 3/31/22, the Employment Development Department (“EDD”)
determined that petitioner did not earn enough wages to establish a valid claim
for benefits. (AR 2.) 
 
Petitioner appealed EDD’s determination. (AR 3, 5.)
On 12/6/22, Administrative Law Judge Nathaniel B. Fellner (“ALJ”) conducted a
hearing regarding whether EDD properly computed petitioner’s benefit award. (AR
10, 13 [HT 2:4-5], 40.) The ALJ admitted into evidence a pay stub from David A.
Lazar Accounting Corporation (“Lazar”) dated 10/7/20 showing $114 in wages
earned. (AR 14 [HT 3:6-8], 17 [HT 6:11-14], 19 [HT 8:4-5], 33.) Petitioner
also sought to have a settlement received in connection with the termination of
his employment considered as part of his wages. (AR 18 [HT 7:6:9].) Petitioner
also asserted that he was entitled to $400 more a week under the American
Rescue Plan Act even if his wages were computed as zero. (AR 17 [HT 6:23-25],
21 [HT 10:15-17].) 
 
On 1/12/23, the ALJ affirmed EDD’s determination,
finding that petitioner did not earn sufficient wages during the relevant time
periods to receive unemployment insurance benefits. (AR 42-44.) Petitioner
appealed the decision of the ALJ to respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board (“Appeals Board”). (AR 50.) On 3/9/23, finding no errors in the ALJ’s statement
of issues, findings of fact, or application of law to the facts, respondent
affirmed the decision of the ALJ denying unemployment benefits to petitioner. (AR
60-62.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
March 23, 2023, petitioner filed a Complaint. On May 23, 2023, petitioner filed
a First Amended Petition for writ of mandate. On August 9, 2023, the Court
(Hon. Malcolm Mackey) sustained respondent’s demurrer with leave to amend.[1] (8/9/23
Minute Order.) On August 23, 2023, petitioner filed a Second Amended Petition
for writ of mandate. 
 
On March 14, 2024, during a status conference, respondent,
by way of counsel, represented that petitioner sued the wrong entity. (See Second
Amended Petition [EDD named as respondent].) (3/14/24 Minute Order.) The Court
(Hon. Alison Mackenzie) ordered the parties to meet and confer to ensure that
the correct entity was sued. 
 
On March 19, 2024, petitioner filed the operative
Third Amended Petition (“TAP”) for writ of mandate naming the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board as respondent. On April 30, 2024, respondent filed an Answer to the Third
Amended Petition. 
 
On March 28, 2024, petitioner filed an opening
brief. On April 30, 2024, respondent filed an opposition. On May 13, 2024, petitioner
filed a reply. On February 28, 2024, petition filed an administrative record,
titled “Exhibit List.” 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial
abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the agency has
not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not supported by
the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence. (CCP §
1094.5(b).)
 
The Court exercises its
independent judgment in reviewing denials of applications for public
assistance. (See Norasingh v. Lightbourne (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 740,
752.) Under the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines
the administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.” (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) The court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) 
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The
interpretation of statute or regulation is a question of law. (See State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
As
a preliminary matter, while petitioner represents himself in this proceeding,
he is held to the same procedural standards as an attorney. “Under the law, a
party may choose to act as his or her own attorney. [Citations.] ‘[S]uch a
party is to be treated like any other party and is entitled to the same, but no
greater consideration than other litigants and attorneys. [Citation.]’
[Citation.] Thus, as is the case with attorneys, pro. per. litigants must
follow correct rules of procedure.” (Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th
1229, 1246-47.) “[M]ere self-representation is not a ground for exceptionally
lenient treatment.” (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 984.)
 
            The critical issue presented in the
operative Third Amended Petition is whether petitioner established his
entitlement to unemployment insurance benefits from his 5/1/22 claim. An
applicant is not entitled to benefits unless, during the applicant’s base
period, the applicant has either (1) been paid at least $1,300 in the base
period quarter in which the applicant’s wages were the highest or (2) been paid
at least $900 in the base period quarter in which the applicant’s wages were
the highest and been paid a total of least 1.25 times the amount of wages paid
during this same quarter during the entire base period. (Unemp. Ins. Code §
1281(a).) 
 
            Petitioner sought to have benefits beginning
on 5/1/22. (AR 2.) The standard base period for benefit years beginning in
April, May, or June is the four calendar quarters ending from the preceding
December. (Unemp. Ins. Code § 1275(a).) If the applicant cannot establish a
valid claim under the standard base period, the applicant may attempt to
establish a valid claim under an alternate base period. (Unemp. Ins. Code §
1275(b).) The alternate base period for benefit years beginning in April, May,
or June is the four calendar quarters ending from the preceding March. (Unemp.
Ins. Code § 1275(b).)
 
            Based on the foregoing, the relevant
time periods are 1/1/21 to 12/31/21 for the standard base period or
4/1/21 to 3/31/22 for the alternate base period. (See also AR 2.) During
the administrative proceedings, the only evidence of wages that petitioner
provided was a pay stub dated 10/7/20 reflecting that petitioner had been paid
a total of $114 during the year 2020. (AR 33.) This pay stub is outside the
standard base period or the alternate base period. Consequently, the pay stub
is not pertinent to—and certainly does not establish—petitioner’s eligibility
for unemployment insurance benefits. 
 
            In
the opening brief, petitioner refers to a check dated 1/6/22 in the amount of
$9,000, which was issued to petitioner by Lazar and Company.[2]
The check was attached as Exhibit A to the opening brief. Petitioner contends
that the $9,000 should have been counted as income during the administrative
proceedings. (Opening Br. at 3:6-9.) 
 
While the date of the 1/6/22 check is within the
alternate base period, the check was not part of the administrative record. “In an administrative mandamus
action, judicial review is limited to matters in the administrative record.
Additional evidence is admissible only if it was not available at the time of
the administrative hearing or was excluded improperly from the record.” (Evans
v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 958, 977, citing Code
Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(e).) In the opening brief, petitioner contends that
extra-record evidence demonstrating the unfairness of the proceeding can be
admitted. (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court (1995) 9
Cal.4th 559, 575, fn. 5 [courts could admit extra-record evidence relevant to
procedural unfairness].)  Here, the
administrative hearing took place on 12/6/22 (AR 10), which was after the date
of the 1/6/22 check.  Petitioner thus appears
to have been able to present the $9,000 check during the administrative hearing.
Petitioner does not explain why he did not do so. Consequently, the Court may
not consider the check. 
 
            Even if the Court were to consider
the check, petitioner stated during the hearing that he received a settlement
from Lazar after he was fired. (AR 18 [HT 7:6:9].) Dismissal and severance pay
does not count as wages under the Unemployment Insurance Code. (Powell v.
California Dept. of Employment (1965) 63 Cal.2d 103, 109.) In the reply,
petitioner asserts that $2,000 of the $9,000 check constituted wages, with the remainder
constituting severance pay. (Reply at 2:16-17.) Petitioner’s assertion is supported
by no evidence either within or outside of the administrative record. Unlike,
for example, the 10/7/20 check contained in the record, the check attached to
the opening brief contains no indication that any portion of the $9,000 check
constituted wages. (Compare Ex. A to Opening Br. with AR 33 [$114
in wages earned].) Accordingly, petitioner does not meet his burden to
demonstrate that the ALJ’s finding that petitioner’s claim was invalid was
contrary to the weight of the evidence.[3]
(Fukuda,
20 Cal.4th at 817.)
 
            Petitioner also argues that he is
entitled to Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (“FPUC”) under the
American Rescue Plan Act. (See 15 U.S.C. § 9023.) Specifically,
petitioner asks for $600 per week for 3 years, totaling $86,400. (Opening Br.
at 2:11-12.) For weeks of unemployment beginning after December 26, 2020 and
ending on or before September 6, 2021, applicants seeking unemployment benefits could
receive $300 per week (not the $600 per week sought by petitioner) on top of
any payments under state law. (15 U.S.C. § 9023(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(3)(A)(ii).)

 
Contrary
to respondent’s contention, petitioner raised this issue before the ALJ. (AR
17 [HT 6:23-25], 21 [HT 10:15-17].) Petitioner was also not required to be
eligible for unemployment benefits under state law to receive FPUC. The statute
only provides that FPUC payments are “additional” to the amount of benefits
under state law. (15 U.S.C. § 9023(b)(1)(B).) For the reasons stated above, the
amount of unemployment benefits to which petitioner is entitled under state law
is $0, but petitioner may have still been entitled to $300 per week on top of
the “zero” state unemployment benefits. (See Questions and Answers:
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) Program, located at
https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/UIPL/2020/UIPL_16-20_Change_1_Attachment_1.pdf
at I-3 [unlike monetary requirements under regular unemployment compensation, “There
is no minimum monetary requirement for an individual to be eligible for PUA”].)

 
Nevertheless, an individual is not eligible for FPUC
unless the unemployment was caused by COVID-19. (15 U.S.C. § 9021(c)(1)(A),
(a)(3)(A)(ii)(I).) During the hearing, petitioner admitted that he was fired. (AR
18 [HT 7:6-7]; see also AR 24, 30, 36 [misconduct noted in claim file].)
The record does not contain any indication that petitioner’s employment with
Lazar ended due to COVID-19. Accordingly, petitioner does not demonstrate that
he was entitled to any FPUC. 
 
            Because petitioner’s contentions raised
in the opening brief and reply regarding the sufficiency of his wages during
the base periods and his entitlement to FPUC are without merit, the Court need
not reach respondent’s contention concerning whether Lazar is an indispensable
party. For the foregoing reasons, petitioner fails to demonstrate that
respondent’s adoption of the ALJ’s decision was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondent California Unemployment
Insurance Appeals Board shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a
proposed judgment.
