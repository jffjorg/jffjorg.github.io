And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the City of Los Angeles's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the complaint filed by Sarah Kohan Darvish (Kohan Darvish) on the grounds that plaintiff failed to comply with the claims presentation requirement under the California Tort Claims Act. The judge found that Kohan Darvish did not plead compliance with the claims presentation requirement anywhere in the first amended complaint and that the City submitted a declaration from Michael Valdivia, a Deputy City Clerk, stating that Kohan Darvish did not serve a claim for damages. The judge also found that Kohan Darvish's claim for loss of consortium accrued on November 6, 2022, and that her time to file a claim expired on May 6, 2023, and that she did not timely remedy the claims presentation issue. Therefore, the motion is granted, but with 30 days leave to amend.
