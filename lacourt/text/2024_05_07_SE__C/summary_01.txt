And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is to continue the motion to set aside default to May 21, 2024. The defendants, Affluent Staffing, LLC and Office Chairs, Inc., filed a motion to set aside default claiming mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect under CCP § 473(b). The judge notes that the defendants did not receive notice of the February 13, 2024 minute order, which resulted in default. However, the judge is inclined to find that default was entered as a surprise to the defendants. Despite this, the judge is not granting the motion at this time because the defendants have not attached a proposed answer or other responsive pleading to their motion. The judge is ordering the defendants to file and serve a proposed answer or other responsive pleading within 5 days.
