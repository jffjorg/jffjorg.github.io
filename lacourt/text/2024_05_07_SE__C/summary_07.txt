And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the complaint brought by Express Restoration Corp. (Plaintiff) against Jasmin Xu (Defendant). The Plaintiff performed work on Defendant's property between March 31, 2023, and April 12, 2023, and is seeking compensation for the work performed. The Defendant demurred to the complaint on the grounds that the Plaintiff was not licensed to perform the work, that the contract is unenforceable, and that the Plaintiff lacks capacity to sue due to the mechanic's lien not being timely filed and properly served. The court granted judicial notice of Plaintiff's verified certificate of licensure and the Contractor's State License Board's License Detail for Plaintiff. The court found that the Plaintiff was not licensed at all times and is therefore barred from seeking compensation. The court sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend.
