Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Noemi Garza’s request for a Preliminary
Injunction is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff Noemi Garza (“Plaintiff”) and Defendant Marko
Kosta (“Defendant”) were formerly in a dating relationship.  The Complaint alleges that Defendant told
Plaintiff he would purchase a car for her in his name and she could make payments.
(Id., ¶ 17.) On or about November 3, 2019, Defendant purchased a 2020
Land Rover Evoque in his name with a down payment of $40,000 and financed the
balance. (Id., ¶¶ 18-19.) On or about December 16, 2019, Plaintiff
repaid Defendant for the down payment with a $40,000 check. (Id., ¶ 21.)
Plaintiff made the payments on the VEHICLE except when Defendant was living in
Plaintiff’s home or when Defendant prevented Plaintiff from making payments. (Id.,
¶ 22.) When Defendant moved out of Plaintiff’s home, he left the VEHICLE with
Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 23.) On or about April 2021, Defendant changed the
delivery address for the loan statements so that Plaintiff could no longer
access them. (Id., ¶ 24.) Plaintiff continued making payments, but
without the statements was unsure how much to pay. (Id., ¶ 25.) On or
about March 1, 2021, Defendant told Plaintiff that he wanted “his” car back. (Id.,
¶ 26.) Plaintiff insisted that she had made the down payment and other payments
and that she was the true owner of the vehicle. (Id., ¶ 27.) On or about
March 1, 2021, Defendant falsely reported the vehicle to the police as stolen.
(Id., ¶ 28.) The bank has refused to accept payments from Plaintiff because
the loan was not in her name. (Id., ¶ 29.) The Complaint was filed on
October 30, 2023 seeks Monetary and Equitable Relief for Fraud, Breach of
Trust, and Employment Law Violations. 
On April 11, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application
for a Temporary Restraining Order to allow her attorney, Charles L Larson, to
communicate directly with Wells Fargo Bank and obtain information regarding the
auto loan.  The Court ordered Defendant
Kosta to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. (Minute
Order, April 11, 2024.)  
No opposition has been filed as of May 3, 2024. 
Counsel for Defendants Kosta and SK8 Gym Corp. has filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel.  That
motion is scheduled to be heard on September 17, 2024.  
Legal Standard 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status
quo pending a decision on the merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners
Ass’n. (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623.) 
 
In deciding whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction, the
court looks to two factors, including “(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff
will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms that is
likely to result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive
relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.) The
factors are interrelated, with a greater showing on one permitting a lesser
showing on the other.  (Dodge, Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc.
v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420.)  However, the party
seeking an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of
success on the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35
Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the burden of
demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the occurrence of
irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if the plaintiff can show an
inadequate remedy at law.  (CCP § 526(a).)   
 
Discussion 
1.           
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS
ON THE MERITS 
 
A
preliminary injunction may not be issued unless it is “reasonably probable that
the moving party will prevail on the merits.”  (San Francisco Newspaper
Printing Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438, 442; see Costa
Mesa City Employees’ Association v. City of Costa Mesa (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 298, 309 [no injunction may issue unless there is at least “some
possibility” of success].)   
 
On April 11, 2024, the Court found that Plaintiff had made
a reasonable proof of harassment by alleging Defendant changed the address for
the loan documents so Plaintiff could not continue to make payments. (Garza
Decl., ¶¶ 12, 14.) Based upon Plaintiff’s down payment and payment history, as
well as the lack of opposition by Defendant, the Court finds that it is
probable that Plaintiff will succeed on the merits. 
2.           
IMMEDIATE AND
IRREPARABLE HARM 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 526, an injunction may be granted “[w]hen it
appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of
some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable
injury, to a party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd.
(a)(2).)  The threat of irreparable harm must be imminent as opposed to a
mere possibility of harm sometime in the future.  “An injunction cannot
issue in a vacuum based on the proponents’ fears about something that may
happen in the future.  It must be supported by actual evidence that there
is a realistic prospect that the party enjoined intends to engage in the
prohibited activity.”  (Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v.
California Presbytery (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.)  Plaintiffs
need not wait until they have suffered actual harm before applying for an
injunction, however, they may seek injunctive relief against threatened
infringement of their rights.  (Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1281, 1292.)
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s unwillingness to allow
her access to the loan statements and the false police report has caused the
bank to refuse to accept payments from Plaintiff.  Plaintiff also contends that she had to garage
the vehicle to prevent it from being repossessed due to Defendant's harassment
tactics. (Complaint, ¶ 32.) 
The Court finds Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged
immediate and irreparable harm because she faces the threat of repossession of
her car.  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for a Preliminary
Injunction is GRANTED.
Undertaking  
 
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and
until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined
defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides
that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  (See Code Civ.
Pro. § 529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Ass’n.
(1992) 11 Cal. App. 4th 916, 920.) 
 
The Court orders Plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of
$5,000.
