And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, which means that the plaintiff's request to stop the defendant from taking certain actions is allowed. The defendant, Marko Kosta, has been ordered to stop harassing the plaintiff, Noemi Garza, and to allow her to make payments on a 2020 Land Rover Evoque. The court has also ordered the defendant to allow the plaintiff to access the loan statements and to prevent the bank from refusing to accept payments from the plaintiff. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $5,000 to ensure that the defendant is not harmed if the court ultimately decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.
