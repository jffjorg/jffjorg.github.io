Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Med (DE)’s Motions to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One) as to Plaintiff Debbie Shannon are GRANTED. Sanctions
are DENIED.  
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Defendant Med (DE) moves to compel responses to Requests
for Production of Documents (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) as
to Plaintiff Debbie Shannon. Each motion requests monetary sanctions in the
amount of $107.00. 
Defendant
alleges that as of the date the motions were filed, no discovery responses had
been provided to any of the requests.  
 
On May 2, 2024, the
Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories
(Set One) as to Plaintiff Debbie Shannon. 

 
Legal
Standard 
 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion
to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion

Here, Defendant has shown that Requests for Production of
Documents (set one) and Special Interrogatories (set one) were served onto
Plaintiff Shannon on June 15, 2023. The deadline to respond has expired, and no
responses of any kind have been provided. This Moton was filed on October 20,
2023— about four months after service of the discovery. As of May 3, 2024, no
Opposition has been filed to the subject Motion. 
Therefore, the Motion to Compel is GRANTED, and Plaintiff
DEBBIE SHANNON is ORDERED to provide verified responses, without objection by
no later than 30 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This
date may be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are
asserted, it will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a
violation of this Court’s order. 
Sanctions with respect to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents are only authorized against a party who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290,
subd. (c); Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, sanctions are
denied because the motions are unopposed.
