The Judge has granted the motion of the defendants, Wei Xu and Yanping Li, to set aside the default judgment entered against them. The defendants argue that they did not receive actual notice of the summons due to the incorrect address on the envelopes and that the default was entered due to surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect. The Judge finds that the declarations submitted by the defendants are sufficient to warrant relief and that the policy of hearing cases on their merits is well-established. The Judge also notes that the law favors trials on the merits.
