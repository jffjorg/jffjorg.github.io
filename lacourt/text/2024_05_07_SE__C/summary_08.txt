Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has continued the hearing on the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their request for production until June 18, 2024. The Plaintiffs, Novi and Rhiekyu Sohn, are suing Kia Motors America, Inc. for violating California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by failing to repair their 2022 Kia Telluride vehicle. The Plaintiffs had requested production of documents in November 2023. The court is not persuaded that the parties have exhausted their meet and confer obligations. The court has ordered the parties to make further efforts to resolve their discovery disputes and has instructed them to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required.
