BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Mamie Mitchell’s lawsuit concerns the tragic shooting of Director of
Photography Halyna Hutchins on
October 21, 2021 while filming a motion picture in New Mexico, which resulted in Ms.
Hutchins’ death. On August 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for assault and battery,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence.
 
Specially
appearing defendants Seth Kenney and PDQ
Arm and Prop, LLC move to quash service of Summons and the Second Amended
Complaint.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A
non-resident defendant may be subject to either general or specific
jurisdiction. (See Elkman v. National States Insurance Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.) General jurisdiction exists when a defendant is
domiciled in the forum state or his activities there are substantial, continuous,
and systematic. (F. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2005) 130
Cal.App.4th 782, 796.) Specific jurisdiction involves a three-part test in
California. California courts adopt the same test as the test used by the court
in Boschetto v. Hansing (9th Cir. Cal. 2008) 539 F.3d 1011,1016: (1) The
nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the
forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the
privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits
and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or
results from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of
jurisdiction must be reasonable.” Panavision International, L.P. v. Toeppen (9th
Cir. 1998) 141 F.3d 1316, 1320 [applying California law].).” (Jewish Defense
Organization, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles County (Rambam)) (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054.) 
 
“Domicile in the state is alone sufficient to
bring an absent defendant within the reach of the state's jurisdiction for
purposes of a personal judgment by means of appropriate substituted service.” (Allen
v. Superior Court in and for Los Angeles County (1953) 41 Cal.2d 306,
310-11, quoting Milliken v. Meyer (1940) 311 U.S. 457, 462-63.) “While a
person may, at any given time, have more than one residence, he or she may have
only one domicile at a time. (In re Marriage of Tucker (1991) 226
Cal.App.3d 1249, 1258.) “In order to establish a new domicile, a person must
show ‘ “(1) physical presence *1259 at the new location with (2) an intention
to remain there indefinitely.” ’ [Citations]” (Id. at 1258-59.)
 
Kenney
states he has lived in Arizona since 2018. (Kenney Decl., ¶ 4.) (SAC, ¶ 2.)
Kenney rented a home in Southern California for a year, with the intent to
return to Arizona, and was present at the rental home only sporadically for no
more than six months. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Kenney owns a single piece of real property
in California for vacation purposes. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Kenney is not domiciled in California.

 
Plaintiff
contends that Defendants maintained an interstate business-related model,
affiliations, and connections with California by supplying “prop guns and blank
and dummy ammunition” on film production-related jobs. Kenney’s declaration
states that defendant PDQ Arm and Prop, LLC had a single business transaction
in California more than three years ago. (Kenney Decl., ¶ 10.) Kenney declares that
PDQ Arm and Prop primarily engages in business transactions in New Mexico,
Texas, Montana, and Ohio. (Id.) Kenney was a consultant for Prop House
Arsenal, a California-based business, from 2010 to 2015, but this was a
temporary position and was before the incident in this lawsuit. (See id.
at ¶ 15.)  
 
None
of causes of action in this lawsuit arise out of these Defendants’ contacts
with California. (See Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314 [“A court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a
nonresident defendant only if: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed
himself or herself of forum benefits; (2) the controversy is related to or
arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of
personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.”].)
“[T]he foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis ... is that the
defendant's conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should
reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.” (Burger King Corp. v.
Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 474, quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.
v. Woodson (1980) 444 U.S. 286, 297, quotations omitted).) The Court finds
that the facts her do not satisfy this standard. 
 
            In their supplemental reply,
Defendants also note “since the hearing on the Motion in November 2023, this
Court granted Specially Appearing Defendant Seth Kenney’s Motion to Quash
Service of Summons and Complaint in the related matter of Serge Svetnoy v.
Rust Movie Productions LLC, et al., LASC No. 21STCV41392 on March 8, 2024,
and Department 45 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse granted Defendants’ Motion to
Quash Service of Summons and Complaint in the related matter of Olga
Solovey, et al. v. Rust Movie Productions, LLC, et al., LASC No.
23STCV02819 on March 4, 2024,” based on the same facts presented here. (Bekken
Decl., ¶ 9; Exhibits B and C) 
 
            The Court does
not have general or specific jurisdiction over these Defendants. The motion is
GRANTED.
