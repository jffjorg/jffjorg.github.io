And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons and second amended complaint filed by the specially appearing defendants Seth Kenney and PDQ Arm and Prop, LLC. The defendants moved to quash service due to lack of personal jurisdiction over them in California. The judge found that the defendants have no connection to California, and the claims in the lawsuit do not arise out of their contacts with the state. The judge also noted that the defendants had previously moved to quash service in related cases and had been granted relief. Therefore, the judge granted the motion to quash service of summons and second amended complaint.
