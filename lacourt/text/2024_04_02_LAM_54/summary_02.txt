Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion for separate trials for each Plaintiff, Valery Vaca and Steffany Noriega. The Court found that the claims of each Plaintiff are based on different events and circumstances, and that a joint trial would result in confusion and prejudice. The Court relied on various statutes and case law, including California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1048(b) and 379.5, Pilliod v. Monsanto Co., David v. Medtronic, Inc., Rubio v. Monsanto Co., and Visendi v. Bank of Am., N.A. The Court noted that neither Plaintiff's rights would be prejudiced by severance, as each is free to proceed with their individual claims. The Defendant is ordered to notice the separate trials, and the parties are encouraged to submit their positions on the tentative ruling to the Court.
