 Case Number:  22STCV05113    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  30 TONY A HADLEY vs IN-N-OUT BURGERSMotion for Terminating SanctionsTENTATIVEDefendant’s motion for terminating or issue sanctions is GRANTED. The Court dismisses Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant In-N-Out with prejudice.  Moving party to give notice.BackgroundOn February 8, 2022, Plaintiff Tony A. Hadley filed a complaint against Defendant In-N-Out Burgers, alleging a cause of action for negligence and premises liability, arising out of a slip and fall.On June 20, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, ordered Plaintiff to respond in 20 days, and imposed sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $700.On July 3, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to request for production, and Defendant’s motion to deem admissions admitted, and imposed sanctions against Plaintiff.On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for an extension of time for discovery.On September 13, 2023, Defendant filed this motion for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue sanctions. No opposition has been filed.On November 6, 2023, the matter was continued to allow Plaintiff one final opportunity to respond to the discovery.On December 7, 2023, Defendant filed a declaration stating that Plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery.Legal StandardIf a party fails to comply with a court order compelling a further response to a request for production, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (i).) CCP section 2023.030 provides that, "[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process...." CCP section 2023.010 provides that "[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery....""The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)Request for Judicial NoticeDefendant requests judicial notice of this Court’s: (1) Plaintiff’s complaint; (2) This Court’s April 12, 2023 Order following the informal discovery conference; (3) June 22, 2023 Notice of Ruling on In-N-Out’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One; (4) June 22, 2023 Notice of Ruling on In-N-Out’s Motion to CompelPlaintiff’s Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; (5) July 10, 2023 Notice of Ruling on In-N-Out’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Response to Request for Production of Documents, Set One; and (6) July 10, 2023 Notice of Ruling on In-N-Out’s Motion for an Order Deeming Admitted the Truth of All Matters Specified in First Set of Requests for Admission to Plaintiff and Awarding Monetary Sanctions in Favor of In-N-Out and Against Plaintiff.The request is GRANTED under Evidence Code section 452(d).DiscussionDefendant moves for terminating and monetary sanctions, or in the alternative, issue and monetary sanctions, against Plaintiff on the ground that Plaintiff failed to comply with Court orders to respond to discovery and pay monetary sanctions.On June 20, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, ordered Plaintiff to respond in 20 days, and imposed sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $700. (6/20/2023 Minute Order.) Defendant gave notice of the Court ruling the next day. (6/22/23 Notice of Ruling.)On July 3, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to request for production of documents, set one, and to deem admissions admitted, and imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $533.95. The Court ordered Plaintiff to provide responses to the request for production within 20 days. (7/3/23 Minute Order.) Defendant gave Plaintiff notice of the Court ruling on July 10, 2023. (7/10/23 Notice of Ruling.)After placing several unreturned calls to, and leaving several unreturned voicemail messages for Plaintiff, on July 12, 2023, Defendant sent email correspondence to Plaintiff not only attaching the four notices of ruling on the Discovery Motions, but explaining that Plaintiff’s supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories were past-due. (Watts Decl. ¶ 10; Exh. 1.) Plaintiff never responded to this email. (Id.) Defendant attempted to meet and confer again to no avail.Despite the Court orders, Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders or pay sanctions. (Watts Decl. ¶ 12.)On November 6, 2023, this matter was continued to allow Plaintiff one final opportunity to respond to ALL of the discovery orders at issue, e.g., the orders from June 20, 2023 and July 3, 2023. The Court cautioned that if Plaintiff does not comply with the discovery 7 days before the continued hearing date of this motion, then the Court is inclined to grant this motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint.Defendant filed a declaration on December 7, 2023, informing the Court that despite sending Plaintiff notice of this Court’s November 6, 2023 ruling, Defendant has not received any further responses from Plaintiff. (Watts Decl., ¶ 3.)The Court notes that whether Plaintiff complied with the Court’s order to pay monetary sanctions is not relevant to the determination of whether terminating sanctions¿should be imposed. A court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction. ¿(Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 610, 615.)¿ A monetary sanction order is enforceable as a money judgment under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, CCP §§680.010, et seq. (Id. at 615.)However, Plaintiff has engaged in conduct that is an abuse of the discovery process by violating the discovery statutes, and failing to comply with multiple Court orders compelling his responses. Additionally, despite being given one more opportunity to respond and warning that the case would be dismissed if these responses are not provided, Plaintiff has still failed to respond to the Court-ordered discovery. Moreover, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to indicate he will comply with these discovery obligations, or explain his failure to comply with the Court’s discovery orders to show he did not willfully disobey the orders. Thus, the Court finds terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiff are appropriate.As the motion for terminating sanctions is granted, the request for monetary sanctions is denied.
