And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC's motion for terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiff Christina Gutierrez's complaint against the Defendant with prejudice. The Defendant's request for monetary sanctions is denied. The Court finds that Plaintiff has willfully misused the discovery process by failing to comply with the Court's August 23, 2023 order compelling discovery responses. The Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests and failure to oppose the motion for terminating sanctions demonstrates a lack of diligence and a disinterest in prosecuting the case. As a result, the Court grants the motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the Plaintiff's complaint against the Defendant with prejudice.
