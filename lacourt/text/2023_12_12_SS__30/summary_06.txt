And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Isabel Moore's motion to compel responses to her demand for inspection of documents, Set One. The Judge grants the motion, ordering Plaintiff Candida Lisseth Canales Martinez to provide responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days of the order. The Judge finds that Defendant properly served the discovery request and Plaintiff failed to provide any responses, entitling Defendant to an order directing Plaintiff to respond. The Judge denies Defendant's request for sanctions, as the motion was not opposed and the request was not made under the correct statute. The Judge also denies Defendant's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, as this statute does not authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
