 Case Number:  21STCV21891    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  30 MARINA M. AVALOS GUZMAN vs GEOBALDA ZAMORA, et al.Motion for Summary AdjudicationTENTATIVEDefendant Geobalda Zamora’s Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED. Moving party to give notice.BackgroundOn June 19, 2021, Plaintiff Marina M. Avalos Guzman filed a complaint against Defendants Geobalda Zamora and Salomon Zamora, alleging three causes of action for negligence, premises liability and violation of Civil Code section 3342. The complaint also seeks punitive damages.The complaint alleges that Plaintiff, Defendant’s tenant, was in the bathroom and Defendants’ dog bit Plaintiff. Defendants knew that the dog had previously attacked another person, that it had extremely dangerous propensity to attack, and had the propensities of that particular type of breed.On February 23, 2023, Defendant Geobalda Zamora filed a motion for summary adjudication. On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition. No reply has been filed.Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) Thus, summary judgment is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (CCP § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.)As to each claim as framed by the Complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense. (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) A motion for summary judgment must be denied where the moving party's evidence does not prove all material facts, even in the absence of any opposition or where the opposition is weak. (Leyva v. Sup. Ct. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387.)A defendant has met its burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if it demonstrates the absence of any single essential element of plaintiff’s case or a complete defense to plaintiff’s action. (CCP § 437c(o)(2); Bacon v. Southern Cal. Edison Co. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 854, 858.) Once the defendant moving party has met the burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show via specific facts that a triable issue of material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense thereto. (CCP § 437c(o)(2).)Where a plaintiff cannot establish an essential element of a cause of action, or where a complete defense is shown, a court must grant a motion for summary adjudication. (CCP § 437c(o)(1)-(2).) A defendant meets its burden by showing that “one or more elements of a cause of action . . . cannot be established.” (Id.; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 853.)DiscussionDefendants move for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim, arguing it has no merit because Plaintiff cannot meet her burden of proof to establish Defendants acted with malice by clear and convincing evidence.Civil Code § 3294 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:(a)¿In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.***(c)¿As used in this section, the following definitions shall apply:(1)¿“Malice” means conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.(2)¿“Oppression” means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.(3)¿“Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (See, e.g., Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th 847, 891.) To prove that a defendant acted with “willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,” it is not enough to prove negligence, gross negligence or even recklessness. (Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.)While “the ‘clear and convincing’ evidentiary standard is a stringent one, it does not impose on a plaintiff the obligation to ‘prove’ a case for punitive damages at summary judgment.” (Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1053.) However, where the plaintiff's ultimate burden of proof will be by clear and convincing evidence, the higher standard of proof must be taken into account in ruling on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, since if a plaintiff is to prevail on a claim for punitive damages, it will be necessary that the evidence presented meet the higher evidentiary standard. (Basich v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1118–1120, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 153.) Further, summary judgment “on the issue of punitive damages is proper” only “when no reasonable jury could find the plaintiff’s evidence to be clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or oppression.” (Id.)Defendant presents the following facts. Plaintiff rented a room from defendant. Plaintiff and defendant shared a bathroom. (Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) No. 1.) When plaintiff moved in, defendant had a small, blind dog weighing approximately 20 pounds named Peluche. (Id., No. 2.) On June 25, 2019, Plaintiff went to use the bathroom. Defendant was in the bathroom with Peluche. Plaintiff asked defendant to leave the bathroom. Defendant left without Peluche. When plaintiff gestured at Peluce to leave the bathroom, Peluche bit plaintiff on the hand. (Id., No. 3.)Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant intended to cause injury, and that Defendant engaged in despicable conduct. Defendant did not order Peluche to attack Plaintiff. (UMF No. 8.) Defendant had never seen Peluche attack or bite anyone prior to June 25, 2019; no one had complained to defendant about Peluche attacking or biting anyone prior to June 25, 2019; and Plaintiff does not believe defendant intended for Peluche to hurt her. (Id., Nos. 5-9.)Defendants have met their burden on summary adjudication to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to whether they acted with malice, because they did not know of the dog’s dangerous propensities, and thus, there was no despicable conduct on their part, and did not intend to injure Plaintiff. Thus, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to present triable issues of fact.Plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition, and therefore, has failed to carry her burden. As such, Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication.
