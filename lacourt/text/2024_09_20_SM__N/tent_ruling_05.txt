REASONING
 
Rule 7.950
of the California Rules of Court governs the procedure for a petition for court
approval of a minor’s compromise under the Probate Code. The Court has reviewed
the petition and finds the settlement fair and reasonable. Plaintiff Nathan
Waugh-Lingman, a Minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Sarah J. Waugh, and
Plaintiff’s counsel have an agreement for attorney fees, which is attached to
the petition, and the declaration of counsel is sufficient to substantiate the
work done in connection with this matter. The Court also finds the single-premium
deferred annuity to be sufficient. Accordingly, Petitioner Sarah J. Waugh’s
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Claimant Nathan
Waugh-Lingman is GRANTED.
