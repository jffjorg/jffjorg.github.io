And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24SMCV00057, setting the stage for a future court hearing on September 20, 2024. The judge notes that the complaint and default package match, and the defendant was properly served. However, the plaintiff has not dismissed the defendant KSA Design Studio from the action. The judge also expresses concerns about the plaintiff's request for $200,000 in damages, stating that the plaintiff has not provided a proper basis for awarding this amount. Specifically, the judge notes that the plaintiff's medical records show that she sustained a scaphoid fracture, but it is unclear how this injury would require the plaintiff to take a leave of absence from her education. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to substantiate the basis for the requested damages or to omit this request from the default package.
