```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's request for default judgment will be continued to a new date. The plaintiff has not provided a copy of the statements of damages served on the defendants, which the court needs to review to determine the basis for the damages. Additionally, the court is unclear about the basis for the defendant Midway Rent A Car, Inc.'s liability and requires admissible evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, the court lacks sufficient evidence to award pain and suffering damages without more proof of harm. The judge is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to address these deficiencies before proceeding with the hearing.
