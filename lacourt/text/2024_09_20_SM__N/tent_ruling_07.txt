 Case Number:  24SMCV00057    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  N CONTINUE  Complaint and default package match. Defendant was properly served. However, Plaintiff has not dismissed Defendant KSA Design Studio from the action. Moreover, Plaintiff seeks $200,000 in damages for pain, suffering, and inconvenience ($100,000) and emotional distress ($100,000) without describing a proper basis for awarding the same. Plaintiff’s medical records show that she sustained a scaphoid fracture as a result of the collision, but it is not clear how this injury would require Plaintiff to take a leave of absence from her education, as the medical records do not state that Plaintiff was unable to continue with her studies. Plaintiff must substantiate the basis for $200,000 in damages for pain, suffering, and inconvenience and emotional distress, or she must omit this request from her default package.
