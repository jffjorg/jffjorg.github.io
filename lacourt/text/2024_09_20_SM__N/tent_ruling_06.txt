 Case Number:  23SMCV05049    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  N CONTINUE   This default package generally appears in order. While there is a remaining defendant, that claim is only one for enforcement of the claim on the contractor’s license bond, so there is no apparent risk of an inconsistent judgment. However, Plaintiff has not provided any evidence that Defendant was an unlicensed contractor besides her own statement. Other evidence of lack of license is necessary to warrant Plaintiff’s full recovery.
