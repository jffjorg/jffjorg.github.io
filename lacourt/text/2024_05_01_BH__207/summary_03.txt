And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's amended complaint. The defendants, a group of medical providers, moved to strike the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief regarding their payment methodology. The court granted the motion, striking the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief regarding the defendants' payment methodology. The court held that the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief was "legally unavailable" because the defendants' payment methodology was governed by the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) and courts may not grant injunctive relief restraining or altering an insurance company's payment methodology. The court also held that the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief regarding the defendants' alleged failure to timely or accurately pay bills was "legally unavailable" because the defendants were statutorily obligated to pay for emergency services and care. The court denied the remainder of the defendants' motion to strike.
