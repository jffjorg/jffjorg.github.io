And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denied Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action, which was entered on July 27, 2022, due to the six-month limitation period. The Court also denied Plaintiff's motion for entry of stipulated judgment, as the Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment due to the voluntary dismissal of the action. The Court noted that the parties did not request the Court to retain jurisdiction during the pendency of the case, as required by statute.
