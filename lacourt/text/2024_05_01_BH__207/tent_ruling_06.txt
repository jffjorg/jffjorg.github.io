filed a First Amended Answer, the Court overrules the demurrer to the original
Answer and denies the motion to strike the original Answer as moot.  (“A party may amend its pleading once without
leave of the court […] after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
472, subd. (a).)
 


[2] The Unlawful Detainer complaint was originally
brought on behalf of a different entity, but was later amended to be brought on
behalf of the Eislers.
