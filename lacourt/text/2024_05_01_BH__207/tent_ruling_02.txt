MATTER


Request for Entry of Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff James Bram (“Plaintiff”)
requests for default judgment against Defendants Xpressguards and Xpressguards
LLC (“Defendants”) in the amount of $125,634.45, which is
composed of damages in the amount of $100,000; prejudgment interest in the
amount of $24,514.05; and costs in the amount of $1,120.40.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges fifteen causes of action
for (1) Failure to Provide Meal Periods; (2) Failure to Provide Rest Breaks;
(3) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages; (4) Failure to Furnish Accurate Itemized
Wage Statements; (5) Failure to Pay All Wages Owed; (6) Failure to Pay Waiting
Time Penalties; (7) Failure to Provide Complete Access to Employee Personnel
File and Payroll Records in Violation of Labor Code §§ 226, 432, and 1198.5;
(8) Retaliation in violation of FEHA; (9) Retaliation in Violation of Labor
Code § 1102.5; (10) Retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 98.6; (11)
Retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 6310; (12) Failure to Prevent
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA; (13) Unfair Business Practices: (14) Wrongful
Termination in violation of FEHA; (15) Wrongful Termination in violation of
public policy.  
 
            Defendants were served with a copy of the summons,
complaint, and statement of damages via substitute service on January 26, 2023.
Default was entered against Defendants on October 12, 2023.  Plaintiff has requested dismissal of the Doe
defendants in the body of his brief, but has not otherwise filed a request for
dismissal.  
 
            Plaintiff’s Statement of Damages
seeks $150,000 in damages, composed of general damages of $50,000 for emotional
distress, and special damages of $100,000 for loss of earnings ($75,000) and for
loss of future earning capacity ($25,000). 
Plaintiff’s Statement of Damages also sets forth a claim of $20,000 in
punitive damages. Therefore, the amount of damages Plaintiff seeks is not in
excess of those specified in the statement of damages.  (Yeung v. Soos (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th
576, 582 [“a default judgment is void when the damages are in excess of the
damages specified in the complaint or the statement of damages”].)  
 
            Plaintiff supports his request for
damages with the Declaration of James Abram. 
With regard to the requested damages, the Abram Declaration indicates:
 
12.
After my termination, I was out of work for approximately a month and a half
while I searched for a new job. I was able to find a temporary job, but that
job fell through shortly after I found it. During this time, I was very worried
and anxious, as my inability to find a steady job after XpressGuards was
affecting my livelihood. 
 
13.
I currently work for Contemporary Services Corporation (“CSC”) in event
security but it is a seasonal job and still does not provide a steady paycheck.
I also try to supplement my income by working security at a club on weekends
and am in the process of obtaining my firearm license so that I can apply for
armed security positions, which would pay more and provide a steady income. 
 
14.
XpressGuards’ treatment towards me caused me to suffer a lot of trauma and
emotional distress. Since my termination, I have experienced anxiety, worry,
and loss of sleep.
 
(Abram Dec. ¶¶ 12-14.) 
However, Plaintiff has not provided specific evidentiary support for the
requested $100,000 – what portion of that amount constitutes loss of earnings
versus what portion constitutes emotional distress – nor has Plaintiff
substantiated the request for lost earnings with figures demonstrating how much
Plaintiff earned with Xpressguards versus the shortfall compared with how much
Plaintiff is currently earning.
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently substantiated the request
for $100,000 in damages.   
 
c.         Prejudgment Interest 
 
            Plaintiff has not provided an
interest computation.  Therefore, the
Court cannot award Plaintiff’s requested interest.  

 
            d.         Costs 
 
            Plaintiff requests $1,120.40 in costs composed of $571.30 in filing fees and $549.10 in process server fees. (MC-010.)
Plaintiff’s request for costs is granted as Plaintiff is the prevailing party
in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is
denied without prejudice.  
 
            Further, the Court continues the Order to Show Cause re
Entry of Default Judgment to July 1, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207, and
Plaintiff shall file an amended request for entry of default judgment in conformance
with the Court’s ruling on or before June 10, 2024.  
 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the
Court’s ruling.
