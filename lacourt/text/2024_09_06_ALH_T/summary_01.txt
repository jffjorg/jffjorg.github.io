And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss the lawsuit is granted. The lawsuit was filed on December 22, 2020, and the defendant was not served with the summons and complaint until June 3, 2024, which is more than three years after the action was commenced. The judge finds that the delay in serving the defendant is a fatal flaw and that the lawsuit is untimely. The judge cites several California court cases to support this decision, including Watson v. Superior Court, Austin v. Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co., and J.A. Thompson & Sons, Inc. v. Superior Court.
