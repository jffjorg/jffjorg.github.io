Significant Statements:
  - "The anti-SLAPP procedures are designed to shield a defendantâ€™s constitutionally protected conduct from the undue burden of frivolous litigation." (Baral v. Schnitt)
  - "The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate defendants from any liability for claims arising from the protected rights of petition or speech. It only provides a procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, meritless claims arising from protected activity."
  - "Resolution of an anti-SLAPP motion involves two steps. First, the defendant must establish that the challenged claim arises from activity protected by section 425.16. If the defendant makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate the merit of the claim by establishing a probability of success."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant's cross-complaint for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil abuse of process, and attempted extortion. The judge finds that Defendant's causes of action arise from Plaintiff's protected activity in bringing a complaint against Defendant for having an inaccessible sales counter under the Unruh Act. The judge also finds that Defendant cannot meet its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits because Plaintiff benefits from Litigation Privilege.

The judge awards Plaintiff reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $15,250.00. The judge reduces the anticipated 3 hours to prepare and argue this motion to 1.5 hours and finds that a blended rate of $500.00 is a reasonable hourly rate for all Plaintiff's counsel.
