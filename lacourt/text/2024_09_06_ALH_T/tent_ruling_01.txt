  Case Number:  20STCV48808    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to DismissMoving Party: Defendants Exposition Park aka Sixth District Agricultural Association aka California Science Center (Erroneously Sued Separately as Doe 6 and Doe 8)Responding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTEDBACKGROUND This is a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the heirs of Decedent Robert Michael Parra, who, while intoxicated, fell from the top floor of a parking structure in November 2019. Plaintiffs filed their complaint against Defendant State of California (“Defendant”) on December 22, 2020 (Declaration of Nikhil P. Pole (“Pole Dec”) at ¶ 3). On January 24, 2022, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to substitute DOE 6 with Defendant Sixth District Agricultural Association and DOE 8 with Defendant Exposition Park (Pole Dec at ¶ 4.) Defendant was not served with the summons and operative complaint until June 3, 2024 (See Declaration of Andrea Ambriz.)MOVING PARTY POSITION Defendant argues Plaintiffs’ service of summons should be quashed and Defendant must be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210, as Plaintiff waited longer than three years to serve Defendant. Defendant also argues that discretionary dismissal is appropriate under and because Plaintiffs unreasonably delayed in naming Defendant as a DOE defendant and serving Defendant with process, causing undue prejudice to Defendant.OPPOSITION Plaintiffs did not file an opposition. ANALYSIS I. Motion to Quash California Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210(a) mandates that “[t]he summons and complaint shall be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced against the defendant. For the purpose of this subdivision, an action is commenced at the time the complaint is filed.” The three-year requirement begins running from the date the initial complaint is filed; later naming a DOE defendant does not toll the deadline. (Watson v. Superior Court (1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 53, 59;  see, also, Brock v. Fouchy (1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 363 and Austin v. Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 599.) Failure to comply with the three year requirement mandates dismissal. (J.A. Thompson & Sons, Inc. v. Superior Court (1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 719, 720)Where a plaintiff files a complaint naming a fictitious defendant and within three years amends the complaint to substitute the defendant's true name, the defendant “is considered a party to the action from its commencement so that the statute of limitations stops running as of the date of the earlier pleading.” Austin v. Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co., 56 Cal.2d 596, 599. Thus, taken together, C.C.P. Sections 340(3), 474 and 583.210 provide the “functional equivalent” of a limitations period of up to four years, depending on when the original complaint is filed. Rumberg v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 424 F.Supp. 294, 297 (C.D.Cal.1976).Here, the dispositive issue is whether Plaintiff identified and served the moving Defendants in the three-year period of its initial filing so the limitation period will not have run.  Plaintiff filed her action on December 22, 2020 (Pole Dec at ¶ 3). Plaintiff served the summons and complaint on Defendant on June 3, 2024 (Ambriz Dec.)Because “the very act of filing the complaint extends the limitation period for three years,” Plaintiff’s amending the complaint to add Defendant as a Doe defendant does not extend the limitation. (Brennan v. Lermer Corp. (1986) 626 F.Supp. 926, 934.) Plaintiff’s complaint is thus untimely.RULING Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED.
