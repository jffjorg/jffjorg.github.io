And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission admitted with respect to Defendant Management Towing Inc. dba Rowlett Towing. The Defendant failed to respond to the Plaintiff's requests for admission, and the Judge finds that this failure is not adequately explained. The Judge orders the Defendant to submit responses to the requests for admission by the date of the hearing on this motion.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission admitted with respect to Defendant Pasco, as the Plaintiff has not provided the Court with the Requests for Admissions.

The Judge has awarded the Plaintiff $1,110 in sanctions, which includes $1,050 for the time spent working on the motion and $60 for the filing fee. The sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of the Plaintiff giving notice of this ruling.
