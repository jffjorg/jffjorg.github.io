Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a new trial, finding that the court did not err in granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff argued that the court should have continued the summary judgment hearing to complete additional discovery, but the judge found that there was no showing that additional discovery was likely to address the core questions pertaining to design immunity or exceptions to design immunity. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate the existence of a concealed trap and that the decision was contrary to law.

The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to recover costs associated with the motion for summary judgment, except for $1,600 in expert witness fees for Rock Miller. The defendant is entitled to recover costs for depositions, service of process fees, and expert witness fees, but the plaintiff is not entitled to recover costs for these expenses.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Court of Appeal cases cited in the document. The judge has applied the relevant laws and statutes to the facts of the case and has made a determination based on the evidence presented.
