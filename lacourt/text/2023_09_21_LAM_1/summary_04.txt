And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Christopher Roberts' motion to transfer the case from the Southeast District to the Central District. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a transfer is warranted based on the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court, which govern the assignment of cases between districts and departments. Specifically, the Judge notes that the case was properly filed in the Southeast District, where the Defendant resides and does business, and that Plaintiff has not shown that he attempted to file the case in the Central District. The Judge also rejects Plaintiff's reliance on his counsel's filing difficulties in a different case, finding that it is not relevant to the instant case. As a result, the motion is denied with prejudice.
