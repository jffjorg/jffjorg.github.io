And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to relate the cases 22STCV08882, 23STCV06809, and 23STCV09389. The cases involve different parties, claims, and facts, and do not meet the criteria for relation under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The judge finds that the cases do not involve the same parties, similar claims, or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events, and therefore do not require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. The judge also notes that the similar protective orders and discovery requests in all cases do not necessarily indicate a relation between the cases.
