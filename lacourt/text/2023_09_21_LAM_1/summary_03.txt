The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to relate the cases 22STCV08882, 23STCV06809, and 23STCV09389. The cases involve different parties, claims, and facts, and do not meet the criteria for relation under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The judge finds that the cases do not involve the same parties, similar claims, or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events, and therefore do not require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. The judge also notes that the similar protective orders and discovery requests in all cases do not necessarily indicate a relation between the cases.

## English Summary

The judge has denied the City of Burbank's motion to relate three separate lawsuits. 

The motion aimed to combine the case of Clifton Bernard (22STCV08882), who alleges discrimination and wrongful termination, with two other cases brought by Carlos Argueta and Jesse Vasquez (23STCV06809 and 23STCV09389) who allege a hostile work environment.

The judge determined that while all three cases involve the City of Burbank and some overlapping themes of discrimination, they are distinct in their specific facts, legal arguments, and parties involved. 

Therefore, the judge believes hearing the cases separately will not result in a significant duplication of judicial resources.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Burbank has filed a motion to relate three employment disputes: 22STCV08882 (Berger v. City of Burbank), 23STCV06809 (Argueta v. City of Burbank), and 23STCV09389 (Vasquez v. City of Burbank). The City argues that the cases involve similar claims, parties, and witnesses, and would require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. However, Judge Teresa A. Beaudet has denied the motion, finding that the cases do not involve the same parties, claims, or underlying facts.

The cases involve allegations of age and race discrimination, harassment, and constructive discharge by the City of Burbank against three employees: Clifton Bernard, Carlos Argueta, and Jesse Vasquez. While the City argues that the cases are related, the Court finds that they are not related and should be heard separately. The Court notes that the cases do not involve the same parties, claims, or underlying facts, and that the assigned judges will be required to resolve different issues in each case.

The City's motion is denied, and the cases will be heard separately.
