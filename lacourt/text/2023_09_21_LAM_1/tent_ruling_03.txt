 Case Number:  22STCV08882    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  1 22STCV08882           CLIFTON
BERNARD vs THE CITY OF BURBANK
Defendant’s Motion to Relate Cases 
TENTATIVE RULING:        The motion is DENIED.
Background of 22STCV08882 Bernard
v. City of Burbank 
 
On March 11, 2022, Plaintiff Clifton Bernard filed
this action against the City of Burbank arising out of his employment as a
water meter mechanic. On May 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint asserting causes of action for: (1) age discrimination; (2) race
discrimination; (3) FEHA retaliation; (4) harassment; (5) failure to prevent
discrimination and harassment; and (6) whistleblower retaliation. 
 
The FAC alleges Bernard is a 64-year-old
African-American male who worked in Defendant’s water meter shop. Plaintiff
alleges Water Supervisor Pete Marshall subjected him to insults, derogatory
comments, baseless criticism, and interfered with Plaintiff’s job duties.
Plaintiff allegedly reported this conduct and Defendant reprimanded Marshall. However,
Marshall allegedly engaged in the same conduct thereafter. Plaintif further
alleges Defendant selected a younger, Caucasian employee, for the role of Water
Supervisor over Plaintiff. Plaintiff also alleges he inadvertently allowed his
credentials to expire, corrected the issue, and explained the situation to
Defendant, but was given a suspension. 
 
On October 18, 2022, the clerk entered Plaintiff’s
request for dismissal of the sixth cause of action for whistleblower
retaliation. On November 4, 2022, the court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action with leave to amend. Plaintiff did not file a second
amended complaint thereafter. 
 
On July 11, 2023, Defendant filed a Notice of
Related Case involving 22STCV08882, 23STCV06809 Argueta v. City of Burbank,
and 23STCV09389 Vasquez v. City of
Burbank.
 
On July 20, 2023, Judge Teresa A. Beaudet issued an
order finding the cases were not related.
 
Background of 23STCV06809 Argueta
v. City of Burbank
 
On March 28, 2023, Plaintiff Carlos Argueta sued the
City of Burbank for claims arising out of his employment as a pipefitter
apprentice. The First Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for: (1)
hostile work environment harassment; (2) discrimination; and (3) failure to
prevent discrimination and harassment. 
 
The FAC alleges Plaintiff Argueta is a Hispanic male
hired in 2019 when he was 21 years old. Plaintiff Argueta alleges he was
subjected to a hostile work environment based upon his race and national origin,
including by Sean Allen, a union steward. The FAC also includes allegations
that Argueta witnessed derogatory comments Pete Marshall made about Clifton
Bernard and was told to lie during an interview related to Bernard’s complaint
about Marshall. Plaintiff Argueta also alleges Cody Paice harassed him and Nick Guin
made derogatory comments about Jesse Vasquez, a Hispanic apprentice, and “drew
a white supremacist hate symbol . . . on the chalkboard” during a meeting.
Plaintiff Argueta alleges he was
constructively discharged.
 
On
May 26, 2023, Plaintiff Argueta filed a Notice of Related Case involving
23STCV06809 and 23STCV09389 only. On June 9, 2023, Judge Stephen I. Goorvich
issued an order relating 23STCV06809 and 23STCV09389.
 
Background of 23STCV09389 Vasquez v. City of Burbank
 
On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff Jesse Vasquez sued the
City of Burbank for claims arising out of his employment as a pipefitter
apprentice. The First Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for: (1)
hostile work environment harassment; (2) discrimination; and (3) failure to
prevent discrimination and harassment.
 
The FAC alleges Plaintiff Vasquez is a Hispanic male
who identifies his national origin as Mexico and was hired by Defendant in 2021.
Plaintiff Vasquez alleges he was subjected to a hostile work environment based
upon his race and national origin, including by Sean Allen, a union steward. The
FAC also includes allegations that Plaintiff Vasquez witnessed derogatory
comments Pete Marshall made about Clifton Bernard. Plaintiff Vasquez also
alleges Nick Guin made derogatory comments about Mexicans, harassed him, and drew
“a white supremacist hate symbol . . . on the chalkboard” during a meeting.
Plaintiff reported the incident and faced threatening comments as a result. Plaintiff
Vasquez alleges he was constructively discharged.
 
22STCV08882
is Not Related to Either 23STCV06809 or 23STCV09389
 
On July 20,
2023, Judge Teresa A. Beaudet issued an order finding 22STCV08882 was not
related to 23STCV06809 or 23STCV09389 within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is properly brought before
Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rule
3.3(f)(3).)   
 
Cases are related when they (1)
involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise
from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events
requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of
law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to
the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).)
 
Defendant contends “all three of these
unlimited civil cases involve many of the same parties and witnesses, are based
on the same or similar claims, arise from the same or substantially identical
incidents or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical
questions or law or fact, are being prosecuted and defended by the same
counsel, and are likely for these reasons, and others, to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.” (Mot. at 3:10-15.)
Defendant further contends “the parties entered into identical protective
orders in all three matters, Plaintiffs have served nearly identical inspection
demands and form interrogatory requests in all three matters, and Defendant
intends on shortly serving nearly identical discovery requests from the Bernard
Matter on Plaintiffs in the Argueta and Vasquez Matters.” (Id. at 4:15-18.)
 
The cases do not involve the same
parties as only Defendant is a party to all three actions. Additionally, the Bernard case, while involving the same
general legal theories under FEHA, does not assert the same claims as the Argueta
and Vasquez cases. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) The Bernard case also does
not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or
events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical
questions of law or fact as the Argueta and Vasquez cases. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(2).) The Bernard case arises out of Bernard’s employment as a water
meter mechanic, the denial of a supervisory promotion, Pete Marshall’s alleged
improper treatment of Bernard, and Bernard’s suspension. The Argueta and
Vasquez cases arise out of an alleged shared hostile work environment in their
positions as pipefitter apprentices and assert claims for constructive
termination. Bernard identifies himself in different protected classes, held a
lead position, and his claims are not based upon the same conduct as the other
actions. 
 
The cases do not appear to require a
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal.
R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) Defendant references a stipulated protective order,
similar written discovery, and a potential joint mediation, (Mot. at 4:15-21), which
do not involve a duplication of judicial resources. The assigned judges will be
required to resolve different issues and there is insufficient overlap between
the Bernard case and the Argueta and Vasquez cases to warrant relation. Contrary
to Defendant’s assertions, that the various Plaintiffs worked in the same
location and witnessed some of the conduct alleged in each other’s cases does
not render the cases related. 
 
The Court declines to relate 22STCV08882
with either 23STCV06809 or 23STCV09389 and
the motion is DENIED.
