And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief and injunctive relief against Dean C. Logan, the Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk, alleging that the County Registrar unlawfully rejected tens of thousands of voter signatures in support of the petition to recall George Gascon. The petition seeks a writ of mandate and injunction to compel the Registrar to count the rejected signatures and certify the recall petition. George Gascon, the District Attorney, filed a peremptory challenge under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, which was accepted by Judge Chalfant.

The Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon filed a motion to reconsider the acceptance of the peremptory challenge, arguing that the subsequent case is a continuation of the prior action and that Judge Chalfant should not have accepted the peremptory challenge. The Committee argues that the peremptory challenge was untimely filed and that Judge Chalfant should have considered the prior action when accepting the challenge.

The Court finds that the subsequent case is not a continuation of the prior action and that the peremptory challenge was timely filed. The Court also finds that the District Attorney has a right to file a peremptory challenge and that Judge Chalfant's acceptance of the challenge should not be reconsidered. Therefore, the motion to reconsider the acceptance of the peremptory challenge is DENIED.

English text:
The tentative ruling in Case Number 23STCP02365, scheduled for a hearing on September 21, 2023 in Department 1, denies the Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon's motion to reconsider and vacate an order granting a peremptory challenge. The case was filed on July 7, 2023, and seeks a writ of mandate and injunction compelling the Registrar to count as valid any and all incorrectly-rejected Recall Petition signatures, reissue a certificate that accurately identifies the number of valid Recall Petition signatures, and certify to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors that the Recall Petition is sufficient. George Gascon was added as a real party in interest on July 28, 2023, and filed a peremptory challenge on August 9, 2023. The Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon argues that the challenge is barred by the continuation rule because it is a continuation of another case, but the court finds that the cases involve entirely different factual and legal issues and that Gascon must not be barred from filing a peremptory challenge.

##  Case Summary: Committee to Support Recall of District Attorney George Gascon v. Dean C. Logan 

**Case Number:** 23STCP02365
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Department:** 1


**People Involved:**

* **Plaintiff:** Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon
* **Defendant:** Dean C. Logan, in his official capacity as Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk, and Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk’s Office

**Other Key Parties:**

* **George Gascon:** District Attorney of Los Angeles County  

**Background:**

This case is a continuation of a separate case (22STCP03795) where the Committee sought to enforce their right to inspect public records related to the recall effort against George Gascon. 

In 23STCP02365, the Committee alleges that the County Registrar improperly rejected thousands of signatures from their recall petition against Gascon. They are seeking a writ of mandate and an injunction to compel the Registrar to:

* Recount the rejected signatures.
* Issue a revised certificate of valid signatures.
* Certify the petition to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

**Disputes:**

* Whether the County Registrar improperly rejected recall signatures.

**Actions:**

* The Committee filed a petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief.
* Gascon filed a peremptory challenge under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 to disqualify the original presiding judge, Judge James C. Chalfant.
* Judge Chalfant accepted Gascon's peremptory challenge.
* The Committee moved to reconsider the judge's acceptance of the peremptory challenge.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The judge denies the Committee's motion to reconsider the acceptance of Gascon's peremptory challenge. The judge finds that:

* The cases are not considered continuations of each other for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6.
* The Committee has not shown sufficient reason to vacate Judge Chalfant's decision.

**Legal Arguments:**

* The Committee argues that the cases are related and therefore Gascon should not be able to peremptorily challenge the judge.
* Gascon argues that the cases are distinct and that he should be allowed to exercise his right to a peremptory challenge.


**Judge's Reasoning:**

The judge agreed with Gascon, finding that the cases involve different factual and legal issues and that Gascon was not a party to the original public records case.


**Outcome:**

The Committee's motion to reconsider the judge's acceptance of Gascon's peremptory challenge is denied.

**Case Number:** 23STCP02365

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Parties:**

* Plaintiff/Petitioner: Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon
* Defendant/Respondent: Dean C. Logan, George Gascon, Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk’s Office

**Key People & Companies:**

* Judge James C. Chalfant
* Los Angeles Superior Court

**Background:**

The Plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate, complaint for declaratory relief, and injunctive relief against Dean C. Logan and the Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk’s Office, alleging unlawful rejection of recall petition signatures. The case was related to 22STCP03795, but was returned to its original department. In 22STCP03795, the Plaintiff sought to enforce public record inspection rights.

**Motion to Reconsider:**

The Defendant George Gascon filed a peremptory challenge under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, which was accepted by the court. The Plaintiff seeks reconsideration and vacation of the order accepting the challenge, arguing that it is barred by the continuation rule as 23STCP02365 is a continuation of 22STCP03795.

**Court's Ruling:**

The court denies the Plaintiff's motion, finding that 23STCP02365 is not a continuation of 22STCP03795. The cases involve different issues and facts, Gascon was not a party to the first action, and it did not affect his interests. Further, the second action does not involve matters necessarily relevant and material to the issues in the original case.
