And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief and injunctive relief against Dean C. Logan, the Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk, alleging that the County Registrar unlawfully rejected tens of thousands of voter signatures in support of the petition to recall George Gascon. The petition seeks a writ of mandate and injunction to compel the Registrar to count the rejected signatures and certify the recall petition. George Gascon, the District Attorney, filed a peremptory challenge under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, which was accepted by Judge Chalfant.

The Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon filed a motion to reconsider the acceptance of the peremptory challenge, arguing that the subsequent case is a continuation of the prior action and that Judge Chalfant should not have accepted the peremptory challenge. The Committee argues that the peremptory challenge was untimely filed and that Judge Chalfant should have considered the prior action when accepting the challenge.

The Court finds that the subsequent case is not a continuation of the prior action and that the peremptory challenge was timely filed. The Court also finds that the District Attorney has a right to file a peremptory challenge and that Judge Chalfant's acceptance of the challenge should not be reconsidered. Therefore, the motion to reconsider the acceptance of the peremptory challenge is DENIED.
