TO SUPPORT THE RECALL OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GASCON vs DEAN C. LOGAN
Petitioner/Plaintiff Committee to Support the Recall of
District Attorney George Gascon’s Motion to Reconsider and Vacate Order
Granting Peremptory Challenge (C.C.P 170.6)
TENTATIVE RULING:  The motion is DENIED.
Background of 23STCP02365 Committee to Support the Recall of District
Attorney George Gascon v. Logan
 
On July 7, 2023, Petitioner/Plaintiff Committee to
Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon filed a petition for writ
of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief and injunctive relief naming
Dean C. Logan, in his official capacity as Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County
Clerk, and Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk’s Office as
Defendants/Respondents. 
 
On July 27, 2023, Judge James C. Chalfant issued an
order relating this action with 22STCP03795 Committee to Support the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon v.
Logan et al and ordering
Petitioner to add District Attorney George Gascon as a real party in interest.
 
Petitioner filed the amended petition adding George
Gascon on July 28, 2023. In the amended petition, Petitioner alleges the County
Registrar unlawfully rejected tens of thousands of voter signatures in support
of the petition to recall George Gascon. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate and
injunction “compelling the Registrar to: (1) count as valid any and all
incorrectly-rejected Recall Petition signatures identified herein; (2) reissue
a certificate that accurately identifies the number of valid Recall Petition
signatures; and (3) certify to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors that
the Recall Petition is sufficient.” (Am. Pet. ¶¶ 36, 52.) Petitioner also seeks
a judicial declaration that the Registrar violated the law by failing to do the
same. (Id. ¶ 45.) 
 
On August 10, 2023, Judge Chalfant accepted George
Gascon’s Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 peremptory challenge. 
 
On August 16, 2023, this Court issued an order
finding 22STCP03795 and 23STCP02365 should no longer be related and returned
the cases to their original departments.
 
Background of 22STCP03795 Committee to Support the Recall of District
Attorney George Gascon v. Logan
 
On October 18, 2022, Petitioner Committee to Support
the Recall of District Attorney George Gascon filed a petition for writ of
mandate and complaint for declaratory relief and injunctive relief naming Dean
C. Logan, in his official capacity as Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County
Clerk, and Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder/County Clerk’s Office as
Respondents. 
 
Petitioner filed an amended petition on November 16,
2022. In this amended petition, Petitioner seeks to “enforce the ‘right to inspect
or to receive a copy of any public record or class of public records’” under
Government Code section 6258. (Am. Pet. ¶¶ 33, 42.) Gascon is not a party to
this proceeding. On December 6, 2022, the court granted Petitioner’s request
for a preliminary injunction. On January 24, 2023, the court granted
Petitioner’s ex parte application to enforce the injunction. On August 10,
2023, the Court of Appeal issued its opinion directing the court to vacate its January
order as to the authorization of electronic lists outside the examination room
and the disclosure of redacted affidavits of voter registration. 
 
Motion to Reconsider Acceptance of 170.6 Challenge
 
Peremptory
Challenges and Reconsideration Thereof 
 
“Section
170.6 permits a party to obtain the disqualification of a judge for prejudice,
upon a sworn statement, without being required to establish it as a fact to the
satisfaction of a judicial body. [Citation.] Where a disqualification motion is
timely filed and in proper form, the trial court is bound to accept it without
further inquiry.” (Barrett v. Superior
Court (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 1, 4.) 
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6(a)(2), a party may file a peremptory
challenge within a specified time. “As a general rule, a challenge of a judge
is permitted under section 170.6 any time before the commencement of a trial or
hearing . . . [S]ection 170.6[(a)], subdivision (2), includes three express
exceptions to the general rule: (1) the master calendar rule; (2) the all
purpose assignment rule; and (3) the 10 day/5 day rule. To determine whether a
peremptory challenge has been timely filed, the trial court must decide whether
the general rule or any of the three exceptions apply.” (Zilog, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1316 citing People v.
Superior Court (Lavi) (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1164, 1171-1173.)
 
Courts
have also adopted a further limitation for proceedings that are continuations
of prior proceedings. “When the second action or proceeding that is considered
to be a continuation of the earlier action or proceeding is assigned to the
same trial judge who presided over the earlier action, the litigants are not
permitted to exercise a peremptory challenge against that judge: Such a motion
is untimely, because it was not made before commencement of the earlier trial.
The reason for this further limitation on the right to peremptorily challenge a
judge under section 170.6 is to prevent a litigant from disqualifying the judge
most familiar with the facts of the case in the hopes of obtaining a more
favorable result.” (Maas v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 962, 979.)
 
In
the Los Angeles Superior Court, Department 1 is the proper department to hear
requests for reconsideration of orders accepting a peremptory challenge that
originated in the Central District. (LASC Local Rule 2.23(1); Geddes v. Superior Court
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 417, 426; Stephens
v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 54, 64–65; In re Marriage of
Oliverez (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1248.)  
 
23STCP02365
Is Not a Continuation of 22STCP03795 for Purposes of Section 170.6
 
George Gascon was added
to 23STCP02365 in the amended petition filed July 28, 2023. Gascon’s counsel
signed an acknowledgement of receipt on August 1, 2023 and filed the peremptory
challenge on August 9, 2023. Thus the peremptory challenge was timely unless an
exception applies. (Code Civ. Proc. § 170.6(a)(2).) No party had filed a
peremptory challenge in 23STCP02365. Accordingly, Gascon’s peremptory challenge
did not violate the “only one motion for each side” limitation. (The Home
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1025, 1032; Code Civ. Proc. §
170.6(a)(4).) 
 
Petitioner contends Respondent
Gascon’s peremptory challenge is barred by the continuation rule because it is
a continuation of 22STCP03795. (Mot. at 9:5-12:10. See Bravo v.
Superior Court
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1493 (“A peremptory challenge may not be made when
the subsequent proceeding is a continuation of an earlier action.”).) 
 
Petitioner asserts that the
cases are a continuation “is exactly why Judge Chalfant transferred the case to
his calendar in the first place.” (Mot. at 9:6-7.) Judge Chalfant ordered the
cases related, which does not resolve the issue presented here. (Bravo,
supra, 149
Cal.App.4th at 1494 (“The fact that the cases are related
does not resolve the issue of whether the second case is a continuation of the
first case for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6.”); Maas v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 962, 979 (“Case law has long established a
further limitation . . . In some situations, that is, when a second action or
special proceeding involves substantially the same issues and matters
necessarily relevant and material to the issues in the original case, the
second action or proceeding is considered a continuation of the earlier action
or proceeding for purposes of section 170.6.”) (quotations omitted).) 
 
As
argued by Gascon, (Gascon Opp. at 4:22-5:10), Petitioner’s cited authority
bears little resemblance to the instant case. Both Yokley v. Superior Court
(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 622, 627 and Garcia v. Superior Court of Riverside
County (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 47, 54 found habeas petitions were
continuations of the underlying criminal proceedings for purposes of Code of
Civil Procedure section 170.6. (Yokley, supra 108 Cal.App.3d at 624
(“for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, a hearing of an order
to show cause made returnable before the trial court by the Court of Appeal, to
make an inquiry as to a defendant’s competence to enter a plea of guilty or to
determine whether he had been denied effective assistance of counsel in the
trial court, is a continuation of a criminal trial.”); Garcia, supra, 92
Cal.App.5th at 55 (both proceedings related “to the conditions of Garcia’s
pretrial confinement,” including “whether the jail had to test him for
porphyria; had to provide him with Givlaari; had to provide him with (or at
least let him wear) protective clothing; had to provide him with a special
diet; and had to shield him from sunlight during transportation”).) 
 
The
court in National Financial Lending, LLC v. Superior Court (2013) 222
Cal.App.4th 262, 278 found a judgment creditor motion for impose liability was
a continuation of a receivership proceeding where both matters “will depend on
consideration of the relationship between PCF and NFL, Harkey’s control over
both entities and NFL’s failure to honor the notice of levy.” In Andrews v. Joint Clerks Port Labor Relations
Committee, San Francisco (1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 285, 300 the second
proceeding “sought the removal of the arbitrator, and the naming of a new
arbitrator . . . Thus, in effect, they sought a modification of the order
previously entered” in the first proceeding. No such considerations are present
here. The petition in 23STCP02365 does not seek to vacate or modify the
injunction order issued in 22STCP03795 and the 23STCP02365 does not depend on
the same considerations as the initial public records proceeding. 
 
In
reply, Petitioner cites Garcia v. Superior Court of Riverside County (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 47, 57-58 to highlight the court’s disjunctive statement of the
continuation rule. (Reply at 6:15-17. See Garcia, supra, 92
Cal.App.5th at 57-58 (“to be a continuation, the habeas proceeding had to
involve either the same issues or matters necessarily relevant and material to
the issues in the criminal action.”).) However, under either formulation the
second action is not a continuation of the first here. 
 
The
Court agrees with Respondents that the subsequent case does not involve the
same issues as the prior action. The first action sought to enforce public
record inspection rights, an issue Gascon has no substantive interest in,
whereas the second action seeks to alter the tally of a recall petition related
to Gascon’s elected office. The cases involve entirely different factual and
legal issues, Gascon was not a party to the first action, and the first action did
not affect his interests. Under the circumstances presented here, Gascon must
not be barred from filing a peremptory challenge. (Stephens v. Superior
Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 54, 61 (“If a new cause or contested proceeding
not involving substantially the same issues as an earlier finalized proceeding
is later commenced, a party who first appears in the new proceeding, and who
may have had no interest to protect in the earlier proceeding, should not be
barred from exercising a peremptory challenge under section 170.6 by a trial or
judicial determination of contested fact issues in the earlier proceeding.”).) 
 
The
second action also does not involve “matters necessarily relevant and material
to the issues in the original case.” (Maas, supra, 1 Cal.5th at 979.)
Whether the Registrar wrongly rejected the recall petition based upon a myriad
of asserted irregularities, the basis of 23STCP02365, is not relevant or
material to whether the Registrar improperly denied Petitioner access to
various public election records, the basis for 22STCP03795.
 
As
argued by Respondents, a similar subject matter and a common ultimate purpose are
not sufficient to support a finding that a subsequent case is a continuation.
(See e.g. City of Hanford v. Superior Court (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 580,
593 (“There is clearly a subject matter connection between the two cases.
However, . . . the legal issues raised by the two actions are quite distinct. .
. . The paramount questions presented by the two cases are different, and the
relationship of the issues in the two cases is not as direct as in the cases
where the second proceeding involves the very validity of the first order or
enforcement proceedings based on the original order. GWF’s suit is a new action
attacking a separate phenomenon and thus is not merely a continuation of the
earlier proceeding.); NutraGenetics, LLC v. Superior Court (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 243, 257 (“the second proceeding must arise out of the first
proceeding—not merely, as NutraGenetics suggests, out of the same incidents or
events that gave rise to the first proceeding.”).) The public records
inspection petition in 22STCP03795 “arises out of later events distinct from
those in” 23STCP02365, i.e. the separate and distinct denial or imposition of
restrictions upon Petitioner’s right to inspect records occurring after the
rejection of the recall petition. (Bravo, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at 1494.)

 
Petitioner also
argues the Respondents are judge-shopping, (Mot. at 12:11-13:19),
which is immaterial and does not require the reconsideration of Judge Chalfant’s
order. (See generally NutraGenetics, LLC
v. Superior Court (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 243, 260 (“Under the current state
of the law, if a motion complies with the statutory conditions, a court should
grant a disqualification motion—even if the court suspects that the party has
abused its right to utilize section 170.6. It is up to the Legislature to
address any concerns that the legal community has in this regard.”) (internal
quotation omitted); City of Hanford v. Superior Court (1989) 208
Cal.App.3d 580, 593 (“judicial efficiency is not to be fostered at the expense
of a litigant’s rights under section 170.6 to peremptorily challenge a judge.”).)

 
Petitioner has not demonstrated that Judge Chalfant’s acceptance
of the peremptory challenge should be reconsidered and vacated. Petitioner’s
motion is DENIED.
