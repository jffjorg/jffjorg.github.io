Judge grants Plaintiff's motion to transfer this action from the Santa Monica Courthouse in the West District to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Central District. The Local Rules allow Plaintiff to permissively file this action in the Central District, but the clerk's office mistakenly rejected Plaintiff's attempts and mandated filing in the West District.

The order to reassign 22SMCV02721 to the Central District will be issued shortly, and Plaintiff is responsible for giving notice.
