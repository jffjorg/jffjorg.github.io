And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to transfer a case from the Santa Monica Courthouse (West District) to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (Central District) of the Los Angeles Superior Court. The plaintiff, James Chavez, seeks to transfer the case due to a clerical error by the clerk's office, which mistakenly rejected his permissive filings in the Central District and mandated the filing in the West District. The court finds that the error was made by the clerk's office and that the plaintiff was prevented from filing the case in the Central District, which is a proper basis for a transfer between districts. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to transfer the case to the Central District.
