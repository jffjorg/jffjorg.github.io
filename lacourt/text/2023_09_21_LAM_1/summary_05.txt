Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Sean Clark, seeks to transfer his case, 23SMCV00021, from the Santa Monica Courthouse in the West District to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Central District. The plaintiff claims that the case was incorrectly filed in the West District due to a clerical error and that he has a right to have it transferred to the Central District. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a valid basis for the transfer. The judge notes that the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases between its districts and departments, and that the plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating that the case should be transferred. The judge also points out that the plaintiff's counsel selected Reason 3 on the civil case cover sheet addendum, which correlates with the location where the cause of action arose, and listed the relevant address as the former place of employment, which is within the West District. The judge concludes that the case was properly filed in compliance with the Local Rules and denies the plaintiff's motion to transfer the case with prejudice.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling is denying Plaintiff's Motion to Transfer District (case number 23SMCV00021) from the West District to the Central District. The Judge states that the Plaintiff, Sean Clark, failed to demonstrate that a transfer is warranted based on the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court. The case is currently assigned to Department P of the Santa Monica Courthouse, which is in the West District. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant, County of Los Angeles, employed him at 427 Encinal Canyon Road, Malibu, California 90265, which is in the West District. The Judge states that the Plaintiff's motion and supporting declaration refer almost exclusively to the Plaintiff's counsel's filing difficulties in a different case, 22SMCV02721 Chavez v. Santa Monica, and that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he properly attempted to file the instant case in the Central District and was unable to complete such filing. Therefore, the Judge denies the Plaintiff's motion with prejudice.
