Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Sean Clark, seeks to transfer his case, 23SMCV00021, from the Santa Monica Courthouse in the West District to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in the Central District. The plaintiff claims that the case was incorrectly filed in the West District due to a clerical error and that he has a right to have it transferred to the Central District. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a valid basis for the transfer. The judge notes that the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases between its districts and departments, and that the plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating that the case should be transferred. The judge also points out that the plaintiff's counsel selected Reason 3 on the civil case cover sheet addendum, which correlates with the location where the cause of action arose, and listed the relevant address as the former place of employment, which is within the West District. The judge concludes that the case was properly filed in compliance with the Local Rules and denies the plaintiff's motion to transfer the case with prejudice.

The judge emphasized that the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court clearly govern the proper filing location and Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a valid reason for transferring the case.
