However, the motion is denied because the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a proper basis for the transfer sought. The local rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases between its districts and departments, and the plaintiff's motion does not meet the requirements for transfer as outlined in the local rules. Additionally, the plaintiff's peremptory challenge is not properly before Department 1, and the plaintiff's request for recusal was denied by Judge Thomas Long, who is assigned to the case. The plaintiff's request for a stay of proceedings is also denied because it was not properly raised or supported by argument or citation to authority.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff's motion to transfer the case to another department and request for immediate stay of proceedings is denied. The Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a proper basis for the transfer sought, and the motion is based on various grievances against Judge Thomas Long, which are not properly before the court on a motion to transfer. The Plaintiff also fails to cite any authority supporting the proposition that a litigant may, via a motion to transfer, avoid the statutory procedures for disqualifying a judicial officer. The court notes that the case remains assigned to Judge Long for all purposes, and the Plaintiff's request for recusal was denied on August 15, 2023. The Plaintiff's peremptory challenge was also denied, and there is no basis for Department 1 to review that order. The motion is denied, and the Plaintiff's stay request is also denied as the Local Rules do not designate Department 1 as the proper department to consider the request.

Ultimately, the plaintiff has not demonstrated a basis for relief that can be granted by Department 1, and her motion is denied.
