The plaintiff's request for a stay of proceedings is also denied because it was not properly raised or supported by argument or citation to authority.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff's motion to transfer the case to another department and request for immediate stay of proceedings is denied. The Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a proper basis for the transfer sought, and the motion is based on various grievances against Judge Thomas Long, which are not properly before the court on a motion to transfer. The Plaintiff also fails to cite any authority supporting the proposition that a litigant may, via a motion to transfer, avoid the statutory procedures for disqualifying a judicial officer. The court notes that the case remains assigned to Judge Long for all purposes, and the Plaintiff's request for recusal was denied on August 15, 2023. The Plaintiff's peremptory challenge was also denied, and there is no basis for Department 1 to review that order. The motion is denied, and the Plaintiff's stay request is also denied as the Local Rules do not designate Department 1 as the proper department to consider the request.

However, the judge has tentatively ruled to deny the motion. The plaintiff's grievances against Judge Thomas Long are not proper grounds for transfer, and the plaintiff has failed to cite any authority supporting her proposition.

The plaintiff's request for a stay is also denied due to lack of argument or authority in the motion. Ultimately, the plaintiff has not demonstrated a basis for relief that can be granted by Department 1, and her motion is denied.

## English Summary:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to transfer their case to another department. The judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide a valid reason for the transfer, citing the specific grounds outlined in the Los Angeles Superior Court's Local Rules. 

The Plaintiff's motion was primarily based on personal grievances against the current assigned judge, Judge Long. The judge emphasized that these grievances do not constitute valid grounds for a transfer under the relevant laws and rules.  Furthermore, the Plaintiff's attempt to challenge Judge Long's impartiality through a peremptory challenge was deemed improper, as it was not filed through the correct procedures.

The Plaintiff also requested a stay of proceedings but failed to provide sufficient arguments or legal support for this request.  

Therefore, the judge ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to transfer and request for a stay were both denied.

### English Text Summary
The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to transfer the case to another department and requests an immediate stay of proceedings. The plaintiff, MAHJOUBI, had listed various grievances against Judge Thomas Long, but the judge found that these issues were not properly before the court on a motion to transfer. The plaintiff had also failed to cite any authority supporting the proposition that a litigant may avoid the statutory procedures for disqualifying a judicial officer via a motion to transfer. The judge noted that the plaintiff's recourse was to seek a writ with the Court of Appeal, and that Department 1 was not the proper department to consider the plaintiff's stay request. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion was denied.

**Case Number:** 20STCV36767

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Department:** 1

**Parties:** Jamileh Mahjobi (Plaintiff) vs David E Fermelia, MD (Defendant)

---

The plaintiff, Jamileh Mahjobi, filed a motion to transfer the case to another department and requested an immediate stay of proceedings. However, the motion has been denied by the judge.

The plaintiff failed to demonstrate a proper basis for the transfer sought. The Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases between its districts and departments. The plaintiff raised issues regarding the calendaring of motions, the denial of a "verbal" peremptory challenge, disagreement with court rulings, and a peremptory challenge "hereby submitted to Department 1." These issues are not properly before this Court on a motion to transfer.

The plaintiff does not cite any authority supporting the proposition that a litigant may, via a motion to transfer, avoid the statutory procedures for disqualifying a judicial officer. Until an assigned judicial officer is found to be disqualified in a procedurally proper manner, that judge has both an ethical and statutory duty to decide the cases assigned to them.

Judge Long denied the plaintiff's "oral motion to continue hearing and motion for the court to recuse itself" on August 15, 2023. The plaintiff's request for recusal should have been sought only by the parties to the proceeding and reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal.

The plaintiff's request for a stay was not supported by any argument or citation to authority. Additionally, the plaintiff's case is not assigned to Department 1 and the Local Rules do not designate Department 1 as the proper department to consider the plaintiff's stay request.

The plaintiff has not demonstrated a basis for relief that can be granted by Department 1. Accordingly, the plaintiff's motion is denied.
