And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff has filed a motion to transfer the case to another department and a request for an immediate stay of proceedings. However, the motion is denied because the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a proper basis for the transfer sought. The local rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court govern the assignment of cases between its districts and departments, and the plaintiff's motion does not meet the requirements for transfer as outlined in the local rules. Additionally, the plaintiff's peremptory challenge is not properly before Department 1, and the plaintiff's request for recusal was denied by Judge Thomas Long, who is assigned to the case. The plaintiff's request for a stay of proceedings is also denied because it was not properly raised or supported by argument or citation to authority.
