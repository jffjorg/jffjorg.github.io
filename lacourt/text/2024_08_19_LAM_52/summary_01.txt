And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

Based on the information presented, the Judge is granting the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant, SXC Studio City, LLC (SXC). The Judge finds that SXC's non-compliance with the court's order to serve responses to interrogatories and requests for production is a serious violation of discovery rules. SXC's failure to pay sanctions and comply with the court's order has prevented the plaintiff from conducting any discovery and may lead to trial by surprise. The Judge believes that terminating sanctions are appropriate in this case, and will strike SXC's answer and enter its default.

In addition, the Judge is ordering SXC and its counsel, Reza Sina, to pay the plaintiff $1,905 in sanctions. The Judge finds that the plaintiff reasonably incurred $1,845 in attorney fees and $60 in filing fees, but reduced the amount to $1,905 as the requested amount of $2,925 was excessive.

The Judge notes that the purpose of discovery is to make trial a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed, and that SXC's non-compliance has prevented the plaintiff from achieving this purpose. The Judge also cites relevant case law, including Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange and Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc., to support the decision.
