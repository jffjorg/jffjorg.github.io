And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Plaintiff Francesco Ferrario's motion to vacate the dismissal of the complaint. The case was dismissed on March 4, 2024, due to Plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at trial. However, the court finds that the non-appearance was due to an unforeseen circumstance, namely Plaintiff's counsel's illness. The court declines to impose a penalty and grants the motion to vacate the dismissal. The trial is set for July 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. All trial counsel are ordered to appear personally at 8:30 a.m.
