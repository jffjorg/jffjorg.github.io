And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Saideh Ghasemi Moghadam, to be relieved as Counsel. The motion was filed due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the judge notes that the case is now pending in Department 32 and orders Counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing, including information about all future hearings and proceedings. Counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service. The judge conditionsally grants the motion pending Counsel's compliance with these requirements.
