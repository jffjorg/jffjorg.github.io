The Court finds that the Defendant has shown it has a meritorious case, a satisfactory excuse for not filing a responsive pleading earlier, and acted diligently to set aside the default. The default was entered on March 21, 2023, and the Defendant filed the motion to vacate and set aside default on March 7, 2024. The Plaintiff, Marta Reinoso, opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant knew of the default earlier but failed to take action to set it aside. The Court finds that the Defendant has met its burden to show that it is entitled to relief.
