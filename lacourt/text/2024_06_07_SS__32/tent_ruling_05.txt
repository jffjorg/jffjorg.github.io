OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
March 11, 2022, Plaintiff Jose Chico (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Israel Ramon Gomez, Swift Transportation Co. of
Arizona, LLC, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc., and Does 1 to 25 for
negligence and negligent entrustment surrounding a motor vehicle accident.
Plaintiff alleges Israel Ramon Gomez was operating the subject vehicle and was
employed by Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC, Knight-Swift
Transportation Holdings, Inc. 
 
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One
and Requests for Production, Set One on Defendant Swift Transportation Co. of
Arizona, LLC (“Defendant”). (Jones Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) Defendant served initial
responses on November 3, 2023. (Id., Exh. 2.) The parties met and
conferred and on February 7, 2024, Defendant served supplemental responses. (Id.,
Exh. 4.) 
 
            Plaintiff now moves to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 13.1 and 13.2.
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions. Defendant opposes. Plaintiff separately
moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set One numbers 21
and 22. No timely opposition was filed by Defendant. 
 
The hearing for this matter was originally set for May 13, 2024. After
the tentative order was posted, Defendant’s counsel requested to be heard.
Since the Court was unavailable that day for oral argument, the hearing was
continued to June 7, 2024. (Min. Order, 5/13/24.)
 
            On May 13, 2024, Defendant filed a
late opposition to the motion to compel further responses to Requests for
Production, Set One.
 
            On May 24, 2024, Defendant filed a
sur-reply, without leave of Court, asserting it inadvertently failed to file
the opposition, which it served on Plaintiff on April 30, 2024. As a result,
Defendant asks the Court to consider the opposition under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473. However, section 473 gives the Court discretion to
relieve a party from “a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him.” Nonetheless, the Court will consider the untimely opposition as
it has no effect on the ruling herein. 
 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
On February 29, 2024, the parties appeared for a scheduled Informal
Discovery Conference (IDC) pursuant to the Court’s Eighth Amended Standing
Order. Therefore, the IDC requirement has been met. (Min. Order, 2/29/24.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I. Compel
Further Response to Form Interrogatories
 
            A.
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(a) provides that
“on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any
of the following apply:¿ 
¿ 
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete.¿ 
(2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.¿ 
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or
too general.”¿ 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(b)(1).) “Unless notice of this motion
is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).)¿¿ 
¿ 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(d).)¿¿¿
 
B.
Discussion
 
Here,
Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
numbers 13.1 and 13.2. Each involve discovery about sub rosa surveillance. Plaintiff
argues the objections lack merit and that the surveillance footage is not
privileged.  
 
Number
13.1 asks the following: 
 
“Have
YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF conducted surveillance of any individual
involved in the INCIDENT or any party to this action? If so, for each
surveillance state: (a) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the
individual or party; (b) the time, date, and place of the surveillance; (c) the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the individual who conducted the
surveillance; (d) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who
has the original or a copy of any surveillance photograph, film, or videotape.”
 
Defendant’s
supplemental response contains the following: 
 
“Objection. This interrogatory is
vague, ambiguous, and overbroad. SWIFT TRANSPORTATION objects to the extent
that this request improperly seeks information protected by both the
attorney-client and attorney work-product privileges, as well as to the extent
that this request seeks the premature disclosure of expert opinion and
information, and to the extent that this request seeks information prepared in
anticipation of litigation. (See, Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214; Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54
Cal.4th 480; Scripps Health v. Sup. Ct. (Reynolds) (2003) 109 Cal. App. 4th
529.) SWIFT TRANSPORTATION objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it
seeks information not relevant to the subject matter of the instant litigation
or the facts plead in Plaintiff's complaint. Subject to and without waiving the
aforementioned objections, Responding Party responds as follows: Surveillance
of Plaintiff Jose Chico was conducted on the following dates: 11/18/22, 11/21/22,
11/25/22, 12/6/22, 12/7/22, 12/13/22, 2/13/23, 2/14/23, 2/15/23, 3/14/23,
3/15/23, 3/16/23, 4/4/23, 4/5/23, 4/6/23, 5/3/23, 5/9/23, and 5/11/23.” 
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues this motion is moot since it served second further
responses on April 30, 2024, before this hearing. 
 
The
second further responses to 13.1 state: “[Defendant asserts the same objections
followed by:] Subject to and without waiving the aforementioned objections,
Responding Party responds as follows: Yes. (a) Plaintiff Jose Chico. On
information and belief, some of the dates in subsection (b) may include
surveillance that was inadvertently conducted on Plaintiff’s brother, Anibal
Chico. (b) 7/19/22, 7/20/22, 7/21/22, 11/18/22, 11/21/22, 11/25/22, 12/6/22,
12/7/22, 12/13/22, 2/13/23, 2/14/23, 2/15/23, 3/14/23, 3/15/23, 3/16/23,
4/4/23, 4/5/23, 4/6/23, 5/3/23, 5/9/23, and 5/11/23 (c) Phillip Cordero, Ruben
Basulto, and Gilbert Landeros of Specialized Investigations, 21550 Oxnard
Street #300, Woodland Hills, CA 91367; and Anthony Palacios and DeMarcus
Allison of Marshall Investigative Group, 401 Devon Ave., Park Ridge, IL 60068;
and (d) Responding Party’s counsel of record.”
(Herzog Decl. ¶
9, Exh. F.) 
 
            Plaintiff has not filed a reply in
response. Since these responses appear to respond to interrogatory 13.1, the
motion to compel is denied as moot.  
 
            Number 13.2 asks the
following: “Has a written report been prepared on the surveillance? If so, for
each written report state: (a) the title; (b) the date; (c) the name, ADDRESS,
and telephone number of the individual who prepared the report; and (d) the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who has the original or a
copy.” 
 
Defendant’s
supplemental response contains the following: 
“[Defendant
asserts the same objections in number 13 followed by:] Subject to and without
waiving the aforementioned objections, Responding Party responds as follows:
Yes, reports were prepared on the following dates: 12/14/22, 12/15/22 and
4/17/23 by Specialized Investigations, and 5/13/23 by Marshall Investigative
Group.”
 
The
second further response to 13.2 states: “[Defendant asserts the same objections
followed by:] Subject to and without waiving the aforementioned objections,
Responding Party responds as follows: Yes. (a) Surveillance Investigation
Report; (b) December 14, 2022, December 15, 2022, January 10, 2023, and April
17, 2023; (c) Phillip Cordero, Ruben Basulto, and Gilbert Landeros of
Specialized Investigations, 21550 Oxnard Street #300, Woodland Hills, CA 91367;
and (d) Responding Party’s counsel of record. (a) Confidential Report; (b) July
29, 2022 and May 13, 2023; (c) Anthony Palacios and DeMarcus Allison of
Marshall Investigative Group, 401 Devon Ave., Park Ridge, IL 60068; and (d)
Responding Party’s counsel of record.”
(Herzog Decl. ¶
9, Exh. F.) 
 
Similarly,
these second responses appear to respond to the interrogatory. Since Plaintiff
has not filed a reply, he fails to show they are deficient. Accordingly, the
motion to compel further is denied as moot. As a result, the Court declines to
award sanctions. 
 
II. Compel
Further Responses to Request for Production 
 
Plaintiff
also moves to compel further responses to Request for Production, Set One
numbers 21 and 22.
 
            A. Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a) provides that
on receipt of a response to a request for production of documents, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses if:¿ 
¿ 
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.¿ 
(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive.¿ 
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too
general.¿¿ 
 
A response
consisting of an objection must specify with particularly the document being
objected to, and, if based on privilege, must provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of this claim, including
if necessary, a privilege log. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240 (b), (c).) 
¿ 
The motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause
for the discovery and include a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b).) 
 
“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).)¿¿¿ 
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310 (h).) 
 
B. Discussion
 
Request for Production, Set One, number 21 asks the following:
“Any and all DOCUMENTS RELATING TO any surveillance of any individual
involved in the INCIDENT or any party to this action.” Number 22 asks
the following: “Any and all RECORDINGS depicting any and all parties to this
lawsuit, including but not limited to covert surveillance video otherwise known
as ‘sub rosa’ video.” 
 
Defendant
did not provide supplemental responses to numbers 21 and 22. The original
responses are identical and contain the following: 
 
“Objection. This request is vague,
ambiguous, and overbroad as to "surveillance." This request is
objectionable to the extent the information sought seeks to invade the attorney
client privilege and work product doctrine, seeks the premature disclosure of
expert opinion and seeks documents prepared in anticipation of litigation. (See
Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214;
Scripps Health v. Superior Court (Reynolds) (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 529.) SWIFT
TRANSPORTATION additionally objects to this request on the grounds that it is
not limited in scope, and is overbroad, burdensome, oppressive, and harassing.
SWIFT TRANSPORTATION objects to this request on the grounds that it seeks
information not relevant to the subject matter of the instant litigation or the
facts plead in Plaintiff's complaint.” 
 
Plaintiff
argues the objections, including those based on privilege and the work product
doctrine are without merit. 
 
i. Work
Product Doctrine 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2018.030 provides the
following: 
 
“(a) A writing that reflects an attorney's impressions,
conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories is not discoverable under
any circumstances. 
 
(b) The work product of an attorney, other than a writing
described in subdivision (a), is not discoverable unless the court determines
that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in
preparing that party's claim or defense or will result in an injustice.” 
 
“California’s
civil work product privilege is codified in section 2018.030. Subdivision (a)
provides absolute protection to any ‘writing that reflects an attorney’s
impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories.” … Such a
writing ‘is not discoverable under any circumstances.’ … Section 2018.030,
subdivision (b) provides qualified protection for all other work product.” (Coito
v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 488.) “[A]n objecting party may be
entitled to protection if it can make a preliminary or foundational showing
that answering the interrogatory would reveal the attorney’s tactics,
impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in opposing counsel
taking undue advantage of the attorney’s industry or efforts.” (Id. at
502.) “A party seeking disclosure [of material protected by qualified work
product] has the burden of establishing that denial of disclosure will unfairly
prejudice the party in preparing its claim or defense or will result in an
injustice.”  (Id. at 499.)
 
In Suezaki v.
Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 166, the California Supreme Court considered
whether a defendant’s surveillance footage of a plaintiff was privileged as a
matter of law. The Court held that the footage did not fall under the attorney
client privilege because it was not a “communication” between the client and
attorney, but that it was subject to work product protection. (Id. at
177–78.) However, the Court further explained that “the fact that the material
sought to be discovered is the ‘work product’ of the attorney is one factor to
be used by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion in determining
whether or not discovery should be granted.” (Id. at 178.) This
observation remains valid even under California’s since-enacted work product
statutes, because the work product statutes are “intended to be a restatement
of existing law relating to protection of work product” and are “not intended
to expand or reduce the extent to which work product is discoverable.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2018.040.)  Therefore, “[t]he trial court must consider all
the relevant factors involved and then determine whether, under all the
circumstances, discovery would or would not be fair and equitable.” (Suezaki,
supra, 58 Cal.2d at 178.) 
 
Here, Defendant has
admitted in Form Interrogatories number 13.1 and 13.2 that surveillance footage
exists.
 
According
to Plaintiff, on April 12, 2024, Defendant’s counsel stated that they did not
intend to use the videos at this time, but their position could change based on
witness testimony. (Jones Decl. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff argues the production is
needed to effectively prepare for trial as the evidence may be used to dispute
Plaintiff’s physical condition. It does not appear the parties have stipulated to
not use the footage at trial; rather, Defendant’s proposed stipulation is
conditional, despite trial being set for July 9, 2024. Therefore, there appears
to be good cause for the discovery. The discovery appears relevant to
Plaintiff’s condition, which will be at issue when assessing damages. It is
unclear how this footage or related documents could include expert opinion.
Therefore, these objections, including based on the scope and burden, are
without merit. The objection based on attorney client privilege is similarly
without merit. Lastly, though it is possible the production could constitute
attorney work product, Defendant fails to oppose this motion or set forth facts
demonstrating the doctrine applies. As stated above in Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.240
(c), the
party asserting work product must provide sufficient factual information for
other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log. Here, Defendant has not complied with section 2031.240. 
 
In
the untimely opposition, Defendant argues it offered to stipulate with
Plaintiff that it did not intend on using the surveillance video presently, but
that Defendant reserved the right to change its position later. (Opp., 3;
Herzog Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. F.) If, after completing discovery, Defendant decides
to use the surveillance footage, the footage would be provided to Plaintiff.
(Herzog Decl. ¶ 13–14.) Defendant asserts that Plaintiff did not agree to the
stipulation. Next, Defendant asserts the footage and documents are protected by
the work product doctrine. Defendant also argues Plaintiff will not be
prejudiced if the footage is withheld because Plaintiff already has knowledge
of his own physical condition. However, the declaration in support of the opposition
provides no facts supporting the work product objection. 
 
Therefore, because
Defendant fails to set forth facts that the work product doctrine applies, the
motion to compel further is granted. 
 
ii. Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
request $2,160 in monetary sanctions representing a $350 hourly rate and the
$60 filing fee. (Jones Decl. ¶ 21.) Sanctions are mandatory against the
unsuccessful party that opposes a motion to compel further discovery. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES as moot Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, numbers 21 and 22. Defendant shall serve
further responses within 15 days.
 
The Court awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,160 as to
Defendant and counsel for Defendant, jointly and severally, due payable to
counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days.
 
Plaintiff
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
