And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled that Defendants' motion to reopen expert discovery for a limited purpose is granted. The Court has found that while Defendants could have acted more diligently in setting dates for expert depositions, the time period at issue is relatively short and there does not appear to be prejudice in reopening discovery for a short period of time. The Court has reopened expert discovery for a limited purpose until June 16, 2024. The parties are encouraged to promptly meet and confer to schedule all outstanding discovery without the need for a further continuance.
