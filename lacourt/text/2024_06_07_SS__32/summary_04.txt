And here is the summary in English:

This tentative ruling is related to a case arising from an alleged motor vehicle collision with a pedestrian. The Defendants, Quick Fleet Services, Inc., Manuel Ayon Salazar, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Oscar Jacob Rubio, and OnTrac Logistics Inc., have filed a motion to continue the trial due to their counsel's pre-planned vacation. The Plaintiff, Dana Musharbash, opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendants did not diligently conduct discovery in the case. The Defendants counter that they need more time for expert discovery. The Judge finds good cause for a short continuance and grants the motion in part. The trial is continued to August 15, 2024, and all discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates shall remain in accordance with the July 15, 2024 trial date unless otherwise stipulated by the parties.
