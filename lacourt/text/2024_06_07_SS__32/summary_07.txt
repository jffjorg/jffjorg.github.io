Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Daniel Hakhamzadeh, counsel for Plaintiff Abelino Esquivel. The court has found that the breakdown in communication and disagreements with Plaintiff are valid reasons for withdrawal. However, the court has denied the motion without prejudice due to procedural defects. The court has requested that Defendant's counsel appear at the hearing to address an address discrepancy. The court has also ordered counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling.
