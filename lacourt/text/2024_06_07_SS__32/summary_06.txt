English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant, PPF AMLI 4242 Via Marina, LLC, argued that the service was defective and the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. However, the Judge found that the defendant failed to provide the plaintiff's correct address in the proof of service, violating the principles of procedural due process. The Judge also noted that an amended complaint was filed on May 20, 2024. As a result, the Judge denies the motion and orders the defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service.
