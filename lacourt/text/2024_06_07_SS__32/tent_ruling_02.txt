MOTION
 
On July 20,
2021, Plaintiff Adrien Aaron Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Juan Carlos Olvera, American Way Management, Inc., and Does 1 to 20
for negligence and negligent entrustment resulting from a motor vehicle
accident. 
 
            Defendants Juan Carlos Olvera
and American Way Management, Inc. (“Defendants”) now move to reopen discovery
to hear and rule on Defendants’ motion to compel depositions of Plaintiff’s
five retained experts. The motion is currently set for June 11, 2024. Plaintiff
opposes reopening discovery, and Defendant replies. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The complaint was filed on July 20, 2021. Trial was initially set for January 17, 2023. 
 
Defendants’
amended answer was filed on September 23, 2021.
 
On November 18,
2022, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial and all related dates
to November 2, 2023.
 
On February 28, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication as to Defendants’ first,
second, and third affirmative defenses. 
 
On September 6, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court
continued trial and all related dates to May 1, 2024. 
 
On April 16,
2024, at the final status conference, the Court continued trial pursuant to the
request of Plaintiff, to May 14, 2024. The discovery/motion cut off was closed.
(Min. Order, 4/16/24.) 
 
On May 8, 2024,
the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application and continued trial to June
17, 2024. Discovery remained closed. The parties were encouraged to meet and
confer to resolve their disputes and avoid a further delay of trial. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“On motion of any party, the court may grant leave to
complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard,
closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date
has been set.¿ This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd.
(a).)¿ 
¿¿ 
“In exercising its discretion to grant or deny this motion,
the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the leave
requested, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The necessity and
the reasons for the discovery.¿ (2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the
party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the
reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was
not heard earlier.¿ (3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing
the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set,
or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any
other party.¿ (4) The length of time that has elapsed between any date
previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd. (b)(1)-(4).)¿¿¿ 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Brian Goldberg, Defendants’ counsel, does not
describe a meet and confer effort with Plaintiff’s counsel to reopen discovery
in order to complete the expert depositions before trial.   
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff designated
his expert witnesses on March 12, 2024. The expert discovery proceedings
cut-off date was April 16, 2024. There are five expert witnesses that
Defendants seek to depose: Azadeh Farin, M.D., Anand Shah, M.D., Anthony
Reading, Ph.D., Hunter Vincent, D.O., and Michael Seruga. 
 
On March
19, 2024, Defendants served notices that unilaterally set the depositions for
all five experts. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served objections to the
depositions of Azadeh Farin, Anthony Reading, and Michael Seruga. On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff served objections to the deposition of Anand Shah and Hunter
Vincent. On the same days, Plaintiff offered alternative dates—except for
Michael Seruga’s deposition. 
 
A.
Azadeh Farin
 
On March
26, 2024, Plaintiff offered April 8, 2024 as an alternative date for Dr.
Farin’s deposition. (Goldberg Decl. ¶ 6.) Defendants served notice of
continuing the deposition to April 8, 2024, on April 1, 2024. (Id. ¶ 7.)
Then, on April 5, 2024, Plaintiff informed Defendants that Dr. Farin was no
longer available. Plaintiff offered a new date of April 15, 2024, but
Defendants’ counsel was unavailable that day. (Id. ¶ 8.) 
 
B. Anand
Shah 
 
On March
27, 2024, Plaintiff offered April 5, 2024 as an alternative date for Dr. Shah’s
deposition. (Goldberg Decl. ¶ 10.) On April 1, 2024, Defendants served a notice
continuing the deposition to April 5, 2024. (Id. ¶ 11.) However, on
April 2, 2024, Plaintiff informed Defendants that Dr. Shah was no longer
available on that date and offered April 9, 2024. (Id. ¶ 12.) On April
4, 2024, Defendants re-noticed the deposition for April 9, 2024. (Id. ¶
13.) On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff informed Defendants that Dr. Shah was no
longer available and offered April 15, 2024. Defendants were unavailable on
that day. However, Plaintiff’s email chain indicates that it was Defendants
that canceled the April 9, 2024 deposition, and requested an alternative deposition.
(See Chanchikyan Decl., Exh. 8.) 
 
C.
Anthony Reading
 
On March
26, 2024, Plaintiff offered April 15, 2024 as an alternative date for Anthony
Reading’s deposition. (Goldberg Decl. ¶ 16.) On April 1, 2024, Defendant served
a notice continuing the deposition for April 15, 2024. (Id. ¶ 17.) On
April 5, 2024, Plaintiff informed Defendants that Reading was no longer
available and offered April 16, 2024 instead. (Id. ¶ 18.) That day did
not work for Defendants. On April 26, 2024, Defendants requested alternative
dates from Plaintiff, but none were provided. (Id. ¶ 20.) Defendants
then unilaterally set the deposition for May 8, 2024. Plaintiff served
objections on April 30, 2024. (Id. ¶ 21, Exh. S.) 
 
D.
Hunter Vincent
 
 On March 27, 2024, Plaintiff offered April 16,
2024 as an alternative date for Hunter Vincent’s deposition. (Goldberg Decl. ¶
23.) On April 1, 2024, Defendants served a notice continuing the deposition
accordingly. (Id. ¶ 24, Exh V.) Then, on April 8, 2024, Plaintiff served
an objection stating that Vincent was no longer available. In the opposition,
Plaintiff offered April 17, 2024 as an alternative date. (Id. ¶ 25, Exh.
W.) 
 
E.
Michael Seruga 
 
On March
26, 2024, Plaintiff served an objection to Seruga’s deposition on the basis
that it was unilaterally set. The objection stated that Plaintiff would work
with Defendants to schedule the deposition on a mutually agreeable date.
(Goldberg Decl. ¶ 27, Exh. Y.) Defendants offer no evidence that they requested
alternative dates from Plaintiff. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff notes that Defendants failed to set forth a meet and
confer declaration. Plaintiff asserts that Defendants unilaterally set the
dates for all expert depositions and then delayed in confirming available dates
once Plaintiff provided them. For instance, Plaintiff argues that he provided
alternative dates on March 26, 2024 and March 27, 2024 and requested
confirmations as soon as possible, but Defendant waited until April 1, 2024 to
respond. (Chanchikyan Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 3.) As a result, the experts were no
longer available on the provided dates. Also, while this was occurring,
Plaintiff argues that Defendants failed to provide any available dates for
their own experts. (Id. ¶ 12.) 
 
In reply, Defendants do not address Plaintiff’s argument that they did
not confirm the deposition dates in a timely manner. While the Court agrees
that Defendants could have acted more diligently, the time period at issue is
relatively short. Further, there does not appear to be prejudice in reopening
discovery for a short period of time.
 
Accordingly, expert discovery as to currently pending depositions is
reopened until June 16, 2024, unless a later date and a trial continuance is
stipulated by the parties. The Court urges the parties to promptly meet and
confer in order to schedule all outstanding discovery without the need for a
further continuance.
 
Sanctions
 
In opposition, Plaintiff requests $2,100 in monetary sanctions. However,
the Court declines to award sanctions, finding that Defendants acted with
substantial justification in bringing this motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendants’
motion to reopen discovery for a limited purpose is GRANTED. 
 
Defendants to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
