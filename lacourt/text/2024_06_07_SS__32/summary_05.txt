And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The court's tentative ruling is based on the parties' motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production. The court grants the motion to compel further responses to Request for Production, Set One, numbers 21 and 22, and awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,160 to the plaintiff. The court denies the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, as moot.
