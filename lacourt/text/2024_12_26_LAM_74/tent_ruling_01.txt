  Case Number:  23STCV14455    Hearing Date:   December 26, 2024    Dept:  74 Moss v.
Lopez
Defendant Eduardo Lopez’s Motions to
Compel Response to Form Interrogatories and Deposition.
 
            On July 26, 2024, Defendant
propounded discovery on Plaintiff, including a notice to appear for deposition
and Form Interrogatories, set one (FROG). Because Plaintiff did not timely
comply with Defendant’s discovery requests, Defendant filed on October 17,
2024, motions to compel. Following the filing of the motions, Plaintiff has
served verified responses to the form interrogatories, making the motion to
compel those responses moot. Plaintiff has also offered dates to appear for his
deposition.
            CONCLUSION
            The
court deems the motion to compel interrogatory responses moot. The court orders
Plaintiff to pay Defendant’s counsel $1,155 in attorney’s fees (3 hrs x
$385/hr) and $1,065 in court reporter costs within 30 days.  (Houska Decl., ¶ 13.)
            The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s appearance at his
deposition. During the December 26 hearing, the court will order the date by
which Plaintiff must appear for his deposition. The court orders Plaintiff to
pay Defendant’s counsel $1,155 in attorney’s fees (3 hrs x $385/hr) within 30
days.
            Defendant
shall give notice.
