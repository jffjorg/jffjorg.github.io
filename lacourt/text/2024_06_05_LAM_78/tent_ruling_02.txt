Plaintiff alleges that she purchased a 2021 Alfa Romeo Stelvio vehicle in September 2021.  The purchase came with an express written warranty. The vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff with serious defects with the vehicle’s air conditioning, check engine light, battery, and infotainment screen, among other things. After Defendant could not repair the vehicle, Defendant failed to repurchase or replace the vehicle.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On November 13, 2023 Plaintiff Margarit Petrosyan filed her Complaint against Defendant FCA US LLC.On December 15 ,2023, Defendant Answered.On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to deem Requests for Admissions (RFAs) Admitted.On May 22, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.LEGAL STANDARDPursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b), “if a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response,” the propounding “party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).” The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Monetary sanctions are mandatory against a party, attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) Sanctions may be imposed for misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.030, subd. (a).) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.010, subd. (d).) Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348 provides that a court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery even if no opposition was filed. DISCUSSIONPlaintiff moves to deem the RFAs propounded on Defendant admitted. Plaintiff’s counsel testifies that he propounded written discovery requests on Defendant on December 19, 2023. (Aslanian Decl., ¶3.) After Plaintiff granted an extension, Defendant’s responses were due on February 6, 2024. (Id., ¶4.) Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant’s counsel, demanding that Defendant serve responses without objection by February 19, 2024. (Id., ¶7.) As of the filing of this motion, Defendant had not served responses. (Id., ¶5.)Defendant’s counsel testifies that she served responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests on April 4, 2024 and verifications on April 22, 2024. (Dao Decl., ¶4.) Counsel testifies that due to a high volume of lemon law cases received by her office, she inadvertently missed Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Id., ¶5.) Through inadvertent error, Defendant’s counsel failed to send the responses. (Id.) Defendant’s counsel did not know the responses had not been served until Plaintiff filed this motion. (Id.)Plaintiff argues on reply that Defendant’s verification was not proper because the person verifying the RFA response did not swear to the truth of the facts stated in the response. (Reply, Exh. 5.) Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.240(b) provides that a corporate party may submit verifications signed by an officer or agent of the party on its behalf. Here, the verification signed by staff counsel for Defendant states counsel reviewed the responses to the RFAs and believes the responses to be true and correct based on information from Defendant’s personnel and records. (Reply, Exh. 5.) An oath that the person verifying discovery responses believes that responses are true and correct would normally show that the person lacked the personal knowledge to verify the responses. However, Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.240(b) expressly allows an officer or agent of a corporate party to sign verifications under oath on the party’s behalf. As a practical matter, it would be difficult for an agent or officer of a corporate entity to have personal knowledge of all matters encompassed by discovery requests. Here, although Defendant’s staff counsel lacked personal knowledge of the matters in the RFA responses, he testified that he believed the responses were true based on information from Defendant’s personnel and records. The Court finds the oath is sufficient to verify the RFA responses as required by 2033.240. Defendant moves for relief from waiver of objections. Code Civ. Proc., sections 2033.280(a) provides that the court may, on motion, relieve a party from his waiver of objections to interrogatories if (1) the party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230, and (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The statutory language “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” in the discovery statute should be interpreted using the same general principles developed in application of the identical language in section 473, subdivision (b). (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 263, 275.) Although the party moving for relief under section 473 has the burden to show that the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect was excusable, any doubts as to that showing must be resolved in favor of the moving party. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420.)  Here, because Defendant failed to file timely responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs due to its counsel’s mistake and Defendant has since served responses, Defendant’s motion for relief from waiver of objections is granted.Plaintiff argues on reply that Defendant’s claim of inadvertent clerical error is unsupported by facts because Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff’s counsel’s communications about the missing discovery and did not serve responses until 28 days after Plaintiff filed this motion. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is sufficient to show Defendant’s counsel failed to file timely responses by mistake.Plaintiff also seeks sanctions under Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.280(c). Because Defendant’s responses were not timely served, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the amount of $1,986.65 for two hours of attorney time at a rate of $550 per hour and filing fees. Sanctions are imposed jointly and severally against Defendant and Defendant’s attorney.DATED:  June 5, 2024___________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
