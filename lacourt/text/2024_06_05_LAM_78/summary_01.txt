Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to seal certain records containing employee personal identifying information. The defendant argued that it has an overriding interest in maintaining the confidentiality of these records due to the personal identifying information contained within. The court found that the employees' interest in privacy overrides the public's interest in accessing the records. The parties had previously agreed to mark specific exhibits as confidential, and the proposed relief is narrowly tailored.
