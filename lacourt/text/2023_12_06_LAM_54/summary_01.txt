Significant Statements:
  - "The party seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as unconscionability." (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236)
  - "The Felisildas' claim against FCA directly relates to the condition of the vehicle that they allege to have violated warranties they received as a consequence of the sales contract. Because the Felisildas expressively agreed to arbitrate claims arising out of the condition of the vehicle – even against third-party nonsignatories to the sales contract – they are estopped from refusing to arbitrate their claim against FCA." (Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 497)
  - "This Court finds the reasoning in Ford persuasive and will follow it. Defendant is not entitled to compel arbitration under the lease."
