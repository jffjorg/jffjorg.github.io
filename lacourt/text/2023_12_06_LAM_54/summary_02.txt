Summary in English:

Judge Maurice Leiter has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Benyamin Aghachi's Motion to Strike the allegations made by Plaintiff Blair Carlton in a landlord-tenant action. The Judge denies the motion, finding that the allegations made by Plaintiff are sufficient at the pleadings stage to establish entitlement to punitive damages. The Judge cites Civil Code § 3294(a) and CCP §§ 435(b)(1) and 436 in support of this decision. The Judge notes that conclusory allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, but the stricken language must be read in the context of the facts alleged in the rest of the complaint. The case will proceed to a hearing on December 6, 2023, in Department 54 of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles.
