And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Dr. Krikor Kalindjian. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend for most of the causes of action brought by Sirena Hovagimyan in her individual capacity, except for the cause of action for wrongful death of her mother, Mary Babayan. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend for the causes of action for wrongful death, as they are duplicative and need to be asserted separately from claims for medical malpractice and medical negligence.

In Hovagimyan's capacity as Babayan's successor in interest, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend for the first cause of action, which improperly merges claims for wrongful death with claims for medical malpractice and medical negligence. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend for the fourth cause of action, which is for negligence per se, as there is no such thing as a cause of action for negligence per se.

The motion to strike is denied with prejudice as moot, as the ruling on the demurrer renders it unnecessary.
