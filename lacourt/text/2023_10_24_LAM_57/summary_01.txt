And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for relief from the order deeming admitted matters in the requests for admission, as well as the waiver of their objections to the requests. The plaintiffs had failed to serve timely responses to the requests, which led to the order deeming the matters admitted. The judge found that the plaintiffs' failure was not due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but rather was the result of inexcusable neglect. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' explanation for their failure to serve timely responses, which was a calendaring error, was not supported by the record. The judge noted that the record showed that the defendant's counsel had reminded the plaintiffs' counsel several times about the need to serve timely responses, and that the plaintiffs' counsel had asked for more time to obtain verified responses. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs' counsel could have served verified responses up to the time of the hearing on the Deemed Admitted Motion, but instead chose to file a non-opposition to the motion. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs' failure to serve timely responses was not the result of a calendaring error, but rather was inexcusable neglect, and therefore denied their motion for relief.
