And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of compromise in the minor Diego Won's case against Defendant Elida Ortiz, who is responsible for a dog bite incident that occurred in 2021. The settlement agreement is for $71,500.00, with $56,500.00 allocated to Diego and the remaining amount to be distributed among the other plaintiffs. The court notes that the settlement funds will be placed in a blocked account, not a trust, and that the Guardian Ad Litem/parent is expected to appear at the next hearing to confirm approval of the compromise. The petition will be granted if the Guardian Ad Litem confirms approval.
