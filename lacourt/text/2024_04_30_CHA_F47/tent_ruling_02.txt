Case #23CHCV00709
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 3/1/24.  
 
MINOR: Diego Won
GAL: Yolanda Won (parent)
Defendant: Elida Ortiz
 
RULING:   
 
This action arises out of dog bite incident that occurred
on 3/28/21 at Golden Valley Dog Park in Santa Clarita.  On that date, Defendant Elida Ortiz’s
(Defendant) dog bit minor Diego Won in the presence of his family members and
co-plaintiffs, Hanson Won (father, Hanson), Yolanda Won (mother, Yolanda) and
Nicolas Won (Nicolas, brother).  On
3/10/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant for: (1) strict
liability in tort, (2) negligence and (3) negligent infliction of emotional
distress.  No proof of service for the
complaint has been filed and Defendant has not appeared in the action.  
 
On 1/31/24, Yolanda, on behalf of Diego, filed the
instant petition for approval of compromise of the claim of Diego.    
 
The petition indicates that Defendant will pay a total of
$71,500.00 to settle all of the Plaintiffs’ claims in this action with
$56,500.00 being allocated to Diego and each of the other Plaintiffs receiving
$5,000.00.
 
The petition indicates medical expenses in the total
amount of $2,817.00 have been incurred with $342.00 having been paid.  Medical expenses in the amount of $2,475.00
are to be paid from the settlement. 
Additionally, attorney fees in the amount of $14,125.00 and expenses in
the amount of $1,965.95 are to be deducted from Diego’s settlement funds
leaving $37,934.05 to be paid to Diego who still has faint scars from the
incident.  
 
Item 18.b.(7) in the petition indicates that Diego’s
settlement funds are to be transferred to the trustee of a trust that is either
created by or approved in the order approving the settlement.  However, Item 10.c. and Attachment 18b(7) of
the petition, Item 9.c.(2) of the proposed Order to Approve the Compromise and
the proposed Order to Deposit Money Into Blocked Account indicate that Diego’s
settlement funds are to be placed in a blocked account which would fall under
Item 18.b.(2).  At the 4/2/24 hearing,
the Court confirmed with counsel that the settlement funds are to be placed
into a blocked account and not placed into a trust which would need approval by
the Probate Division.    
 
Diego’s Guardian Ad Litem/parent was unable to attend the
4/2/24 hearing.  Therefore, the matter
was taken under submission and continued to 4/30/24.  (See 4/2/24 Minute Order).
 
If the Guardian Ad Litem appears and confirms approval of
the compromise, the petition will be granted as noted in the 4/2/24 ruling.
