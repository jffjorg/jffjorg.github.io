The defendant, Linda Draves, filed a demurrer to the third cause of action of the plaintiff, Julie Kim's, complaint, alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress. However, on February 28, 2024, the plaintiff dismissed the third cause of action with prejudice. As a result, the demurrer is moot and the case will proceed without the third cause of action.
