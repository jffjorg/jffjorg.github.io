And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages allegations in the complaint. The defendant, Garfield Beach CVS, LLC, argued that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient specific facts to establish how the defendant acted with the requisite malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge agrees with the defendant and notes that the complaint does not provide specific information regarding the alleged "dozens of similar incidents across North America" and that the plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to establish corporate approval of the alleged wrongful conduct. The judge is granting the defendant's motion with 20 days leave to amend the complaint.
