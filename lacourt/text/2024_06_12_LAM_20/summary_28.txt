And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a case between Mark Fleming and Candace Nichols (the Plaintiffs) and Victor Robles and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transport Authority (LACMTA) (the Defendants). The Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging negligence against the Defendants. The Defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint does not meet the mandatory pleading standard for claims against a public entity. The Judge rules that the complaint does not adequately allege a statutory basis for liability against LACMTA, and that the Plaintiffs must amend their complaint to show compliance with the Government Claims Act. The Judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
