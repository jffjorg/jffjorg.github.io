```

And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Numark's motion to compel the deposition of Jennie Levin, without prejudice, on procedural grounds. The ruling states that Numark has not served Jennie Levin with a deposition subpoena, which is a mandatory requirement. Additionally, there is no evidence that Numark has personally served Jennie Levin with the motion papers. The Court cannot order a non-party to attend a deposition or take any other action without evidence that the non-party had notice and the opportunity to be heard. The ruling also denies both parties' requests for sanctions and expresses no view as to whether this ruling renders moot the motion for a protective order set for hearing on April 29, 2024.
