And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Vida Nikjoo. The defendants had previously noticed the depositions of all four plaintiffs, including Vida Nikjoo, but the plaintiff did not serve a written objection and did not appear for the deposition. The defendants inquired about the non-appearance, but no resolution was reached. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and grants the motion to compel. The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $60 to the defendants. The plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition and produce the requested documents on April 4, 2024, at 10 am by remote videoconference.
