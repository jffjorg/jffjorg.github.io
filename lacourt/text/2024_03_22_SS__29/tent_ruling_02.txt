 Case Number:  21STCV23847    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for
Good Faith Settlement Determination filed by Defendant Luis Rodriguez
 
The Court, on
its own motion, and for reasons related to its own schedule, continues the
hearing for approximately seven days, to a date that is convenient for the Court
and counsel.  
 
The Court recognizes
that this is the third attempt by Defendant Luis Rodriguez to obtain a good
faith settlement determination.  The
prior two attempts failed for lack of proof. 
This time, Luis Rodriguez does add some significant additional
information, including that Plaintiff Smith has not treated since approximately
2019 and that his total medical special damages are in the range of
approximately $15,000 (past and estimated future).  This is of assistance to the Court in
analyzing the Tech-Bilt factors, including the first factor.
 
The Court further
recognizes that Defendant Diaz has requested (as alternative relief) a
continuance to give her the opportunity to conduct additional discovery.  The Court would like to hear from counsel for
Diaz regarding what discovery is needed, why it was not propounded earlier
(including, for example, in connection with the first two motions for a good
faith settlement determination), and how long of a continuance is being
requested.Moving party to give notice.
