And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a new cause of action for elder and dependent adult financial abuse, neglect, and abandonment, and to remove the names of the plaintiff's former attorneys. The judge found that the proposed amendments are not well taken because the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide sufficient information about when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and because the proposed elder abuse claim is both untimely and would be subject to demurrer based on the statute of limitations. The judge also found that permitting leave to amend would be prejudicial in light of the plaintiff having previously sought and obtained trial preference for a bifurcated trial, and the court is now ready to set trial dates for the remaining causes of action. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
