And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Polaris Industries, Inc.'s motion to preserve the confidential status of portions of Aaron Deckard and Donald Zeck's deposition transcripts. The motion was made under a protective order that controls access to and dissemination of documents in the case. Polaris argued that the designated portions of the transcripts contain trade secrets and that public disclosure of the information could harm their business interests. The plaintiff, Sophia Soli, opposed the motion, arguing that Polaris had not established a sufficient basis for maintaining the information as confidential and that the information is of public interest. The judge found that Polaris had established a sufficient basis for maintaining the information as confidential and granted the motion.
