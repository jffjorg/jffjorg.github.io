And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Lisa Flores, to strike certain parts of the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Erika Toroya. These parts relate to punitive and exemplary damages, which are damages that are awarded in addition to compensatory damages to punish the defendant for their wrongdoing.

The judge is granting the defendant's motion with 10 days leave to amend. This means that the defendant can re-file the complaint with changes to the allegations that address the judge's concerns.

The judge's decision is based on the fact that the complaint does not adequately allege that the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, which are the elements required to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to specifically plead how the defendant's conduct caused additional injuries and damages beyond the initial accident.

The judge is also citing several California court cases that support their decision, including Brooks v. E.J. Willig Truck Transp. Co. (1953) 40 Cal.2d 669, which held that a hit-and-run driver can only be liable for additional damages if the act of fleeing the scene caused the plaintiff additional harm.
