Lofton from this case.  Plaintiff’s motion (6571) set for hearing on September 9, 2024 is DENIED as MOOT.  Also, the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion (3671) to recuse Hon. Joel L. Lofton is ADVANCED from October 9, 2024 to this date (September 9, 2024) and VACATED.Background            Plaintiff has filed recusal motions  against Hon. Joel L. Lofton on May 21, 2024 and July 18, 2024.  Both motions were denied.  (6/24/24 Minute Order; 8/26/24 Minute Order.)  This third recusal motion was filed on July  25, 2024.  There is also a fourth recusal  motion against Hon. Joel L. Lofton that was filed on August 27, 2024 and is to  be heard on October 9, 2024. Discussion Effective September 3, 2024, an order was made that this action,  previously assigned to Judge Joel L. Lofton is assigned to Judge Lauren A.R.  Lofton, in Department X at Alhambra Courthouse.  (8/27/24 Notice of Case Reassignment and Order  for Plaintiff to Give Notice.)  Plaintiff’s request is now moot because this case is no longer pending  before Judge Joel L. Lofton.  Therefore,  Plaintiff’s motion is moot and shall be denied as such.  Plaintiff’s fourth motion to recuse Judge Joel L. Lofton will be advanced  and vacated—because that motion is moot for the same reasons as this motion:  this case is no longer pending before Judge Joel L. Lofton.
