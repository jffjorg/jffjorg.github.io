And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff has filed a motion to recuse Judge Joel L. Lofton from the case, citing concerns about the judge's impartiality. However, the judge has previously denied two similar motions, and a third motion was filed on July 25, 2024. The judge has also assigned the case to Judge Lauren A.R. Lofton, effective September 3, 2024. As a result, the plaintiff's motion to recuse Judge Joel L. Lofton is now moot, and the judge has denied it as such. Additionally, the plaintiff's fourth motion to recuse Judge Joel L. Lofton will also be advanced and vacated, as the case is no longer pending before Judge Joel L. Lofton.
