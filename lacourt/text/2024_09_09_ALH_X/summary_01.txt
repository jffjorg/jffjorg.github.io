And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint will add allegations regarding the plaintiff's recent visit to the defendant's coffee shop and website accessibility barriers identified by a certified professional. The judge found that there was no sufficient showing of prejudice to the defendant in the amendment and that allowing the amendment would not vitiate the defendant's opportunity to challenge the validity of the additional claims. The plaintiff is to file the proposed amended complaint within 10 days, and any responsive pleading is due within 20 days of service. The judge also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice.
