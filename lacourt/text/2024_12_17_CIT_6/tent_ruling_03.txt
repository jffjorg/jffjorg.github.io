 Case Number:  23PSCV02513    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiffs  Daniel Tomes and Maureen Tomes’ Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Esteban Ramirez  TENTATIVE RULING              Plaintiffs’  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $57,419.84. Prior to the  hearing on December 17, 2024, Plaintiff shall submit a new Proposed Judgment to  reflect the amounts approved herein.   BACKGROUND                        This  is a construction dispute. On August 17, 2023, plaintiffs Daniel Tomes and  Maureen Tomes (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action against defendants  Esteban Ramirez (Ramirez), Western Surety Company (Surety), and Does 1 through  30, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, rescission, negligence,  disgorgement of funds aid, license bond, fraud, negligent misrepresentation,  and common count. On August 13, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Surety from the  complaint.              On  September 29, 2023, Surety filed a cross-complaint for interpleader against  Plaintiffs, Javier Ortiz, Ramirez Esteban dba S R Construction, and Does 1  through 50, alleging one cause of action for interpleader.              On  October 7, 2024, default was entered against Ramirez. Plaintiffs also submitted  a default judgment package, which was denied without prejudice. On December 3,  2024, Plaintiff submitted documents addressing the matters set forth in the  Court’s October 29, 2024 ruling.            LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiffs seek  default judgment against Ramirez in the total amount of $59,380.50, including $49,215.00  in damages, $8,244.00 in interest, and $1,921.50 in costs. The Court finds  Plaintiff’s additional documentation resolves the Court’s concerns noted in its  prior tentative ruling. (See Order re Tentative Ruling (10/29/24).) The Court  only finds the prejudgment interest calculation to be excessive. The complaint  does not allege facts of Plaintiffs giving notice of rescission to Ramirez or  restoring or offering to restore everything of value to Ramirez, which are  necessary for a rescission claim. (Civ. Code, § 1691; see Compl., ¶¶ 9-18.)  However, by filing and serving the complaint, Plaintiffs satisfied those  requirements. (Civ. Code, § 1691, hanging paragraph [“When  notice of rescission has not otherwise been given or an offer to restore the  benefits received under the contract has not otherwise been made, the service  of a pleading in an action or proceeding that seeks relief based on rescission  shall be deemed to be such notice or offer or both”].) Thus, the date of  prejudgment interest runs from the date Plaintiffs filed this action, not from  the date of the earlier payments. (Hayt v. Bentel  (1913) 164 Cal. 680, 686 [“Until rescission, or a demand for repayment, nothing  was due, and interest was not allowable”].) The Court calculates Plaintiffs’  prejudgment interest in the amount of $6,283.34 (at the rate of 10% from August  17, 2023 through November 25, 2024 (466 days)). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ request for entry of default judgment in the reduced amount of  $57,419.84.  CONCLUSION                        Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ request  for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $57,419.84. Prior  to the hearing on December 17, 2024, Plaintiff shall submit a new Proposed  Judgment to reflect the amounts approved herein.
