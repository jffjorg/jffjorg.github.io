And here is a text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Sergio Urtez, sought default judgment against the defendant, Felipe Garcia, individually and dba Garcias Concrete, for breach of contract, negligence, and disgorgement of construction funds. The judge found that the plaintiff's default judgment package contained several defects, including a lack of admissible evidence in support of the request for entry of default judgment, conflicting damage amounts in the package, and failure to comply with procedural due process requirements. Additionally, the judge noted that the maximum amount of damages alleged in the complaint is $128,700.00, and therefore the plaintiff cannot seek any principal damages greater than that. The judge's decision denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment, but does not prevent the plaintiff from re-filing the request once the defects are corrected.
