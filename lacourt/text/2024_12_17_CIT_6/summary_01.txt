And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant Tucker Lincoln's motion for attorneys' fees, but reduces the total amount requested by 40% or $94,213.00. The reduced amount is $141,319.50. The Judge finds that Defendant Lincoln is the prevailing party due to the judgment of dismissal with prejudice entered in his favor. The Judge also finds that the case involved abatement of public nuisance and enjoining use of a building in connection with a controlled substance, which makes Lincoln eligible for attorneys' fees under Civil Code section 3496 and El Monte Municipal Code section 1.19.030. However, the Judge reduces the amount of attorneys' fees due to excessive billing and duplicative work. The Judge notes that the case was not particularly complex and that not all of the attorneys, paralegals, and law clerks billed were necessary or reasonable to justify the requested billed amount.
