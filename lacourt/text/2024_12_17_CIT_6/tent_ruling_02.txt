 Case Number:  23PSCV00826    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Sergio Urtez’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendant: Felipe Garcia, individually and dba Garcias Concrete TENTATIVE RULING           Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           BACKGROUND                       This  is a construction dispute. On March 20, 2023, plaintiff Sergio Urtez (Plaintiff)  filed this action against defendant Felipe Garcia, individually and dba Garcias  Concrete (Defendant) and Does 1 to 50, alleging causes of action for breach of  contract, negligence, and disgorgement of construction funds.             On  October 8, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.             On  November 14, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package.           LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $161,330.37,  including $160,000.00 in damages and $1,330.37 in costs. The Court finds  Plaintiff’s default judgment package contains some defects. First, the  declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel is in support of an application for  publication of summons, and provides no information or evidence in support of  the request for entry of default judgment. (See generally Forberg Decl.  (11/14/24); Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [a  defaulting defendant admits only the well-pleaded facts concerning liability;  the plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of  damages].) Second, the principal damage  amounts requested between the Request for Entry of Default Judgment and  Proposed Judgment conflict with each other, with the former seeking $160,000.00  and the latter seeking $128,700.00. (CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (a); JUD-100, ¶ 6,  subd. (a)(1).) Third, the maximum amount of  damages alleged in the complaint is $128,700.00, so Plaintiff may not seek any principal  damages greater than that. (Compl., ¶ 27.) Relief awarded in a default  judgment cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 585; Paterra v. Hansen (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 507, 536; Greenup v.  Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) “Procedural due process requires ‘that a  defendant be given notice of the existence of a lawsuit and notice of the  specific relief which is sought in the complaint served upon him. The logic  underlying this principle is simple: a defendant who has been served with a  lawsuit has the right, in view of the relief which the complainant is seeking  from him, to decide not to appear and defend. However, a defendant is not in a  position to make such a decision if he or she has not been given full notice.’  [Citation.]” (Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th  1024, 1031.) .) “The purpose of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 580 is to  require the plaintiff to provide notice of the maximum amount of the  defendant's potential liability.” (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy  (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1174; see also Becker v. S.P.V. Constr. Co. (1980)  27 Cal.3d 489, 494 [“a prayer for damages according to proof passes muster  under section 580 only if a specific amount of damages is alleged in the body  of the complaint. [Citation]”.) Thus, “a default judgment greater than the  amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the [trial] court's  jurisdiction.” (Id. quoting Greenup, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 826.) Fourth, Plaintiff’s counsel did  not sign any of the signature blocks in the Request for Entry of Default  Judgment. (CIV-100, ¶¶ 3, 6, 7.) CONCLUSION                        Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
