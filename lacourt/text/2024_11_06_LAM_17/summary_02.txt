And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's demurrer to the cross-complaint is sustained, with 10 days leave to amend. This means that the cross-complaint is ineffective and must be refiled in a revised form. The judge has also dismissed the motion to strike, as it is no longer necessary since the cross-complaint has been rendered moot. The judge has ruled against the cross-complainants on several grounds, including that the cross-complaint is barred by the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel, that it fails to allege how the cross-complainants were damaged by the alleged breach of contract, and that P2MG is not in good standing with the California Secretary of State. The judge has also ruled that the cross-complaint is uncertain regarding whether it is alleging breach of contracts other than the indemnity agreement, that Nelson lacks standing to assert breach of contracts other than the indemnity agreement, and that the surety bonds were not issued for the benefit of P2MG. Finally, the judge has ruled that there is no actual controversy between the plaintiff and the cross-complainants, and therefore, declaratory relief is not warranted.
