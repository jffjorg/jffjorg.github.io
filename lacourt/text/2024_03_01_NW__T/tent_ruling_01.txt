Introduction
Plaintiffs Martha Michel-Aquino
and Pedro Aquino (collectively, Plaintiffs) moved for their attorneys’ fees,
costs, and expenses against Defendant For Motor Company (Defendant). 
Plaintiffs requested $31,244.50 in attorneys’ fees plus a 0.5 enhancement of
$15,622.25, which totals fees to $46,866.75.  Plaintiffs also requested
$7,290.04 in costs and expenses. 
Procedure
Defendant made a cursory argument
that the Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the instant motion because the
action was dismissed on January 31, 2024.  Defendant failed to present any
legal authority to support the contention and the argument is unpersuasive. 
In any event, the Court retains jurisdiction to determine ancillary matters,
such as costs and attorney fees.  (Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1281, 1290.)  Plaintiff need not request the court to retain jurisdiction
over ancillary matters.  The Court reviewed the substance of the motion.
Discussion
Plaintiffs asserted entitlement
to attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party per Civil Code section
1794(d).  The statute provided in pertinent part that Plaintiff is
entitled to “a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer.”  (Id.)  There
is no dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties. 
Statutory attorney fees are
ordinarily determined by the court pursuant to the “lodestar” or “touchstone”
method. However, the Court’s discretion is somewhat limited in fee awards under
the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  The statute takes a different
approach from customary statutory or contractual provisions.  The statute
requires an “initial determination of the actual time expended; and then to
ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual
time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended are
reasonable.  These circumstances may include, but are not limited to,
factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill
exhibited and the results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge
being made for the time expended is not reasonable under all the circumstances,
then the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.” In the situation of a contingency fee arrangement, the court in Nightingale
stated, “for purposes of section 1794, subdivision (d), a prevailing buyer
represented by counsel is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees for
time reasonably expended by his or her attorney.”  (Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818 (citing
to Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104-105, fn.
6.)  Plaintiffs’ Counsels asserted that they took the case on a
contingency basis.  (Roger Kirnos Decl. par. 9.)  Because the
Counsels took on Plaintiffs’ case on a contingency basis, Plaintiff is entitled
to reasonable fees for the time reasonably expended by Counsels. 
Defendant argued that the fees
should be denied entirely or reduced to $14,388.50 on the grounds of
unreasonableness as to the rate and time expended.  The time expended and
the rates charged by Plaintiffs’ counsels are: (1) 23 hrs. at  $325/hr.
for 2022 and $375/hr. for Associate Armando Lopez; (2) 2 hrs. at $425/hr. for
2022 and $450/hr. for 2023 for Partner Amy Morse; (3) .7 hrs. at $425/hr. for
Senior Associate Deepak Devabose; (4) 5 hrs. at $495/hr. for Associate Debra
Reed; (5) 12.5 hrs. at $495/hr. for Senior Attorney Jacob Cutler; (6) 8 hrs. at
$345/hr. for Associate Katti Trinh;  (7) 5.4 hrs. at $395/hr. for 2022 and
$425/hr. for 2023 for Senior Associate Maite Colon; (8) 3.7 hrs. at $375/hr.
for Outside Counsel Mitchell Rosensweig; (9) 4.3 hrs. at $350/hr. for Associate
Maxwell Kreymer; and (10) 11.2 hrs. at $450/hr. for Associate Phil
Thomas.  (Roger Kirnos Decl. pars. 29-38.)  The total hours expended
by all Counsels is 75.8 hours.  The Court finds that the rates and hours expended
to be reasonable and necessary based upon the skill displayed throughout the
litigation and the amount of success achieved. 
Defendant argued that the use of
ten different timekeepers is unreasonable and unnecessary.  Defendant
failed to present legal authority to show that the number of attorneys assigned
to a case as being a factor in determining the reasonableness of time expended
or the fees incurred. 
Defendant argued that entries
were block-billed.  “Block billing” is a time-keeping method in which
attorneys and legal assistants record the total daily time spent on a case
rather than itemizing the time spent on specific matters. (Mountjoy v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 279.)  However, the entries
cited by Defendant are not considered as block-billing because the entries
showed the time spent on specific matters.  The Court does not find that
Counsels block-billed.
Defendant further argued that
there are entries that are duplicative.  Duplication of work is seen to be
an unreasonable charging of time.  Defendant provided that Plaintiffs’
counsels duplicated 1.4 hours of work performed by Armando Lopez.  (Hannah
Biemann Decl., Exh. G.)  Due to the unnecessary duplication, Mr. Lopez’s
hours are reduced by 1.4 hours or $525.00.  Plaintiff’s fees are reduced
by $525.00. 
Defendant argued that the
attorneys also billed for clerical work and for internal communication. 
The fact that some of the hours expended by attorneys were clerical in nature
or internal communications, by itself, is insufficient to show unreasonableness. 
At least as to internal communications, communication within a law office is
seen to be a reasonable charging of time so that the case is managed properly.
Defendant further disputed the
lodestar multiplier as being unjustified.  It is Plaintiff’s burden of
proof to show that the enhancement is primarily to compensate counsel at a rate
reflecting the risk of nonpayment in contingency cases as a class. 
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.)  The aim is to compensate
attorneys at fair market value as an inducement to accept these cases. 
(Id.)  Plaintiff failed to provide any facts to show that the hourly rates
are below fair market value.  Plaintiff failed to meet their burden to
show grounds for an enhancement.  The request for a 0.5 enhancement is
DENIED.
Plaintiffs’ motion for fees is
GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part.  Plaintiffs’ fees are reduced to
$30,719.50 and Plaintiffs’ request for an enhancement is DENIED. 
As to costs, Plaintiffs
requested  $7,290.04 as seen in the Cost Memo.  Defendant argued that
Plaintiffs failed to attach supportive documentation to the Cost Memo. 
However, initial verification of the Cost Memo is sufficient.  There is no
requirement that supportive documentation be attached to the Cost Memo. 
Supporting documentation must be submitted when costs have been put into issue
by way of a motion to strike/tax costs.  (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.)  Defendant’s initial argument is
unpersuasive.  Further, Defendant requested that the Court not consider
any supporting documentation submitted with the reply.  However, the
evidence submitted in response to the opposition arguments are to be
considered.  Because Defendant raised the issue, Plaintiffs are allowed to
provide supportive documentation in response.  Defendant’s request to not
consider any supportive documentation submitted with the reply is unpersuasive.
However, Defendant’s argument
that they would not be afforded an opportunity to respond to Plaintiff’s reply
is persuasive.  So that Defendant is afforded an opportunity to respond to
Plaintiffs’ reply, the Court CONTINUES the hearing solely as to the motion’s
request for “Costs and Expenses” and the Cost Memo.  Defendant is provided
an opportunity to file a response to Plaintiffs’ reply.
