DISCUSSION:
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
            Defendant
moves for summary judgment on the First Amended Complaint.
 
            As
Defendant is not entitled to summary adjudication of all causes of action,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
Motion for Summary Adjudication
 
            Defendant
Ohio Security Insurance Co. moves for summary adjudication of each of the three
remaining causes of action and the claim for punitive damages. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The lack of opposition by a plaintiff is
not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a defendant cannot meet
their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy Stores, Inc. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the Articles of
Organization for 17th Street Complex LLC filed with the California
Secretary of State on June 25, 2012; (2) the Statement of Information for 17th
Street Complex LLC filed with the California Secretary of State on July 27,
2022; (3) the Articles of Organization for 17th Street, LLC filed
with the California Secretary of State on April 23, 2020; and (4) the Statement
of Information for 17th Street, LLC filed with the Secretary of
State on February 22, 2021. Defendant’s requests are GRANTED pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452(c) (official acts). 
 
Plaintiffs’ Untimely Opposition
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c subdivision (b)(2) expressly states that any
opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication must be
served and filed no later than 14 days before the date the motion is to be
heard. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c subd. (b)(2).) Plaintiffs’ opposition papers
were filed with the Court on November 18, 2024, merely eight days before
the scheduled November 26 hearing. Further, the included proof of service
states that the papers were served on Defendant’s counsel by email on November
17, 2024, which is (1) a Sunday and (2) a mere nine days before the
hearing. 
 
            On November
26, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation in which Defendant waived any
objection to the untimely filing and service of the opposition. (November 26,
2024 Stipulation No. 2.) The Court will therefore overlook the untimely filing
and consider Plaintiffs’ opposition to the extent it bears on the Court’s
ruling. 
 
Defendant’s Improper Separate Statement
 
            Defendant’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Fact does not comply with the
requirements of the California Rules of Court. Defendant’s Separate Statement
sets forth each issue raised in the notice of motion, verbatim, and separately
identifies each cause of action and claim for damages at issue, as required by
the Rules of Court. (Rule 3.1350 (b), (d)(1)(A).) Rather than listing each
supporting material fact separately as to each issue, as required by
subdivision (d)(1)(B), Defendant has instead listed all 58 of its claimed
material facts first, and then incorporated by reference only material facts
numbered 1 through 31 as to each of the four issues raised on the motion. The
parties’ November 26, 2024 stipulation clarifies that the Separate Statement
contains a typographical error, erroneously identifying facts 1 through 31
instead of 1 through 58. In light of the parties’ stipulation, the Court finds
this error to have caused no prejudice to Plaintiffs and will consider the
Separate Statement on its merits.
 
Plaintiffs’ Evidentiary Objections
 
            Plaintiffs
purport to object to portions of the evidence relied upon by Defendant in
support of its motion. However, Plaintiffs’ objections do not (1) identify the
name of the document in which the specific material objected to is located; (2)
state the exhibit, title, page, and line number of the material objected to;
(3) quote or set forth the objectionable material, and (4) stathe grounds for
each objection in the format required by the Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 3.1354(b).) The Court therefore declines to address Plaintiffs’
evidentiary objections as they have not been properly presented. 
 
First Cause of Action: Breach of Contract
 
            Defendant
moves for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for breach of
contract on the grounds that Plaintiffs committed insurance fraud, thereby
voiding the contract. 
 
To prevail on a claim for breach of
contract, a plaintiff must plead and prove (1) a contract; (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) the defendant’s breach; and (4)
resultant damage to the plaintiff. (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific
Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388.) 
 
Under California law, an insurer
may defend against a claim for breach of contract as to an insurance policy—and
seek summary judgment thereon—on the grounds that the policy is voided by the
plaintiff’s violation of a “fraud and concealment” provision. (Cummings v.
Fire Ins. Exchange (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1415-16 quoting Claflin
v. Commonwealth Ins. Co. (1884) 110 U.S. 81, 94-97.) “A false answer as to
any matter of fact, material to the inquiry, knowingly and willfully made, with
intent to deceive the insurer, would be fraudulent. . . . And if the matter
were material and the statement false, to the knowledge of the party making it,
and willfully made, the intention to deceive the insurer would be necessarily
implied.” (Cummings, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at 1416 quoting Claflin,
supra, 110 U.S. 81 at 95.) 
 
According to Defendant, Plaintiffs,
17th Street Complex, LLC and 17th Street, LLC, are
separate entities sharing the same registered agent, manager, and chief
executive officer, Pourang Nassi. (Separate Statement of Undisputed Material
Fact Nos. 5-6.) Defendant asserts that 17th Street Complex, LLC, owned a parcel
of real property at 722 E. 8th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90021, but
sets forth no material facts supporting this assertion. “This is the Golden
Rule of Summary Adjudication: if it is not set forth in the separate statement,
it does not exist.” (United Community Church v. Garcin (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 327, 337 [italics in original].) 
 
In any case, the evidence and
material facts indicate that Defendant issued an insurance policy for the
property at 722 E. 8th Street numbered BZS 600058362, naming 17th
Street LLC as the Named Insured, and covering the period from July 3, 2020 to
July 3, 2021. (SSUMF Nos. 1-2.) On October 14, 2020, Defendant received notice
of a fire which had occurred on the property the day before. (SSUMF No. 4.) On
October 14, 2020, Defendant’s representative contacted Pourang Nassi and
requested a complete copy of any lease agreements, a detailed description of
tenant improvements made by Crown Fabrics, Inc., and a rent ledger and profit
and loss statement for 2020. (SSUMF No. 7.) Plaintiffs’ public adjuster, Glenn
Nahmias, responded on Plaintiffs’ behalf and produced two leases on October 27,
2020. These lease agreements consisted of (1) a lease from Pourang Nassi to
Massoud Nassi and Crown Fabric Co. for 722 E. 8th Street (SSUMF Nos. 9-10) and
(2) a lease from Pourang Nassi to Jesus Cristain Valle Cruz for 722 E. 8th
Street Unit B. (SSUMF Nos. 11-12.) The lease to Mr. Cruz stated that rent on
the property was $7,490 per month for a term from March 1, 2018 to February 28,
2023, with a 5% annual increase in rent. (SSUMF Nos. 13-15.) 
 
On October 28, 2020, Plaintiffs’
agent requested an advance payment on the claim of $250,000 for loss of the
building and $50,000 for loss of income. (SSUMF No. 16.) Defendant requested
further documentation, including a rent ledger and a Sworn Statement for
Advance Payment. (SSUMF Nos. 17-18.) Plaintiffs produced a Sworn Statement for
Advance Payment executed by Pourang Nassi on November 6, 2020. (SSUMF No. 19.)
The advance payment was issued on November 9, 2020. (No. 20.) Plaintiffs
subsequently produced a summary of the Rent Roll with supporting documentation
on January 26, 2021, which showed that Mr. Cruz paid $7,864.50 per month for
rent in January and February 2020 and $8,257.72 per month from March through
October. (SSUMF Nos. 22-23.) In April 2021, Pourang’s father, Massoud Nassi,
stated that he collected Mr. Cruz’s rent each month at the direction of Pourang,
and that Mr. Cruz paid approximately $4,000 of rent by check and the remainder
by cash, but that the exact amount would vary from month to month. (SSUMF Nos.
29-30.) Pourang Nassi corroborated his father’s statements. (SSUMF Nos. 33-35.)
On June 10, 2021, counsel for Plaintiffs produced copies of checks from Mr.
Cruz to Massoud Nassi’s business, Crown Fabric, which purport to be rent
payments for amounts ranging from $4,575 and $4,809. (SSUMF Nos. 36-37.) On
July 8, 2021, Massoud Nassi reaffirmed his prior statements, and stated that he
deposited Mr. Cruz’s rent checks into Crown Fabric’s bank account, but not the
cash payments, which Massoud admitted he spent or used himself. (SSUMF Nos.
43-46.) 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs
cannot pursue a claim for breach of contract under the policy because the
policy is voided by the “fraud or concealment” provision in Paragraph C of
Endorsement No. BP 01 55 02 20 attached to the policy. (See SSUMF No. 3.) This provision
states:
 
We do not provide coverage to the
insured who, whether before or after a loss, has committed fraud or
intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance
concerning:
 
a.      
This Policy;
 
b.     
The Covered Property
 
c.      
That insured’s interest in the Covered property; or
 
d.     
A claim under this Policy.
 
(SSUMF No. 3.) Defendant’s argument attempts to rely on
repeated statements, both orally and in writing, by Mr. Cruz that he only paid
approximately $4,500 in rent, plus utilities, and did so exclusively by check.
(SSUMF Nos. 24-25; 52-55.) Mr. Cruz also purportedly denied that he signed the
document produced by Plaintiffs’ agent as his lease and stated that the
document did not accurately reflect his rent. (SSUMF Nos. 56-57.) Defendant
also claims that Mr. Cruz said on March 25, 2021 that Massoud Nassi had
instructed Mr. Cruz not to cooperate with Defendant, and to sign paperwork
verifying that he had paid higher rent than he had actually paid. (SSUMF Nos.
26-27.)  Thus, Defendant argues,
Plaintiffs intentionally misrepresented the amount of rent collected from Mr.
Cruz in order to defraud Defendant. 
 
            Defendant’s
argument is fatally defective because it is premised entirely on the out-of-court
statements by Mr. Cruz regarding the rent he actually paid and the veracity of
the lease documents to establish the falsity of Plaintiffs’ representations.
Certainly, the records containing these statements might fairly be construed as
business records in light of the evidence produced as to the time, sources, and
methods of preparation of those records. (See Declaration of Jonathan Lawlee
ISO Mot. ¶ 2; Evid. Code § 1271.) However, the statements by Mr. Cruz within
those records are plainly barred by the rule against hearsay evidence. (Evid.
Code § 1200.) What is more, the only affidavit signed by Mr. Cruz is in
Spanish, and the purported translation is both unsigned and unaccompanied by an
affidavit by the translator affirming the accuracy of the translation. (Defendant’s
Exhs. 24-25.) (See Evid. Code § 751.) Mr. Cruz’s affidavit is therefore also
inadmissible on this separate grounds. Further still, although Defendant claims
that the signatures on the rent checks do not match Mr. Cruz’s signature, that
contention is not set forth in the Separate Statement. “This is the Golden Rule
of Summary Adjudication: if it is not set forth in the separate statement, it
does not exist.” (United Community Church v. Garcin (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 327, 337 [italics in original].) 
 
            Because
Defendant has offered no admissible evidence establishing the falsity of any
representations made by Plaintiffs, Defendant has not demonstrated that the
“fraud or concealment” provision voids the policy and defeats Plaintiff’s
breach of contract claim. As Defendant has not carried its burden in this
respect, the burden does not shift to Plaintiff to demonstrate a triable issue
of fact, and Defendant is not entitled to summary adjudication of this cause of
action.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the first cause of action for
breach of contract is DENIED. 
 
Second Cause of Action: Breach of Implied Covenant of
Good Faith
 
            Defendant
moves for summary adjudication of the second cause of action for breach of the
implied covenant of good faith on the grounds that no policy benefits were due
in light of Plaintiffs’ purported fraud, and, alternatively, that Defendant
acted reasonably in denying coverage. As Defendant has offered no admissible
evidence which tends to establish fraud, the Court is unmoved by these
contentions.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the second cause of action is
DENIED.
 
Third Cause of Action: Reformation
 
            Defendant
moves for summary adjudication of the third cause of action for reformation of
the contract on the grounds that “Plaintiffs have no evidence […] that Ohio
Security agreed to issue a policy to 17th Street Complex, LLC.” (Motion
p. 24:11-13.) This contention does not carry Defendant’s burden on summary
adjudication, as Defendant must produce evidence, and not merely point out
through argument, that Plaintiffs do not possess and cannot reasonably obtain
needed evidence. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th
826, 854.) Defendant is therefore not entitled to summary adjudication of this
cause of action.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the third cause of action is
DENIED.
 
Punitive Damages
 
            Defendant
also moves for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages
on the grounds that Plaintiffs have no evidence that Defendant acted with
fraud, oppression, or malice, as defined by Civil Code section 3294. Once
again, it is not sufficient for Defendant to assert that Plaintiffs have no
evidence: Defendant must produce evidence, and not merely point out through
argument, that a Plaintiffs do not possess and cannot reasonably obtain needed
evidence. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, at p. 854.)
Moreover, to the extent Defendant relies on the contention that it acted
reasonably in denying coverage, that line of argument fails for the reasons
stated above as to the first cause of action. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the claim for punitive damages
is DENIED. 
 
Conclusion
 
            For the
reasons stated above, Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED in
its entirety. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED. 
 
            Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
