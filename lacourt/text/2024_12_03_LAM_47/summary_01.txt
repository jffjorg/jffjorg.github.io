And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a third-party subpoena for records from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. The motion was brought by the defendants and cross-complainants, who are seeking to prevent the production of the records. The court has found that the code of civil procedure requires that the entity in control of the records be served with notice of the motion, which has not been done in this case. As a result, the court has continued the motion to January 2, 2025, and ordered the defendants to give notice to all interested parties and file proof of service with the court.
