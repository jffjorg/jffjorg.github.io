STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion.
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants misappropriated funds intended for the
purchase of a 2008 Sea Ray 44 Sundancer boat. 
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants
move to quash a third-party subpoena for records propounded to the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants
move to quash a third-party subpoena for records propounded by
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants to the California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration. Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3, under which this motion
is brought, expressly requires that the witness from whom the records are
sought be served with notice of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1985.3(g).) Here,
Defendants’ proof of service states only that notice of this motion was given
to Plaintiffs through their counsel of record. The Court cannot issue an order
regarding the production of subpoenaed records without the entity in control of
those records having notice that the issue is before the Court. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to
Quash Subpoena is CONTINUED to January 2, 2025, at 9:00 AM. Defendants are
ordered to give notice to all interested parties, including the entity in
possession of the records sought, and to file proof of service with the Court
showing that service was made on those entities in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(b). 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
