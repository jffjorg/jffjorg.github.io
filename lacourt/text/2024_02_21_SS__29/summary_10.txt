And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which involves a motion to compel a response to a request for a statement of damages and three motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The judge has denied the motion to compel a response to the request for a statement of damages as moot, since the plaintiff has since served a statement of damages. The judge has also denied the request for sanctions in this motion.

The three motions to compel further responses to discovery requests are being continued for approximately 30 days, and the defendants are being ordered to file updated separate statements that comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345. The judge notes that the reasoning of Justice Moor in the case of City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466 is persuasive, and that the California Supreme Court has granted review of this case.

The judge is aware that the dispute over whether the plaintiff should be required to serve a statement of damages is still ongoing, and that the dispute over whether the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests are adequate is also ongoing. The judge is continuing the hearing on the motions to compel further responses to discovery requests for approximately 30 days, and will reconsider the matter at that time.
