 Case Number:  20STCV17661    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Motions to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Benjamin Arsenian.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On May 8, 2020, Plaintiffs Brian Quirante and
Jenny Dang (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against City of
Santa Monica, Big Blue Bus, Stanley Jackson Jr., and Does 1 to 10 for Motor
Vehicle Negligence and General Negligence stemming from an auto accident
occurring July 26, 2019.
On January 30, 2024, Benjamin Arsenian filed these motions to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiffs. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted
at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by
either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts
between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice and Order to be Relieved as Counsel, forms MC-051 and MC-053.
However, Counsel failed to use form MC-052 for his declaration to be relieved
as counsel for each Plaintiff. Use of that form is mandatory. (See California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c) [“The motion to be relieved as counsel must be
accompanied by a declaration on the Declaration in Support of Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil [form MC-052].”].) 
Further, the
proof of notice attached Counsel states service of these documents was by
electronic mail, but the attached declaration does not provide how the email
address’s currentness was confirmed with Plaintiff Dang; instead it is based on
“information and belief.” (Arsenian Decl., ¶ 6.) This does not meet the
requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362(d), “[a]s used in this
rule, ‘current’ means that the address was confirmed within 30 days before the
filing of the motion to be relieved. Merely demonstrating that the notice was
sent to the client's last known address and was not returned or no electronic
delivery failure message was received is not, by itself, sufficient to
demonstrate that the address is current.”
Accordingly, the
Court finds counsel has not satisfied the procedural requirements for a motion
to be relieved. The motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
