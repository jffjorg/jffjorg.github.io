And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the proof of service and answer filed by the defendant, Lovepreet Singh. The plaintiff claims that the Lovepreet Singh who was served and answered the complaint is not the same person intended in the complaint. The plaintiff believes that the driver's license attached to the answer is different from the one in the CHP officer's report, and that the correct Lovepreet Singh has now been served. The judge has quashed the service on Lovepreet Singh and struck the answer filed on November 28, 2023.
