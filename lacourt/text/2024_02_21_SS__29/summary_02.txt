And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Asserted without prejudice. The motion was filed by the Defendant, Francisco Jose Maisch, in response to the Plaintiff, Brad Bello's, failure to respond to Requests for Admission served on May 12, 2023. The Judge finds that the Defendant failed to effect proper service on the Plaintiff, as the Plaintiff is representing himself in pro per and email service is not mandatory for pro per litigants. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff did not respond to the Requests for Admission, and therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
