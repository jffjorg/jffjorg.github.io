And here is a summary in English text:

The City of Los Angeles has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the defect in the sidewalk where the plaintiff, Elizabeth Moran, tripped and fell was trivial and not a dangerous condition. The plaintiff disagrees, claiming that the City is liable for the injury. The Judge has considered the evidence and argues that the defect was not trivial and that the condition of the sidewalk was dangerous. The Judge denies the City's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of fact and that the case should go to trial.
