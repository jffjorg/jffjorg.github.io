Francisco Jose Maisch.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On April
23, 2020, Plaintiff Brad Bello (“Plaintiff”) filed his complaint against
Defendant Francisco Jose Maisch (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 30 for motor vehicle
negligence arising out of an accident on April 25, 2018.  Defendant filed his answer to the complaint
on November 19, 2021.
 
On April
28, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved as
counsel
 
On May
12, 2023, Request for Admissions was served on Plaintiff by regular mail and
email. (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)
 
On July
10, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to deem the truth of the matters
asserted. The motion was served by email only. 
The hearing was set for March 27, 2024. 
On December 14, 2023, Defendant gave notice, by email only, that the
hearing had been rescheduled for February 21, 2024.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission by regular mail and email. (Mittskus
Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
Defendant filed this motion and served Plaintiff, who is
representing himself in pro per, by email only. 
Although email service may be mandatory for represented parties,
litigants who are in pro per are not subject to mandatory email service, and
Defendant has presented no evidence that Plaintiff has consented to email
service.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6,
subd. (c)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B).)
 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED without prejudice for failing to effect proper service.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s
Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Asserted in Request for Admission
without prejudice..
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
