Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Lyft's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims against them. The plaintiff, Shanai Denera Beime, filed a complaint against Lyft, Inc. and others after an automobile accident on June 30, 2021. Lyft filed a motion to compel arbitration, claiming that the parties had agreed to arbitrate their disputes in the terms of service that the plaintiff had accepted. The judge found that Lyft had met its burden of showing that an agreement to arbitrate existed between the parties and that the agreement was enforceable. The judge also found that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applied to the arbitration agreement, and that the FAA's procedural rules required the court to grant the motion to compel arbitration and stay the litigation pending completion of the arbitration. The judge ordered the plaintiff and Lyft to arbitrate the claims in the complaint, and stayed the litigation of the plaintiff's claim against Lyft pending the outcome of the arbitration.
