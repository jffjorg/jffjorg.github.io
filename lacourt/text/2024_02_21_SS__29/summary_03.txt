```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion of Counsel Benjamin Arsenian to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiffs, Brian Quirante and Jenny Dang, without prejudice. The motion was denied because Counsel failed to use the required forms, specifically the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form MC-052), and because the proof of notice attached to the motion did not demonstrate that the email address of Plaintiff Dang was current. The Judge has given Counsel notice of the denial and has delayed the effective date of the order relieving Counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
