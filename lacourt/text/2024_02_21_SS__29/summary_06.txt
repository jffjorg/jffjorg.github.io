The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case with the number 22STCV05449. The hearing date is set for February 21, 2024, in Department 29. The Judge excuses the need for the claimant and the guardian ad litem to appear in person, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call instead. The Judge has reviewed the Petition for Minor's Compromise filed on January 10, 2024, and finds that the proposed settlement and requested attorney's fees are fair and reasonable, and that the settlement satisfies all applicable substantive and procedural requirements. Therefore, the petition is granted. The Judge sets an order to show cause (OSC) for proof of deposit of funds in a blocked account, with a date to be determined. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this OSC.
