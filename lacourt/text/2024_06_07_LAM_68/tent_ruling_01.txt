SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Michael Williams alleges the purchase of
2086-2088 Santa Rosa Ave., Alta Dena, in August 2022. Plaintiff requested help
with a loan modification, due to affordability concerns. Plaintiff was
convinced to take out a $134,000 loan for a construction project that would
increase rental income to the property. Plaintiff signed certain documents
without understanding the agreements. 
 
Withdrawals from Plaintiff’s subsequently began occurring
from a separate annuity account, and were transferred to an account not opened
by Plaintiff. A second “hard money” loan from defendant Civic for $787,500 was
also executed on the property, which Plaintiff alleges was fraudulently
acquired. Plaintiff also discovered the loan was for $150,000, without any
receipt of the proceeds from said loan. Plaintiff contends the loan contained
false income information and violated state and federal disclosure laws.
Plaintiff also maintains identity theft. The delinquent loans subsequently led
to a non-judicial foreclosure sale.
 
On February 28, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
Identity Theft (Civil Code § 1798.93), Fraud, Penal Code § 496, Negligence,
Notary Fraud (Civil Code § 1189), Broker Liability for Fraudulent Concealment,
Cancellation of Instruments, Quiet Title, Unjust Enrichment, Unfair Business
Practices, and Injunctive Relief. On February 28, 2020, the court issued a
temporary restraining order. On June 23, 2020, the court denied the motion for
preliminary injunction.

Defendants Civic Financial Services, Civic Securitization
Trust II, and Civic Holdings III Trust (Civic) move for summary judgment as to
the ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fifteenth causes of action
in the fifth amended complaint. Plaintiff in opposition challenges the right to
enforce a fraudulently obtained loan in that Civic intentionally disregarded
“red flags” indicating a fraudulent loan application. Civic in reply maintains
no triable issues of material fact exist regarding classification of the loan
as anything other than a business transaction. 
 
The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)  
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
The Civic defendants are named in this action solely as
funders of a certain loan. Civic maintains it only takes in information
presented, and makes its funding decisions from the applications. Civic only
makes commercial loans for nonowner occupied properties. Civic denies any signs
of a fraudulent or unauthorized loan on behalf of Plaintiff. [Declarations of
Thomas French and Joan Spaeder-Younkin, and Compendium of Exhibits.] Plaintiff counters
that internal standards followed by Civic, as established in the deposition of
Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) Sean Daily, required verification as to the
accuracy and veracity of the loan. Plaintiff contends Civic disregarded its own
standards in approving the loan without sufficient verification. [Declaration of Michael Anderson, Appendix of Evidence, Ex.
A: Deposition of Sean Daily.]
 
While the entire complaint arises out of the course of
conduct leading to the funding of the loan, the individual causes of action present
varying claims for recovery. The court therefore individually addresses each
item.
 
9th Cause of Action, Predatory Lending:
Granted.
Civic challenges the claim for predatory lending on
grounds that the underlying loan remains outside the statutory scope of
protection for pleading the subject cause of action. The cause of action is
governed by California Financial Code section 4970, et seq. The section begins
with definitions:
 
“(b) ‘Covered
loan’ means a consumer loan in which the original principal balance of the loan
does not exceed the most current conforming loan limit for a single-family
first mortgage loan established by the Federal National Mortgage Association in
the case of a mortgage or deed of trust, and where one of the following
conditions are met:
(1) For a
mortgage or deed of trust, the annual percentage rate at consummation of the
transaction will exceed by more than eight percentage points the yield on
Treasury securities having comparable periods of maturity on the 15th day of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the application for the
extension of credit is received by the creditor.
(2) The
total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before closing for a
mortgage or deed of trust will exceed 6 percent of the total loan amount.
...
“(d) ‘Consumer
loan’ means a consumer credit transaction that is secured by real property
located in this state used, or intended to be used or occupied, as the
principal dwelling of the consumer that is improved by a one-to-four
residential unit. “Consumer loan” does not include a reverse mortgage, an open
line of credit as defined in Part 1026 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (Regulation Z), or a consumer credit transaction that is secured by
rental property or second homes. “Consumer loan” does not include a bridge
loan. For purposes of this division, a bridge loan is any temporary loan,
having a maturity of one year or less, for the purpose of acquisition or
construction of a dwelling intended to become the consumer's principal
dwelling.”
 
(Fin.
Code, § 4970.)
 
Civic
offers no argument over the conforming limit applicable at the time, or the
interest rate and fees, and instead challenges the term “consumer loan.” The
application itself identifies the purpose of the loan as one for investment
purposes as a nonowner occupied property. The declaration of French attests
that Civic only made the loan because of the commercial nature of the
transaction, and company policy against underwriting residential, consumer loans.
[French Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.] French also represents “due diligence” in accepting the
application and approving the loan. [French Decl., ¶¶ 6-8, 12-14.] Civic
disputes any claims of a fraudulent signatures. [French Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.]
 
Civic PMK
Sean Daily confirms lending business practices for nonowner occupied business
purpose investment loans. [Spaeder-Younkin Decl., ¶ 9, Compendium of Exhibits,
Ex. 9, Deposition of Sean Daily, Director of Underwriting, 56:2-4.] Daily
reviewed the application and notes both the represented revenue and income
valuation. [Daily Depo., 58:7-59:4.] In response to the question regarding the verification
process for nonowner occupied claims, Daily references database resources for proof
of representation in order to ascertain any potential “red flags” or
“anomalies” rendering the loan unreasonable or fraudulent. On the instant loan,
Daily specifically considered the existence of a third party tenant lease,; the
stated income; and, an investor statement regarding an “exit strategy” upon
completion of redevelopment/conversion of the property into a triplex for the
purpose of a sale. [Daily Depo., 59:23-60:25, 61:5-10, 84:14-23.]
 
Plaintiff
in opposition challenges the content of the application as both forged, and
incorporating false information. [Anderson Decl., Appendix of Evidence, Ex. 2:
Declaration of Michael Williams.] Plaintiff in fact admits to signing a series
of documents presented at a Starbucks on Lake Avenue to which he lacked
knowledge and understanding, while also categorially maintaining the loan
application documents for the underlying $787,500 loan were forged. [Williams
Decl., ¶¶ 7, 9.] Plaintiff appears to at least in part suggest the forgery/fraudulent
application based on the provision of a phone number, residential and e-mail
address not related to Plaintiff in any way. The statement of $117,000 in
income, “strategy letter,” and “Letter of Explanation” regarding development
plans, are also categorically disputed. [Williams Decl., ¶¶ 10-16.]
 
The court
finds no factually supported dispute regarding the representation that Civic in
fact considered the application submitted on behalf of Williams by the broker
defendant. Given the admission to signatures, albeit without making an effort
to read or understand the documents, the court declines to examine the
credibility Plaintiff’s declaration for purposes of determining the existence
and/or scope of fraudulent conduct by the broker. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (e); Desert Outdoor Advertising v.
Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 866,
872.)
 
 
The court
therefore lacks the ability to definitively determine the existence of actual
forged signatures given the admission of signing documents at the Starbucks
location with the notary present.
 
Nevertheless,
accepting the statements of inflated income, nonowner occupied, and intent to
build a triplex and sell the premises as an income property as
misrepresentation of fact placed by the broker, the court can and will consider
the content from the perspective of the reasonableness of Civic in approving
the loan application. Plaintiff seeks to establish triable issues of material
fact on grounds that Civic effectively breached an unarticulated standard of
care for review based on certain questionable entries admitted by Sean Daily in
deposition. More specifically, Civic improperly reviewed the loan application
in that it failed to sufficiently authenticate the application, thereby funding
an unaffordable loan based on inflated stated income, false declarations of
non-owner occupied, and future income property development plans. [Anderson
Decl., Appendix of Evidence, Ex, 2: Deposition of Sean Daily, 24:11-13,
29:4-19, 30:4-15, 34:2-24, 48:21-49:9, 51`:3-18, 57:21-24, 59:5-9, 74:23-75:4,
80:2-15, 99:8-11, 115:16-20, 120:5-25, 121:8-9, 125:7-11, 132:5-8.]
 
Plaintiff
presents no legal foundation for such an argument however, including a basis
for imposing a duty of care on potential lenders to determine whether
underwriting verification requirements impose a burden of confirmation
distinguishing a consumer residential versus a non-covered commercial loan
notwithstanding the purported representation on the application. Although not
cited by Plaintiff, the anti-predatory lending statute prohibits a lender from
making an unaffordable “covered” loan, which squarely address the claims raised
in the opposition, if the subject loan in fact constitutes a covered loan. 
 
“(1) A
person who originates covered loans shall not make or arrange a covered loan
unless at the time the loan is consummated, the person reasonably believes the
consumer, or consumers, when considered collectively in the case of multiple
consumers, will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation
based upon a consideration of their current and expected income, current
obligations, employment status, and other financial resources, other than the
consumer's equity in the dwelling that secures repayment of the loan. In the
case of a covered loan that is structured to increase to a specific designated
rate, stated as a number or formula, at a specific predetermined date not
exceeding 37 months from the date of application, this evaluation shall be
based upon the fully indexed rate of the loan calculated at the time of
application.
 
“The
consumer shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay
the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer's total
monthly debts, including amounts owed under the loan, do not exceed 55 percent
of the consumer's monthly gross income, as verified by the credit application,
the consumer's financial statement, a credit report, financial information
provided to the person originating the loan by or on behalf of the consumer, or
any other reasonable means.
 
“(2) No presumption
of inability to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation shall arise
solely from the fact that at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer's
total monthly debts, including amounts owed under the loan, exceed 55 percent
of the consumer's monthly gross income.
 
“(3) In
the case of a stated income loan, the reasonable belief requirement in
paragraph (1) shall apply, however, for stated income loans that belief may be
based on the income stated by the consumer, and other information in the
possession of the person originating the loan after the solicitation of all
information that the person customarily solicits in connection with loans of
this type. A person shall not knowingly or willfully originate a covered loan
as a stated income loan with the intent, or effect, of evading the provisions
of this subdivision.”
 
(Fin.
Code, § 4973, subd. (f).) 
 
The statute also provides liability for broker related
conduct, though it remains unclear whether Civic constitutes a “person” under
the statute. “If a person who originates covered
loans makes a loan where the person knew of and showed reckless disregard for a
violation of this division by a broker, the person and broker shall be jointly
and severally liable for all damages awarded under this division with respect
to the broker's unlawful conduct.” (Fin. Code, § 4974, subd. (b).)
 
The motion
for summary adjudication to the subject cause of action itself relies on
statutory inapplicability, while Plaintiff relies on a required finding of a covered
consumer loan. In considering the unmade arguments, the court fist cites to the
general rule: a financial institution owes no duty of care above and beyond the
role as a lender, unless the bank undertakes additional duties. “Liability to a
borrower for negligence arises only when the lender ‘actively participates’ in
the financed enterprise ‘beyond the domain of the usual money lender.’” (Nymark v. Heart Federal Savings & Loan
Association (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1089, 1096; Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 741.) 
 
A lender can arguably be found liable
for knowingly aiding and abetting a fraudulent actor, like a broker, in making
an unaffordable loan. (See Casey v. U.S. Bank Nat. Assn. (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1145; see also Chance World Trading E.C. v. Heritage
Bank of Commerce (N.D. Cal. 2005) 438 F.Supp.2d 1081, 1084, aff'd (9th Cir.
2008) 263 Fed.Appx. 630 [“California courts have acknowledged that the tort of
aiding and abetting is at odds with statutory limitations on bank liability”].)
Plaintiff makes no such claim or showing of
knowledge, and instead depends on circumstance, speculation, negligence, or
even mistake to establish the claim for a predatory loan.
 
The cause of action therefore
relies on a finding for a standard of care specifically addressing the determination
of the veracity of the loan application submitted from a broker without any
outside knowledge or information of wrongful conduct. Plaintiff only relies on
circumstances described as “red flags” as a substitute. 
 
The court finds a lack of support
imposing such a requirement under the statute or the governing law on money
lending. Nothing in the opposition supports a finding of activity above and
beyond the role of a traditional money lender. The court declines to make a
determination that potential inconsistencies in the application described as
“red flags” equate to a new standard of care for money lending without any
further basis linking said practices with a common law and/or statutory duty. Thus,
even with the suggestion of insufficient adherence to loan review compliance standards
occurring during the underwriting process, without sufficient underpinning legal
support establishing both a legal standard and evidence of knowledge regarding
the fraudulent representations into some form of arguable (albeit unmade) claim
for aiding and abetting, the court lacks a basis for any finding of triable
issues of material fact. (Das v. Bank of America, N.A., supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at p. 742.) 
 
While the
court finds the circumstances sympathetic to Plaintiff, the lack of an
underlying nexus between the statute and a fundamental basis of duty, precludes
any finding of statutory liability under the predatory lending act. The motion
for summary adjudication on the instant cause of action is therefore granted.
 
10th Cause of Action, Violation of Civil Code
§ 1785.20.3: Denied.
Civic challenges the subject cause of action on grounds
that Plaintiff lacks evidence of any violation of the statute. Plaintiff
counters that Civic failed to adhere to the statutory standard thereby
violating the section. Civic in reply reiterates the lack of any evidence of a
breach of due diligence requirements.
 
The section provides in relevant part:
 
“a) Any
person who uses a consumer credit report in connection with the approval of
credit based on an application for an extension of credit, and who discovers
that the consumer's
first and last name, address, or social security number, on the credit application does not match, within a
reasonable degree of certainty, the consumer's first and last name, address or addresses, or social
security number listed, if any, on the
consumer credit report, shall take reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of
the consumer's first and last
name, address, or social security number
provided on the application to confirm that the extension of credit is not the
result of identity theft, as defined in Section 1798.92.
...
“(c) Any
consumer who suffers damages as a result of a violation of this section by any
person may bring an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction against that
person to recover actual damages, court costs, attorney's fees, and punitive
damages of not more than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) for each violation,
as the court deems proper. ...”
 
(Civ.
Code, § 1785.20.3.)
 
Civic
maintains sufficient diligence in the review, and maintains that all signatures
were from Plaintiff and notarized. Plaintiff specifically cites to the credit
report, whereby the credit report specially states: “ADDRESS DISCREPANCY: THERE
IS A DIFFERENCE BETEWEEN THE ADDRESS SUBMITTED IN THE INQUIRY AND THE
ADDRESS(ES) ON FILE.” [Declaration of Michael Anderson, Appendix of Evidence,
Ex, D.]
 
Again,
neither party offers legally supported argument beyond the plain language of
the statute. Subdivision (a) specifically imposes a standard of verification,
where a discrepancy appears. While the purpose ostensibly refers to identity
theft, the court finds the purportedly fraudulent submission of the broker at a
minimum renders a valid claim under the section. Thus, unlike the predatory
lending claim, the court finds a basis of duty sufficiently established to
render triable issues of material fact regarding adherence to the standard of
care on the basis of address verification, given the specific notice in the
credit report regarding an address discrepancy. The motion for summary
adjudication, and therefore summary judgment are denied.
 
11th Cause of Action:  Violation of Cal. Civil Code 2923, et seq.:
Granted
12th Cause of Action: Violation of Homeowner
Bill of Rights: Granted.
Civic jointly challenges the subject causes of action on
grounds that the foreclosure protections never applied given the property was
never identified as owner occupied. Plaintiff in opposition maintains the
property meets the subject criteria, and Civic improperly relied on fraudulent
documents. Plaintiff contends the prior noted issues with the application
constitute “competing evidence” and therefore establish triable issues of
material fact regarding the existence of an owner occupied property, which provides
protection under the statutory sections.
 
Statutory liability depends on two criteria: owner
occupied and a first lien or deed of trust securing the property. (Civ. Code, § 2924.15, subd. (a).) Again, the parties simply
challenge the statute based on proper or fallible reliance on the broker
submitted application and subsequent follow through on the foreclosure. 
 
Consistent with the
considerations in the ninth cause of action, the court finds no underpinning
legal basis requiring Civic to verify the veracity of the broker submitted loan
application without further evidence of misconduct, thereby automatically
establishing a finding of owner occupied protections. The court finds no
triable issues of material fact regarding a violation of the statute. The
motion is therefore granted as to the subject causes of action.
 
13th Cause of Action, Violation of TILA 15
U.S.C. 1601 et al.: Denied.
Civic challenges the subject cause of action on grounds
of no basis of liability under the exemption governing language. Plaintiff
counters with citation to the prior argument regarding the insufficient review
of the application to determine a consumer versus commercial loan. Civic in
reply reiterates the lack of any evidence of a breach of due diligence
requirements.
 
The Truth in Lending Act, or TILA exists under 15 U.S.C.A. § 1601, et seq. The statute specifically
exempts certain transactions: 
 
“(1)
Credit transactions involving extensions of credit primarily for business,
commercial, or agricultural purposes, or to government or governmental agencies
or instrumentalities, or to organizations.
...
“(3)
Credit transactions, other than those in which a security interest is or will
be acquired in real property, or in personal property used or expected to be
used as the principal dwelling of the consumer and other than private education
loans (as that term is defined in section 1650(a) of this title), in which the
total amount financed exceeds $50,000.”

U.S.C.A. § 1603.)
 
Plaintiff additionally presents legally supported
argument regarding the determination for review of a consumer versus commercial
loan. The court considers the Federal District Court and Ninth Circuit
authority. “[T]he decisions of the
lower federal courts, while persuasive, are not binding on us. (Citation.)
Thus, in the absence of a controlling United States Supreme Court [or
California Supreme Court] opinion, we make an independent determination of
federal law. … In short, the presence or absence of a decision by the Ninth
Circuit on this issue is not determinative.” (Forsyth v. Jones (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 776, 782–783;
Thurston v. Midvale Corp. (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 634, 640.) The court declines to consider the unreported cases.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a); Rittiman
v. Public Utilities Com. (2022) 80
Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote 18).)
 
“In
determining whether credit to finance an acquisition...is primarily for
business or commercial purposes (as opposed to a consumer purpose), the
following factors should be considered: 
The
relationship of the borrower's primary occupation to the acquisition. The more
closely related, the more likely it is to be business purpose.
The
degree to which the borrower will personally manage the acquisition. The more
personal involvement there is, the more likely it is to be business purpose.
The ratio
of income from the acquisition to the total income of the borrower. The higher
the ratio, the more likely it is to be business purpose.
The size
of the transaction. The larger the transaction, the more likely it is to be
business purpose.
The
borrower's statement of purpose for the loan.”
 
Thorns
v. Sundance Properties (9th Cir. 1984) 726
F.2d 1417, 1419; Gallegos v. Stokes (10th Cir. 1979) 593 F.2d 372, 375 [The commercial use
exception constitutes “a factual issue to be resolved by the trier of fact]; Mauro v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (E.D.N.Y. 2010) 727 F.Supp.2d 145, 153 [“Most other courts
that have addressed the issue have held that a court must look at the entire
transaction and surrounding circumstances to determine a borrower's primary
motive”].) 
 
The court
finds the case law persuasive and the criteria articulated renders triable
issues of material fact regarding TILA compliance. [Anderson Decl., Appendix of
Evidence, Ex, 2: Deposition of Sean Daily, 24:11-13, 29:4-19, 30:4-15, 34:2-24,
48:21-49:9, 51:3-18, 57:21-24, 59:5-9, 74:23-75:4, 80:2-15, 99:8-11, 115:16-20,
120:5-25, 121:8-9, 125:7-11, 132:5-8; [Spaeder-Younkin Decl., ¶ 9, Compendium
of Exhibits, Ex. 9, Deposition of Sean Daily, Director of Underwriting,
56:2-4.] The motion for summary adjudication is therefore denied.
 
15th Cause of Action, Unfair Business
Practices: Denied.
Civic challenges the subject cause of action on grounds that
Plaintiff fails to state an basis of injury as a result of the commercial loan.
Plaintiff cites to the prior statutory claims as a basis for linking liability
under the unfair practices act. Civic in reply challenges any reliance on
credibility, and otherwise lack of evidence establishing a wrongful act under
the statute.
 
“The UCL does not proscribe specific acts, but broadly
prohibits ‘any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and
unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising....’” [¶] “‘A private
plaintiff must make a twofold showing: he or she must demonstrate injury in
fact and a loss of money or property caused by unfair competition.’ (Citation.)” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1359.) Fact
specific pleading is not required in order to allege an unfair business
practice. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46–47. 
 
An “unlawful” practice “means any
practices forbidden by law, be it civil or criminal, federal, state, or
municipal, statutory, regulatory, or court-made.… ‘Unfair’ simply means any
practice whose harm to the victim outweighs its benefits. (Citation.)
‘Fraudulent,’ as used in the statute, does not refer to the common law tort of
fraud but only requires a showing members of the public ‘“are likely to be
deceived.”’” (Saunders v. Superior
Court (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 832, 838–839.) “[A]n unfair
business practice also means” the relied upon public policy provision is
“tethered” to a specific regulatory provisions. (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 81.) Fundamentally,
recovery requires a direct harm to the consumer, and actual reliance. (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51
Cal.4th 310, 326–327.) 
 
Given the triable issues of material fact on the Violation
of Civil Code § 1785.20.3 and TILA causes of action, the court finds triable
issues of material fact at least partially joined under the “unfair” prong of
the unfair practices act, thereby precluding complete resolution of the subject
cause of action. The court therefore denies summary adjudication on the subject
cause of action based on triable issues of material fact in the Violation of
Civil Code § 1785.20.3 and TILA causes of action. The court cannot as a matter
of law balance the public policy considerations regarding the potentially
unfair business practices in reviewing the loan application and subsequent
harms to Plaintiff, versus potential statutory protections in relying upon the
submitted application for purposes of the subject claim.
 
In summary, the motion for
summary judgment is DENIED. The motion for summary adjudication is granted as
to the ninth, eleventh, and twelfth, causes of action, and denied as to the
tenth, thirteenth, and fifteenth causes of action.
