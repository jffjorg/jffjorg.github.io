And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' request for specific performance, requiring the defendants to complete the purchase of a vacant property in West Covina, California. The court has ordered the court clerk to execute and notarize documents necessary to close escrow on the property, including a grant deed transferring the property to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are required to place $650,000.00 into escrow, which will be reduced by any costs and/or attorney fees ordered by the court. The net proceeds from the sale will be distributed in a separate divorce action. The cross-complainant, Sylvia Wei-Ting Hu, takes nothing by way of her cross-complaint against the cross-defendants.
