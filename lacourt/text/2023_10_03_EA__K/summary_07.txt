Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Raul Uriarte-Limon's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The judge notes several defects in the application, including the need for Plaintiff to resubmit its attorney's fees request in compliance with Local Rule 3.214, the lack of authority for "investigation" fees, and the failure to provide evidence of the ownership of the Premises by the defendants. The judge has set a Case Management Conference for October 3, 2023.
