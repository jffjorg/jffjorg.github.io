Raul Uriarte-Limon’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Raul
Uriarte-Limon (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff has a
spinal injury and uses a wheelchair for mobility. On February 17, 2023,
Plaintiff went to Burger Depot located at 1169 N. Hacienda Blvd., La Puente, CA
91744 (“Premises”) but encountered parking barriers; namely, the adjacent
access aisle to the “accessible” parking space does not have the required
running width, markings, or slopes and neither the parking stall nor the access
aisle are on a firm, stable, slip-resistant surface. The required ISA and
enforcement signage has also been defaced so as to be unreadable. The Premises
is owned by Jesus Ibarra, in his capacity as the Trustee of the Hacienda
Revocable Living Trust (“Ibarra”), and Eduardo Mota (“Mota”).
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against Ibarra, Mota and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Violation of The Americans with Disabilities Act
2.                 
Violation of The Unruh Civil Rights Act
3.                 
Violation of The California Disabled Persons Act
On July 5, 2023, Mota’s default
was entered. On July 26, 2023, Ibarra’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is
set for October 3, 2023.
