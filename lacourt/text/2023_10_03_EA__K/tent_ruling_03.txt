 Case Number:  22PSCV01790    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  K The hearing on Counsel
for Plaintiffs Yanjun Liu’s and Xinzhi Xing’s (i.e., Law Offices of Edward C.
Ip & Associates, APC) Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED TO October
5, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. [see below].
Background[1]  
Plaintiffs Yanjun Liu and Xinzhi Xing (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
On July 25, 2017,
Plaintiffs purchased the residential property located at 3623 Hawkwood Rd.,
Diamond Bar, California 91765 (“subject property”) for $1 million. When
purchasing the subject property, Plaintiffs made a $400,000.00 down payment and
sought to obtain a loan for the remainder of the purchase price. Honghua Shang
aka Henry Shang (“Shang”), the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Great Wall Realty, Inc. (“GWR”), assisted Plaintiffs with the
purchase of the subject property and helped them obtain a $600,000.00 loan
through Margaret Hsu (“Hsu”). Plaintiffs subsequently returned to China and
entrusted Shang and GWR to provide property management services for the subject
property. Shang and GWR proposed that Plaintiffs rent out the subject property
for $3,500.00. Shang represented that the money received from rent was the
exact amount owed on the interest of the loan. Shang and GWR did not use the
entirety of the rent received for repayment of the loan. In 2019, Plaintiffs
remitted a check for $200,000.00 to Hsu to pay down the loan principal. In
2021, Plaintiffs contacted Shang to assist them with selling the subject
property. Shang advised that the subject property required various repairs in
preparation for listing it on the market and requested funds to perform such
repairs. Shang instead misappropriated these funds for his personal use.
Plaintiffs entered into a Residential Listing Agreement with Shang and GWR on
August 3, 2021. In January 2022, Shang and GWR received an officer to purchase
the subject property, which they failed to communicate to Plaintiffs. On
January 11, 2022, Shang executed a Residential Purchase Agreement on behalf of
Plaintiffs but without their prior knowledge or consent. Shang falsified and
executed a Power of Attorney as well. Plaintiffs did not know of the foregoing
acts and omissions until late 2022, when Plaintiffs requested documents and
information from GWR and Shang. On October 17, 2022, Plaintiffs sent GWR and
Shang a cease and desist letter and demand for all records pertaining to the
subject property but GWR and Shang have yet to comply. 
On November 14, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Shang, Punchun Cai
(“Cai”), Hsu, GWR and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
3.                 
Intentional Misrepresentation
4.                 
Negligent Misrepresentation
5.

6.

7.

8.

10.             
Aiding and Abetting
11.             
Quiet Title
12.             
Cancellation of Written Instrument
13.             
Declaratory Relief
On April 14, 2023, Plaintiffs
dismissed Hsu, without prejudice.
The Final Status Conference is set
for March 4, 2025. Trial is set for March 18, 2025.

instant motion is continued to October 5, 2023 at 9:30 a.m., due to the notice
deficiency noted in the footnote above. Plaintiffs’ counsel is instructed to
