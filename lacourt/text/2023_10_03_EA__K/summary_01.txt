And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Bank of the West, has applied for an order to sell the dwelling of the defendant, Rodney Michael Lindsay, to enforce a money judgment. However, the court has denied the application without prejudice due to deficiencies in the timing and service of the notice of the hearing. The plaintiff failed to file the application within 20 days of the notice of levy, and also failed to serve the notice of hearing on the defendant. The court has determined that the plaintiff did not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 704.750, subdivision (a). The homestead exemption protects the dwelling of a natural person from being sold to enforce a money judgment, and the court has determined that the plaintiff's application does not meet the requirements of the law.

## English Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to deny Bank of the West's request to sell Rodney Lindsay's home. 

This denial stems from two main problems:

1. **Timeliness:** Bank of the West filed the application to sell the house too late after the levying officer notified them of the levy. California law requires the application to be filed within 20 days of this notice.
2. **Service:** Bank of the West did not properly serve legal documents to Mr. Lindsay, including the application itself, as required by law. 

The Judge stated that the application is denied without prejudice, meaning Bank of the West can refile if they correct these issues.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's (Bank of the West) application for an order to sell the defendant's (Rodney Michael Lindsay) dwelling, without prejudice. The plaintiff had sought to sell the dwelling to satisfy a judgment debt arising from a defaulted retail installment sale contract. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not complied with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 704.750, which governs the sale of a dwelling to satisfy a money judgment. Specifically, the plaintiff had not filed the application within the required 20-day time period, and had not properly served the defendant with notice of the application. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support the application. The denial of the application is without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the application if they can cure the deficiencies noted by the judge. The judge's ruling is based on the strong public policy of protecting a person's homestead from forced sale by creditors, as reflected in the homestead exemption laws.
