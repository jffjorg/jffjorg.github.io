And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Bank of the West, has applied for an order to sell the dwelling of the defendant, Rodney Michael Lindsay, to enforce a money judgment. However, the court has denied the application without prejudice due to deficiencies in the timing and service of the notice of the hearing. The plaintiff failed to file the application within 20 days of the notice of levy, and also failed to serve the notice of hearing on the defendant. The court has determined that the plaintiff did not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 704.750, subdivision (a). The homestead exemption protects the dwelling of a natural person from being sold to enforce a money judgment, and the court has determined that the plaintiff's application does not meet the requirements of the law.
