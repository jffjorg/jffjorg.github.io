(“Contract”) with Plaintiff’s assignor for the purchase of a 2016 Chevrolet

24, 2020, default judgment was filed.
On August 28, 2020, an abstract of judgment was issued.
On April 18, 2023, a writ of execution was issued.
Legal Standard
“[T]he interest of a natural person in a dwelling may not be
sold under this division to enforce a money judgment except pursuant to a court
order for sale…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.740, subd. (a).)
Section 704.740 is designed to protect a person’s domain:
Homestead laws are designed to protect
the sanctity of the family home against a loss caused by a forced sale by
creditors. . . The homestead exemption ensures that insolvent debtors and their
families are not rendered homeless by virtue of an involuntary sale of the
residential property they occupy. Thus, the homestead law is not designed to
protect creditors. . . This strong public policy requires courts to adopt a
liberal construction of the law and facts to promote the beneficial purposes of
the homestead legislation to benefit the debtor [and his family].
(Wells Fargo Financial
Leading, Inc. v. D&M Cabinets (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 59, 67-68, quoting
Amin v. Khazindar (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 582, 585.)
Discussion
Plaintiff (“Judgment Creditor”) applies for an order for
sale of the dwelling commonly known as 937 N. Soldano Avenue, Azusa, CA 91702 (“the
Property”) owned by Defendant (“Judgment Debtor”).
Timeliness
of Application 
“Promptly after a
dwelling is levied upon…, the levying officer shall serve notice on the
judgment creditor that the levy has been made and that the property will be
released unless the judgment creditor complies with the requirements of this
section. Service shall be made personally or by mail. Within 20 days after
service of the notice, the judgment creditor shall apply to the court for an
order for sale of the dwelling and shall file a copy of the application with
the levying officer. If the judgment creditor does not file the copy of the
application for an order for sale of the dwelling within the allowed time, the
levying officer shall release the dwelling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.750, subd.
(a).)
Plaintiff has provided
the court with a copy of the levying officer’s “Notice to Creditor of Levy on
Dwelling” dated October 10, 2022. (Olson Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. E.) The application
was filed on July 19, 2023, well in excess of 20 days from the date of the
levying officer’s notice; as such, the court determines that Code of Civil
Procedure § 704.750, subdivision (a) has not been satisfied.
            Service Requirements
“Upon the filing of the application by the judgment creditor, the court
shall set a time and place for hearing and order the judgment debtor to show
cause why an order for sale should not be made in accordance with the
application. The time set for hearing shall be not later than 45 days after the
application is filed or such later time as the court orders upon a showing of
good cause.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 704.770, subd. (a).)
Further, under subsection (b):
Not later than 30 days before the time set
for hearing, the judgment creditor shall do both
of the following: 
 
(1)       Serve
on the judgment debtor a copy of the order to show cause, a copy of the
application of the judgment creditor, and a copy of the notice of the hearing
in the form prescribed by the Judicial Council. Service shall be made
personally or by mail. 
(2)       Personally
serve a copy of each document listed in paragraph (1) on an occupant of the
dwelling or, if there is no occupant present at the time service is attempted,
post a copy of each document in a conspicuous place at the dwelling.” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 704.770, subd. (b) [emphasis added].)
Here, Judgment Creditor submitted a “[Proposed] Order to Show
Cause Why Order for Sale of Dwelling Should Not Issue” (“Proposed OSC”)[1]
on July 19, 2023. There is no evidence that an order to show cause was
issued by the court, however; rather, Judgment Creditor appears to have
reserved the October 3, 2023 hearing date.
Judgment Creditor filed a proof of service reflecting personal and mail
service on July 19, 2023 of a “Notice of Hearing on Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor
MS Services LLC Application for Order to Show Cause for Issuance of Order for
Sale of Dwelling Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section
704.750(a)” (“Notice of Hearing”), but not of the actual “Application for
Issuance of Order for Sale of Dwelling Pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure § 704.750(a)” (“Application”) or OSC.
Judgment Creditor also filed a proof of service on July 26, 2023,
reflecting that the Notice of Hearing, Application and Proposed
OSC were posted on the dwelling on July 25, 2023.
The application is denied without prejudice, based on the
timeliness and service deficiencies noted above.
