The plaintiffs allege that Honghua Shang, the CEO and CFO of Great Wall Realty, Inc., assisted them in purchasing a residential property in 2017 and later misappropriated funds for personal use. The plaintiffs have filed a complaint against Shang, Punchun Cai, Margaret Hsu, Great Wall Realty, Inc., and Does 1-50 for various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and intentional misrepresentation. The hearing on the motion is continued to allow notice of the new hearing date.
