English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has ruled that the Demurrer filed by Brighten Investment Group Inc. and Huandan Luan to the Complaint filed by Connie Lin Sun is SUSTAINED. The Demurrer was filed on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.

The Court has declined to consider Exhibit A attached to the Demurrer as improper, as it was not attached to the Complaint nor is it the subject of a Request for Judicial Notice.

The Court has analyzed the first cause of action for rescission and has found that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court has also analyzed the second cause of action for declaratory relief and has found that it fails to identify an actual controversy between the parties.

The Court will hear from counsel for Plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested, and as to which cause(s) of action, and will require an offer of proof if so.
