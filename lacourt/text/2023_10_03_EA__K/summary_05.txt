**English Summary:**

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff AGN Logistics LLC's application for a default judgment against the Defendants. 

The Judge found several issues with the Plaintiff's request:

1. **Vagueness of Agreements:** The complaint doesn't clearly describe the agreements between the parties, particularly the number and nature of the agreements. The Plaintiff's manager's declaration contradicts the initial complaint by stating there was only one ongoing agreement.
2. **Unasserted Damages:** The Plaintiff is seeking $40,824.00 in storage fees that are not mentioned in the complaint.  California law limits default judgments to the amount specifically demanded in the complaint.

The Judge has denied the default judgment without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can modify their application and address these issues before the October 3rd hearing.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff alleged that it entered into agreements with defendants in April 2021, but the plaintiff's manager, Jason Becker, has attested that there was only one ongoing oral agreement. However, Becker does not identify the individual who entered into the agreement on behalf of the plaintiff, and his statements are conclusory, unsupported, and based on information and belief. The judge found that an affidavit based on "information and belief" is hearsay and must be disregarded.

Additionally, the plaintiff's prayer in the complaint does not request reimbursement for ongoing storage fees, and the amount demanded in the complaint is limited to the amount requested in the prayer. The plaintiff's calculation of ongoing storage fees is also defective. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice.

significant\_statements:
- Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice due to insufficient evidence regarding the agreements and the amount of damages sought.

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff AGN Logistics LLC's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice due to several issues with the complaint. Firstly, there is a lack of clarity regarding the existence and terms of the agreements between the parties, as Plaintiff's manager Jason Becker's declarations are based on "information and belief" and are therefore hearsay. Secondly, the complaint does not reference the $40,824.00 in "ongoing storage fees" that Plaintiff seeks in its Application for Default Judgment. The Judge notes that in actions for money damages, a default judgment is limited to the amount demanded in the complaint, which in this case is $61,348.00. Therefore, the Judge denies the Application for Default Judgment without prejudice, allowing Plaintiff to amend its complaint and address these issues.
