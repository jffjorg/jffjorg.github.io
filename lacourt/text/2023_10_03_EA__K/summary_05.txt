The Plaintiff, AGN Logistics LLC, has applied for a default judgment against the Defendants, V12 Health LLC, V12 Forza LLC, V12 Mask LLC, Tarek Kirschen, Monique Hewitt, and Barbara Beoto. The Judge has denied the application without prejudice due to several defects. The Plaintiff's complaint does not specify the individual who entered into the agreements on behalf of the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff's manager, Jason Becker, has only attested to one ongoing oral agreement. Additionally, the Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for ongoing storage fees, but these fees are not mentioned in the complaint. The Judge notes that a default judgment is limited to the amount demanded in the complaint, and the amount demanded in this case is $61,348.00, plus interest, attorney's fees, costs, and other relief.
