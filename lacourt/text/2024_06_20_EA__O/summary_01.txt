And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition filed by the plaintiff, Kim Hernandez, against General Motors, LLC. The motion seeks to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified, with production of documents and a request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00.

The court grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The court grants the motion as to certain discovery requests, including requests for writings, technical service bulletins, and recalls related to the plaintiff's vehicle. The court denies the motion as to other requests, including requests for confidential information and work product.

The court declines to impose sanctions on either party. The court finds that the plaintiff has met its burden of showing that the discovery requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court also finds that the defendant has valid objections to certain discovery requests.

The court's ruling is based on the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court cites to two California Court of Appeal cases, Johnson v. Ford Motor Co. (2005) and Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001), in support of its ruling.
