And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling indicates that the court will presume the motion filed on 5/16/24 is the moving paper, as the two appear identical. The issue of whether the then-owner complied with the timeline for the Declaration is disputed between RV and the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs argue that they are successors in interest and are entitled to enforce the Protective Restriction, which is a covenant running with the land. The judge notes that RV provides analysis of the 1961 Declaration, but the Plaintiffs focus on the covenant running with the land. The court cites several cases, including ReadyLink Healthcare v. Cotton and Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green, to support its ruling. The judge's ruling is intended to clarify the dispute and prepare for the upcoming court hearing.
