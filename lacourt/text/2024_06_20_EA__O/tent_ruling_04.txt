[1] A motion was also
filed on 5/15/24, but as the two appear identical and though the 5/16/24 motion
is not labeled as “amended,” the court will presume the 5/16/24 motion is the
moving paper. 


[2] The issue of whether
the then-owner complied with the timeline such that the Declaration was effective
is disputed between RV and Plaintiffs.   



[3] RV provides
considerable analysis on the 1961 Declaration, if enforceable, being an
equitable servitude, but Plaintiffs make clear that they “do not need to make
this argument” as they instead focus on the protective restriction/1961
Declaration being a covenant running with the land. (Reply to RV Opp. p. 5, fn.
1.)  
 


[4] “Plaintiffs
allege that they are successors in interest and are entitled to enforce the
Protective Restriction pursuant to the express provisions of the Protective
Restriction, not because they claim the right to be permanently next to a golf
course.” (Reply to Sunjoint Opp.
p. 7:10-12.)
 


[5] Motion p. 14:17-19
[“The language of the Protective Restriction uses the present tense of the verb
“is”. Covenants running with the land, like CC&Rs, 2 are subject to the
same rules governing the interpretation of contracts.”].)

of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds for
relief.]; see also Weil & Brown, California Procedure Before Trial, 9:579,
