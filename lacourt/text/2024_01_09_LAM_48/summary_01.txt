And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions of Ramy Galal and Lubin Pham + Caplin LLP, counsel for the defendants, to be relieved as counsel. The defendants have refused to sign the substitution of attorney forms due to an actual conflict of interest between the jointly represented parties. The Judge finds that the motions comply with California Rules of Court and no prejudice is shown, and therefore grants the motions. However, the Judge notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in court, and therefore schedules an Order to Show Cause for May 10, 2024, requiring 2522 The Strand LLC to retain new counsel before then. If the corporation fails to do so, the Court may place it in default.
