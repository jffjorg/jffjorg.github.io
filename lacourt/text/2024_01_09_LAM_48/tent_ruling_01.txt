  CASE NO.: 23STCP01460
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 9, 2024



 
Ramy
Galal and the firm Lubin Pham + Caplin LLP, counsel of record for Defendants 2522
The Strand LLC, Brian Taylor, and Stuart Sackley, seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that there is an
actual conflict of interest existing between the jointly represented parties, and
Defendants refuse to sign the substitution of attorney forms.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and no prejudice is shown.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on 2522
The Strand LLC, Brian Taylor, Stuart Sackley, and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)
An
Order to Show Case Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel For 2522 The Strand LLC is
scheduled for May 10, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  Defendant 2522 The Strand LLC must retain new
counsel before then or the Court may place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
