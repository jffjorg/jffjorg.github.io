 Case Number:  23STCV28694    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  14 #8Case Background
Plaintiff alleges that he agreed to invest money in a
camping business which Defendants were to run, but only until Plaintiff
received a work visa in the United States. Plaintiff claims that Defendants
refused to provide financial records when he arrived to take over the business.
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint for
(1) Breach of Contract and (2) Accounting against Defendants Tanaka’s Camp, LLC
(“Camp”), Ayu Tanaka (“Tanaka”), and DOES 1-10.
On April 11, 2024, the Court sustained a demurrer filed
by Defendant Ayu Tanaka with 30 days leave to amend.
Defendant Tanaka’s Camp, LLC has not appeared in this
action.
On August 8, 2024, Defendant Tanaka filed this motion
to dismiss.
Instant Pleading
Defendant Tanaka moves to dismiss this action on the
grounds that her demurrer was sustained and Plaintiff failed to file an amended
pleading.
Decision
The motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Tanaka is
GRANTED. The action filed by Plaintiff Yoshihiro Hozumi is dismissed under Code
Civ. Proc., section 581(f)(2).
Discussion
The Court may dismiss a complaint as to a
particular defendant if, after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with
leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend within the time allowed by the
court and either party moves for dismissal. (Code Civ. Pro. section
581(f)(2).)  
The motion is unopposed. That
lack of an opposition amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious.
(See California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg
v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 (the party who
fails to argue an issue abandons that issue).)
Here, the Court sustained Tanaka’s
demurrer on April 11, 2024 and allowed Plaintiff 30 days of leave to amend.
Tanaka served Plaintiff with notice of this ruling on April 23, 2024. It is now
September 24, 2024 and Plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint. Because
Plaintiff did not amend his complaint within the time allowed by the Court’s
April 11, 2024 order, Tanaka’s motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s action is
dismissed.
Conclusion
The motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Tanaka
is GRANTED. The action filed by Plaintiff Yoshihiro Hozumi is dismissed under
Code Civ. Proc., section 581(f)(2).
