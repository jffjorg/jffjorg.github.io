And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants (1114 LA Street, Inc. and Dollar Fashions, Inc.). The plaintiff, FCI Group, LLC, alleges that the defendants engaged in fraudulent conveyance and a creditor's suit. The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the first cause of action (fraudulent conveyance) and denied the motion to strike paragraph 26 of the complaint. The judge has also overruled the defendants' demurrer to the second cause of action (creditor's suit) and denied the motion to strike.

The judge notes that the plaintiff filed an amended complaint too late, just two calendar days before the hearing on this motion, and therefore the amended complaint is stricken and the demurrer will proceed as scheduled. The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents, including a grant deed dated December 19, 2019, but notes that the court may not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted in these documents.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages are sufficient and that the complaint states sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days of this order.
