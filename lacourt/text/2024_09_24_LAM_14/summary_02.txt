And here is a summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion for leave to pursue punitive damages against White Memorial Medical Center is denied. The plaintiff alleges that she was raped by a doctor at the hospital where she worked and that White Memorial failed to take adequate action to address the situation. The plaintiff seeks punitive damages against White Memorial, but the Court finds that the evidence presented is insufficient to establish a prima facie case for punitive damages. The Court also denies the defendant's motion for clarification and relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.
