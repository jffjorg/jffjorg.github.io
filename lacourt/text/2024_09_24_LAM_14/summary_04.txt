And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Ayu Tanaka. The plaintiff, Yoshihiro Hozumi, had alleged that he agreed to invest in a camping business run by the defendants, but only until he obtained a work visa in the United States. However, the plaintiff claims that the defendants refused to provide financial records when he arrived to take over the business. The plaintiff filed a complaint on November 27, 2023, but the defendant Ayu Tanaka's demurrer was sustained on April 11, 2024, with 30 days leave to amend. Despite this, the plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint, and the defendant Ayu Tanaka filed a motion to dismiss on August 8, 2024. Since the plaintiff did not amend his complaint within the time allowed, the judge is granting the motion to dismiss and dismissing the action under California Civil Procedure Code section 581(f)(2).
