And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial from January 19, 2024, to September 13, 2024. The defendant sought the continuance to accommodate the hearings on its discovery motions, which are set for January 26, 2024, January 29, 2024, and March 13, 2024. The court found good cause to grant the continuance, citing the congestion on the court's calendar and the defendant's efforts to meet and confer with the plaintiff to resolve the discovery issues. The court has also continued the final status conference from January 4, 2024, to August 29, 2024.
