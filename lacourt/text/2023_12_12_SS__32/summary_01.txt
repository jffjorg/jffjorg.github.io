The judge's tentative ruling concludes that Sayaco Partnership's Motion for Summary Adjudication on its cross-complaint is granted. The Court finds that the Lease Agreement between Sayaco and A Plus Fabric, Inc. requires APF to indemnify and defend against plaintiff's action on behalf of Sayaco. The ruling is based on the evidence presented, which shows that APF removed the metal rail from the gate, causing it to fall, and that Sayaco failed to correct the issue after being notified. The Court concludes that there is no triable issue of material fact that the indemnity provision does not require APF to defend and indemnify Sayaco.
