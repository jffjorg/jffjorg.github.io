And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Jesus Jimenez to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Carlos Ortiz. The demurrer was based on the argument that the complaint is uncertain, vague, and ambiguous because it does not specify the terms of the contract between the parties. However, the judge has ruled that the complaint is sufficient to apprise the defendant of the nature of the action. The complaint alleges that the parties executed a promissory note for a loan of $95,000, which was not repaid, and that the defendant has made payments but with bad checks. The judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to serve and file his answer to the complaint within 10 days.
