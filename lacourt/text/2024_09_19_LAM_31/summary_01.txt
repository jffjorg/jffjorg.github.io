And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reopen discovery. The defendant sought to depose a non-party witness, David Illulian, to prepare their defense. However, the judge found that the defendant did not demonstrate good cause to reopen discovery. The judge considered several factors, including the necessity of the discovery, the diligence of the parties, and the likelihood that permitting the discovery would prevent the case from going to trial on the date set. The judge found that the defendant did not demonstrate a sufficient reason for the discovery, and that the defendant had not diligently sought to complete discovery earlier. The judge also found that the defendant did not explain how the information they sought to obtain from Mr. Illulian would aid their defense. The judge concluded that good cause did not exist to reopen discovery, and the motion was denied.
