DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE

RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Carlos
Ortiz
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February
22, 2024, Plaintiff Carlos Ortiz (Ortiz or Plaintiff) initiated this action
against Defendant Jesus Jimenez (Jimenez or Defendant) for (1) Breach of
Contract (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 337 and 159), (2) Common Count: Money Lent, (3)
Common Count: Open Book Account; and (4) Breach of Implied Covenant of Duty of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing.  Defendant
is self-represented. 
 
As alleged in the Complaint, Jimenez began a construction project.  In April 2018, Jimenez asked Ortiz for a
short-term loan to continue financing the construction project.  In May 2018, the parties executed a
promissory note in which Ortiz agreed to loan $95,000 to Jimenez and Jimenez
agreed to repay the principal amount by November 1, 2018.  The promissory note is attached as Exhibit A
to the Complaint.  On November 1, 2018, Jimenez
failed to repay any portion of the principal amount.  Ortiz continued to demand repayment.  On April 7, 2021, the parties executed a
repayment plan whereby Jimenez agreed to pay monthly installments of $2,500 if
Jimenez could not repay the full loan by July 1, 2021.  The repayment plan is attached as Exhibit B
to the complaint.  Thereafter, Jimenez
made payments through companies owned and controlled by Jimenez totaling approximately
$62,800.  However, $46,400 of the $62,800
were paid with bad checks.  Jimenez
ceased making payments and continues to owe $78,600 pursuant to the promissory
note.  This action followed.
 
            On June 3,
2024, Defendant filed this Demurrer to the Complaint.
 
            Plaintiff
filed an opposition.  Defendant did not
file a reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
            A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained only where
the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].)
Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)¿ In
construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual
allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)¿¿  
            A
demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause
of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)¿“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.”¿(Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
            Where the
complaint contains substantial factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to amend.¿ (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden
is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Ibid.)¿
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant demurs to the Complaint on
the ground it is uncertain, vague, and ambiguous because Plaintiff does not
allege “the terms of, condition, and provisions of any type of contract,
written, oral or implied as it would apply to this demurring defendant.”  (Demurrer, p. 4.)  
 
            The argument lacks merit.  Plaintiff alleges that the parties executed a
promissory note on May 1, 2018 for a loan of $95,000.  (Complaint, ¶ 8.)  The parties later agreed to a repayment plan
on April 7, 2021.  (Complaint, ¶
13.)  To date, Defendant still owes
$78,600 on the promissory note. 
(Complaint, ¶ 16.)  Copies of the
promissory note and repayment plan are attached as exhibits to the
Complaint.  The allegations are more than
sufficient to apprise Defendant of the nature of this action.
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
The Demurrer is OVERRULED. 

 
Defendant is ordered to serve and file his Answer to the
Complaint within 10 days of this order. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
