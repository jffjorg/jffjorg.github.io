And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The motion seeks to add a new theory of liability to the complaint, which was not alleged in the previous versions of the complaint. The Judge finds that the complaint was not legally insufficient, but rather the Court concluded that the allegations in the complaint delimited the issues for summary adjudication and the extrinsic evidence submitted showed there was no triable issue on those allegations. The Judge also finds that the proposed amendment asserts an entirely different legal theory, which is impermissible. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff made no effort to seek leave to amend the complaint until after the summary judgment motion was granted against him. The Judge concludes that the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint.
