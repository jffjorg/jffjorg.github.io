 Case Number:  23SMCV03296    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  KAVEH KEVIN JEBELI,   Plaintiff, v.  JEWISH EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV03296     Hearing Date:  February 29, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO VACATE    DEFAULT    BACKGROUND Plaintiff Kaveh Kevin Jebeli entered into a contract with Defendants Jewish Educational Movement (“JEM”) and Hertzel Illulian (“Illulian”) for warehouse/storage space.  Jebeli used the space to store over $1,396,136 worth of computer and computer-related equipment, inventory, fixtures and tools he used for his business.  Jebeli was also storing boxes of men’s clothing for his father-in-law valued at approximately $100,000. Defendants rented the space next to Jebeli’s to a CBD oil manufacturer who used the premises to manufacture CBD oil, a highly flammable substance.  The unit in fact caught fire, burning all of Jebeli’s belongings.  Jebeli was only able to recover $380,000 from his insurance.  On July 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants.  The Complaint alleges claims for gross negligence, breach of written contract and declaratory relief.  Jebeli claims damages in the amount of $1,122,136.      Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendant Hertzel Illulian was personally served on October 25, 2023 and Defendant Jewish Educational Movement was substitute served on November 3, 2023.   This hearing is on Defendants’ motions to vacate default and for judgment on the pleadings.  Defendants argue that Illulian was not at home on the dates and times when the process server claims that service was purportedly made upon him and by substituted service on him on behalf of JEM.  Defendants note that the physical description of the person the process server claims to have served is not even close to the physical description of Illulian.   Defendants also argue that the Court should enter judgment on the pleadings because the lease expressly provided that Plaintiff was required to “obtain and maintain” “full replacement cost coverage with a deductible not to exceed $1,000 per occurrence” “on all of Lessee’s personal property” and “Trade Fixtures.”  Defendants argue that Plaintiff took the risk of not having enough insurance coverage and of not complying with his own contractual obligations to insure his property.     LEGAL STANDARD “Compliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction.  Thus, a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute is void.  Under section 473, subdivision (d), the court may set aside a default judgment which is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due to improper service.”  (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.)   “When a court lacks jurisdiction in a fundamental sense, an ensuing judgment is void, and thus vulnerable to direct or collateral attack at any time.”  (Strathvale Holdings v. E.B.H. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1249 (trial court properly granted motion for relief from default and default judgment based on CCP §473(d) where defendants argued there was no valid service of process and they lacked minimum contacts with California).)   A defendant may therefore move to set aside a default and default judgment based on improper service and lack of personal jurisdiction under Code Civ. Proc. §473(d).  (Id. at 1250.)  A defendant need not bring a motion to quash prior to or in conjunction with a motion for relief from default and default judgment pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(d).  (Id.) It is always the plaintiff’s burden to establish the existence of jurisdiction.  (Id. at 1250-1251; Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-1440.)  Thus, even though defendant is the moving party on a motion to quash or a motion to set aside a void judgment under Code Civ. Proc. §473(d), the burden is on plaintiff to establish proper service.  (Dill, 24 Cal.App.4th at 1439-1440.)  A valid proof of service gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of valid service.  (Id. at 1441-1442.)  But the presumption may be overcome by contrary evidence.  (City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726, 731.) The statutory requirements of service are construed to uphold jurisdiction, rather than defeat it.  (See Pasadena Medi-Center Associates v. Sup.Ct. (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778.)  As long as the defendant receives actual notice of the lawsuit, substantial compliance with the Code provisions governing service of summons will generally be held sufficient.  (Id.).   DISCUSSION Defendants’ motion is procedurally defective.  Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc. § 437, subdivision (b), a motion to set aside a default¿must be accompanied by a copy of the¿proposed answer, “otherwise the application shall not be granted.”  “The requirement that a . . . pleading accompany the application for relief or that one be on file is mandatory, and failure to comply necessarily results in denial of relief.”  (Daniels¿v.¿Daniels¿(1955) 136 Cal.App.2d 224, 228; (See also Puryear v. Stanley (1982) 172 Cal.App.3d 291, 293-294.)  Defendants’ motions to vacate default are not accompanied by a proposed answer.   Further, as default has not been vacated, the Court has no jurisdiction to consider Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Howard Greer Custom Originals v. Capritti¿(1950) 35 Cal.2d 886, 888-89¿(“a defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff’s right of action”); Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc.¿(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301 (“[t]he clerk’s entry of default cuts off the defendant's right to take further affirmative steps such as filing a pleading or motion”).)¿  CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motions to vacate default and for judgment on the pleadings.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: February 29, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
