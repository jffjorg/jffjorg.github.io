```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies defendants' motions to vacate default and for judgment on the pleadings. The defendants, Jewish Educational Movement and Hertzel Illulian, argue that the process server did not have the correct physical description of Illulian, and therefore, the service of process was invalid. They also argue that the plaintiff, Kaveh Kevin Jebeli, failed to comply with his contractual obligations to insure his property, and therefore, he cannot recover damages. However, the court finds that the defendants' motions are procedurally defective because they were not accompanied by a proposed answer. Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings because default has not been vacated.
