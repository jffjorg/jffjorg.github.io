Adjudication
Forouzan Golshani vs. Board of Trustees of the California
State University, 20STCV40168
Moving Parties: Defendant Board of Trustees of the
California State University

Responding Party: Plaintiff Forouzan
Golshani

I.                  
Background
Plaintiff Forouzan Golshani
(Plaintiff) was Dean of the of the College of Engineering at California State
University Long Beach (CSULB) from 2007 to 2020. (SSUF 1, 80.) While Plaintiff
was Dean, Plaintiff reported to the Provost, which was the chief academic
officer at CSULB. (SSUF 2.) The Provost when Plaintiff was non-retained as Dean
was Dr. Brian Jersky. (SSUF 3.) Dr. Jersky made the decision regarding
Plaintiff’s non-retention as Dean. (SSUF 80.)
During Plaintiff’s time as Dean of
the College of Engineering, the College was issued multiple citations for
safety issues. (SSUF 21.) Among the safety issues reported by the Occupational
Safety and Environmental Specialist, Michael Kitahara, were improper storage
and labeling of liquids and hazardous wastes. (SSUF 23, 24.) Numerous other
safety hazards were observed by Mr. Kitahara over time. (SSUF 25-27.) The
previously observed safety problems were not corrected when he re-inspected the
College’s labs the next year. (SSUF 28.) Plaintiff did not attend a meeting
about the safety problems in 2016. (SSUF 30.) Further safety problems were
observed in 2017. (SSUF 31-32.)
Following all these reports of
safety problems, a chemical explosion occurred in one of the labs of the
College of Engineering. (SSUF 33.) The explosion happened because Dr. Ted Yu,
an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering, was attempting to dissolve lithium
in a bucket of water. (SSUF 35.) Compounding the safety issues, lithium had not
been in the chemical inventory list for that lab. (SSUF 38.) The EH&S
Investigation after the chemical explosion found that Dr. Yu had not been trained
on hazardous waste disposal procedures. (SSUF 41.)
After the explosion, Plaintiff told
Dr. Jersky that he wanted to do a self-audit of the College of Engineering
safety policies and procedures. (SSUF 43.) Plaintiff’s plan was to have a
retired professor re-examine the College of Engineering safety procedures to
see if there were things that needed to be updated. (SSUF 44.) Dr. Jersky
disagreed with this approach, and instead hired a full time safety officer for
the College of Engineering.  Subsequently,
Ricardo Magallanes was hired as Chemical Hygiene Officer in January 2019. (SSUF
46-49.)
A CSU safety audit done in July 2019
had multiple findings against the College of Engineering. (SSUF 53.) The safety
audit found problems related to the College’s Chemical Engineering Plan, its
Access to Hazmat, Hazardous Material, Hazardous and Universal Waste, Safety
Equipment and Maintenance Inspections, and Laser Safety Program. (SSUF 54-59.)
After learning about the results of the safety audit, Plaintiff told Dr. Jersky
that the College of Engineering was taking corrective measures to address the
safety concerns. (SSUF 62.) A report done in October 2019 showed that not much
progress was made toward addressing the concerns in the safety audit. (SSUF
64.)
After the explosion, Plaintiff
recommended Dr. Yu for tenure, despite the fact that he caused the explosion.
(SSUF 65.) During the tenure review process, Dr. Jersky discovered Dr. Yu had
not included the Long Beach Police Report discussing Dr. Yu’s role in the
explosion in his Working Personnel Action File. (SSUF 67.) However, the
Personnel Action File did include a copy of the police report. (SSUF 68.)
Despite requirements that the Personnel Action File be reviewed for tenure
decisions, Plaintiff did not review Dr. Yu’s Personnel Action File before
making his recommendation. (SSUF 69-70, 72.) Plaintiff claimed that he was
restricted from viewing the Personnel Action file. (SSUF 73.)
The given reasons for Plaintiff’s
non-retention as Dean in January 2020 were (1) safety (referring to Plaintiff
not having done enough to address safety issues in the College of Engineering
(SSUF 83)); (2) Dr. Yu’s tenure review; and (3) Plaintiff’s attempts to go over
Dr. Jersky’s head by copying President Conoley and Scott Apel on an email
requesting additional “tenure track” hires. (SSUF 82.)
Despite understanding that safety
meant that Plaintiff had not done enough to address the safety issues (SSUF
83), Plaintiff believed that Dr. Jersky fired him for engaging in a protected
activity (SSUF 81).
Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint
(TAC), filed against Defendant Board of Trustees of California State University
(Defendant), alleges that the protected activities in which Plaintiff engaged
were “informing his supervisors that he was a [sic] conducting a self-audit to
ensure that the College was up to date in policies and procedures relating to
modern safety hazard after a chemical reaction resulted in a fire in the
College’s lab, informing his supervisors about safety issues identified by the
CSU safety audit that whether either addressed by the College’s technician or
of which purchase ordered needs to be submitted to contract services, making
requests to his supervisor(s) for funding, support, and personnel to address
safety issues in the College.” (TAC, ¶ 76.)
Plaintiff alleges that his
non-retention as Dean was retaliation for engaging in these alleged protected
activities. Plaintiff alleges one cause of action for whistle blower
retaliation pursuant to Gov. Code ¶ 8547.12.

Analysis
a.     
Standard for Summary Judgment and
Adjudication
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial
judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.”¿ (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)¿ 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)¿ 
When interpreting § 437c, courts have held that a
three-step analysis is required: (1) Identify the issues framed by the
pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by
establishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis
for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent’s pleading;
(2) Determine whether the moving party’s showing has established facts which
negate the opponent’s claim and justify a judgment in movant’s favor; and (3) Determine
whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material
factual issue. (AARTS Production, Inc. v. Crocker National Bank (1986)
179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065.)¿¿ 
Summary Judgment may be granted only where all the
supporting and opposition papers show there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment “as a matter of
law.” (CCP § 437c(c).)¿¿ 
As a result, the Plaintiff “must present evidence that
would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact
more likely than not—otherwise, he would not be entitled to judgment as a
matter of law but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 851, fns. omitted; Oldcastle
Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554,
562-563.)¿¿ 
The Defendant need only show the existence of a triable
issue of material fact. (Union Bank v. Super Ct. (Demetry) (1995)
31 Cal.4th 573, 590; see Lopez v. SuperCt. (Friedman Bros. Invest. Co.) (1996)
45 Cal.4th 705, 713; Leslie G. v. Perfy & Assocs. (1996) 43 Cal.4th 472, 482.) Summary
judgment would not be proper where the facts support a triable issue of fact.¿ 
b.     
Issues for Summary Judgment
                                                             
i.     
Issue Nos. 1 – 3: Third Cause of Action
Defendant moves for summary judgment against Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action for
whistleblower retaliation in violation Gov. Code § 8547.12. Defendants moves
for summary judgment on the basis that the cause of action fails because
Plaintiff cannot establish that he made a protected disclosure; Plaintiff
cannot establish that his alleged disclosures were contributing factors in the
decision to non-retain Plaintiff as Dean of the College of Engineering; and the
undisputed evidence is clear and convincing that Dr. Jersky non-retained
Plaintiff for legitimate, independent reasons.
The
California Whistleblower Protection Act (CWPA) prohibits retaliation against
state employees who “report waste, fraud, abuse of authority, violation of law,
or threat to public health.” (Gov. Code, § 8547.1.) Section 8547.12 of the CWPA
prohibits retaliation against an employee of the CSU for “having made a
protected disclosure” within the meaning of section 8547.2, where such
protected disclosure was a “contributing factor” in the decision to take an
adverse action against the employee. (See Gov. Code, § 8547.12.)
To
establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the CWPA, a plaintiff must
show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he made a “protected disclosure”
and that such “protected disclosure” is causally linked to an adverse action
taken against him. (Gov. Code § 8574.12.)
Protected Disclosures
A
protected disclosure under the CWPA is “a good faith communication, including a
communication based on, or when carrying out, job duties, that discloses or demonstrates
an intention to disclose information that may evidence (1) an improper
governmental activity, or (2) a condition that may significantly threaten the
health or safety of employees or the public if the disclosure or intention to
disclose was made for the purpose of remedying that condition.” (Gov. Code, §
8547.2(e).)
None
of Plaintiff’s alleged disclosures would be protected disclosures. First, his
plan to conduct a self-audit would not be a protected disclosure. Plaintiff was
not disclosing or demonstrating any condition that could threaten health or
safety by saying that he wanted to do a self-audit. He was merely declaring his
intention to look into the safety practices of his department.
Next,
informing his supervisors about the College’s progress in addressing the safety
issues identified by the CSU safety audit would also not be a protected
disclosure. This merely appears to be the fulfillment of an administrative task
as Dean of the College. He was not disclosing anything by informing his
supervisor’s of the College’s progress.
Finally,
Plaintiff’s requests for funding, support, and personnel to address safety
issues in the College would not be protected disclosures, either. Similar to
the previous alleged disclosures, Plaintiff was not disclosing anything.
Plaintiff was simply asking for resources to address safety concerns, which is an
administrative concern. (See Patten v. Grant Joint Union High School Dist.
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1385 [plaintiff’s disclosures “about needing more
staff for safety purposes do not amount to whistleblowing as a matter of law”
because they “were made in an exclusively internal administrative context”]; Levi
v. Regents of University of California (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 892, 904
[“Complaints made ‘in the context of internal administrative or personnel
actions, rather than in the context of legal violations’ do not constitute
protected whistleblowing.”].)
In
Plaintiff’s opposition to Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff attempts
to argue that he made five protected disclosures. However, his TAC only lists
the three that were addressed by Defendant in its motion. Plaintiff cannot add
new protected disclosures in his opposition that were not present in his TAC.
Defendant does not need to address alleged disclosures that were not present in
the pleadings. (See Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co. (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 486, 493 [“[T]he burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment
only requires that he or she negate plaintiff’s theories of liability as
alleged in the complaint, that is, a moving party need not refute liability on
some theoretical possibility not included in the pleadings.”].)
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has not presented any triable issues of fact
regarding protected disclosures for purposes of the CWPA.
Contributing Factors
Even
if Plaintiff’s alleged disclosures were protected disclosures, they were not
contributing factors in the decision to non-retain Plaintiff as Dean of the
College of Engineering. Plaintiff has not established any causal link between
his alleged protected disclosures and the decision of Dr. Jersky to non-retain
Plaintiff as Dean.
The
reasons given for Plaintiff’s non-retention were that he did not do enough to
address the safety issues in the College of Engineering; he recommended Dr. Yu
for tenure despite his role in the lab explosion; and he attempted to go over
Dr. Jersky’s head for tenure track hires. None of these things were related to
Plaintiff’s alleged protected disclosures. Plaintiff even admitted that he
believed that Dr. Jersky blamed him for the College’s safety problems. (SSUF
86.) Dr. Jersky did not cite Plaintiff’s self-audit idea as one of the reasons
for why he was not retaining Plaintiff as Dean. (SSUF 87.)
There
is no triable issue of fact regarding whether Plaintiff’s alleged disclosure
were a contributing factor in his non-retention.
Non-Retention for Legitimate, Independent
Reasons
Even
if Plaintiff’s alleged disclosures constituted protected activities, Dr. Jersky
non-retained Plaintiff for legitimate, independent reasons.
In
Vatalaro v. County of Sacramento (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 367, the Court of
Appeal affirmed summary judgment for an employer because clear and convincing
evidence demonstrated that it would have released the employee, even if the
employee had not engaged in protected activity. (Id. at 405.) The Court
of Appeal found that undisputed evidence would require a reasonable factfinder
to find it “highly probable” that the employer would have released the employee
for having been insubordinate, disrespectful, and dishonest no matter what
“protected activity” had occurred, causing the Court of Appeal to conclude that
the employer had met its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that
it would have released the employee for legitimate, independent reasons even
had she not engaged in protected activity. (Id. at 403-405.)
Even
if Plaintiff had engaged in protected activities, this would not matter because
Defendant has demonstrated that it would have non-retained Plaintiff
regardless. Considering the history of the College of Engineering while
Plaintiff was Dean, Dr. Jersky had legitimate concerns about Plaintiff’s
handling of the safety issues of the College. It would have been highly
probable that Dr. Jersky would have non-retained Plaintiff regardless of any
alleged protected activity that Plaintiff engaged in.
            Defendant has met its burden of
showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have released, and did
release, Plaintiff for legitimate, independent reasons.

judgment is GRANTED IN ITS ENTIRETY.
