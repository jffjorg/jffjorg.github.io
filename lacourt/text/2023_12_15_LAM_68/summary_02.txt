And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The plaintiff, Forouzan Golshani, was the Dean of the College of Engineering at California State University Long Beach from 2007 to 2020. The college was issued multiple citations for safety issues during Golshani's tenure. Golshani conducted a self-audit of the college's safety policies and procedures, informed his supervisors about the college's progress in addressing safety issues, and requested funding, support, and personnel to address safety issues.

The defendant, the Board of Trustees of the California State University, claims that Golshani's non-renewal as Dean was for legitimate, independent reasons. The court finds that Golshani has not established any triable issues of fact regarding protected disclosures under the California Whistleblower Protection Act. The court also finds that Golshani's alleged disclosures were not contributing factors in the decision to non-renew him as Dean. Finally, the court concludes that the defendant has demonstrated that it would have released Golshani for legitimate, independent reasons, regardless of any alleged protected activity.
