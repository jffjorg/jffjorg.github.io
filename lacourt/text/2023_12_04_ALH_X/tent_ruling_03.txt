RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
deeming the truth of the matters asserted in her requests for admissions as

BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Christel G.
Franco’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. breached
an agreement to repurchase a 2023 Kia Sportage, Vehicle Identification Number 5XYK6CAF8PG024689
(“Subject Vehicle”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on May 23, 2023. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of the matters
asserted in her RFAs as admitted is DENIED as moot.
 
            Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions is granted
for a total of $375.00.
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b), provides that
if a party fails to respond to a request for admission, “[t]he requesting party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted”.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs
move for an order deeming the truth of the matters asserted in her requests for
admissions as admitted. Plaintiff served her first set of requests for
admissions on June 22, 2023. (Sanjur-Van Brande Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiff provides that Kia has failed to produce any
responses as of October 31, 2023. (Id. ¶ 3.) In opposition, Defendant
provides its failure to timely serve responses was based on a clerical error,
and it served responses on November 9, 2023. (Stewart Decl. ¶¶ 6-10.) Because
Defendant has served responses prior to the hearing on this motion, Plaintiff’s
motion to deem admitted is denied as moot.
 
            However, Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c), provides, in part, that “[i]t is mandatory that the
court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” Plaintiff’s requests for
sanctions is granted for a total of $375.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of the matters
asserted in her RFAs as admitted is DENIED as moot.
 
            Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions is granted
for a total of $375.00.
