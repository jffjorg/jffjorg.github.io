for admission.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2033.290, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling PUSD to provide further responses to her discovery
requests. The present motions involve two separate sets of discovery requests. 
 
Plaintiff provides that she
served her first set of discovery requests, which included form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for the production of
documents on PUSD on February 9, 2023. (Skaf Decl. ¶
5.) Plaintiff provides PUSD responded on July 19, 2023. (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff
provides she served her second set of discovery requests, which included form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for the production of
documents, and requests for admissions on August 8, 2023. (Skaf Decl. ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff provides PUSD served responses on September 7, 2023. (Id. ¶
4.) 
 
            In
opposition, PUSD contends that the motions are partially mooted by the fact
that it served supplemental responses and any remaining discovery requests
improperly seek student records. PUSD provides it served supplemental responses
to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories set one and requests for the production
of documents set one on November 21, 2023. (Doumanian Decl. ¶ 3.) PUSD provides it served supplemental responses to the
entirety of Plaintiff’s second set of discovery requests on November 1, 2023. (Doumanian
Decl. ¶ 1.) 
 
            According
to PUSD, only a small portion of Plaintiff’s discovery request are pending. 
 
            Set
One Discovery Requests
 
            In its
oppositions, PUSD provides that only request for production number 62 and special
interrogatories numbers 89, 90, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, and 100 are still
pending. PUSD contends Plaintiff’s form interrogatories set one seek student
records.

            Application
 
            A central issue raised by the
discovery motions is whether certain discovery requests seek records protected
by Education Code section 49076. Education Code section 49076, subdivision (a),
provides in part: “A school district shall not permit access to pupil records
to a person without written parental consent or under judicial order except as
set forth in this section”. However, neither party sufficiently
address this issue. “Civil discovery is intended to operate with a
minimum of judicial intervention. ‘[I]t is a “central precept” of the Civil
Discovery Act ... that discovery ‘be essentially self-executing[.]’ ” (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 402.) The parties both rely on copy-pasted language in their
briefs to broadly assert their argument.
 
“California law
defines ‘pupil records’ as ‘any item of information directly related to an
identifiable pupil, other than directory information, which is maintained by a
school district....’ ” (BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 742. 752.) “ ‘ “Pupil Record” means information relative to an
individual pupil gathered within or without the school system and maintained
within the school system, regardless of the physical form in which it is
maintained. Essential in this definition is the idea that any information which
is maintained for the purpose of second party review is considered a pupil
record.’ (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 5, § 430, subd. (d).)”
 
The court
recognizes that, pursuant to Education Code section 49076, PUSD may be required
to disclose the records under judicial order, but in the absence of any
developed argument on this issue, the court declines to grant such a sweeping
discovery order.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is granted as to (1) RFP set one number 62;
(2) special interrogatories set one numbers 89, 94, and 96; (3) RFP set two numbers
82 and 97; (4) special interrogatories set two numbers 113, 115, 132, 133, and
135; and (5) RFA numbers 71, 72, and 73.
 
            The court recognizes that Plaintiff asserts that PUSD’s
supplemental responses are still deficient and that PUSD’s recitation of
pending discovery requests is inaccurate. Thus, Plaintiff may submit subsequent
motions to compel. 
 
However, the court informs both parties that any motion to compel
further must be accompanied by an adequate separate statement. California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires a separate statement to include “[a] statement of the
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses, answers, or
production as to each matter in dispute”. In her several separate
statements, Plaintiff merely used copy-pasted language that makes no reference
to the specific discovery request at issue. Plaintiff merely includes stock
language claiming the responses are insufficient and that Defendant’s
objections are meritless and boilerplate. Any future motion to compel must
include a proper separate statement addressing why the court should order
further responses as to each matter in dispute. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions for each
motion filed. The court notes that PUSD served supplemental responses months after
its initial response and after Plaintiff filed the present motions. Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c), provides, in part, that “[i]t is mandatory that the
court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” Thus, Plaintiff’s requests
for sanctions is granted for two hours worked at $500 an hour plus a $60 filing
fee for a total of $1060 ordered against Defendant’s counsel. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motions to compel further responses are granted in part and denied in part.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is granted as to (1) RFP set one number 62;
(2) special interrogatories set one numbers 89, 94, and 96; (3) RFP set two
numbers 82 and 97; (4) special interrogatories set two numbers 113, 115, 132,
133, and 135; and (5) RFA numbers 71, 72, and 73.
 
PUSD is ordered
to provide responses within 15 days. 
 
Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions
is granted for a total of $1060 ordered against Defendant’s counsel.
