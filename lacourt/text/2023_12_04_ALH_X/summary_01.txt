And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff had requested further responses to discovery requests, including requests for production, interrogatories, and requests for admissions. The defendant, Pasadena Unified School District, had served responses to some of the requests, but not all of them.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion as to certain specific requests, including requests for production number 62, special interrogatories set one numbers 89, 94, and 96, and requests for admissions numbers 71, 72, and 73. The judge orders the defendant to provide responses to these requests within 15 days.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions, ordering the defendant's counsel to pay $1060 for failing to serve timely responses to discovery requests. The judge notes that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was a violation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which requires that responses to discovery requests be served within a certain time period.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after oral argument and consideration of additional evidence.
