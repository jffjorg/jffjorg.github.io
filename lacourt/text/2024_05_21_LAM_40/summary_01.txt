And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas. The subpoenas are overbroad and invade the plaintiff's privacy. However, the court finds that the tax privilege applies to the requested information and that there is a compelling need for the discovery. The court grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The court will address at oral argument a reasonable method for separating the evidence to be produced from the evidence protected.
