 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Danny
  Bakewell, Sr.’s Motion to Quash Subpoenas Duces Tecum and for Sanctions in
  the Amount of $3,360.00 Against Defendants Kevin Cohee and OneUnited Bank and
  Their Counsel of Record Parnell Fox, Esq.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr. sues
Defendants OneUnited Bank (the Bank), Kevin Cohee (Chairman and CEO of the
Bank), and Does 1 to 20 pursuant to an April 15, 2020, First Amended Complaint
(FAC) alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Fraud and Deceit, (3)
Declaratory Relief, (4) Unfair Competition, (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and
(6) Fraudulent Sale of Securities.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendant Cohee induced Plaintiff Bakewell into subscribing to $250,000 of
OneUnited Bank Preferred Stock by making alleged false representations to
Bakewell to the effect that Bakewell would be able to redeem his $250,000 in
Preferred Stock, plus corresponding dividends, upon request, only for OneUnited
Bank to deny such a request by Bakewell in December 2019.
B. Subpoenas at
Issue
On April 8, 2024,
Defendants Cohee and OneUnited Bank served a subpoena for various of
Plaintiff’s financial records from Plaintiff’s accountant, Paul G. Joseph, CPA
(Joseph, CPA).
On April 10, 2024,
Defendants Cohee and OneUnited Bank served subpoenas for various of Plaintiff’s
financial records from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and from California’s
Franchise Tax Board (FTB).
On April 18, 2024,
Defendants Cohee and OneUnited Bank served subpoenas for various of Plaintiff’s
financial records from Northern Trust, an investment firm that appears in
Plaintiff’s 2008 tax records.
The subpoenas all
checked off a proof of service of notice to consumer or employee that purports
to reflect service of the notice by mail to Plaintiff’s counsel.
The subpoenas served on
Joseph, CPA, the IRS, and on the FTB contain identical requests for Plaintiff’s
financial documents, which seek to subpoena:
1. Plaintiff Bakewell’s
income tax returns for years 2005 to 2020 showing 1) dividend payments received
from OneUnited Bank, 2) Bakewell’s ownership of company stock, or 3) any
deductions taken for losses associated with ownership of stock purchased from
OneUnited Bank.
2. All Form 1099s and
any other tax records showing Bakewell receiving dividend payments from
OneUnited Bank.
3. All Form 1099s and
any other tax records showing Bakewell receiving dividend payments from any
entity associated with ownership of company stock.
4. All documents
showing Bakewell’s receipt and/or deposit of dividend checks received from
OneUnited Bank regarding stock purchased from it, including but not limited to
bank account statements, and/or statements, cancelled checks, and the like.
The Northern Trust
subpoena contains requests for documents related to financial investment
opportunities and discussions relating thereto between Plaintiff and Northern
Trust and its employees.
C. Motion Before the
Court
On April 29, 2024,
Plaintiff Bakewell filed a motion to quash the subpoenas served on the IRS and
on the FTB. The motion arises from arguments that the information sought here
is privileged under the tax privilege, that the information is not relevant,
and that even if the information were relevant, the right to privacy overcomes
the need for the discovery for various reasons.
On May 6, 2024, the
Court held the final status conference in this action, at which time the Court advanced
the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to May 21, 2024, and ordered that “[b]riefing
[opposing or replying to Plaintiff’s motion] shall include any objections
relating to documents sought to be subpoenaed to trial.”
On May 8, 2024,
Defendants Cohee and OneUnited Bank filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. The
opposition raises arguments responding to the moving papers’ points and
attaches copies of the four subpoenas discussed above, which are attached as
Exhibits F-I to counsel’s declaration. Consistent with the Court’s May 6, 2024,
directives, the opposition discusses the Joseph, CPA, and the Northern Trust
subpoenas.
On May 15, 2024,
Plaintiff Bakewell filed a reply to Defendants’ opposition.
Plaintiff Bakewell’s
motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Quash
            INITIAL NOTE: Not all social
security numbers have been redacted from the Exhibits to the Opposition, such
as virtually every page of Exhibit E. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.201.) ) Defendants’
counsel is ordered to immediately review the entire filing and provide a
redacted version of the Opposition, plus Exhibits that complies with Rule of
Court 1.201(a); once that is done the Court will delete the prior filing and issue
a nunc pro tunc with the prior filing date for the newly redacted document.
A.
Legal Standard
A motion to quash a deposition subpoena or deposition
notice is used to strike, modify, or impose conditions on a subpoena or notice
that is procedurally or substantively defective. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
1987.1, subd. (a), 2025.410, subd. (c); see, e.g., Catholic Mut. Relief Soc’y
v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 358, 365 (Catholic Mut.) [motion
based on ground that subpoenas sought information outside scope of discovery]; John
B. v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186 [motion based in part on
ground that subpoenas violated right of privacy]; McClatchy Newspapers v.
Superior Court (1945) 26 Cal.2d 386, 391 (McClatchy) [motion based
on ground that subpoenas were unreasonable and oppressive]; Far W. S&L
Assn. v. McLaughlin (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 67, 71 [motion based on ground
that subpoena was not properly served]; City of Los Angeles v. Superior
Court (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 883, 888 [procedural remedy for a defective
subpoena is generally a motion to quash under § 1987.1].) 
Such a motion may be made by:
(1) Any party to the action (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (b)(1)); 
(2) The subpoenaed witness (e.g., a
custodian of another person’s personal records) (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1,
subd. (b)(2); Monarch Healthcare v. Superior Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th
1282, 1287-1288 (Monarch)); 
(3) A person (party or nonparty) whose
consumer, governmental, or employment information or records have been
subpoenaed (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3, subd. (g) [party consumer], 1985.4
[state or local-agency employee or any other natural person], 1985.6, subd.
(f)(1) [employee], 1987.1, subd. (b)(3) [consumer], 1987.1, subd. (b)(4)
[employee]; see also Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1985.3, subd. (g), ¶ 2, 1985.6, subd.
(f)(2) [nonparty consumer can make written objections instead of motion to
quash]); 
(4) A person whose “personally identifying
information” within the meaning of Civ. Code § 1798.79.8, subd, (b), subpoenaed
in connection with an action involving that person’s exercise of free-speech
rights; and 
(5) The Court, on its own motion, after
giving the parties notice and the opportunity to be heard (Code Civ. Proc., §
1987.1, subd. (a).) 
A motion to quash may be based on various
grounds, including that:
(1) The subpoena contains error or
irregularities in the deposition notice (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410,
subds. (a), (c));
(2) The subpoena seeks information that is
not relevant to the issues in the case (see, e.g., Catholic Mut., supra,
42 Cal.4th at p. 365 [motion to quash deposition subpoena because documents
were outside the scope of discovery]; Slagle v. Superior Court (1989)
211 Cal.App.3d 1309, 1314-1315 [motion to quash trial subpoena because medical
records were not relevant was properly overruled]; cf. Cadiz Land Co. v.
Rail Cycle, L.P. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 122-123 [motion to quash
deposition notice because deposition would not lead to admissible evidence]);
(3) The subpoena makes unreasonable or
oppressive demands for information (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a);
see, e.g., McClatchy, supra, 26 Cal.2d at p. 391 [motion to quash
deposition subpoenas because they were unreasonable and oppressive]);
(4) The disclosure of the records sought
will violate the consumer’s constitutional right to privacy (see Cal. Const.,
art. I, § 1; see, e.g., Fett v. Medical Bd. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 211,
213 [petitions to quash to nonparties’ doctor because of privacy rights]; Manela
v. Superior Court (2009) 117 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1150-1151 [motion to quash a
subpoena to party’s doctor because of privacy rights]); and
(5) The disclosure of records will violate a
privilege belonging to the consumer, the witness, or a person with whom the
witness has a relationship that requires the witness to assert the privilege on
the person’s behalf. (See, e.g., Monarch, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1290 [objections to subpoena for business records based on trade-secret
privilege]).

B.
Court’s Determination

Despite reasonable arguments on
both sides, the Court finds in favor of Defendants Cohee and OneUnited Bank, in
part.
First, much of the information
sought by Defendants is relevant. The information is relevant to the pleadings
insofar as they allege that Plaintiff was not a sophisticated investor when he
purchased OneUnited Bank stock. (FAC, ¶ 7; see Opp’n, Fox Decl., Ex. C, 26:4-15.)
The information sought is relevant to whether Plaintiff Bakewell has received
dividends from OneUnited Bank, a question to which Plaintiff has testified by
stating that he does not recall and to which Plaintiff’s reply answers in the
affirmative. (Opp’n, Fox Decl., Ex. C, 59:6 [“I don’t believe I ever received
any dividends”], 59:1-6, 179:1-21, 208:13-17.) Last, the information sought has
conceivably become relevant as impeachment evidence to highlight Plaintiff’s truthfulness
or lack thereof.
Second, the Court finds that based
on equal evidence going in both directions, the Court cannot grant the instant
motion on the ground that Plaintiff Bakewell was never served with notices to
the consumer regarding his consumer records held by the IRS, FTB, Joseph, CPA,
and Northern Trust, the subpoenaed non-parties. (Compare Mot., pp. 7-8 [arguing
no notice to consumer], Ivie Decl., ¶ 2 [purporting to attach two exhibits but
failing to do so], with Opp’n, Fox Decl., Exs. F [Joseph, CPA subpoena], G [FTB
subpoena], H [IRS subpoena], & I [Northern Trust subpoena] at SUBP-025, p.
2, Proof of Service of Notice to Consumer or Employee and Objection.)
Third, the Court accepts that the
tax privilege applies to the requested information.
Fourth, the Court determines that at
least some of Plaintiff’s tax information has been put at issue. A party can
waive or diminish its right to privacy by raising a claim or defense in a suit
that puts the personal information at issue. (See, e.g., John B. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1199 [by putting his own medical condition at
issue, defendant substantially lowered expectation of privacy].) The personal
information should be disclosed only if (1) it is directly relevant to the
party’s claim or defense and (2) disclosure is essential to the fair resolution
of the claim or defense. (Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844,
859; Alch v. Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1425 [a
compelling need for discovery exists where the information sought is directly
relevant and essential to the fair resolution of the legal proceeding].) Here,
as discussed above, the tax information is relevant in several ways, and
disclosure is essential to a fair resolution of specific issues (e.g., whether
Plaintiff was a sophisticated investor as alleged in the FAC and whether he received
dividends, and if so, how much).
Fifth, as briefly summarized at the
end of the preceding paragraph, the Court determines that there is a sufficient
compelling need for the discovery here to overcome a privacy right held by
Plaintiff in his financial records. Where a case involves an obvious invasion
of a privacy interest that is fundamental, a compelling interest or need must
be present to overcome the privacy interest. (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 556.) Here, the Court finds a compelling need not only in
the relevance of the discovery, but also in possible impeachment of Plaintiff
Bakewell. Of course, before such evidence may be admitted at trial, there will
need to be a showing that the documents are in fact impeaching as to some testimony
given. Personally investing in stock is far different from having a broker who
does the decision-making as to stock purchases. 
Finally, while Defendants could potentially
have obtained this information in other ways from other sources, including from
Plaintiff himself, direct evidence of Plaintiff’s financial records appears to
be necessary where Plaintiff has testified that he does not recall the
information that may be gleaned from his financial records, and where
Defendants are arguing that the substance of the claim of not being a
sophisticated investor are false.
On the other hand, however, the records
requested as set forth in the subpoenas attached to the Opposition are
overbroad. As phrased, they invade privacy rights that have not been put at
issue in this litigation. Specifically, the subpoenas request the entirety of
the federal and state tax returns, even though there has only been argument set
forth as to dividend payments from either OneUnited Bank or other entities.
There has been no showing of the relevance of the rest of those tax returns,
which also contain private information relating to Mr. Bakewell’s spouse.
Thus, the Court will DENY the
motion to quash as it relates to evidence of dividends received by, reported
by, or cashed by Danny Bakewell Sr., and it is otherwise GRANTED.
The Court DENIES the sanctions
requested by Plaintiff and Defendants. While the Court denied the motion in
large part, the importance of the right that Plaintiff Bakewell sought to
protect by way of his motion is important to this litigation, as discussed
above. To penalize Plaintiff under the circumstances discussed above would
ignore the fact that Plaintiff presents a reasonable argument for why his
deposition testimony framed him as not being able to recall certain
information. Moreover, the documents requested were found by the Court to be
overbroad. Overall, sanctions are not merited in either direction where both
parties made reasonable arguments. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr.’s
Motion to Quash Subpoenas Duces Tecum and for Sanctions in the Amount of
$3,360.00 Against Defendants Kevin Cohee and OneUnited Bank and Their Counsel
of Record Parnell Fox, Esq. is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
The Court will address at oral
argument a reasonable method for separating the evidence to be produced from
the evidence protected. Moreover, the Court will consider a relevant protective
order to protect Mr. Bakewell’s privacy even as to those documents that are
produced.
Defendants Kevin Cohee and
OneUnited Bank’s opposition request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
Defendants’ counsel is ordered to
immediately review the entire Opposition and provide a redacted version of the Opposition,
plus Exhibits that complies with Rule of Court 1.201(a).
