And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The plaintiff's counsel, Jorge Ledezma, has filed motions to be relieved as counsel for both the individual plaintiff and the estate of the deceased. The court finds that Mr. Ledezma has complied with the necessary requirements and has provided valid reasons for his withdrawal. The court grants both motions, finding that the withdrawal will not cause undue prejudice or delay in the proceeding. The court notes that no trial date has been set, and the opposing parties have not filed oppositions to the motions.
