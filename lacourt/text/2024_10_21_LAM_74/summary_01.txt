The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default. The Defendant, Glendale Diagnostic Imaging Network Medical Office, Inc., alleges that it was served with the Complaint on August 30, 2023, but the documents never reached the appropriate personnel in its office. The Defendant's administrator, Harry Sarafin, was not aware of the case until July 9, 2024. The Defendant immediately contacted its liability insurer and retained counsel after becoming aware of the case. The Judge finds that the Defendant has sufficiently shown that its failure to participate in the case was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motion. The Judge orders that the Defendant shall give notice.
