On 2/28/23, Plaintiff filed his complaint against Defendant,  alleging the following causes of action: (1) General Negligence; and (2) Motor  Vehicle Negligence. On 5/24/23, Defendant filed his answer thereto.   On 5/26/23, Defendant served the subject discovery requests  on Plaintiff. On 9/1/23, Defendant filed the instant motions to compel  Plaintiff’s responses thereto.  // // //   ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.  (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Defendant electronically served  the subject discovery requests on Plaintiff on 5/26/23, the last day for Plaintiff  to respond was 6/28/23. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) On 7/27/23, Defendant  granted Plaintiff an extension to provide responses to the subject discovery  requests by 8/21/23. (Ex. C to Decl. of Kimberly A. Mueller.) To date, Plaintiff  has not provided responses to Defendant’s discovery requests. The Court notes that Plaintiff  has failed to timely oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants  the instant motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to the subject  discovery requests.   Sanctions    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests  for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.  (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that  conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred  by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.  (a).)   Here, Defendant requests $462.50 in  monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel for each of the four  motions, in a total sum of $1,850.00. This amount includes (1) 1.5 hours of  attorney’s time spent preparing each motion; and (2) an anticipated 1 hour  appearing at the instant hearing, at Defendant’s attorney’s hourly rate of $185.00  per hour. (Mueller Decl. ¶¶  6–7.)   In granting the instant motions, the  Court finds it reasonable to award Defendant sanctions against Plaintiff and  his counsel in the total amount of $370.00.    CONCLUSION    The motions are granted. Plaintiff  is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Defendant’s first set of  discovery requests within 10 days. Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One,  are deemed admitted. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the  amount of $500.00.
