Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Gloria Franklin's motion for terminating sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue sanctions, and monetary sanctions against Defendant Spectrum Laboratories Products, Inc. and its counsel. The Court denies the motion for terminating sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, and issue sanctions without prejudice, meaning that the parties may re-file the motion in the future. The Court grants the motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,515.30, representing the costs and fees incurred by Plaintiff's counsel.

The Court finds that the Defendant has failed to comply with discovery orders and has not provided sufficient responses to requests for production and form interrogatories. The Court also finds that the Defendant's counsel has failed to communicate adequately with Plaintiff's counsel and has not provided timely responses to discovery requests.

The Court imposes monetary sanctions on the Defendant and its counsel in the amount of $4,515.30, which includes costs and fees incurred by Plaintiff's counsel. The Court notes that this amount is reduced from the original amount requested by Plaintiff, which was $11,995.30.

The Court orders the Defendant and its counsel to remit payment within 30 days of the order.
