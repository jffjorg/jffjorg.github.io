 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Sonia
  Maravilla’s Motion to Compel Responses to Set One of Plaintiff’s Discovery.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Sonia Maravilla sues Defendants FCA US LLC (FCA US) and Does 1
through 10 pursuant to an April 20, 2023 Complaint alleging Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (SBA) claims of (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil
Code section 1793.2, (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section
1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (4) Breach
of Express Warranty, Civil Code Section 1791.2 Subdivision (a); Section 1794,
and (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability, Civil Code Section
1791.1; Section 1794.
On June 1, 2023, FCA US filed an Answer to Complaint.
Motion Before the Court
On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff Maravilla served various discovery requests
on Defendant FCA US: (1) Form Interrogatories – General, Set One (FROGs, Set
One); (2) Special Interrogatories to Defendant, Set One (SROGs, Set One); (3)
Requests for Production of Documents to Defendant, Set One (RPDs, Set One); and
(4) Requests for Admission to Defendant, Set One (RFAs, Set One).
The discovery was served by email to two attorneys at Clark Hill LLP,
counsel for FCA US (ehanson@clarkhill.com and vdao@clarkhill.com) and on a
third Clark Hill email seemingly created for the purpose of “FCA” litigation (clarkhill.fca@clarkhill.com,
which appears as the email for counsel in FCA US’s June 1, 2023 Answer).
Responses to this discovery were due on September 12, 2023.
On September 15, 2023, as a professional courtesy, Plaintiff’s counsel
emailed FCA US’s counsel regarding the overdue responses, an email to which FCA
US’s counsel did not respond.
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel followed up with FCA US’s
counsel, which responded that same day indicating that FCA would serve
responses by October 4, 2023.
On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff sent another courtesy email regarding Defendant’s
overdue responses, with FCA US’s counsel stating that FCA US thought that
responses were served and that counsel would check the status with FCA US and
forward responses to Plaintiff’s counsel.
On December 8, 2023, due to ongoing nonresponse from FCA US, Plaintiff
filed a motion to (1) compel initial discovery responses to FROGs, Set One,
SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, and (2) deem RFAs, Set One, admitted against
FCA US. The motion does not request monetary sanctions and was served by email
to the same three email addresses where the discovery at issue was served.
Despite a facially valid proof of service, FCA US has failed to oppose
Plaintiff’s motion, which is now before the Court. 
 
Motion
to Compel Initial Responses and to Deem Admissions Admitted
I.
Legal Standard
– Compel Initial Responses
A
motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did
not serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a)
[demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish
this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories],
2031.040 [demand to produce]);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b)
[interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and
(3)
No timely response (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories],
2031.300 [demand to produce]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].) 
Order
Compelling Initial Discovery Responses: GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s
motion attaches evidence showing proper service of FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set
One, and RPDs, Set One, on FCA US. (Mot., Xie Decl., Ex. 1, RPDs, Set One,
SROGs, Set One, and FROGs, Set One, Proofs of Service.)
Plaintiff’s
motion attaches evidence showing expiration of the deadline to respond. (Mot.,
Xie Decl., ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff’s
motion attaches evidence showing no timely response has been made by FCA US.
(Mot., Xie Decl., ¶¶ 4-11.)
A
review of FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One shows that the
requests are within the scope of discovery. These interrogatories and
production requests relate to, among other things, the subject vehicle at issue
in this litigation and to information for other vehicles of the same year,
make, and/or model. Such discovery, for example, could lead to a determination
that FCA US was aware of non-conformable defects in the subject vehicle and
nevertheless failed to comply with its statutory requirement to repurchase or
replace that vehicle.
Plaintiff’s
motion is therefore GRANTED as to FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set
One.
II. Deem RFAs, Set One, Admitted
Legal
Standard
The
discovering party can make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests
for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a)
[RFA responses must be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs
is treated like no response].) These requests are not automatically deemed
admitted; the discovery party must make the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).)
To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.070);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b));
and
(3)
That (a) the responding party served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response
(see Appleton v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636
[unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra,
263 Cal.App.2d at p. 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].)
Order
Deeming RFAs Admitted: GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s
motion attaches evidence showing proper service of RFAs, Set One, on FCA US.
(Mot., Xie Decl., Ex. 1, RFA, Set One, Proof of Service.)
Plaintiff’s
motion attaches evidence showing expiration of the deadline to respond. (Mot.,
Xie Decl., ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff’s
motion attaches evidence showing no timely response has been made by FCA US.
(Mot., Xie Decl., ¶¶ 4-11.)
A
review of RFAs, Set One, shows that the requests are within the scope of
discovery. These admission requests relate to, among other things, the subject
vehicle at issue in this litigation and to information for other vehicles of
the same year, make, and/or model. Such discovery could, for example, lead to a
determination that FCA US was aware of non-conformable defects in the subject
vehicle and nevertheless failed to comply with its statutory requirement to
repurchase or replace that vehicle.
Plaintiff’s
motion is therefore GRANTED as to RFAs, Set One. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Sonia Maravilla’s Motion to Compel Responses to Set One of
Plaintiff’s Discovery is GRANTED.
Defendant FCA US LLC is ORDERED to provide objection-free, Code-compliant
responses to (1) Form Interrogatories – General, Set One, (2) Special
Interrogatories to Defendant, Set One, and (3) Requests for Production of
Documents to Defendant, Set One, within 14 days of this order. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subds. (a), (b), 2031.300, subds. (a), (b).)
The genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified
in Requests for Admission to Defendant, Set One, are DEEMED ADMITTED against
Defendant FCA US LLC. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a), (b).)
