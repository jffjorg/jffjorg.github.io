DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES (filed 07/02/2024)
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Defendant a reduced amount of attorneys’
fees totaling $59,510.96 in
attorney fees and costs. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November
12, 2020, Plaintiff Fitness International, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendant Andrews Rancho Del Sur (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10.
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract
(Representations, Warranties, and Covenants); (2) Breach of Contract (Credit);
(3) Breach of Contract (Failure to Abate Rent); (4) Common Count (Money Had and
Received); (5) Common Count (Money Paid by Mistake); and (6) Declaratory
Judgment. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiff is a nationwide operator of health and fitness
centers. Defendant is the owner of the real commercial property located at 7230
Firestone Boulevard in Downey, California (“Subject Property”).  On
December 13, 1999, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Lease Agreement
(“Lease”), whereby Defendant agreed to rent the Subject Premises to Plaintiff
for the purposes of operating a health and fitness center, in exchange for the
monthly payment of rent.  Pursuant to the Lease, Defendant agreed to
deliver to Plaintiff use of the Subject Premises and, further agreed Plaintiff
would be provided with peaceful and quiet possession and enjoyment of the
Subject Premises.  In exchange for the peaceful and quiet provision and
possession of the Subject Property, Plaintiff agreed to pay monetary rent on a
monthly basis. 
 
On March 19,
2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-33-20,
directing all individuals in California to stay at home due to the COVID-19
pandemic, and further directed all non-essential businesses, including gyms and
fitness centers, to immediately cease operating to prevent further spread of
COVID-19.  Due to Executive Order N-33-20, as well as corresponding
Federal and State Stay-At-Home Orders, Defendant was unable to provide
Plaintiff with possession of the Subject Premises from approximately March 17,
2020 to June 11, 2020, and thereafter, from July 13, 2020 to the present. 
However, despite Defendant’s inability to perform under the governing Lease,
Defendant required Plaintiff’s performance and demanded Plaintiff’s payment of
monthly rent.  Pursuant to Defendant’s demand, Plaintiff paid monthly
rent, totaling approximately $460,412.69, from approximately March 17, 2020
through March 31, 2020, and April 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020. 
Plaintiff maintains Defendant’s demand for payment of rent constitutes a breach
of the Lease as Defendant was unable to perform under the Lease by providing
Plaintiff with peaceful and quiet possession of the Subject Property during the
COVID-19 pandemic.  Plaintiff, additionally, maintains that Plaintiff was
excused from paying rent under the Lease as the purpose of the Lease was
frustrated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and performance under the Lease was
impracticable. 
 
On October 25,
2022, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff
appealed the Court’s judgment on December 12, 2022.
 
On January 9,
2023, Defendant filed its first Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. On July
18, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion and awarded Defendant the total amount
of $300,109.64.
 
On February
16, 2024, the Court of Appeal affirmed this Court’s judgment. The Court of
Appeal also ordered that Defendant is entitled to its costs. (2/16/24 Court of
Appeal’s Order.)
 
On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Review by the California Supreme Court. The
California Supreme Court denied Fitness’ Petition for Review on May 15, 2024.
 
On May 20,
2024, following the Supreme Court’s denial of Plaintiff’s Petition for Review, the
Court of Appeal issued its Remittitur stating that its Opinion had become
final. 
 
On July 2,
2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees against Plaintiff,
arguing:
·      
Defendant is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs on appeal by contract.
·      
Defendant moves for entry of an award of their Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs incurred in the total amount of $62,275.96  
 
No opposition
has been filed. 
 
On August 8,
2024, Defendant filed a Notice of Non-Opposition requesting the Court grant
Defendant’s unopposed Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. 
 
II. ANALYSIS 
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that a prevailing party may
recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may include
attorneys’ fees when authorized by statute or contract. 
 
“[A]bsent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,
including those relating solely to the fee.  We explained that the purpose
behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e., encouraging attorneys to act as
private attorneys general and to vindicate important rights affecting the
public interest—will often be frustrated, sometimes nullified, if awards are
diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a
rightful fee claim.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id. at 1134.) Other factors to consider in fixing the
reasonableness of fees to be considered beyond the fee agreement alone include,
but are not limited to “(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee
customarily charged in this locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount
involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the
circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or
lawyers performing the services.” (Glendora Community Redevelopment
Agency v. Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470.)
 
B.     
Defendant is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees
 
In any action “on a contract” that provides for the prevailing
party’s recovery of attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party “shall be entitled to
[an award of] reasonable attorneys’ fees.”¿(Civ. Code, § 1717.) The
contractual entitlement to an attorney’s fee award in favor of the prevailing
party applies to both trial and appellate court proceedings. (Serrano v
Unruh (“Serrano”) (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 637 (it is established that
fees, if recoverable at all -- pursuant either to statute or parties’ agreement
– are available for services at trial and on appeal)). An award of costs on
appeal does not preclude a party from seeking attorneys’ fees under California
Rule of Court, rule 3.1702. The prevailing party is to file a motion for
attorney’s fees on appeal with the trial court within 40 days of the issuance
of the remittitur. (CRC, Rule 3.1702(c); 8.278(c)(1)).
 
Here,
the Court of
Appeal issued its Remittitur stating that its Opinion had become final on May
20, 2024. Defendant timely filed this motion on July 2, 2024. The Court of
Appeal ordered “Defendant Andrews Rancho Del Sur is entitled to costs,”
following the California Supreme Court’s denial of Plaintiff’s Petition for
Review. (Ferruzzo Decl. at ¶¶ 15-18.)
 
Defendant is
a prevailing party in this action. The provision in the lease provided that the
unsuccessful party shall reimburse the successful party for its reasonable
attorneys’ fees, costs and any attorneys’ fees incurred in any post-judgment
proceeding. (Ferruzzo Decl., Ex. A, Section 22.7.) Thus, the Court finds that Defendant
is entitled to its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
C.     
Hourly Rate
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) An attorney’s
own billing rates carry a presumption of reasonableness. (Mandel v. Lackner
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761)
 
Defendant
seeks to recover a total of $59,515.00 in attorneys’ fees for work completed by several
attorneys and paralegals with varying hourly rates. Defendant asserts
that the appellate team for this case was composed of Senior Partner Gregory J.
Ferruzzo as Trial Counsel; Senior Associate Sean E. Morrissey as Handling
Attorney; Partner Gordon D. Scholte; Associate Alex C. Verdegem; and several
paralegals/legal staff. Counsel states that the
hourly rates of $550/hour for a senior partner, $495/hour for a partner, $350/hour
to $395/hour for associates, and $175/hour to $250/hour are well within the
range of current market rates in Orange County for highly skilled and
experienced litigators who regularly handle matters of similar complexity.
(Ferruzzo Decl., ¶ 38.)
 
The Court finds that the rates requested by
Defendant are reasonable and not higher than rates charged by attorneys with
comparable skill and expertise. Counsel’s
declaration attests to their experience and the reasonableness of the rates. (Ferruzzo
Decl., ¶ 38.) Based on the evidence before it, the
Court is not inclined to reduce the hourly rates requested.
 
D.    
Reasonable Hours Incurred and Costs
 
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) 
 
While
not per se objectionable, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney fee request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326.) 
 
Defendant’s counsel states that the appellate team expended
145 hours defending this case on appeal which represents a reasonable number of
hours in light of the complexity, duration and nature of the claims, and the
successful result obtained by counsel. Defendant submitted its billing invoices to support its
requested attorneys’ fees. (Ferruzzo Decl., Ex. L.) 
 
The Court has considered the sought attorney fees
based on the stated tasks and does not find them unreasonable in light of the
work completed by counsel in this case. Further, verified cost bills are “prima
facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily
incurred…” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682). In light
of the uncontroverted evidence in support and its own experience, the Court
finds the hourly rates and work billed by counsel reasonable. (See Morris v.
Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41, as modified
(Oct. 11, 2019), review denied (Jan. 2, 2020).) 
 
Defendant anticipated additional attorneys’ fees to review Plaintiff’s
Opposition, prepare Defendant’s Reply, and to prepare for and attend the motion
hearing, at a rate of $395 an hour for 8 hours, totaling $3,160. (Ferruzzo
Decl., ¶ 40.) Since the motion is unopposed, the Court will only include
an hour of these anticipated fees for Defendant to prepare for and attend the
motion hearing. 
 
Defendant also filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking the recovery of
its filing and service costs in connection with this matter. The “prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) Thus, the Court further awards Defendant’s requested costs
for $2,760.96. 
 
In sum, this Court grants Defendant a reduced amount of attorneys’
fees totaling $56,750.00 and costs totaling $2,760.96. The Court awards Defendant a total amount of $59,510.96 in
attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
III.
DISPOSITION 
 
Defendant’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Defendant a reduced amount of attorneys’
fees totaling $59,510.96 in
attorney fees and costs.
