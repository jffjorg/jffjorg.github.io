And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, American Express National Bank, had filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Meltem Saricicek, alleging that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff for money lent to the defendant. The parties had entered into a stipulation for conditional entry of judgment, which provided for the defendant to make monthly payments to the plaintiff. However, the defendant failed to make the required payments, and the plaintiff is seeking to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The court has reviewed the stipulation and found that the defendant has defaulted on the agreement, and therefore, the court is granting the plaintiff's motion and entering judgment in the amount of $64,903.29, which includes the principal sum of $70,444.66 and costs of $1,148.63.00, less credits of $6,690.00.
