PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO VACATE DISMISSAL AND ENTER
JUDGMENT (filed 6/6/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment.  
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On September
19, 2023, Plaintiff American Express National Bank filed the instant action
against Defendant Meltem Saricicek, aka Meltem M Saricicek, alleging causes of
action for common counts.  
 
The Complaint alleges that Defendant is indebted to Plaintiff
for money lent to Defendant at Defendant’s request. Plaintiff alleges damages
in the amount of $70,444.66.
 
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff and
Defendant entered into a Stipulation for Conditional Entry of Judgment
(hereinafter “Stipulation”). Pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation,
Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $53,520.00, inclusive of court costs, in
monthly payments. 
 
On January 03, 2024, this Court
dismissed this matter without prejudice pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6 as was agreed
upon by the Parties in the Stipulation. The Court stated in its order that the
Court retains jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all terms of
settlement, including judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section
664.6.
 
On
June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment.  
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
II.ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
CCP section 664.6 provides that “[i]f
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6.)
 
B.     
Discussion
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant
failed to fulfill the obligations agreed to in the parties’ Stipulation. As a
result, Plaintiff requests that the Court vacate the dismissal previously
entered in this case pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6, and
enter Judgment in the amount of $64,903.29 pursuant to the terms of the written
Stipulation. 
 
In support of its motion,
Plaintiff filed the Stipulation showing the agreed upon terms. The Stipulation provides
for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP section 664.6 to enforce
the agreement. (Keith Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 6.) Pursuant to the Stipulation, Plaintiff
was to recover from Defendant the sum of $53,520. (Keith Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 1.) Defendant
was to pay Plaintiff $2,230 on or before November 10, 2023 and $2,230 on or before
the 10th day of each month until the sum of $53,520 is paid in full.
(Ibid.) Further, pursuant to the Stipulation, in the event of default by
the Defendant, Plaintiff is entitled to request entry of judgment against
Defendant for the amount of principal plus court costs, less a credit for all
payments received under the terms of the Stipulation. (Keith Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 6.)

 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
made payments totaling $6,690 and then stopped making payments required by the
Stipulation. (Keith Decl. ¶ 3.) Notably, Defendant failed to file an
opposition.  
 
As Defendant has defaulted, the
Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment under the
Stipulation. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
grants the Motion to vacate dismissal and enters judgment in the principal sum
of $70,444.66
and costs of $1,148.63.00, less credits of $6,690.00, for a total
of $64,903.29.   
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
