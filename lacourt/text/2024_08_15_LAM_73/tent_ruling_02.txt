163, 166, 169, 170, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 182, 184, 185,

Natural Affairs, Inc. (Bloomberg) shall provide code-compliant responses within
20 days.
BACKGROUND
 
On June 9,
2021, Plaintiff Heather Krantz (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment action
against Defendants Bloomberg L.P., Bloomberg BNA Holdings Inc., The Bureau of
National Affairs, Inc. d/b/a Bloomberg Industry Group (“BNA”), Michael
Bloomberg, Stephen Crossman, and Matthew Daley (collectively “Defendants”). On
January 19, 2022, Defendants Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg L.P. were
dismissed with prejudice. 
 
On February
4, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the
following causes of action: (1) gender discrimination in violation of the FEHA
and Government Code § 12940(a); (2) retaliation in violation of the FEHA and
Government Code § 12940(h); (3) constructive discharge in violation of public
policy; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, retaliation in
violation of the FEHA and Government Code § 12940(k); and (5) gender harassment
in violation of the FEHA.
 
As alleged in the FAC, Plaintiff claims
she was treated less favorably than her male peers because of her gender during
her employment with Defendant Bloomberg Industry Group (“BNA”). (FAC, ¶ 186.)
Plaintiff was hired by BNA in January 2017 as a Large Law Account Executive.
(FAC, ¶ 74.) In May 2017, Plaintiff alleges she began witnessing a male
dominated culture within the company, including discriminatory behavior by male
colleagues towards women during work meetings. (FAC, ¶¶ 113, 133.) Plaintiff
alleges that after notifying her supervisor, Defendant Crossman, that she was
pregnant in September 2017, she was passed over for a promotion and reassigned
to a new “dockets” sales role. (FAC, ¶¶ 104-112, 117-119.)  While in training for this new role, she
allegedly had her accounts taken away which prevented her from earning
commissions and bonuses. (FAC, ¶¶ 123-124.)  When Plaintiff returned from pregnancy leave,
she alleges she was given less desirable duties assisting a Regional Sales
Director by covering open accounts and she was not given a defined territory
with her own accounts. (FAC, ¶¶ 125, 135-137.)  Further, she alleges she did not have a clear
compensation plan and was unable to earn commission. (FAC, ¶¶ 138-143.)  In addition, Plaintiff alleges her male peers
were offered higher starting salaries and commissions than her for the same
role. (FAC, ¶¶ 83-84.)

 
Plaintiff
alleges she complained to BNA supervisors of her job assignment, including her
lack of sales opportunities, lack of defined compensation plan and
discrimination concerning her pregnancy and maternity leave.  (FAC,
¶¶ 159-170.) After her repeated complaints to her supervisors, Plaintiff
alleges she was finally given her own defined territory in October 2019;
however, the accounts primarily consisted of smaller, less lucrative law firms.
(FAC, ¶¶ 172-173.) On November 1, 2019, Plaintiff alleges she was
constructively discharged. (FAC, ¶
182.)
 
On February
28, 2024, the Court granted Motion for Summary Judgment as to Defendant
Bloomberg BNA Holdings, Inc. only.
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Request for Production of Documents, Set Four, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Request
Nos. 158, 160, 162 163, 165, 166, 169, 170, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178,
179, 180, 182, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197,
198, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216,
217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 229 and 230. 
·      
Each of the responses to these requests contain numerous
boilerplate objections, particularly as to relevancy, without Defendants
setting forth the basis for its objections.
·      
The information contained therein is relevant for the following
reasons: (1) to show the disparate treatment based on sex in compensation in
comparison to her male team members after she announced her pregnancy; (2) to
show the disparate treatment based on sex in account assignment to Plaintiff
and in comparison to her male team members from the time Plaintiff was hired
and assigned Large Law Accounts and then was reassigned accounts without
commission potential after she informed her male supervisor she was pregnant;
and (3) to show the disparate treatment based on sex in compensation in
comparison to her male team members from the time Plaintiff was hired and
assigned Large Law Accounts in 2017 until after she informed her male supervisor
she was pregnant, and took maternity leave in 2018. Plaintiff is entitled to
this material and necessary information, which supports her claims for gender
and pregnancy discrimination against Defendants.
 
Defendant
filed an opposition. Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Motions to compel further responses must always be accompanied by
a meet-and confer-declaration (per Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040) demonstrating a
“reasonable and good faith attempt an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.”  (Id., §§ 2030.300(b), 2031.310(b)(2),
2033.290(b).)  They must also be accompanied by a separate statement
containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a
further response is warranted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) 
The separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials
may be incorporated by reference.  (Id., rule 3.1345(c).) 
 
A motion to compel further production must set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection
demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the
motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good
cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts show that the
discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise
at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65
Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is
discoverable if it is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and it is not
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source
that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v.
Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence).) 
 
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or
production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion to compel a further response to a request for production
must be noticed within 45 days of the service of the response, or any
supplemental response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing. 
Otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel further response to
the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)  The motion must
also be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of any issue presented by it. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).) Finally, a motion to compel
further responses to inspection demands must be accompanied by a separate
document that sets forth each item to which further response is requested and
the factual and legal reasons for compelling it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).)  
 
B.     
Meet and Confer
 
Plaintiff submits the declaration of her counsel stating that on
December 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a deficiency letter to defense
counsel about their failure to produce documents and to narrow the outstanding
documents. (Clancy Decl., ¶ 3.) On
December 13, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred with defense counsel
about Defendants’ failure to produce the entirety of the requested documents. (Ibid.)
 
While in its opposition Defendant asserts that this Motion is improper
because Plaintiff did not request or schedule an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”) as a prerequisite to filing, the parties attended an IDC on July 10,
2024.
 
The Court finds the meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
C.     
Defendant Bloomberg BNA Holdings Inc.
 
First, Defendant argue Plaintiff’s Motion should be denied as to
Defendant Bloomberg BNA Holdings, Inc. because they are no longer a party to
this lawsuit.
 
Plaintiff’s Motion was filed before the Court granted Motion for
Summary Judgment as to Defendant Bloomberg BNA Holdings, Inc. on February 28,
2024. In Plaintiff’s reply, she does not dispute that Bloomberg BNA Holdings,
Inc. is no longer a party to this lawsuit. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant The
Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., dba Bloomberg Industry Group, must still be
compelled to provide full and complete responses to Plaintiff’s RFP #4.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion only
applies to Defendant
The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., dba Bloomberg Industry Group. 
 
D.    
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Request Nos.
158, 160, 162 163, 165, 166, 169, 170, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179,
180, 182, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198,
202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217,
218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 229 and 230. 
 
As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes that Defendant repeatedly claims documents
are protected under its right to privacy. The California Constitution
provides Californians with a right to privacy. (Cal. Const., art. 1, section
1.) The California Supreme Court has held that “[t]he party asserting a privacy
right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened
intrusion that is serious.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 552 (“Williams”), citing Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35.) 
 
Other than
broadly asserting certain requests as a violation of privacy, Defendant has not
established a protected privacy interest. To the extent that Defendant
determines that certain documents are private or privileged, Defendant is
ordered to produce a privilege log identifying documents claimed to be
protected and the grounds for that protection. 
 
a.      Request Nos.
158; 160-163; 166; 180; 182; 184-189; 195; 205; 226-227; 230
 
Request No. 158 seeks “Any and all Account Executive and/or Relationship Partner
account lists for coverage before and after the October 2019 re-alignment for
the Western Division Large Law Bloomberg Law Sales Division.”
 
Request No. 160 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS concerning every account that
PLAINTIFF covered for Yadana Latt, each renewal and incremental revenue that
occurred while PLAINTIFF was covering the firms and whether PLAINTIFF received
a commission.”
 
Request No. 162 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS indicating coverage assignments for
each account in each open territory in Yadana Latt’s three regions during 2018
and 2019.”
 
Request No. 163 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS relating to Allen Cotton’s role(s)
before and after PLAINTIFF’S return from maternity leave.”
 
Request No. 166 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS relating to Allen Cotton’s accounts
or territories he was assigned to cover before and after the “Summer of 2018”
re-organization, and what other roles he held.”
 
Request No. 180 seeks “Darin Karpel’s 2019 Compensation Plan Summary.”
 
Request No. 182 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS regarding Base Salaries and Overall
earnings (base + variable compensation) for all Large Law Western Division
Account Executives for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 184 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS regarding Base Salaries and Overall
earnings (base + variable compensation) for all Relationship Partners for 2017,
2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 185 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS regarding Base Salaries and Overall
earnings (base + variable compensation) for all Large Law Relationship Partners
for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 186 seeks “Allen Cotton’s Compensation Plan Summary for 2017, 2019.”
 
Request No. 187 seeks “Allen Cotton’s Target Compensation Summary for 2017, 2018,
2019.”
 
Request No. 188 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS regarding Allen Cotton’s Sales
Earnings for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 189 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS regarding Allen Cotton’s earnings
for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 195 seeks “The October 2019 Account Executive Territory Account List
given to PLAINTIFF for coverage prior to her constructive discharge.”
 
Request No. 205 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS concerning incremental sales revenue
in Yadana Latt’s open accounts that PLAINTIFF covered from August 2018 through
December 2019.”
 
Request No. 226 seeks “Any and all Short-Term Disability Policies in effect from
2019 to the present.”
 
Request No. 227 seeks “Any and all Long-Term Disability Policies in effect from
2019 to the present.”
 
Request No. 230 seeks “Any and all spreadsheets concerning the allocation of
accounts within territories in 2019 as testified to by Andrew Prior in his
deposition held on September 8, 2023.”
 
As to each of these requests, Defendant states in a conclusory
manner that further responses should not be compelled because these requests
seek the exact same documents sought by other RFPs, which have already been
produced. Defendant also contends that after further meeting and conferring
between the parties, Defendant provided information on each Large Law and Extra
Large Law account for which she received commissions in 2017, as well as those
same accounts both before (2016) and after (2017-2019) she serviced those
accounts in order to show the amounts sold, in context. 
 
Plaintiff maintains that Defendant has still not provided these
documents, despite its assertion that it had already produced them.
 
The Court finds Defendant fails to explain how these requests are
duplicative and how they seek the same documents sought by other RFPs. Defendant
also does not clarify whether or not responsive documents exist and/or whether
they are being withheld because of one or more of their
objections.
 
For example, Defendant argues RFP No. 162 is duplicative of RFP
Nos. 160- 161. However, RFP No. 162 seeks documents indicating coverage
assignments for each account in each open territory in Yadana Latt’s three
regions during 2018 and 2019, whereas RFP No. 160 seeks documents concerning
every account that Plaintiff covered for Yadana Latt and RFP No. 161 seeks
documents indicating whether Plaintiff received a commission on every account
that she covered for Yadana Latt. Not all documents which seek documents to
Plaintiff only would encompass all documents responsive to RFP No. 162 which
relates to the assignment of accounts to individuals other than Plaintiff. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to
why the information sought in these requests are necessary and relevant to her
case. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
request for production of document Nos. 158; 160-163; 166; 180; 182; 184-189;
195; 205; 226-227; 230.
 
b.      Request No.
165
 
Request No. 165 seeks “Any and all DOCUMENTS indicating firm names
and amounts for commissions paid to PLAINTIFF in 2018 and 2019.”
 
Defendant argues it already produced documents responsive to this
Request, in response to Request 63. Defendant asserts it is not in the
possession, custody, or control of any additional documents as no such
documents exist or have ever existed, as stated in Defendant’s responses. Defendant
further asserts that to the extent Plaintiff seeks information regarding
commissions in 2018 and 2019, the documents do not exist as she did not earn
commissions during this time period.
 
Since Defendant contends that documents do not exist regarding
commissions in 2018 and 2019 as Plaintiff did not earn commissions during this
time period, the Court finds this is sufficient. Plaintiff does not
specifically address this in her reply.
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
request for production of document No. 165. 
 
c.       Request Nos.
169-171; 173-179; 193; 206-225
 
Request No. 169 seeks “Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between Steve Crossman, Matt
Daly, Jon Mabel and any other executive officer of Defendants Bloomberg INDG or
Bloomberg BNA relating to the reasons PLAINTIFF’s Account Executive role was

Daley and/or any other Bloomberg INDG or Bloomberg BNA Officer relating to the

Request No. 218 seeks “Matt Daley’s calendar showing Calendar Meetings for June,
July, August 2018.”
 
Request No. 219 seeks “Matt Daley’s calendar showing Calendar Meetings for

Request No. 220 seeks “Steve Crossman’s calendar showing Calendar Meetings in

Request No. 224 seeks “Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between Andrew Prior and Human

Request No. 225 seeks “The email referenced by Matt Daley during his deposition
taken on June 23, 2023, which he called a “Congratulatory Email” in which Sue
Fong complains of being treated unfairly or unequally compared to males.”
 
Defendant asserts the same argument as to why further response
should not be compelled as to each of these requests. Defendant argues that: “on
March 19, 2024, Defendant sent Plaintiff their responses to Plaintiff’s
proposed ESI search terms. The Parties then discussed during their lengthy meet
and confer call on May 14, 2024. Defendant did not hear back from Plaintiff
regarding the same in the period between March 19 and May 14, 2024. When the
Parties spoke on May 14, Plaintiff stated only that Defendant’s proposed
revisions were “unreasonable.” This did nothing to further the meet and confer
process and Plaintiff has made no additional efforts to meet and confer with
Defendant. This Motion is improper on this basis.” (Def’s Separate Statement,
p. 6.)
 
In her reply, Plaintiff argues that with respect to Defendant’s
contention that they cannot produce the requested documents until the parties
reach an ESI protocol, the Court has previously rejected Defendant’s same
argument when it ruled in favor of Plaintiff on her Motion to Compel Defendants’
further response to RFP # 3. Plaintiff also asserts the parties have been
engaged in discussions and are working towards finalizing an ESI protocol,
however, a Court Order is necessary to compel Defendant to produce the
discovery which Plaintiff is entitled.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to
why the information sought in these requests are necessary and relevant to her
case. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
request for production of document Nos. 169-171; 173-179; 193; 206-225.
 
a.      Request Nos. 191-192;
194 
 
Request No. 191 seeks “Any and all Performance Records, annual and/or mid-year
reviews for Allen Cotton for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 192 seeks “Any and all Quota Achievement Performance Records for
Allen Cotton for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Request No. 194 seeks “Allen Cotton W2s for 2017, 2018, 2019.”
 
Defendant argues the information sought is protected by the
third-party right to privacy under both the California and United States
Constitutions. Specifically, Mr. Cotton, not a party to this matter, has a
strong privacy interest in his performance reviews and any comments contained
therein. The information sought also constitutes confidential business
information that is not relevant to Plaintiff’s claims, particularly as the
underlying information (regarding Mr. Cotton’s earnings) has already been
produced. 
 
To the extent
that Defendant determines that certain documents are private or privileged, Defendant
is ordered to produce a privilege log identifying documents claimed to be
protected and the grounds for that protection. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to
why the information sought in these requests are necessary and relevant to her
case. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
request for production of document Nos. 191-192; 194.
 
b.      Request Nos. 196-198;
202-204
 
Request No. 196 seeks “Any and all December 2017 Commission payouts for
PLAINTIFF’s former San Diego accounts.”
 
Request No. 197 seeks “Any and all January 2018 Commission payouts for
PLAINTIFF's former San Diego accounts.”
 
Request No. 198 seeks “Any and all February 2018 Commission payouts for
PLAINTIFF's former San Diego accounts.”
 
Request No. 202 seeks “Any and all December 2017 Commission payouts for
PLAINTIFF's former select Los Angeles accounts.”
 
Request No. 203 seeks “Any and all January 2018 Commission payouts for PLAINTIFF's
former select Los Angeles accounts.”
 
Request No. 204 seeks “Any and all February 2018 Commission payouts for
PLAINTIFF's former select Los Angeles accounts.”
 
As to these requests, Defendant argues it already provided
verified, Code-compliant responses including nearly four-hundred pages of
responsive documents. Plaintiff’s “reasons” why a further response should be
compelled is unintelligible and, despite numerous requests for clarification,
Defendant are left at a loss as to how to proceed. 
 
The Court does not find Defendant’s argument persuasive. Defendant
does not identify the responsive documents and only refers to the entirety of
their production. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to
why the information sought in these requests are necessary and relevant to her
case. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
request for production of document Nos. 196-198; 202-204.
 
c.       Request No.
229
 
Request No. 229 seeks “Any and all territories and accounts assigned for the BLIC
role in 2017-2020.”
 
Defendant argues this Request is unintelligible. 
 
Plaintiff argues Defendants’ responses are incomplete as they
failed to provide the accounts for the BLIC (“Docket”) role that were
purportedly assigned to Plaintiff and Mr. Cotton. The information is relevant
to show the disparate treatment based on sex in compensation in comparison to
her male team member who was assigned the same role with viable accounts to
earn commission that Defendants claimed was a promotion for Plaintiff after she
announced her pregnancy.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to
why the information sought in this request is necessary and relevant to her
case. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
request for production of document No. 229.
