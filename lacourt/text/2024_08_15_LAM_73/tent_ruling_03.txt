On May 19, 2023, Plaintiffs Richard Yang and Seijoon Hwang
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants Jia Qi Wang
(“Wang”), Hao Luo, Albert Abkarian (“Abkarian”), YMIP, Inc. (“YMIP”), YMENT
Group Inc., and OBOA, Inc. (“OBOA”). 
 
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) alleging the following causes of action: 
 
C/A 1: Fraudulent Inducement 
C/A 2: Negligent Misrepresentation
C/A 3: Fraud 
C/A 4: Conversion 
C/A 5: Breach of Fiduciary Duty
C/A 6: Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty
C/A 7: Aiding and Abetting Fraud
C/A 8: California Penal Code Section 496
C/A 9: Accounting
C/A 10: Unfair Business Practices (Violation of
Business and Professions Code Section 17200)
 
The FAC
alleges that Defendants induced Plaintiffs to invest more than $1.45 million
into a fraudulent investment scam. The FAC alleges that Defendants falsely
misrepresented facts about the company that Plaintiffs invested in and falsely
misrepresented that Plaintiffs’ would be paid back for their investments. 
 
On
May 28, 2024, counsel for Defendants Hao Luo and Jia Qi Wang filed Motions to
Be Relieved as Counsel as to each. 
 
No
opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.      Discussion
Noah
Green, counsel for Defendants Hao Luo and Jia Qi Wang,
seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure, Section 284(2). Counsel correctly
completed and filed the notice (Form MC-051) and declaration (MC-052). (Code
Civ. Proc., § 284(2); Cal. Rules Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In
the declarations, counsel sufficiently explains that this motion is being
brought under Section 284(2) instead of 284(1) because the clients and
counsel have irreconcilable differences regarding the handling of the case. 
Counsel
served the notices (MC-051), the declarations (MC-052), and the proposed orders
(MC-053) on all the parties, including Defendants Hao
Luo and Jia Qi Wang. 
The
Court finds all the requirements for relief have been completed. Additionally,
trial is not scheduled in this case until March 24, 2025. Defendants Hao
Luo and Jia Qi Wang have a reasonable amount of time to obtain new
counsel, such that they should not be prejudiced by the withdrawal.
III. DISPOSITION
 
Accordingly, the Motions
to be Relieved as Counsel as to Defendants Hao Luo and Jia Qi Wang are GRANTED.
