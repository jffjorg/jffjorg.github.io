The Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff
worked as the Chief Marketing Officer of SHH. Defendant Epstein served as the

and SHH. Plaintiff alleges that during his employment with Defendants, Defendants
failed to fully or accurately pay Plaintiff the entirety of his earned salary
and commissions, failed to provide Plaintiff accurate itemized wage statements,
and failed to reimburse Plaintiff for necessary business expenses he incurred. Plaintiff
resigned on or about June 30, 2023 as a result of Defendants’ failure to pay
