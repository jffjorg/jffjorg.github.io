 Case Number:  24STLC03121    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  76 The hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint is CONTINUED to January 21,
2024 at 8:30 a.m. Plaintiff served this motion upon Defendant in pro per by electronic
service only. “Unrepresented
persons are exempt from any mandatory electronic filing imposed pursuant to
this subdivision.” (Civ.
Proc. Code § 1010.6(f)(2).)
 
Plaintiff is to serve Defendant in pro per by appropriate
means such as mail or personal service.
 
On the other hand, Defendant must retain counsel, as an
entity may not function as a self-represented litigant, as EMC Development Solutions
appears to be doing here (unless this is a fictitious business name used by Erick Chung, who signed its case management statement [1]).
An order to show cause re: retention of counsel is also set for January 21,
2024 at 8:30 a.m. EMC Development Solutions is to retain counsel by that date,
or show cause why EMC may represent itself.
