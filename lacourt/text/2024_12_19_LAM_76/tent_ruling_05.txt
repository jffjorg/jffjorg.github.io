The designation of "DBA" or
"doing business as" simply indicates Pinkerton's, Inc., operates
under a fictitious business name. (See Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17900 et seq.
[regulating fictitious business names].) Use of a fictitious business name does
not create a separate legal entity. As the First District Court of Appeal
recently noted, " '[t]he designation [DBA] means "doing business
as" but is merely descriptive of the person or corporation who does
business under some other name. Doing business under another name does not
create an entity distinct from the person operating the business.' [Citation.]
The business name is a fiction, and so too is any implication that the business
is a legal entity separate from its owner." (Citations omitted.)
