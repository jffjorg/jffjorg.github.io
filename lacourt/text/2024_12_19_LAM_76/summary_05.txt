And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling that the designation of "DBA" or "doing business as" does not create a separate legal entity for Pinkerton's, Inc. The judge cites a recent decision from the First District Court of Appeal, which states that the use of a fictitious business name does not create an entity distinct from the person operating the business. The judge notes that the business name is a fiction and does not imply the existence of a separate legal entity.
