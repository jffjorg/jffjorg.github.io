  Case Number:  24STCP02341    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  76             The petition was originally served
by certified mail with return receipt requested on August 14, 2024. However,
service by mail is insufficient as to a petition which institutes an action,
unless a signed notice of acknowledgment is returned. (Civ. Proc. Code, §
415.30.) There is no indication that occurred.  Thus, the Court on September 23, 2024 continued the hearing to December 19, 2024 so that petitioner would have sufficient time to serve.
            Petitioner in November 2024 effected substituted service of the petition relative to the continued hearing.  Service only became effective on November 29, 2024 (10 days after
mailing—Civ. Proc. Code, § 415.20. This only leaves 14 court days’ notice,
while at least 16 court days plus 5 calendar days (for service by mail, which
is necessary to effectuate substituted service) is required per Civ. Proc.
Code, § 1005.  This is insufficient notice.
            As such, the hearing on the petition
is CONTINUED to February 7, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. Petitioner is to give notice of
the continuance.
