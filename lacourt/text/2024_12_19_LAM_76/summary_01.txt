And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the petition is continued to February 7, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. due to insufficient notice. The petition was originally served by certified mail on August 14, 2024, but service by mail is insufficient for a petition unless a signed notice of acknowledgment is returned, which did not occur. The Court continued the hearing to December 19, 2024 to allow the petitioner sufficient time to serve. The petitioner then effectuated substituted service in November 2024, but this only provided 14 court days' notice, which is insufficient according to California Civil Procedure Code Section 1005.
