And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding the defendant's objection to a deposition notice. The judge finds that there is no indication that the defendant served a valid objection under CCP § 2025.410, which addresses defective notice of deposition. The judge also notes that the type of objections contemplated by CCP § 2025.210 et seq. deal with procedural requirements such as the contents required to be included in a deposition notice and the manner of service upon party deponents. The judge also mentions that the court may make an order to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense, and that this order may include directions such as limiting the scope of the examination or excluding certain matters.
