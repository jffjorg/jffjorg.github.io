And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Madelynn Carranza v. Bell's Lashes, et al. The Court has taken off calendar the hearing on the demurrer filed by Bell's Lashes and Steven Zou to the third cause of action in Lash Stuff LLC's cross-complaint. This decision is based on the Court's finding that Lash Stuff LLC filed a timely amended cross-complaint, which allows the Court to vacate the hearing on the demurrer. The Court notes that the demurrer was filed on June 25, 2024, and that the opposition was due on July 5, 2024, but Lash Stuff LLC had already filed and electronically served its amended cross-complaint before that date. The Court's decision does not prejudice the rights of any party and the Case Management Conference remains scheduled for August 14, 2024.
