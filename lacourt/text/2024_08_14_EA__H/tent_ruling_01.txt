  Case Number:  24PSCV01022    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  H Cross-Defendants Bell’s Lashes’ and Steven Zou’s Demurrer  to Cross-Complaint is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.   Background   Plaintiff Madelynn Carranza (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she sustained  severe burning, swelling, itching, and scarring to her eyebrow area due to the  use of a defective product during a brow lamination procedure. On April 2,  2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Bell’s  Lashes, Steven Doe, Lash Stuff LLC and Does 1-30 for (1) general negligence and  (2) products liability. On May 6, 2024, Lash Stuff LLC filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes  of action against Bell’s Lashes, Steven Does, and Does 1-20 for (1) equitable indemnity;  (2) contribution; (3) express indemnity; and (4) negligence.  On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to Complaint,” correcting  the name of “Steven Doe” to “Steven Zou” (“Zou”).  Bell’s Lashes and Zou filed
a demurrer to the third cause of action in Lash Stuff LLC’s cross-complaint on
June 25, 2024. Because the Court finds that Lash Stuff LLC filed a timely amended
cross-complaint, the Court takes the hearing on the demurrer off calendar.  The Case Management Conference remains
scheduled for August 14, 2024. Discussion  Bell’s Lashes and Zou demur to the third cause of action (i.e., for  Express Indemnity) in Lash Stuff LLC’s cross-complaint, on the basis that it “does  not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civil  Procedure § 430.10, subdivision (e).) The Court takes the demurrer hearing off  calendar based on its conclusion that Lash Stuff LLC filed a timely amended  cross-complaint under Code of Civil Procedure § 472.  Code of Civil Procedure § 472 provides that “[a] party may amend its  pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer,  demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike  is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended  pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to  the demurrer or motion to strike.” Here, the Court observes that while the demurrer was filed (and electronically  served) on June 25, 2024, it should have been electronically served by June 21,  2024, in order to provide the requisite notice under Code of Civil  Procedure § 1005, subdivision (b) and 1010.6, subdivision (a)(2)(B) (i.e., 16 court days (excluding the July 4,  2024 court holiday) plus 2 additional court days’ notice for electronic  service). Had the demurrer been electronically served by June 21, 2025 (based  on the original July 18, 2024 hearing date), the opposition would have been due  on July 5, 2024.  On July 8, 2024, Lash Stuff LLC filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint. On  July 9, 2024, the Court issued a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,”  resetting the July 18, 2024 hearing on the demurrer to August 14, 2024. Based  on the rescheduled hearing, Lash Stuff LLC’s opposition would have been due  August 1, 2024. However, Lash Stuff LLC had already filed and electronically served  its amended cross-complaint before that date—on July 8, 2024. Accordingly, because Lash Stuff LLC filed its First Amended Cross-Complaint  within the time set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 472, the Court vacates  the hearing on the demurrer. The Case Management Conference remains scheduled  for August 14, 2024.
