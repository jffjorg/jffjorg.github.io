  Case Number:  23PSCV01379    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff A.A., a minor by and through his Guardian
Ad Litem, Sherry Gua’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED
without prejudice.
BackgroundIn this dog bite case,
Plaintiff A.A., a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Sherry Gua (“Plaintiff”), alleges that A.A. was bitten by a Labrador Retriever owned by
neighbor Eileen Ortega (“Defendant”). The complaint asserts causes of action
against Defendant and Does 1 through 10 for: (1) negligence; (2) common law
strict liability based on known dangerous propensities; and (3) statutory
strict liability.

Despite being served in June 2023, Defendant has not filed a responsive
pleading or otherwise appeared in this case. On June 25, 2024, the Clerk
entered default against Defendant, and Plaintiff has filed an application for
default judgment against Defendant. A Case Management Conference is set for
August 14, 2024.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.       Plaintiff’s Statement of
Damages (Galindo Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. B) lists $337,500.00 as the total damages
amount, which is itemized as follows: (1) $12,500.00 for past medical expenses; (2)
$25,000.00  for future medical expenses; (3) $250,000.00  for past pain, suffering,
anxiety, disfigurement; and (4) $50,000.00  for future pain, suffering, anxiety and
disfigurement. However, in the instant application, Plaintiff seeks $342,438.00 in total damages, which is comprised of $42,438.00 in special
damages and $300,000.00 in general damages.
“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint, in the statement required by Section
425.11 [i.e., statement of damages], or in the statement provided for by
Section 425.115 [i.e., punitive damages statement] . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
580). 
2.       Absent additional
information or documentation, the Court is not inclined to award anywhere near
$300,000.00 in general damages for pain, suffering, anxiety, and disfigurement ($250,00.00
for past damages and $50,000.00 in future damages).

3.       Plaintiff has failed to
complete that portion of Item 5a in the proposed judgment identifying Defendant.

4.       Plaintiff’s counsel
attests, in the “declaration of nonmilitary status,” that she knows Defendant is not in the U.S. military because “Plaintiff’s
representative has spoken with Defendant and knows she is not in the U.S.
military.” This statement fails to identify how “Plaintiff’s representative”
came to have such knowledge.
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s application without prejudice and directs
Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses the
aforementioned defects.
