And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the demurrer filed by Bell's Lashes and Steven Zou to the third cause of action in Lash Stuff LLC's cross-complaint. The Court finds that Lash Stuff LLC filed a timely amended cross-complaint, therefore, the demurrer hearing is taken off calendar. The Court notes that the demurrer was filed and electronically served on June 25, 2024, but should have been electronically served by June 21, 2024, to provide the requisite notice. Despite this, the amended cross-complaint was filed and electronically served on July 8, 2024, within the time set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 472. As a result, the Court vacates the hearing on the demurrer and the Case Management Conference remains scheduled for August 14, 2024.
