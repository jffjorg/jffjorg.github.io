Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
The court has
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
The court DENIES
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees. 
Background
On April 5, 2019, Plaintiff Connie
M. Aguilar (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Taixian Piao (aka
Ruth Piao); Yu Wang; and Ivy Bridge Institute, a California Corporation and
Does 1 through 50 (collectively “Defendants”) for (1) constructive fraudulent
transfer (CACI 4203 and Civil Code §§ 3439 et seq.); (2) successor liability;
and (3) declaratory relief. 
On December 4, 2020, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Protective Order against Defendants Piao and Wang whereby
Plaintiff sought to secure $850,976.48 by attachment for the underlying debt
Defendants had failed to pay. Given such failure to pay, the Court ordered Defendants
Piao and Wang be enjoined and restrained from transferring, directly or
indirectly, any interest in their two properties located at 4421 Rochelle Pl,
Encino, CA 91316-3940; and 276 Windsor Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90004-3820,
effective October 23, 2020.
On March 16, 2023,
Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), adding the following
claims: (1) actual fraud with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor;
(2) violation of whistleblower protection act; and (3) retaliation in violation
of FEHA. Plaintiff’s FAC also maintained two of her original claims filed in
the original complaint which were for (4) constructive fraudulent transfer; and
(5) declaratory relief. However, Plaintiff dropped her claim for successor
liability. 
The instant case, however,
concerns an underlying case (herein “Underlying” lawsuit) filed on January 22,
2016 in the Los Angeles Superior Court (Case No. BC608030), Connie M.
Aguilar v. Ivy Bridge Group (West Coast). Plaintiff claimed she began
employment with Defendant Ivy Bridge Group (“IBG”) with the job title of
District Consultant, commencing in June of 2013 and terminating in August 2014.
However, IBG failed to pay Plaintiff’s statutory overtime wages and classified
her as an independent contractor, despite Plaintiff not qualifying as one or
being an exempt employee. Accordingly, on February 28, 2018, Plaintiff obtained
a Judgment by Court After Bench Trial on the Underlying lawsuit whereby Plaintiff
was awarded damages for IBG’s failure to pay statutory overtime wages, failure
to provide accurate itemized wage statements, and failure to indemnify
business-related expenses in the amount payable to plaintiff of $36,895.89,
plus interest at 10% from the date of judgment. By March 18, 2019, the amount
due and owing to Plaintiff by IBG had accumulated to $499,346.34, which
included attorneys’ fees, costs of suit, and also interest.
            In Plaintiff’s FAC which is now the
operative complaint, Plaintiff alleges that individual Defendants’ Piao and
Wang have a unity of interest and thus, are the alter egos of Ivy Bridge Group
(“IBG”). Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants Piao and Wang loaded
IBG with liabilities that did not belong to it; diverted IBG revenues to other
entities (including HOMESTAY MATCH DOT COM, INC.); consistently failed to
maintain funds adequate to meet payroll obligations; failed to adequately
capitalize IBG; failed to abide by legal formalities; and utilized IBG as a
mere shell. (FAC ¶ 22.) Furthermore, Plaintiff maintains the foregoing was
confirmed by Judge Stern on October 20, 2020. (FAC, Ex. E.) Plaintiff now claims
that Defendants Piao and Wang closed IBG by burdening it with such liabilities
and redirecting revenues to Homestay Match and did this to make IBG judgment
proof. (FAC, ¶ 24.) Thus, Plaintiff claims that Defendants Piao and Wang
completely controlled, dominated, managed, and operated IBG for their sole and
exclusive benefit and now Defendants Piao and Wang should be jointly and
severally liable for IBG’s current and past actions, accordingly. (FAC, ¶ 34.)
            Despite
the fact that on January 31, 2024, the Court granted the Motion of Defendants
Piao and Wang for Judgment on the Pleadings without leave to amend, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion for Attorneys Fees on April 2, 2024 on the grounds
that Defendants refused to pay the judgment in the Underlying lawsuit until the
foreclosure proceedings against their residences had commenced. Plaintiff
contends that such foreclosure proceedings were only due to Plaintiff’s success
in gaining a permanent protective order during the proceedings in this
case. In effect, Plaintiff contends that Defendants were forced to finally pay
off the judgment in the Underlying case due to prosecuting this instant case. 
            As
such, Plaintiff’s April 2, 2024 Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is based on the
Catalyst Theory, as well as CCP § 1021.5, and Civil Code § 3439.07. 
On May 22, 2024, Defendants Piao
and Yang filed their Opposition, along with a Request for Judicial Notice. 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
her Reply. 
Plaintiff’s Request
Plaintiff
requests the Court,
in its discretion augment Plaintiff’s Counsel’s lodestar of $316,255.00 by
applying a 2.5 multiplier to yield a total fee award in the amount of
$790,637.50. Interest shall accrue at the legal rate of 10% from the date of
entry of this order, and each of the Defendants shall be jointly and severally
liable for the same. 
Plaintiff argues that Counsel’s
hour rate of $950 is consistent with hourly rates for attorneys in Los Angeles
with similar skill and background. In light of numerous factors, including but
not limited to the skill demonstrated by Plaintiff’s Counsel, the results he
obtained, the risk non-payment and the serious delay in payment, Plaintiff
argues the 2.5 multiplier is appropriate. 
Evidentiary Matters
Defendant’s Request for Judicial
Notice
Defendant requests that pursuant
to Evidence Code §§ 451, 452, and/or 453, the Court take Judicial Notice
of Exhibits 1-4:
Exhibit 1 is the
June 27, 2018 Order from Judge Stern setting Mr. Cullen’s reasonable hourly
rate at $440, denying Plaintiff Connie M. Aguilar (“Plaintiff”)’s request for a
multiplier and awarding her with $389,345.00 in attorney’s fees. 
Exhibit 2 is the
fully executed and notarized Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment from
the case Aguilar v. Ivy Bridge Group (West Coast), Inc., Case No. BC608030 that
Plaintiff served on the Defendants on or about January 5, 2022. 
Exhibit 3 is
this Court’s May 20, 2022 Order granting the Defendants’ Motion to Dissolve the
Permanent Protective Order. 
Exhibit 4 is
this Court’s January 31, 2024, Order granting Defendants’ Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings Without Leave to Amend. 
The Court grants
Defendant’s request to judicially notice Exhibits 1-4.
Legal Standard
 
General
Attorneys’ Fees
“As a general
rule, the prevailing party may recover certain statutory costs incurred in the
litigation up to and including entry of judgment. [Citations.] These costs may
include attorney fees, if authorized by contract, statute . . . or law.
[Citation.] . . . attorney fees require a separate noticed motion.
[Citations.]” (Lucky United Props. Inv., Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 125, 137.) This motion may be brought: (1) after judgment or
dismissal, for fees incurred “up to and including the rendition of judgment in
the trial court--including attorney’s fees on an appeal before the rendition of
judgment…”; and (2) on an interim basis, upon remittitur of appeal, of only
fees incurred on appeal. (CRC, Rule 3.1702(b)-(c).)
In determining
what fees are reasonable, California courts apply the “lodestar” approach. (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)
This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “[t]he lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id.) Relevant factors include: “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
CCP Section
1021.5
CCP section 1021.5
(“section 1021.5”) codifies the “private attorney general” exception to the
general rule that each side bears its own fees unless the parties contracted
otherwise.  See CCP §1021.  Section
1021.5 permits a trial court to award fees to a successful party in any action
where it has been established that (1) plaintiff’s action has resulted in the
enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, (2) a
significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on
the general public or a large class of persons, and (3) the necessity and
financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award
appropriate.  Conservatorship of
Whitley, (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206, 1214. 
The burden is on the party requesting section 1021.5 fees to demonstrate
all elements of the statute, including that the litigation costs, transcend his
or her personal interest.  Millview County Water Dist. v. State Water
Resources Control Bd., (“Millview”) (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 759,
769.  The issue is committed to the trial
court’s discretion.  Ibid.
Courts take a “broad, pragmatic view of what
constitutes a ‘successful party’” in order to effectuate the policy underlying
section 1021.5.  Graham
v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.,
(“Graham”) (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565. 
The party seeking attorney fees need not prevail on all of its alleged
claims in order to qualify for an award. 
Harbor v. Deukmejian, (“Harbor”) (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078, 1103; Daniels v. McKinney, (“Daniels”) (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 42,
55.  The party is considered “successful”
under section 1021.5 if the litigation “contributed substantially to remedying
the conditions at which it was directed.” Planned
Parenthood v. Aakhus, (“Aakhus”)
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 162, 174.  In other
words, the “successful” party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds
on “any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the
parties sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles,
(“Maria P.”) (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los
Angeles, (2004) 34 Cal.4th 604,
610.  Prevailing counsel who qualify for
an award under section 1021.5 are entitled to compensation for all hours
reasonably spent.  Serrano v. Unruh,
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 632–33.
Unlike the separate substantial benefit doctrine,
“the ‘significant benefit’ that will justify an attorney fee award need not
represent a ‘tangible’ asset or a ‘concrete’ gain but, in some cases, may be
recognized simply from the effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or
statutory policy.” Woodland Hills
Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council,
(“Woodland Hills”) (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 939. 
“[T]he benefit may be conceptual or doctrinal and need not be actual or
concrete; further, the effectuation of a statutory or constitutional purpose
may be sufficient.”  Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal., (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011.  Moreover, the extent of the public benefit
need not be great to justify an attorney fee award.  See,
e.g., Protect Our Water v. County of Merced, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 488, 496 (significant
public benefit where litigation prompted agency to improve methods of creating
and managing its CEQA records). The trial court determines “the significance of
the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving benefit, from a
realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains
which have resulted in a particular case.” 
Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at
939-40.
The party seeking attorney’s fees must show that
the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff “out of
proportion to his individual stake in the matter.” Woodland
Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941.  Although cases refer to this requirement as
the “financial burden” criterion, nothing in the language of CCP section 1021.5
limits the consideration of the necessity and financial burden clause to solely
financial interests.  Hammond v. Agran,
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 125.  “The
idea is that the litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one's
interests, whether pecuniary or not.”  Id. at
127.  The question is whether advancement
of the public interest was merely coincidental to the attainment of the party’s
personal goals.  Bowman
v. City of Berkeley, (2005)
131 Cal.App.4th 173, 181.  The party
seeking attorney fees bears the burden of establishing that its litigation
costs transcend its personal interests.  Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court, (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 247.  The trial court's application of the
financial burden criterion involves a “realistic and practical comparison of
the litigant's personal interest with the cost of suit.” Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado
County v. Bd. of Supervisors, (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 515.
Discussion
Plaintiff
argues she is entitled to attorneys’ fees for this litigation pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (“CCP”) §
1021.5, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (Civ. Code, § 3439.07), Lab. Code,
§ 226(g), 1194, and 2802, and/or under the Catalyst Theory as a Private
Attorney General.
Catalyst Theory, CCP § 1021.5
Plaintiff argues that even
though this Court recently granted Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings, since Plaintiff is no longer a judgment creditor and those claims
have been rendered moot, that is a separate matter from whether Plaintiff
should be considered the prevailing party in this action.[1]
(Motion for Attorneys’ Fees (“Mot. Atty Fees”), pg. 2.) Plaintiff contends that
on that point, California law is clear, and this Court’s ruling on the motion
for judgment on the pleadings is in accord. “As Plaintiff indicates, she is the
prevailing party as to these claims because Defendants satisfied the judgment.
(See Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 572
[‘When a creditor sues a debtor to collect a debt, and the debtor pays the debt
before a judgment is entered against it, the creditor has been a “successful
party” by any conventional understanding of that term.’”].) (January 31, 2024,
Order [in this case Granting Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings]
at 6-7; Mot. Atty Fees pg. 2.) Plaintiff argues that under California Supreme
Court precedent, Plaintiff is the prevailing party here and asserts that in Graham,
the court set forth the following:
[A]
plaintiff seeking attorney fees under a catalyst theory must first reasonably
attempt to settle the matter short of litigation. (See Grimsley v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 960,
966–967, 213 Cal.Rptr. 108.) We believe this requirement is fully consistent
with the basic objectives behind section 1021.5 and with one of its explicit
requirements—the “necessity ... of private enforcement” of the public interest.
Awarding attorney fees for litigation when those rights could have been
vindicated by reasonable efforts short of litigation does not advance that
objective and encourages lawsuits that are more opportunistic than
authentically for the public good. (Graham, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 576.)
 
Plaintiff argues that she
made the prelitigation demands in accordance with Graham because she
verbally requested Defendants pay her judgment after it became clear to her
that Defendants were making no arrangements to do so. (Mot. Atty Fees, pg. 3.)
Plaintiff also reduced such requests to writings, including in her May 31, 2018
email to Roger Hsu and a December 19, 2018 email to Roger Hsu. (See Cullen
Decl. at ¶ 16 and Ex. A and B.)
Secondly, Plaintiff
argues she prevailed because the Catalyst Theory requires the Plaintiff to be
the successful party and makes clear that such success does not bear on the
ultimate manner of a case’s resolution:
In
determining whether a plaintiff is a successful party for purposes of section
1021.5, ‘[t]he critical fact is the impact of the action, not the manner of its
resolution.’ (Folsom [v. Butte County Assn. of Governments (1982)] 32 Cal.3d at [668], 685
[186 Cal.Rptr. 589, 652 P.2d 437] (Folsom).) [¶¶] The trial court in its
discretion ‘must realistically assess the litigation and determine, from a
practical perspective, whether or not the action served to vindicate an
important right so as to justify an attorney fee award’ under section 1021.5. (Woodland Hills Residents Assn., supra, 23 Cal.3d at p. 938 [154 Cal.Rptr.
503, 593 P.2d 200].)” (Maria P., supra, 43
Cal.3d at pp. 1290–1291, 240 Cal.Rptr. 872, 743 P.2d 932.) 
Graham, supra,
34 Cal.4th at p. 566.

“When a creditor sues a debtor to
collect a debt, and the debtor pays the debt before a judgment is entered
against it, the creditor has been a ‘successful party’ by any conventional
understanding of that term.” Graham, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 572.
Given the Underlying case was closed upon payment, Plaintiff contends there was
no opportunity to demonstrate that she was a prevailing party here until payment
had actually occurred. (Mot. Atty. Fees, pg. 6.)
Next, Plaintiff argues she
vindicated an important right that justifies the attorney fee award under
section 1021.5. The California Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that prompt
payment of wages is clear California public policy and nonpayment of the same
is not condoned. (Mot. Atty. Fees, pg 4-5.) 
Thus, Plaintiff argues this case represents a matter of public interest.
(Id.)
Here, the Court finds that
although the California Supreme Court finds that prompt payment of wages
promotes California Public Policy, Plaintiff’s payment of previously unpaid
wages does not constitute “a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or
nonpecuniary, that has been conferred on the general public or a large class of
persons.” The Court notes that the argument can be made that any time justice
is administered, the general public benefits. However, in this case, the
benefit conferred—Plaintiff’s payment of earned wages—was a benefit conferred
on Plaintiff as an individual instead of on the general public or a large class
of persons. The law may confer the benefit on the public as the aggregate of
individual claims but in this case, Plaintiff was acting as an individual and
represented only herself. Plaintiff has not provided case law demonstrating
that the legislature intended for 1021.5 to be construed in this way or that
any benefit to the public is merely more then incidental in this case.
Furthermore, the
Court notes that Plaintiff filed an Acknowledgment of
Satisfaction of Judgment on January 10, 2022 in the Underlying case (Case No.
BC608030) which Plaintiff served on Defendants on January 5, 2022. Although
Plaintiff maintains that she could not request attorneys’ fees until such
judgment was satisfied, by such reasoning, Plaintiff had the opportunity to
request fees on that basis over two years ago. 
As
Defendants argue, under CCP § 685.080(a), “[t]he judgment creditor may
claim costs authorized by Section 685.040 by noticed motion. The motion shall
be made before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years
after the costs have been incurred.” (Opposition, pg. 8.)  Thus, if
Plaintiff wishes to argue that pursuant to section 1021.5, she had no
opportunity to demonstrate she was a prevailing party until payment actually
occurred, Plaintiff must also argue why she should be exempt from the provision
of “no later than two years after the costs have been incurred.” Plaintiff did
not file the instant motion prior to the judgment being satisfied in full and
did not file the instant motion when Defendants began to make payments in
October of 2021. As this Court noted on May 20, 2022, “Plaintiff
provides no explanation as to why Plaintiff never sought her attorney's fees
prior to the satisfaction of the judgment.” (Opp., Ex. 3, pg. 6.)  Here, the Court again finds Plaintiff has
failed to provide any explanation as to why Plaintiff never sought her
attorney’s fees prior to the satisfaction of judgment.  Although Plaintiff argues that she seeks fees
pursuant to section 1021.5 and not section 685.080(a), Plaintiff has not
demonstrated the public benefit requirement of section 1021.5. As such,
Plaintiff remains subject to the provisions of section 685.080(a). 
Thus, Plaintiff’s
request for attorneys’ fees is not supported by the catalyst theory, section
1021.5, nor section 685.080(a).
 
Civil Code § 3439.07, Uniform Fraudulent Transfer
Act (“UFTA”)
Plaintiff
next argues that Civ. Code section 3439.07
authorizes equitable relief, which Plaintiff contends, includes attorney fees.
Mot. Atty. Fees, pg. 7.)  Specifically,
Civ. Cod section 3439.07 states that “(a)) In an action for relief against a
transfer or obligation under this chapter, a creditor ... may obtain... (3)
Subject to applicable principles of equity and in accordance with
applicable rules of civil procedure... (C) Any other relief the circumstances
may require.” Civ. Code, § 3439.07 (Italics added).  (Mot. Atty. Fees, pg. 7.)
Additionally, Plaintiff argues
that while Defendants are correct in stating that the UFTA does not specifically
authorize attorneys’ fees, the court in Cardinale did not rule that
the UFTA prohibited granting an attorney fee award as part of the “other
relief” that the Court is specifically authorized to grant a successful
Plaintiff in an UFTA action as a matter of equity. (Mot. Atty. Fees, pg. 8.)
Plaintiff asserts that there is no controlling California case law to the
contrary of which Plaintiff is aware. (Mot. Atty. Fees, pgs. 7-8.) Where the
circumstances warrant, as here, there is no prohibition to awarding attorney’s
fees as part of this other relief.” (Id.) No California case on point
that holds otherwise, and the statute authorizes equitable relief, which can
include attorney’s fees. (Id.) Furthermore, Plaintiff notes that
California case law demonstrates that the concept of “other relief” provided by
Civ. Code, § 3439.07 is large enough to allow issuance of a lis pendens remedy,
even though that specific remedy is not listed in the Remedies of
creditors set forth in Civ. Code, § 3439.07. Kirkeby v. Superior Court (2004)
33 Cal.4th 642. (Id.) Lastly, Plaintiff provides a footnote stating that
as a probate court has the equitable power to charge a beneficiary’s share of a
trust for frivolous litigation against the trust (see e.g., Rudnick v.
Rudnick (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1334), here this Court has the power
in equity to impose attorney's fees against these Defendants, because they
engaged in fraudulent conduct that is just as deserving of opprobrium as is
frivolous litigation. (Id. at pg. 7.)
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s arguments are inapposite because as this
Court provided on May 20, 2022, (in which it granted Defendants’ Motion to
Dissolve the Permanent Protective Order), the general rule under CCP section
1021 is that attorney's fees must [be] provided for by statute or contract. Thus,
here, the absence of a prohibition against attorneys’ fees does not constitute
an express provision for attorneys’ fees. This argument contravenes CCP section
1021. Furthermore, this Court also noted in the May 20, 2022, Order to Dissolve,
that “Plaintiff cites no authority establishing that she would necessarily be
entitled to recover her attorney's fees for her fraudulent conveyance claim.”
(Opp., Ex. 3, pg. 6.) In this case and in addressing the instant motion, the
Court notes again that Plaintiff has not provided authority expressly providing
for attorneys’ fees under such circumstances. Furthermore, the Court finds
Plaintiff’s reference to equitable power in the context of a beneficiary’s
share highly distinguishable from the case at bar and highly inapplicable.
Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is unsupported
for the foregoing reasons.
As such, Plaintiff has
not demonstrated grounds to be awarded attorneys’ fees under any of the
foregoing provisions. Furthermore, given Plaintiff’s judgment was awarded in
the amount of $36,895.89 and Defendants have already paid Plaintiff
$720,485.41, the Court finds Plaintiff has been awarded attorneys’ fees. Although
Plaintiff argues that those attorney’s fees were for the Underlying action,
Plaintiff’s billing records do not differentiate between fees requested for the
Underlying action as opposed to the instant one. For example, there are fees
being requested starting on May 31, 2018, and the instant case was not filed
until April 5, 2019. (Mot. Atty. Fees, Ex. H.) Additionally, Plaintiff was
awarded $389,345.00 in attorneys’ fees for that action. 
For the aforementioned
reasons, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. 
The moving party is to
give notice.
 
It is so ordered.
