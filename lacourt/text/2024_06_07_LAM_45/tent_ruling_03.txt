Legal
Standard
The governing
rule is Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800 which lays out the requirements for
default judgments. In pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use
form CIV-100 and file the following documents with the clerk: (1) Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) Declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) Interest computations
as necessary; (4) A memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; (6) A proposed form of judgment; (7) A dismissal of all parties against
whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary; and (9) A
request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the
parties.
 
Discussion
            On December 26, 2023, default was entered as to Defendants Sunday Media,
Inc., Jae Kwon Kim, and James Yoo. On January 8, 2024, default was entered as
to Defendant Sang Tae Choi. On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default
judgment package to the Court. On May 3, 2024, dismissal was entered as to Does
1 through 20. In their default judgment package, Plaintiff requested an entry
of default judgment against Defendants Sunday Media, Inc., Sang Tae Choi, James
Yoo, and Jae Kwon Kim in the amount of $28,928.91 representing $26,000.00 as
demanded in the Complaint, $2,065.75 in interest, and $863.15 in costs.         On May 20, 2024, the Court denied the
request for default judgment because Plaintiff’s interest calculation was at
10%, which is reserved for actions based on contract. (See Civ. Code §3289.)
This action is non-contractual, and pursuant to Civ. Code §3287, the correct
interest rate is 7%. Upon re-filing a new default judgment package, the new
calculations are provided in a revised Declaration of John Heath. Those new
calculations yield a revised total amount at $28,448.79, with the same
$26,000.00 demanded in the Complaint, and $1,585.64 in interest, and $863.15 in
costs. Plaintiff has adequately remedied the prior defect. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED.     
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
