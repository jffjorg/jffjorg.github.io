Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories-Unlawful Detainer
(Set One)
(3)
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set One)
The Court
considered the moving papers, the opposition papers and the omnibus separate
statements filed by Plaintiff.  The Court
also considered the Joint Statement re: Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further
Responses filed on May 24, 2024, as well as the Amended Joint Statement filed
on May 29, 2024.
 
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to RFPs (Set One), Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories-Unlawful Detainer (Set One)
(Filed on December 6, 2023) is DENIED as to RFP No. 3 and GRANTED as to RFP
Nos. 12 and 14 and UD FROG 72.1 and 72.3. 
These were the only remaining discovery requests in dispute after the
parties’ meet and conferred further in accordance with the Court’s May 9, 2024
order.  Defendant is ordered to serve
further responses within 20 days.  
 
Background
            Plaintiff
leased commercial property to Defendant DZLA, LLC.  Plaintiff served Defendant with three 10-day Notices
to Cure or Quit pursuant to CCP §1161(3) and on 30-day Notice to Cure or Quit for
violations under Lease §13.1(d) and (e). 
Plaintiff served three of the notices on March 17, 2023 in accordance
with CCP §1162, posting them at the property and mailing them to Defendant’s
address for service in the Lease Agreement. 
Plaintiff served the fourth notice on April 26, 2023, personally serving
the occupants at the premises and mailing the notice the Defendants.  Defendant did not cure the defaults set forth
in the four notices within the time to cure. 

 
            On
April 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant action for unlawful detainer.  On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint alleging unlawful detainer pursuant to CCP
§1161(3).  
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories-Unlawful
Detainer (Set One), the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories-General (Set One) and the Motion to Compel Further Responses to
RFPs on December 6, 2023.  Defendant
DZLA, LLC filed an omnibus opposition to these three Motions to Compel Further
Responses on April 24, 2024.  Plaintiff
filed an omnibus separate statement on April 26, 2024.  
 
            The
three motions to compel further came before the Court on May 9, 2024 and they
were continued to June 7, 2024, so that parties could meet and confer
further.  A Joint Statement was filed on
May 24, 2024 and an Amended Joint Statement was filed on May 29, 2024.  
 
Legal
Standard
            1.  Form
Interrogatories
            If a timely motion to compel has
been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or
failure to fully answer the interrogatories and RFAs. (Coy v. Sup.Ct.
(Wolcher) (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221; Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct.
(Stendell) (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
 
CCP §2030.300
(a) On receipt
of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
            (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
            (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate.
            (3) An objection to an interrogatory
is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.
(2) In lieu of a
separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court may
allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute.
(c) Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response
to the interrogatories.
(d) The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(e) If a party
then fails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).
 
            2.  Requests
for Production
            The burden is on the moving party to
show both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying
discovery.  (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v.
Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.)  Once good cause is established by the moving
party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure.  (Hartbrodt
v. Burke (1996, 2nd Dist.) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.)
CCP § 2031.310
(a) On receipt
of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
            (1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
            (2) A representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
            (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
(b) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following:
            (1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
            (2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
            (3) In lieu of a separate statement
required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.
(c) Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand.
… (h) Except as
provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff filed separate motions to compel further
responses to (1) RFP Nos. 1-19, (2) Form Interrogatory 17.1 and (3) Unlawful
Detainer Form Interrogatory Nos. 72.1, 72.2, 72.3 and 76.1.  Based on the Amended Joint Statement filed on
May 29, 2024, which Defense counsel allegedly refused to sign, the only
remaining discovery requests at issue are: 
(1) RFP Nos. 3, 12 and 14; and (2) UD FROGs 72.1 and 72.3.  
 
RFP No. 3—DENY.  RFP No. 3 seeks
production of all documents “listed” in Defendant’s interrogatory responses.
However, as conceded by Plaintiff in his Omnibus Separate Statement in support
of these motions, Defendant did not list any documents in response to interrogatories.  Defendant instead referenced documents
pursuant to CCP §2030.230.  (Amended
Joint Statement, p. 3.)  Defendant’s
response that no such documents exist complies with the requirements of CCP §§2031.210
and 2031.230.  The motion to compel
further responses is therefore denied.
 
RFP No. 12—GRANT.  Plaintiff’s UD
action is based on part on Defendant’s alleged unapproved plans for Tenant
Improvements, plus a false statement on the plans.  The request seeks inspection reports from the
City of Los Angeles, any contractor or anyone else who has inspected the
premises.  Defendant’s objection based on
overbreadth is meritorious.  Inspection
reports prepared by the City and contractors are relevant.  However, the inclusion of inspection reports
prepared by “anyone else” is overbroad. 
Defendant is ordered to produce responsive documents limited to
inspection reports by City of Los Angeles or contractors.  
 
RFP No. 14—GRANT as to January 2022 through the present.  Plaintiff seeks any and all correspondence
referring or relating to David H. Kim, Sandy Kim and/or the Lease.  Defendant argues the RFP is neither limited
in time nor by subject matter.  The Court
agrees that the failure to specify a time frame or a specific subject matter to
which such correspondence relates renders the RFP overbroad and improper.  As such, the motion is granted as to RFP No.
14 but responsive documents shall be limited to January 2022 through the
present, which amounts to a little over two years.  This is a reasonable limitation.  The failure to limit by subject matter is
permissible given the very short time frame of the parties’ landlord-tenant
relationship, the very narrow scope of their relationship (landlord-tenant) and
the broad scope of discovery as defined under CCP §2017.010.  
  
UD FROG 72.1—GRANT.  Defendant
objects to this FROG on grounds that it refers to “the NOTICE TO QUIT,” but Plaintiff
allegedly served four Notices to Quit and did not define “Notice” to refer to
any particular one of the four. 
Defendant argues Plaintiff should be required to serve separate
interrogatories as to each of the four Notices. 
The Court disagrees.  Meet and
confer attempts are intended to resolve any confusion over what “NOTICE to
QUIT” refers to.  Defendant is ordered to
respond to Form Rog 72.1 as to each of the Notices alleged served on it in
connection with this UD action.
 
UD FROG 72.3—GRANT.  Form Rog 72.3
is a supplemental interrogatory to Form Rog 72.1.  Defendant is ordered to provide further
responses to UD FROG 72.3 as to each of the Notices allegedly served on it in
connection with this UD action.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to RFPs (Set One), Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories-Unlawful Detainer (Set One)
(Filed on December 6, 2023) is DENIED as to RFP No. 3 and GRANTED as to RFP
Nos. 12 and 14 and UD FROG 72.1 and 72.3. 
Defendant is ordered to serve further responses within 20 days.  
 
            It
is so ordered.
