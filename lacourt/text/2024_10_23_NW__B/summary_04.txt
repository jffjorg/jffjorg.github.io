And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Carlos Pizza Food Services, Inc. The plaintiff sought damages of $85,989.50 for injuries sustained in an assault by a defendant employee on May 15, 2021. The judge found that the plaintiff's request was deficient due to an unreasonable ratio of general to special damages and a lack of prima facie evidence supporting the amount of damages sought. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had previously filed a deficient request for default judgment, which was denied. As a result, the judge set an order to show cause (OSC) re: Dismissal for failure to timely obtain default judgment and put the plaintiff on notice that further deficient filings risk dismissal.
