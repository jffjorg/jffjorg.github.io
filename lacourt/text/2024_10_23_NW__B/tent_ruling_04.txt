(“Defendant”) pushed Plaintiff, a lawful patron of Defendant, to the ground and punched her in the face, causing Plaintiff injury.On June 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Carlos Pizza Food Services, Inc. (“Defendant”), Marian de Jesus (“de Jesus”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”), alleging six causes of action: (1) assault; (2) battery; (3) premises liability; (4) negligence; (5) negligent supervision; and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress.On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On July 1, 2024, Defendant entered default.On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant request for default judgment against Defendant.LEGAL STANDARDCode of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rulesof Court, rule 3.1800.)ANALYSISPlaintiff seeks monetary damages against Defendant in the amount of $85,989.50, representing $85,000 in general and special damages and $989.50 in costs.Plaintiff’s request is denied for the following deficiencies:1. Plaintiff’s general damages are 7.5x special damages. This ratio is unreasonably high as general damages are usually limited to a maximum of 5x special damages.2. Plaintiff fails to provide prima facie evidence supporting the amount of damages sought. While Plaintiff provides a recommendation for future surgery and ongoing therapy, they fail to provide any estimates of said treatments. (See Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.)Plaintiff’s request for default judgment has now been denied for deficiencies twice. Accordingly, the Court will set an OSC re: Dismissal for failure to timely obtain default judgment. Plaintiff is put on notice that further deficient filings risk dismissal pursuant to Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 583.410 and CRC 3.110(h).Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Defendant Carlos Pizza Food Services, Inc. is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
