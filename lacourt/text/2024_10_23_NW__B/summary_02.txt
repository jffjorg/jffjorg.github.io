And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Food 4 Less's motion for summary judgment. The case involves a plaintiff, Jerry Lee Dorris, who alleges that he sustained serious injuries when he slipped and fell on Food 4 Less's premises on March 9, 2020. Food 4 Less argues that it did not have notice, actual or constructive, of the dangerous condition that caused the plaintiff's injuries and therefore does not owe him a duty as a matter of law.

The judge has ruled that Food 4 Less has met its initial burden by presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden by relying on allegations and speculation rather than specific factual support.

The judge has granted Food 4 Less's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is no triable issue of material fact as to whether Food 4 Less had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. The judge has ordered Food 4 Less to give notice of the ruling.
