PARTY: NoneEXPEDITED PETITION FOR APPROVAL OFMINOR’S COMPROMISE OF A DISPUTED CLAIM(CCP § 372, CRC, rules 7.950, 7.950.5)TENTATIVE RULING:The Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Dale Thomspon is DENIED.ANALYSIS:I. BackgroundOn May 26, 2021, Plaintiff Dale Thompson (“Claimant”) by and through his guardian adlitem Abdul Thompson (“Petitioner”) filed an action for general and motor vehicle negligence against Defendant Alejandro Bernal Benge (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 15. Petitioner was appointed as guardian ad litem for Claimant on November 19, 2021.On March 21, 2023, Petitioner filed a Notice of Settlement.On June 5, 2024, the matter was assigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East. Petitioner was ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of this notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this notice. The Court notes that Petitioner has failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.On June 5, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Expedited Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of Claimant.II. Legal StandardCourt approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] Nor is the settlement binding [on theminor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (CCP § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code § 3500.Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; CRC Rule 7.950.) (Italics added.)Under CRC Rule 7.950.5, an expedited petition for minor’s compromise without a scheduled hearing is permitted as long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain additional conditions.III. Discussion & ConclusionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive$4,000. $1,000 in attorney’s fees will be deducted from Claimant’s settlement amount. (MC-350EX Item 17c.)The fee agreement between Petitioner and Petitioner’s counsel is reasonable as it represents a 25% contingency fee of the proposed $4,000 settlement. (MC-350EX Attachment 14a.) However, Petitioner does not satisfy CRC 7.950.5 because they fail to disclose information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise. Notably, Petitioner and Alaysha Thompson are to receive $13,000 and $5,000, respectively. Petitioner provides no declaration or other admissible evidence pertaining to the reasonableness of Claimant’s settlement amount in relation to theirs.Accordingly, the Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Abdul Thompson is DENIED and this hearing is continued to [date].Petitioner is ordered to give notice.
