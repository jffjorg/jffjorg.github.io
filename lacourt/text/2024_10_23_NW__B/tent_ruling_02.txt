B DATE: OCTOBER 23, 2024 TIME: 8:30 A.M. COMPLAINT FILED: FEBRUARY 14, 2022 TRIAL DATE: FEBRUARY 10, 2025I. BACKGROUNDOn February 14, 2022, Plaintiff Jerry Lee Dorris (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Food 4 Less of California, Inc. (“Food 4 Less”), the Kroger Company (“Kroger”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2) premises liability. The complaint arises from a March 9, 2020, incident where Plaintiff allegedly sustained serious injuries when they slipped and fell on an unknown substance while on Defendants’ premises.On June 5, 2024, the matter was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On August 5, 2024, Food 4 Less filed the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.On October 17, 2024, Food 4 Less filed their reply.II. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTFood 4 Less moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint because Defendant alleges they did not have notice, actual or constructive, of the dangerous condition that caused Plaintiff’s injuries. (Notice of Motion, p. 2: 9-12.) Therefore, Food 4 Less argues that they do not owe Plaintiff a duty as a matter of law. (Ibid.)III. LEGAL STANDARDSBurden on Summary Judgment or Summary AdjudicationIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)A moving defendant may satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses toshow that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [it is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) “The defendant must present evidence, typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.)Unless and until a defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.On the other hand, if the defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)IV. DISCUSSIONEvidentiary ObjectionsOn October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed evidentiary objections to various portions of the declaration of Alondra Carcamo (“Carcamo”), the store leader at the time and location of Plaintiff’s alleged injuries.Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections are sustained as to No. 9. No. 9 properly objects to Food 4 Less’s Exh. G, the Sweeps Floor Inspection Report, dated March 9, 2020, which lacks authentication. (Cal. Evid. Code § 1414.)Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections are overruled as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. These objections largely rely on Carcamo’s lack of foundation or personal knowledge. However, as store leader of the location where Plaintiff was injured, and as responding management to Plaintiff’s injuries at the time they occurred, Carcamo demonstrates sufficient foundation and personal knowledge of relevant store policies and procedures.Defendant’s BurdenFood 4 Less meets their initial burden.Food 4 Less moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint because Defendant alleges they did not have notice, actual or constructive, of the dangerous condition that caused Plaintiff’s injuries. (Notice of Motion, p. 2: 9-12.) Therefore, Food 4 Less argues that they do not owe Plaintiff a duty as a matter of law. (Ibid.)The elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence:¿duty, breach, causation, and damages.¿ (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)¿Those who own, possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.¿(Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)¿If a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe for [customers’] use or to give a warning adequate to enable them toavoid the harm.”¿(Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)¿The existence and scope of a property owner’s duty are legal questions for the court.¿(Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th¿ at p. 36.)¿“Because the owner is not the insurer of the visitor’s personal safety . . . the owner’s actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is a key to establishing its liability.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1206.) “[W]here the plaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous condition to prove the owner’s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the owner had [actual or constructive] notice of the defect in sufficient time to correct it.” (Ibid.) To establish liability for negligence, “[t]here must be some evidence . . . to support the conclusion that the condition had existed long enough for the proprietor, in the exercise of reasonable care, to have discovered and remedied it.” (Girvetz v. Boys’ Market (1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 827, 829; Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1206.)Plaintiff alleges that he sustained injuries when he slipped and fell on Defendant’s premises. (Food 4 Less Separate Statement of Facts “F-SSF” Nos. 1-3.) Video surveillance shows that, at approximately 2:58 p.m. on the day of the incident, an unidentified customer drops a grocery item on the ground. (Ibid. at No. 10; Exh. E [video surveillance].) This action resulted in the spilled spaghetti sauce which Plaintiff slipped on. (Ibid. at No. 11; Exh. E.) Approximately five minutes later, at 3:03 p.m., Plaintiff comes into view of the camera and slips on the spilled sauce. (Ibid. at Nos. 12 and 13; Exh. E.) Video surveillance shows that there were no employees at or near the area to observe the creation of the condition which caused Plaintiff’s incident five minutes later. (Ibid. at No. 14; Exh. E.) The video also shows that no employees passed through the area during the interim five minutes. (Ibid. at No. 15; Exh. E.) On the day of the incident, Food 4 Less was not informed by any employee or customer that the subject area neededcleaning or care. (Ibid. at No. 16; Carcamo Decl. ¶ 8.) Food 4 Less only learned of the incident after Carcamo responded to Plaintiff’s incident. (Ibid. at No. 17; Carcamo Decl. ¶ 9.)Furthermore, Food 4 Less provides evidence that the subject aisle was sufficiently inspected and cleared of any debris 45 minutes prior to Plaintiff’s incident. The video evidence shows store employee Antonio Dominguez sweeping the subject aisle at 2:13 p.m. and leaving it clear of any foreign substances. (Carcamo Decl. ¶¶ 6b. and 6c.) Store policy dictates that courtesy clerks complete sweeps of the store every 60 minutes. (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)Based on the foregoing, Food 4 Less provides sufficient evidence demonstrating a lack of actual or constructive notice of the spill which caused Plaintiff to slip. Video surveillance shows that the dangerous condition only existed for five minutes before Plaintiff’s incident. Furthermore, video surveillance shows that no employees were at or near the dangerous condition before Plaintiff slipped.Accordingly, Food 4 Less meets its initial burden. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff.Plaintiff’s BurdenIn opposition, Plaintiff presents three main arguments: (1) Food 4 Less has only provided video from one camera angle, suggesting Food 4 Less is hiding evidence (see Plaintiff’s Response to F-SSF “PR-F-SSF" No. 14); (2) the video shows a person who “appears to be an employee” and who appears to look down the aisle with the spill (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Facts “P-SSF” Nos. 19 and 20); (3) Food 4 Less should have been inspecting the aisles every 10 or 15 minutes; and (4) manipulation of the video cannot be “ruled out.” (P-SSF No. 31.)Plaintiff fails to meet their burden.Plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Consumer Cause, Inc., supra, 91Cal.App.4th at 468.) Here, all four of Plaintiff’s arguments rely on allegations without specific factual support. Plaintiff claims Food 4 Less might have more camera angles of the incident but provides no facts suggesting Food 4 Less’s deliberate efforts to conceal such evidence during discovery. Plaintiff also fails to address the future possibility of obtaining such evidence. There is no evidence suggesting the person who glances down the aisle is a Food 4 Less employee, as Plaintiff claims. Plaintiff’s claim that it’s industry standard to inspect aisles every 10 or 15 minutes is purely conjecture. (See P-SSF Nos. 16 and 17.) Finally, Plaintiff admits that manipulation of the video evidence “cannot be proven.” (P-SSF No. 31.) Therefore, Plaintiff solely opposes this motion with allegations and speculation. “If the plaintiff cannot [set forth specific facts], summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at 467.)V. CONCLUSIONNo triable issue of material fact exists as to whether Food 4 Less had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.Dated: October 22, 2024 __________________________________Hon.
