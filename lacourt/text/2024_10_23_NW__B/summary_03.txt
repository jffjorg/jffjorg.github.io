Here's a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Karen Moskowitz in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department B. The case is about a motion to disqualify counsel, Christopher L. Rudd, who represents both the plaintiff, Noah Cvengros, and the defendant, Sam Tucker. Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, an intervening party, filed the motion, arguing that Rudd's representation creates a nonwaivable conflict of interest. The court grants the motion, citing California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.7(d), which prohibits an attorney from representing adverse parties in the same or separate matters. The court finds that Rudd's representation violates this rule and that Interinsurance has standing to bring the motion. The court also notes that the motion is not untimely and that the grant of the motion is necessary to preserve public trust in the administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.
