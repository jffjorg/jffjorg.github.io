And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Expedited Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Dale Thompson is denied. The Petitioner has failed to provide sufficient information to demonstrate the reasonableness of the compromise, which is a requirement for court approval of a minor's settlement. The Petitioner's fee agreement with their counsel is reasonable, but the Petitioner has not disclosed information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromise. The case is continued to a later date, and the Petitioner is ordered to provide notice.
