And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled that Petitioner Tom Lehman's petition to compel Respondent Medialab.Ai Inc. to arbitrate and pay Petitioner's reasonable attorneys fees and costs is continued to allow Petitioner to file an unredacted billing record for the Court's review. The Court finds that Respondent did commit a material breach of the arbitration agreement by failing to pay arbitration fees within 30 days of receipt of the invoice. However, the Court agrees with Respondent that the fees and costs awarded should only be those incurred as a result of the material breach. The Court notes that Petitioner's heavily redacted billing statement suggests padding, and therefore requires an unredacted version to assess the reasonableness of the hours billed.
