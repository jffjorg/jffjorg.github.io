ROGER

         vs.
 
POLARIS
  INDUSTRIES, INC. 
  


 Case No.: 
  22STCV21371 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  January 16, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel deposition is GRANTED, with Defendant to respond within the
next 10 days by providing three available dates for deposition. Defendant is
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400.00. 
 
            On
6/30/2022, Plaintiff Roger Villalobos (Plaintiff) filed suit against Polaris
Industries, Inc. (Defendant), alleging: (1) breach of express warranty
(Song-Beverly); (2) breach of implied warranty; (3) breach of express warranty
(Commercial Code); (4) violation of the Federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act; and
(5) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200.
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant to produce its Person Most Knowledgeable
(PMK) for deposition and produce documents. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            On 9/9/2022, Plaintiff served
Defendant with a deposition notice for its PMK. On 11/4/2022, Defendant served
objections, indicating that it was unilaterally set and that its counsel and
PMK were unavailable on that date. 
 
Plaintiff contends
that he attempted to meet and confer to find mutually available dates for
deposition, and that “Defendant POLARIS and its counsel have never provided any
reasonable dates of availability to Plaintiff’s counsel despite numerous
attempts to informally resolve this issue.” (Motion, 2: 12-13.) Indeed,
Defendant did not oppose this motion.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel deposition is granted, with Defendant to respond within the
next 10 days by providing three available dates for deposition. Defendant is sanctioned,
jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400. ($350/hr x 4 hr). 
 
It is so ordered.
