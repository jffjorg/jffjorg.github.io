Background
 
This case arises out of an alleged
breach of a written rental agreement. Plaintiff Keith Troy (Plaintiff) filed
suit against Defendant Vietnamese United Buddhist Churches (Defendant) and Does
1 to 50. 
 
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint. On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.
 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC), alleging causes of action for (1) breach
of contract; (2) promissory fraud; (3) private nuisance; (4) illegal entry (Civ
Code, § 1954.); (5) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (Civ. Code, § 1927); (6) retaliatory eviction
(Civ. Code, § 1942.5, subd. (d).); (7) negligence; (8) tenant harassment (Los
Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) Chapter IV, Article 5.3 §§ 45.35, et seq., and
also LAMC Chapter XV, Article 1 § 151.33.); and (9) illegal rent (LAMC Chapter
XV, Article 1, § 151.04, subd. (A).)
 
On October 4, 2024, Defendant demurred
to the SAC. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. On October 30, 2024, Defendant
filed a reply.
 
The Court sustains the demurrer,
with leave to amend.  
 
Meet and Confer 
 
The meet and confer requirement is
met. (See Declaration of Olesya Mikhaylova [Mikhaylova Decl.], ¶¶ 2-3, Exh. A,
Exh. B. at p. 8.)
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading on grounds which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or
a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “A
special demurrer attacks a pleading for uncertainty, while a general demurrer
points out substantive pleading defects such as failure to state a cause of
action or affirmative defenses (e.g., statute of limitations or waiver).” (Ojavan
Investors, Inc. v. California Coastal Comm’n (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 373,
384, fn. 8.)
 
The purpose of a demurrer is to
challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “‘treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law[.]’” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
525.) 
 
Analysis
 
Special Demurrer –
Uncertainty – All causes of action
 
Defendant first argues that all
causes of action are uncertain because the SAC is 
disorganized, incoherent, and unintelligible. A demurrer for
uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the
complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) A demurrer for uncertainty will only be sustained
where the complaint is so poorly pled that a defendant cannot reasonably
determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
 
First Cause of Action for
Breach of Contract
 
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s breach
of contract claim fails to clearly state which agreement is the basis of his
contract claim: the lease agreement, the reduced rent agreement, or the
agreement to evict the tenant Rofick Akbar and Vance Kornegay (Kornegay).
Additionally, the SAC makes contradictory statements regarding rent payments
and credits.
 
To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, a complaint must allege: (1) the contract; (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4)
resulting damages to plaintiff. (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific
Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388.) At issue here is
the existence of a contract between the parties.  


In opposition, Plaintiff asserts
the SAC sufficiently states four breaches of contract for illegal entry into
Plaintiff’s apartment, Defendant canceling the rental agreement, Defendant
refusing Plaintiff’s rental payments, and Defendant’s alleged employee and
property manager, Tho Chau (Chau), threatening to evict Plaintiff.
 
The Court finds breach of contract
claim to be ambiguous and incoherent. Plaintiff alleges he signed a contract on
June 1, 2023 and paid $750.00 in rent and a security deposit on June 1, 2023.
(SAC, ¶¶ 72-73, 82.) The SAC alleges Defendant breached the contract by not
evicting Kornegay by the end of June 2023. (SAC, ¶ 83.) Plaintiff attached a
copy of the June 1, 2023 agreement to the SAC, but it does not reference a
provision in the rental agreement stating Kornegay’s eviction was a provision
of the rental agreement. This calls into question which agreement is the basis
of Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer
to the first cause of action is sustained.
 
Second Cause of Action for
Promissory Fraud 
 
Defendant argues the promissory
fraud claim is uncertain because Plaintiff fails to plead actions that show
inducement. 
 
To state a claim for promissory
fraud, a plaintiff must allege a promise “that the promisor did not intend to
perform at the time the promise was made, that the promise was intended to
deceive and induce reliance, that it did induce reliance, and that this
reliance resulted in damages.” (Fleet v. Bank of America N.A. (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1411.) 
 
Here, the SAC alleges two acts used
to induce Plaintiff to assume rent payments, as of April 1, 2023 and to enter
into a written rental agreement. First, Plaintiff states that Chau promised
Plaintiff that Defendant would promptly evict both Rofick Akbar and Kornegay.
(SAC, ¶ 173(a).) Second, Chau promised to promptly clear out any items
remaining in the front section of the apartment and to clean up the entire
area. (SAC, ¶ 174.) Plaintiff allegedly signed the agreement in reliance on
this promise, and Kornegay remained in the apartment thereafter.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that
other SAC allegations directly conflict with Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant
did not intend to evict Kornegay. For example, the SAC states that on February
22, 2024, Yoland Bowman, a VUBC employee, texted Plaintiff confirming she
served a 60-day eviction notice on Kornegay to vacate the premises and that the
notice did not pertain to Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 29(b)-(c).) Elsewhere in the SAC,
Plaintiff lists the date as February 22, 2023. (SAC, ¶ 321.)
 
The Court finds the SAC does clearly
and unambiguously state a claim for promissory fraud because Plaintiff alleges
several contradictory facts about whether Defendant’s employe fraudulently
induced him to pay rent and enter into the rental agreement.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is sustained.
 
Third Cause of Action for
Private Nuisance 
 
“The essence of a private nuisance
is an interference with the use and enjoyment of land.” (Friends of H Street
v. City of Sacramento (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 152, 160.) Plaintiff must
therefore allege injury specific to the use and enjoyment of his land. (See Monks
v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 263, 302.) 
 
Here, the SAC alleges that because
Defendant failed to evict Kornegay, Plaintiff was subjected to foul orders
permeating from Kornegay’s part of the apartment. (SAC, ¶ 227.) The SAC also
alleges that Plaintiff feared he would be susceptible to severe respiratory
ailments or complications due to the odors. (SAC, ¶ 228.) 
 
The Court finds these statements to
be conclusory, speculative, and vague because the SAC does not sufficiently
allege an injury due to the foul odor. 
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to the third cause of action.
 
Fourth Cause of Action for
Illegal Entry (Civ. Code, § 1954.)
 
To plead an illegal entry claim,
the complaint must include allege that the plaintiff was in peaceful possession
of the property and the defendant entered without plaintiff’s consent using
deceit, force, or threats. (Davies v. Stark (1914) 25 Cal.App. 519,
521.) The complaint must also specify damages sought such as rental value or
loss of property. (Ibid.)
 
The SAC alleges Defendant employee
Chau illegally entered Plaintiff’s apartment on three occasions even though no
exceptional conditions existed to justify the entries. On June 20, 2023, Chau
entered the apartment without Plaintiff’s prior knowledge or consent to show a
monk the extent of the cleanup which would be necessary to fix Plaintiff’s
apartment. (SAC, ¶ 290.) On June 22,[1]
Chau again entered the apartment without prior permission to post the notice of
eviction directly on Kornegay’s room. (SAC, ¶ 293.) On August 3, 2023, Chau
entered the apartment to leave Plaintiff a note stating that Defendant had
canceled Plaintiff’s rental agreement. (SAC, ¶ 298.) On one occasion, when
Plaintiff complained to Chau about the entry, Chau allegedly retorted that if
Plaintiff did not like it “he could move out.” (SAC, ¶ 295.) 
 
The Court finds that the SAC is
vague because it does not allege that Chau used deceit to enter the apartment,
forced his way into the apartment, or threatened Plaintiff when entering the
apartment. If anything, the SAC seems to allege that Chau was attempting to
comply with the alleged agreement to evict Kornegay. Thus, the SAC does not sufficiently
allege a cause of action for illegal entry.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to the fourth cause of action.
 
Fifth Cause of Action for
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Civ. Code, § 1927)
 
To plead a quiet
enjoyment claim, the complaint must allege: (1) a lease agreement between
plaintiff and defendant; (2) absence of language contrary to the implied
covenant that tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession; and (3) an act
or omission of the landlord, or anyone claiming under the landlord, which
substantially interferes with a tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises
for purposes contemplated. (Andrews v.
Mobile Aire Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 588-591; Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 293 [“Breach can take many forms, including actual
or constructive eviction.”].). The complaint must also allege an applicable
remedy: (1) the tenant remained in possession and was damaged; or (2) the tenant
surrendered possession and is relieved of obligation to pay rent. (Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at pp. 588-591.)
 
Here, the SAC alleges Plaintiff and
defendant entered into a month-to-month rental agreement for the apartment on
June 1, 2023, after which Plaintiff retained possession of the apartment. (SAC,
¶ 315.) The SAC also alleges Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment
within that agreement by Chau illegally entering his apartment three times
(SAC, ¶ 319.), failing to evict Kornegay and to prosecute an unlawful detainer
action against Kornegay (SAC, ¶ 320.), and causing Plaintiff to be deprived of
his exclusive use and possession of five out of the eight rooms in the
apartment. (SAC, ¶ 324-325.)
 
The Court finds the SAC’s
allegations contradictory because Plaintiff claims above that Chau entered the
apartment on two occasions to evict Kornegay and assess the damage Defendant
would need to fix in the apartment. Note that these alleged actions stem from acts
Plaintiff alleges induced him to sign the June 1, 2023 rental agreement. (SAC,
¶ 173(a), 174.) Thus, the SAC does not sufficiently state a cause of action for
depriving Plaintiff of the property’s use and enjoyment.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action.
 
Sixth Cause of Action
Retaliatory Eviction (Civ. Code, § 1942.5, subd. (d).)
 
To plead a retaliatory eviction
claim, the complaint must allege: (1) the lessor acts to, or threatens to, bring
an action to evict the tenant; (2) because the tenant exercised a cognizable
right, including (a) complained to an appropriate agency regarding the
tenantability of a dwelling; or (b) exercised any right under Civil Procedure Code
section 1940. (Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane
Associates (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1493; Civ. Code, § 1942.5, subds.
(a), (c); see also Aweeka v. Bonds
(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 278, 281 [noting parties are entitled to seek punitive
damages for retaliatory evictions].)
 
The SAC alleges Defendant
threatened to evict Plaintiff from the premises on five occasions in response
to Plaintiff filing numerous complaints with various government entities,
including the County Health Department. (SAC, ¶ 351.) The SAC does not include
specific dates of the alleged complaints. The SAC alleges Chau told Plaintiff
to move out after learning about the complaints. (SAC, ¶ 351(a)-(c).) This
directly conflicts with Plaintiff’s factual allegations that Defendant employee
Yolanda Bowman texted Plaintiff confirming she served a 60-day eviction notice
on Kornegay to vacate the premises and that the notice did not pertain to
Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 29(b)-(c).)
 
The Court finds the SAC is
ambiguous regarding Plaintiff’s claim of retaliatory evictions because the
SAC’s allegations are contradictory about when and if Defendant attempted to
evict Plaintiff. Thus, the SAC fails to sufficiently allege a cause of action for
retaliatory eviction.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action.
 
 Seventh Cause of Action for Negligence 
 
To plead a negligence claim, the
complaint must allege that: (1) the defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care;
(2) the defendant breached the duty; and (3) the defendant’s breach was the
actual and proximate cause of (4) plaintiff’s damages. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137
Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) “A landlord generally owes a tenant the duty, arising
out of their special relationship, to take reasonable measures to secure areas
under the landlord’s control against foreseeable criminal acts of third
parties.” (Castaneda v. Olsher (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1205, 1213.)
 
The SAC alleges that as Plaintiff’s
landlord, Defendant had a duty to take reasonable measures to eradicate the
noxious fumes of foul stench emanating from Kornegay’s room. (SAC, ¶ 376.)
Plaintiff alleges he complained to Defendant and Defendant’s employees multiple
times but does not state facts alleging an injury or damages. (SAC, ¶ 377(a),
(i).) As mentioned above, the SAC states Plaintiff “fears” that he will suffer
severe respiratory ailment or complications. (SAC, ¶ 377(i).)
 
The Court finds the SAC fails to
sufficiently allege a cause of action negligence. The SAC is speculative and
does not state facts showing Defendant did not act to evict Kornegay from the
premises. The SAC states facts to the contrary regarding Defendant posting
notices of eviction and filing an unlawful retainer action against Kornegay.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s seventh cause of action.
 
Eighth Cause of Action for
Tenant Harassment (Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) Chapter IV, Article 5.3 §§
45.35, et seq., and LAMC Chapter XV, Article 1 § 151.33.)
 
To plead a tenant harassment claim,
the complaint must allege that the “landlord’s knowing and willful course of
conduct directed at a specific tenant or tenants . . . causes detriment and
harm, and that serves no lawful purpose.” (Los Angeles, Ord. No. 187,109,
section 45.33.) Such conduct includes (1) reducing or eliminating housing
services required by a lease; (2) failing to perform and timely complete
necessary repairs and maintenance required by Federal, State, County, or local
housing, health, or safety laws; (3) Abuse of the right of access into a rental
unit as established and limited by California Civil Code Section 1954; (4) threatening
a tenant, by word or gesture, with physical harm; (5) attempting to coerce a
tenant to vacate with offers of payment; and (6) repeated acts or omissions that
substantially interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of
a tenants and that cause, are likely to cause, or are committed with the
objective to cause a tenants “to surrender or waive any rights in relation to
such tenancy.” (Los Angeles, Ord. No. 187,109, section
45.33(1)-(5), (16).)
 
Here, the SAC alleges the same
facts as stated for other causes of actions and cites the alleged laws
supporting the claim. The SAC alleges Defendant, through Chau, illegally
entered Plaintiff’s apartment on three occasions—June 20, 2024, June 22, 2024, and
August 3, 2024. (SAC, ¶ 429.) The SAC also alleges that beginning in August
2023, Defendant misrepresented its reasons for wanting Plaintiff to vacate the
apartment including that Defendant needed to renovate the apartment. (SAC, ¶¶
430-437.) Defendant also refused to accept Plaintiff’s rent payments after
Defendant sent Plaintiff notices to vacate. (SAC, ¶¶ 431-434.) Like the facts
above, these allegations lack specificity regarding how Defendant’s actions
constitute tenant harassment, the allegations are contradictory and conclusory,
and confusing.
 
The Court finds the SAC fails to
sufficiently allege a cause of action for tenant harassment.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action.
 
Ninth Cause of Action for Illegal
Rent (LAMC Chapter XV, Article 1, § 151.04, subd. (A).)
 
To plead a cause of action for
illegal rent, the complaint must plead facts showing that the landlord
demanded, accepted, or retained more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted
pursuant to the Los Angeles Municipal code. (Los Angeles, Ord. No. 174,501,
section 151.04(A).)
 
Here, the SAC alleges Plaintiff was
subjected to two rental increases from April 2023 to August 2023, totaling
$287.50. (SAC, ¶ 60, 61, 71, 457.) (SAC, ¶ 70.) First, the SAC alleges on April
2, 2022, Chau raised the rent from $785.00 to $875.00. (SAC, ¶ 71.) Second, the
SAC alleges that on June 12, 2023, Chau raised the rent to $900.00, per the
June 1, 2023 rental agreement, but only required Plaintiff to pay half the rent
due to Korengay’s continued presence in the apartment. (SAC, ¶¶ 73-74.) The SAC
alleges that after Plaintiff complained to the local housing department, the
housing department informed Defendant the amount of Plaintiff’s monthly rent
must stay the same as the previous tenant. (SAC, ¶ 48.) 
 
The Court finds confusion regarding
the timeline of Plaintiff’s interactions with Chau regarding when Chau raised
the rent. Plaintiff jumps back and forth between April 2022 and April 2023.
Without a clear and unambiguous timeline, the SAC does not sufficiently allege
a cause of action for illegal rent. 
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s ninth cause of action.
 
General Demurrer - Second
Cause of Action for Promissory Fraud 
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s
second cause of action for promissory fraud on the grounds that the SAC to
state a claim. Defendant argues Plaintiff fails to allege facts showing
Defendant intended to deceive Plaintiff. Plaintiff states he “was induced to
and did assume the future rent payments as of April 2023” but does not state
facts showing how he was induced into entering a month-to-month lease. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff states
Defendant failed to comply with the meet and confer requirement and that
Defendant stipulated to waiving his right to demur to the SAC by signing the
stipulation permitting Plaintiff to file his SAC.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that the
stipulation did not waive Defendant’s right to demur to the SAC but extended
the time for Plaintiff to file his SAC and for Defendant to respond to the SAC.
(Supplemental Declaration of Olesya Mikhaylova, ¶ 2, Exh. C, at p. 2.)
Defendant also argues that the SAC’s allegations directly conflict with
Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant did not intend to evict Kornegay. For example,
the SAC states that on February 22, 2024,[2]
Defendant’s employee, Yoland Bowman, texted Plaintiff confirming she served a
60-day eviction notice on Kornegay to vacate the premises and that the notice
did not pertain to Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 29(b)-(c).) 
 
To state a claim for promissory
fraud, a plaintiff must allege a promise “that the promisor did not intend to
perform at the time the promise was made, that the promise was intended to
deceive and induce reliance, that it did induce reliance, and that this
reliance resulted in damages.” (Fleet v. Bank of America N.A. (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1411.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff states the SAC
includes two acts used to induce Plaintiff to assume rent payments, as of April
1, 2023, and to enter into a written rental agreement. First, Plaintiff states
that Tho Chau promised Plaintiff that VUBC would promptly evict both Rofick
Akbar and subtenant Kornegay. (SAC, ¶ 173(a).) Chau also promised to promptly
clear out any items remaining in the front section of the apartment and to
clean up the entire area. (SAC, ¶ 174.) Plaintiff signed the agreement in
reliance on this promise, and Kornegay remained in the apartment thereafter.
Defendant’s alleged subsequent acts, posting the notice of eviction and filing
the unlawful detainer action—directly conflict with the SAC’s claim that
Defendant intended to deceive Plaintiff.
 
Thus, the Court finds the SAC does
not sufficiently state a claim for promissory fraud because Plaintiff alleges
several contradictory facts.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is sustained.
