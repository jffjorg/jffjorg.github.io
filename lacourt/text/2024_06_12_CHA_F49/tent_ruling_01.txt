  Case Number:  23CHCV03446    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  F49       Dept.      F49     Date:      6/12/24     Case      Name: Cyrus Jazaeri v. Michael Rhames, and Does 1-25     Case      No. 23CHCV03446            LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    JUNE 12, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER  RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, REQUEST FOR  SANCTIONS   Los Angeles Superior  Court Case No. 23CHCV03446    Motion  filed: 5/1/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Michael R. Rhames (“Rhames”  or “Defendant”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Cyrus Jazaeri (“Jazaeri”  or “Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court compelling Plaintiff to provide further verified responses,  without objection, to Defendant’s first set of Special Interrogatories, and  imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $685.00 against Plaintiff.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   BACKGROUND   On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed his form Complaint against  Defendant and Does 1 to 20, alleging: (1) breach of contract, and (2) legal  malpractice, to which Defendant subsequently filed his demurrer on January 8,  2024.   On May 1, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel  Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”).   On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Opposition to the  Motion. On the same day, Plaintiff filed his operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”),  rendering Defendant’s demurrer moot. The FAC alleges the following causes of  action: (1) professional negligence, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach of  fiduciary duty, and (4) fraud and deceit.   Subsequently, Defendant filed his Reply to Plaintiff’s  Opposition on June 5, 2024.   ANALYSIS   “On receipt of a response to  interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a  further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following  apply:(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.  (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230  is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.  (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)   A.     Procedural  Requirements   1.      45-Day  Rule   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.300, subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within 45 days following  the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or  by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the propounding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).)   Here, Plaintiff served the initial responses to Defendant’s  Special Interrogatories, Set One, on March 25, 2023. (Niedbalski Decl., ¶ 4.)  This establishes the deadline for Defendant to file a motion to compel further  responses as May 9, 2024. Defendant filed the instant Motion on May 1, 2024,  thus meeting the established deadline.    Therefore, the Court finds the Motion to be timely.   2.      Meet  and Confer   “A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a  meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)   Additionally, Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 sets  forth, “A  meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a  reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue  presented by the motion.”    Here,  Defendant sent Plaintiff a meet and confer letter on February 27, 2024, after  Plaintiff had failed to provide any responses, which were due on February 9,  2024. (Niedbalski Decl., ¶ 4.) Subsequently, Defendant sent Plaintiff another  meet and confer letter on April 2, 2024, addressing issues raised in the  instant Motion concerning Plaintiff’s initial response to the first set of  Special Interrogatories served on March 25, 2024. (Id., ¶ 7.) Despite  these efforts, Plaintiff has not served verified, code-compliant responses as  of the filing of the Motion. (Id., ¶ 8.)   Therefore, the Court determines that the meet and confer  requirements have been satisfied.    3.      Separate  Statement   A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories  must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1345(a)(3).) “A separate statement is a separate document filed and served  with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to  understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at  issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)   Defendant has met the above requirement  by filing a separate statement explaining the interrogatories at issue, Plaintiff’s  responses, and why further responses are necessary.   B.      Motion to  Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories   Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to  provide supplemental code-compliant responses, without objection, to Special  Interrogatories, Nos. 4, 6-12. (See generally Def.’s Separate Statement.)  Defendant claims that Plaintiff’s initial responses were also unverified.  (Mot., at p. 4, Niedbalski Decl., ¶ 6.)   Moreover, Defendant asserts that the  information sought in the Special Interrogatories, Set One concerns Plaintiff’s  contention in the action, arguing that Plaintiff’s two-page form Complaint was  completely devoid of facts. (Mot., at p. 5, Reply, at p. 2.)   In his Opposition, Plaintiff states that  he has filed a FAC along with an email on May 9, 2024, which referenced the  outstanding discovery responses, stating, in part, “In regard to the  outstanding discovery, we apologize for the delay but were only able to find  someone to assist us recently who, at present, is working on the answers and  the further answers which we intend to provide before your first motion on May  30th. After you receive our responses (which will be without objections),  please contact us as to whether or not you intend to proceed on the Motions.”  (Jazaeri Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. “2.”)    In Reply, Defendant maintains that  although Plaintiff’s May 9, 2024, letter indicated that supplemental responses  would be provided before May 30, 2024, no such amended responses have been  received from Plaintiff.    Based on the above records, the Court  finds that Plaintiff agreed to, but has failed to provide, supplemental  responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One.  The Court notes that Plaintiff does not make any substantive argument concerning  the purported deficiency of his initial responses as raised in the Motion.    Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the  instant Motion.    C.     Monetary  Sanctions   Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d)  provides, “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.”   Given that the  Court has granted the Defendant’s Motion under Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.300, subdivision (a), it determines that the mandatory sanction is  applicable in this case.   Utilizing  a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the  Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs  incurred for the instant Motion is $310.00, calculated at $250.00 per hour for  one hour, in addition to a cost of $60 for filing fees.   CONCLUSION   Defendant’s  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.   Plaintiff  is ordered to serve and file verified supplemental responses, without  objection, to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days.   Defendant’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   Plaintiff  is ordered to pay $310.00 to Defendant within 30 days.   Moving  party to give notice.
