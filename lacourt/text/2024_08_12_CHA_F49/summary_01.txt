And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Mark Coyne, Paquita Izabel Engle-Fiallos, and RW Property Services, Inc. The defendants argued that the defect in the concrete driveway, which was 3/4 inch high, was trivial as a matter of law. However, the judge found that reasonable minds could differ on whether the defect was trivial, considering the slope of the driveway, the shadows cast by the nearby tree, and the fact that the plaintiff had never walked on the driveway before the accident. The judge concluded that the plaintiff has satisfied her burden of establishing a prima facie case, demonstrating the existence of a triable material factual issue. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
