And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's application for default judgment against the Defendant, Brian Rivera. The Plaintiff, Oakwood Development LP, is seeking $108.33 in daily rent and $26,873 in attorneys' fees. The Court previously denied the application without prejudice due to the Plaintiff's failure to provide adequate explanation for their claims and because the premises were re-rented in July 2023. The Plaintiff has resubmitted a proposed order with reduced numbers, but the Court still requires a fully filled-out and appropriate proposed order. The Defendant's re-renting of the premises has rendered the Plaintiff's claim for daily rent unclear. The Court intends to deny the application again without prejudice unless the Plaintiff provides a revised proposed order with the reduced numbers.
