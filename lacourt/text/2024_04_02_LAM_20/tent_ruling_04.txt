Plaintiff Oakwood Development LP seeks default judgment against Defendant Brian Rivera.Previously, the Court ruled that “The Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice because:Plaintiff seeks $108.33 in daily rent through December 27, 2023, and the date of entry of judgment, but the premises were apparently re-rented in July 2023 such that it is not apparent why Plaintiff is entitled to such daily rent;Plaintiff requests $26,873 in attorneys’ fees, but the subject lease indicates that in any action to enforce the lease ‘the parties agree that the reasonable attorney's fees to be awarded shall be $500.00 to the prevailing party in any action or proceeding’ ” Plaintiff has resubmitted a proposed order with its old numbers; has provided an inadequate explanation as to the Court’s prior points; and has indicated that the Court can enter reduced numbers if it so chooses. It is counsel’s duty to provide a fully filled-out, appropriate proposed order.  The Application is again denied without prejudice.  Counsel is to provide a proposed order with the reduced numbers it discusses in its current application.   Plaintiff to give notice.
