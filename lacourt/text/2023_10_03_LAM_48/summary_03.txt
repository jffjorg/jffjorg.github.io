Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Jose Luis Nazar's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC) and grants Attorney Thomas M. Johnson, Jr.'s application to appear pro hac vice in the case. The FAC removes several defendants and causes of action, and the Plaintiff's new counsel proposes additional amendments to the remaining causes of action. The Judge finds that there is no showing of actual prejudice from the amendments and grants the motion. The application for admission pro hac vice is granted, and the attorney must pay a $50.00 fee and an annual renewal fee of $500.00.
