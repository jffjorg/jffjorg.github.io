  CASE NO.: 23STCV07794
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 3, 2023



 
Tony
Cara, counsel of record for Plaintiff Theresa Kang, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s motion and declaration state that the
attorney-client relationship has been compromised, Plaintiff is uncooperative regarding
the continuation of her case, and it is extremely difficult for counsel to carry
out representation effectively.  No party
opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been scheduled, and there is
no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Theresa
Kang and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 3rd day of October 2023
