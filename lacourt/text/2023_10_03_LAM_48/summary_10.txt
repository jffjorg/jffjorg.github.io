And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of Tony Cara, counsel for Plaintiff Theresa Kang, to be relieved as counsel. The motion states that the attorney-client relationship has been compromised and Plaintiff is uncooperative, making it difficult for Counsel to carry out representation effectively. Since the motion is unopposed and there is no prejudice to Plaintiff, the Judge grants the motion. The Judge orders that Counsel's relief is effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed order and this order on Theresa Kang and all parties who have appeared.
