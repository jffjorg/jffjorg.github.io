[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO FILE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 3, 2023



 
On
July 13, 2023, Plaintiff Elana Malekan filed a motion for leave to file a third
amended complaint (“TAC”) to add a new cause of action for violation of Penal Code
section 496.  At the original August 15, 2023
hearing on the motion, the Court continued the hearing and ordered Plaintiff’s counsel
to file a supplemental declaration further explaining why the proposed new cause
of action could not be alleged earlier, including (1) the delay in reviewing the
chain of title for the property; (2) why the information from the chain of title
in fact gave rise to the facts supporting the amended allegations, rather than the
new claim being based on previously known facts; and (3) the change in law regarding
Penal Code section 496 as it affects Plaintiff’s proposed new claim.
Plaintiff’s
counsel now explains that “there was really no delay in reviewing the chain of title.
We ordered and received the deeds relating to the subject property; however, the
deeds that were sent to us were incomplete, and it was not until April or May 2023,
when for the first time we realized the mistake by the title company.  We then ordered a complete chain of title report.”  (Azadegan Suppl. Decl. ¶ 5.)  Only then did Plaintiff learn that Defendant Rebeka
Shadpour had transferred the property without consideration to her family members
before selling it to a third party.  (Azadegan
Suppl. Decl. ¶ 5.)  These previously unknown
allegations are the basis for Plaintiff’s belief that Defendant had a coordinated
plan to defraud Plaintiff.  (Azadegan Suppl.
Decl. ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel now cites Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th
333 as the change in law regarding Penal Code section 496 as it affects Plaintiff’s
proposed new claim.  This opinion issued on
July 21, 2022—nearly a year before Plaintiff’s July 13, 2023 motion, and even before
Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint (September 13, 2022) and second amended
complaint (April 20, 2023).
Although
Plaintiff should have been more diligent in seeking amendment, the proposed amendment
allows Plaintiff to recover treble damages and attorney fees and does not substantively
change the allegations and other claims. 
Trial is not until January 8, 2024, and no actual prejudice is shown.
The
motion for leave to file an amended complaint is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the TAC
within five days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
