And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the action pending the resolution of the family law case In re: Marriage of Ozeran and Parsons. The defendant argued that the claims in this action arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events as the Dissolution Action, and therefore sought a stay under the Court's inherent authority, forum non conveniens, and Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10. However, the judge found that the claims in this action do not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events as the Dissolution Action, and therefore declined to issue a stay. The judge noted that the claims in this action are largely based on the premarital conduct of the parties and do not involve the same property or claims as the Dissolution Action. As a result, the Court concludes that a stay of this action would not further judicial economy.
