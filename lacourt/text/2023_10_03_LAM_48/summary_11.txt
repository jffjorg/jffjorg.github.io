And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the action pending the resolution of the family law case In re: Marriage of Ozeran and Parsons. The defendant argued that the claims in this action arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events as the Dissolution Action, and therefore sought a stay under the Court's inherent authority, forum non conveniens, and Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10. However, the judge found that the claims in this action do not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events as the Dissolution Action, and therefore declined to issue a stay. The judge noted that the claims in this action are largely based on the premarital conduct of the parties and do not involve the same property or claims as the Dissolution Action. As a result, the Court concludes that a stay of this action would not further judicial economy.

## English Summary:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion to stay the current legal action. The defendants wanted the case to be paused until a separate family law case (Dissolution Action) involving the same parties was finished. 

The judge found that the two cases are distinct, with different claims and factual issues. The judge also noted that the current case involves claims that are not relevant to the Dissolution Action, such as claims related to premarital promises and investments made before the marriage. 

Therefore, the judge believes that staying this case would not promote efficiency and is denying the motion.
