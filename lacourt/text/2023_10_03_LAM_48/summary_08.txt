Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer and dismissing the case. The plaintiff, K.A., alleged that she was sexually assaulted by Pastor A in Indiana in 1984, and the defendant, Doe 1, is a California corporation that governed the local church. The plaintiff claims that the defendant was negligent and breached its fiduciary duty, and is seeking damages under California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred because Indiana's statutes of limitations have expired. The judge applied the governmental interest analysis to determine which state's laws should apply. The judge found that Indiana's laws should apply because the plaintiff was a resident of Indiana, the abuse occurred in Indiana, and Indiana has a shorter statute of limitations period. The judge also found that California's interest in applying its own laws is relatively weak in this case.

The judge concluded that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and sustained the demurrer. The action is dismissed.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer and dismissing the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff, K.A., filed a complaint against the defendant, Doe 1, alleging childhood sexual assault by Pastor A in Indiana in 1984. The defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the claims are time-barred under Indiana's statutes of limitations.

The Court applied the governmental interest analysis to determine which state's laws should apply. The analysis revealed that Indiana's shorter statutes of limitations for injury to person and childhood sexual abuse would bar the plaintiff's claims, conflicting with California's longer, revived limitations period in section 340.1.

The Court found that California's interest in applying its revival statute is relatively weak in this case, as the plaintiff has no connection to California and the abuse did not occur in California. The Court concluded that Indiana's statutes of limitations must apply, and the plaintiff's claims are time-barred.

The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the action is dismissed.

English text:
The tentative ruling sustains Defendant's demurrer without leave to amend and dismisses the action. The plaintiff, K.A., alleges that she was abducted, assaulted, molested, and raped by Pastor A in Indiana in 1984. She brings claims for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress against DOE 1, the California corporation that governed the local church. However, the court finds that all causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations and that California's revival statute does not apply. Additionally, Indiana has an interest in applying its own statutes of limitations for harms that occurred in Indiana, while California has an interest in applying its revival statute to expand the ability of victims of childhood abuse to sue those responsible for their injuries. The court finds that Indiana's statutes of limitations must apply and that Plaintiff's claims against Defendant are time-barred.
