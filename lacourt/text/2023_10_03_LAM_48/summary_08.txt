Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer and dismissing the case. The plaintiff, K.A., alleged that she was sexually assaulted by Pastor A in Indiana in 1984, and the defendant, Doe 1, is a California corporation that governed the local church. The plaintiff claims that the defendant was negligent and breached its fiduciary duty, and is seeking damages under California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred because Indiana's statutes of limitations have expired. The judge applied the governmental interest analysis to determine which state's laws should apply. The judge found that Indiana's laws should apply because the plaintiff was a resident of Indiana, the abuse occurred in Indiana, and Indiana has a shorter statute of limitations period. The judge also found that California's interest in applying its own laws is relatively weak in this case.

The judge concluded that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and sustained the demurrer. The action is dismissed.
