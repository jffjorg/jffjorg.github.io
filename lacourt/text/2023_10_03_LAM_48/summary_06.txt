  - "The Court will typically consider: (1) the plaintiff's (roughly) approximated total recovery; (2) the settlor's share of liability; (3) the size of the settlement at issue; (4) the distribution of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (5) the usual discount value when plaintiffs settle before trial; the settlor's financial condition and insurance policy limits; and (6) whether there is evidence of 'collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.'"
