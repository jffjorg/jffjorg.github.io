And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which adds a new cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496. The plaintiff's counsel explained that the delay in reviewing the chain of title was due to incomplete deeds and a chain of title report that was not received until April or May 2023. The new allegations are based on previously unknown information and are the basis for the plaintiff's belief that the defendant had a coordinated plan to defraud the plaintiff. The court found that the proposed amendment does not substantially change the allegations and other claims and allows the plaintiff to recover treble damages and attorney fees. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the third amended complaint within five days.
