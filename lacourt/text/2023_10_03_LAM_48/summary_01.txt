And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which adds a new cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496. The plaintiff's counsel had previously filed a motion, but the court continued the hearing and ordered a supplemental declaration to explain the delay in reviewing the chain of title for the property. The plaintiff's counsel explained that the deeds received were incomplete, and it was not until April or May 2023 that the mistake was discovered and a complete chain of title report was ordered. The report revealed that the defendant had transferred the property without consideration to family members before selling it to a third party, which the plaintiff believes is evidence of a coordinated plan to defraud her. The court cites the case of Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333 as a change in law regarding Penal Code section 496. Although the plaintiff should have been more diligent in seeking amendment, the proposed amendment allows for recovery of treble damages and attorney fees and does not substantively change the allegations and other claims. The court grants the motion, and the plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the third amended complaint within five days.
