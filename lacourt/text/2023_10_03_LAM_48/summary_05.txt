On August 22, 2023, Judge Thomas D. Long found a proposed settlement between Plaintiff J.A.M. and Defendants Nant Capital LLC, Nantmedia (LA Times), Atlas Capital Group LLC, and 360 Global Security to be fair and reasonable. However, because the necessary paperwork (Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account) was not filed, the hearing was continued.

A further hearing, an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Deposit Into Blocked Account, is scheduled for December 4, 2023. If proof of funds being placed into the blocked account is filed before December 4th, no appearance will be required at the hearing.
