  CASE NO.: 22STCV09614
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL; GRANTING APPLICATION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 3, 2023



 
Alan
S. Gutman of Gutman Law, counsel of record for Defendant Cinemoi North America LLC,
seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s
declaration states that Defendant has failed and refused to pay any fees or costs
in accordance with the attorney-client agreement, resulting in an irreparable breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship and preventing counsel from effectively continuing
to represent Defendant.  No party opposed
the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.
The
Final Status Conference is scheduled for October 9, 2023, and a Jury Trial is scheduled
for October 23, 2023.  “[A] corporation cannot
represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona or through an officer
or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa
Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th
1094, 1101.)  Therefore, Defendant Cinemoi
North America LLC would typically be severely prejudiced by counsel withdrawing
on the eve of trial.
However,
counsel also filed an unopposed ex parte application to continue the FSC and trial.  The Court finds that there is good cause for a
continuance of these dates.  (See California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3), (c)(7), (d).)  Accordingly, the application to continue trial
is GRANTED.
The
Final Status Conference scheduled for 10/09/2023 at 9:00 AM is advanced to this
date and CONTINUED to __________.  The Jury
Trial (Three-Day Time Estimate) scheduled for 10/23/2023 at 9:00 AM is advanced
to this date and CONTINUED to __________.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Retention of New Counsel by Cinemoi North America LLC is
scheduled for __________.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Cinemoi
North America LLC and all parties who have appeared.
As
a result of the FSC and trial continuances and setting of an OSC, the proposed Form
MC-053 order no longer includes accurate future dates.  Before signing the order, the Court will correct
this information.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
