Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to be relieved as counsel due to the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship caused by the defendant's failure to pay fees or costs. The judge has also granted the defendant's application to continue the trial and final status conference. The trial and final status conference dates have been advanced, and a new date will be set. The judge has ordered that an order to show cause will be scheduled to determine whether the defendant will retain new counsel.
