  CASE NO.: 22STCV20244
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PETITION TO APPROVE
  MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 3, 2023



 
On
August 22, 2023, the Court found that the proposed settlement between Plaintiff
J.A.M. and Defendants Nant Capital LLC, Nantmedia (LA Times), Atlas Capital Group
LLC, and 360 Global Security was fair and reasonable.  However, because no Order to Deposit Funds in
Blocked Account (Form MC-355) was filed, the Court continued the hearing.  Plaintiff’s counsel has now filed the Order.
Accordingly,
the Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise is GRANTED.  The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof
of Deposit Into Blocked Account for December 4, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.  (California Rules of Court, rule 7.953(a).)  If acknowledgement of receipt by the financial
institution is filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 3rd day of October 2023
