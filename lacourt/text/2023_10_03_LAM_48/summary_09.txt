And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Amended Petition in part, ordering the claims against Respondents to arbitration. The judge has also denied the request for nomination of an arbitrator, stating that the parties should attempt to agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator before the court nominates or appoints one. The judge has granted the request for costs in part, awarding $495.00 to Petitioner. The judge has dismissed the action with prejudice.

The dispute arose from joint venture agreements between Petitioner and Respondents, which contain arbitration provisions. Petitioner filed a petition to compel arbitration, and Respondents did not file oppositions. The judge has determined that the dispute is arbitrable and that the parties should attempt to agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator.
