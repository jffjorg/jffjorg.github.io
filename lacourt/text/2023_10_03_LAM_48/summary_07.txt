And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff Jennifer Bornoff's motion to compel supplemental responses to discovery requests, including Requests for Production, Set One and Set Three, and Special Interrogatories, Set One and Set Two. The Court finds that Plaintiff's motion is untimely, as it was filed after the deadline for filing motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has not shown good cause for seeking further production of documents, as the documents requested are largely irrelevant to the claims at issue. Finally, the Court notes that Plaintiff's motion does not comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it does not set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought.
