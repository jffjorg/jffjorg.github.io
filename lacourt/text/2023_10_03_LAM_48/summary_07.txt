The Judge denied Plaintiff Jennifer Bornoff's motion to compel supplemental responses from Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company. The Judge found that Plaintiff's motions were filed after the jurisdictional deadlines for filing such motions. 

While Plaintiff argued that she was engaging in good faith negotiations with Defendant and therefore should be granted equitable tolling, the Judge rejected this argument, stating that ongoing meet-and-confer efforts do not excuse the failure to timely file motions.  The Judge also found that Plaintiff's requests for specific documents lacked sufficient justification.
