(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction …." (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030)
  - "A discovery sanction should not create a 'windfall' for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court's orders and the Civil Discovery Act." (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant sought these sanctions because the plaintiff failed to appear for his deposition, despite a court order requiring him to do so. The judge found that the defendant had not shown a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that would justify the severe sanction of terminating the case. The judge also noted that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendant, which is not a purpose of discovery sanctions. The judge did not grant the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, as it was not included in the notice of motion and motion. The denial of the motion for terminating sanctions is without prejudice to the defendant seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings if it can show a further misuse of the discovery process.
