 Case Number:  22STCV05110    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form Interrogatories
(Set Three)
Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for Admissions (Set Two)
Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
 
Tentative
 
The Court will call this matter and discuss the three
motions with Defendant’s counsel and Plaintiff.
 
The motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
interrogatories is denied as moot.
 
The motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to requests for
admission is denied on the ground that such a motion is not provided for in the
Civil Discovery Act.
 
The motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff is denied
on procedural grounds for failure to comply with statutory requirements.
 
Background
On February 9, 2022, Morry Waksberg (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Canter’s Fairfax (“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 50
asserting a cause of action for premises liability arising out of an alleged
slip and fall on February 16, 2020, 
On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff
substituted in as attorney and has proceeded to represent himself in pro per.
 
On May 1, 2024, this trial in this
matter was continued at the request of Plaintiff. The minute order states that all
deadlines, including discovery deadlines, were reset based on the new trial
date.
 
On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed
these three motions: to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories
(Set Three); to compel Plaintiff to respond to Requests for Admission (Set Two);
and to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. 
 
Plaintiff filed a combined opposition
and supporting declarations on July 18. 
 
No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Interrogatories 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
Requests
for Admission
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion [to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Deposition

“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
Discussion
Interrogatories
 
Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories on February 23, 2024. (Snyder Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant seeks an
order compelling responses to both. 
 
Plaintiff served responses on or
about July 17, 2024.  (Waksberg Decl., ¶ 10
& Exh. MW-B.)
 
The motion to compel initial
responses is therefore denied as moot.  
 
As Plaintiff has not unsuccessfully
opposed the motion, Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.  In addition, and independently, the Court
finds that, in light of Plaintiff’s understanding of the Court’s ruling on May
1, Plaintiff acted with substantial justification.
 
Requests for Admission  
 
The Civil Discovery Act does not
provide for a motion to compel initial responses to requests for
admission.  What the Code authorizes instead
is a motion for an order deeming the responding party to have admitted the
truth of the matters specified in the requests, but Defendant does not seek
this remedy and, in any event, Plaintiff has served responses.
 
The motion to compel initial
responses to the requests for admission is therefore denied.
 
Deposition of Plaintiff
 
Defendant
contends it served Plaintiff with notice of deposition for May 31, 2023 and
November 21, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to appear. (Snyder Decl., ¶¶ 5, 6.) 
 
While Defendant
attests to extensive discussions with Plaintiff’s former counsel regarding
deposition scheduling, there is nothing in the declaration of Defendant’s
counsel indicating that, after the date and time of the deposition, Defendant
contacted Plaintiff’s counsel (or Plaintiff, after the date that he began to
represent himself) to inquire about Plaintiff’s nonappearance at the
deposition.  That is required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)  To obtain a court order compelling a party to
appear for deposition, the moving party must satisfy all statutory
requirements, including those set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, subdivision (b).
 
Accordingly,
the motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is denied without prejudice.
 
The
Court will call this matter to discuss the recollections of Defendant’s counsel
and of Plaintiff regarding the Court’s rulings of May 1, 2024.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motion
to compel responses to Request for Admission (Set Two).
 
The
Court DENIES the motion to compel responses to Form interrogatories (Set Three)
as moot. 
 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff. 
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
