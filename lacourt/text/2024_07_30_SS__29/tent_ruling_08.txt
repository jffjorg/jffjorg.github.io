 Case Number:  22STCV30927    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed by Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC
Demurrer filed by Defendant Schindler Elevator Corporation.
 
Tentative
Both demurrers are sustained with leave to
amend.
Background
On September 21, 2022, Luvleighan
Clark (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”),
County of Los Angeles (“County”), Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Metro”), and Does 1 through 100 asserting causes of action
for (1) Liability for Dangerous Condition of Public Property, pursuant to
government Code section 835 et seq., (2) Vicarious Liability for the
Wrongful Acts or Omissions by Public Entity Employees and/or Retention of Unfit
Employee under Government Code section 815.2; (3) Premises Liability, and (4)
Negligence, all arising out of an alleged trip and fall on on October 20, 2021,
on a sidewalk at or near 660 South Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles.
On December 13, 2022, County was
dismissed. 
After the Court sustained Metro’s
demurrer, with leave to amend, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
on December 20, 2022, asserting the same causes of action against the same
defendants.
Metro filed a motion to strike, and then the Plaintiff
and Metro filed a stipulation, which the Court approved, for Plaintiff to file
a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  Plaintiff
filed the SAC on February 14, 2023, this time asserting only one cause of
action, for Liability
for Dangerous Condition of Public Property, pursuant to government Code section
835 et seq., against the same defendants.
 
On April 6 and 12, 2023, City and Metro filed answers to
the SAC.
 
On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name NREA TRC 700 LLC (“NREA”) as Doe 1. On September 20, 2023,
NREA filed an answer to the SAC.
 
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff amended
the complaint to name Schindler Elevator Corporation (“Schindler”) as Doe 1
(even though Plaintiff had already named a different entity as Doe 1); CBRE as
Doe 2; ABM Engineering, Inc. (“ABM”) as Doe 3; and UG2 LLC as Doe 4.
 
On July 9, 2024, CBRE, Inc.
(erroneously sued as CBRE) (“CBRE”) filed an answer to the SAC and a
cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 10.
 
As it relates to the matters set for
hearing on July 30, ABM and Schindler demurred to the SAC on June 7, 2024.  On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a combined
opposition stating (among other things) that Plaintiff intended to file a Third
Amended Complaint.  (Plaintiff filed a
motion seeking leave to file a Third Amended Complaint on July 24; it is set
for hearing on August 19.)  ABM filed a
reply on July 24.
 
Legal
Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the
“face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that
would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes
material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can be sustained only when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
Meet and Confer Requirement
"Before filing a demurrer
pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
A demurring party must file and
serve, with the demurrer, a declaration that states either that the parties met
and conferred and did not resolve the issue or that “the party who filed the
pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request
of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.”  (Id., subd. (a)(3).)
Here, counsel for the demurring
parties each filed declarations stating that Plaintiff failed to respond to
their meet and confer requests.  (Schrader
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4; Tsair Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.) Accordingly, the demurring parties have
satisfied their obligations under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a).
Discussion
Defendants ABM and Schindler demur to the SAC
on the same ground: the lone cause of action is for a dangerous condition of
public property under Government Code section 835 et seq., but ABM and
Schindler are each private entities and therefore not subject to Government
Code section 835.
Plaintiff filed an opposition stating an
intent to file an amended complaint, without any argument as to the legal
sufficiency of the SAC as against the demurring defendants ABM and Schindler. 
The Court has reviewed the SAC and concludes that
it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as against
ABM and Schindler.  As private entities,
they are not subject to Government Code section 835.  Accordingly, the Court sustains the two
demurrers.
The Court grants Plaintiff leave to
amend.  This case involves a fall on the
steps of the 7th Street/Metro Center subway station.  (SAC, ¶ 9.) 
There is at least a reasonable possibility that, through amendment,
Plaintiff will be able to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against ABM and Schindler – either because they exercised some degree of
maintenance or control of the premises or otherwise.
Conclusion
The Court SUSTAINS ABM’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint.
The Court SUSTAINS
Schindler’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint.
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff leave
to file an amended complaint within 14 days of notice of ruling.
Each moving party is to give
notice.
