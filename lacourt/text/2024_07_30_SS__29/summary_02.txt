And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the City of Los Angeles' motion to continue the trial date. The trial date is continued to December 2024, and the hearing on the City's motion for summary judgment is advanced to November 2024. The judge finds good cause to advance the hearing on the City's motion for summary judgment and to set the date of trial approximately 30 days after the hearing. The judge also notes that the City has the right to have its motion for summary judgment heard, and that the five-year rule under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 is a consideration in determining whether to grant the motion to continue trial.
