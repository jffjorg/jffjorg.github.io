 Case Number:  20STCV43004    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Defendant Memo’s
Scaffolding Norwalk, Inc. 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On November 10, 2020, Plaintiffs Rafael H. Salgado and
William Salgado (“Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against Memo’s Scaffolding
Norwalk, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 30 for Strict Liability and
Negligence / Negligence Per Se arising from a fall on November 19, 2019.
 
Defendant filed an answer to the complaint on September
8, 2021.
 
On January 11, 2023, Plaintiffs amended their complaint
to name Gordon S. Gibson, Inc. dba Gordon Gibson Construction (“Gibson”) as Doe
1. 
 
On May 3, 2023, Gibson filed its answer to the complaint.
 
On June 9, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint
against Gibson.  Gibson answered the
cross-complaint on June 20, 2023.
 
On January 19, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation
continuing trial dates from March to September 2024.
 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff William Salgado dismissed his
claims, with prejudice.  That leaves
Plaintiff Rafael H. Salgado (“Plaintiff”) as the only remaining plaintiff. 
 
On March 12, 2024, the Court granted the motion of
Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved of representing Plaintiff.
 
On May 6, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to
compel and ordered Plaintiff to appear for his deposition on May 24, 2024.  Plaintiff did not appear.  (Danishwar Decl., ¶ 18.)
 
On July 2, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
terminating sanctions.  In the
memorandum, but not in the notice of motion and motion, Defendant also requests
monetary sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a party fails to obey an order compelling the party to appear
for deposition, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against that party deponent ….  In lieu
of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (h).)
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendant
seeks terminating sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s
May 6, 2024 order requiring him to appear for his deposition. 
For terminating sanctions, a party must generally
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendants have not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Accordingly, the request for a terminating
sanction is denied. 
In its memorandum, Defendant requests
monetary sanctions.  That request,
however, does not appear in the notice of motion and motion.  Accordingly, the request for a monetary
sanction is denied. 
The
denial as to a terminating sanction is without prejudice to Defendant seeking
other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the
proceedings, based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process.
 
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for sanctions. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
