And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion was filed by the defendants, Venco Power Sweeping, Inc. and Menahem Roberto Solares, on June 14, 2024. The judge has determined that the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40(c)(1) have not been met, as proof of service shows service on the parties but not on the State Bar of California. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to serve the State Bar of California with the application and notice of hearing before the hearing can proceed.
