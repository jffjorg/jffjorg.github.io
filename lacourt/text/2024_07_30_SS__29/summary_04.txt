And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial filed by the defendant, Renaissance Hotel Management Company, LLC. The defendant discovered a conflict with its previous counsel in February 2024, but did not retain new counsel until late May 2024. The judge is concerned that the defendant has not acted with appropriate diligence and is seeking to understand why the defendant waited so long to retain new counsel. The judge is also concerned about the delay in scheduling the PMQ depositions of the defendants. The judge will hear from the parties on the following issues: why did it take the defendant so long to retain new counsel? Why has the defendant not offered dates for its PMQ deposition? Why has Sunstone not yet substituted in new counsel? The judge will also consider the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance. The judge will hear from counsel and will make a decision based on the evidence presented.
