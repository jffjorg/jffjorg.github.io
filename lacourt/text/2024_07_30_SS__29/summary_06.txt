English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motions to compel the Plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatories (Set Three) as moot, as the Plaintiff has already served responses. The motion to compel responses to Requests for Admission (Set Two) is denied as the Civil Discovery Act does not provide for a motion to compel initial responses to requests for admission. The motion to compel the deposition of the Plaintiff is denied without prejudice, as the Defendant failed to contact the Plaintiff or his counsel to inquire about the nonappearance at the deposition, as required by statute. The Court will call the matter to discuss the recollections of the parties regarding the Court's previous rulings.
