Summary:

The Court grants City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment, finding that the sidewalk defect was a trivial defect as a matter of law. The Court concludes that the defect was one and three eighths of an inch high, and that there was no evidence of any obstruction of the defect, no evidence of prior accidents at the site of the defect, and that the accident occurred during daylight hours. The Court finds that City of Los Angeles has met its initial burden of showing that the element of the existence of a dangerous condition in Plaintiff's claim under Government Code section 835 "cannot be established," and that Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motion.
