And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling to sustain the demurrers filed by Defendants ABM Industry Groups, LLC and Schindler Elevator Corporation to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff had alleged a cause of action for liability for a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835 et seq., but the Judge ruled that ABM and Schindler, as private entities, are not subject to this section and therefore cannot be liable. The Judge granted the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint within 14 days of the ruling. The Plaintiff had indicated an intention to file a Third Amended Complaint, and the Judge noted that there is a reasonable possibility that, through amendment, the Plaintiff may be able to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against ABM and Schindler.
