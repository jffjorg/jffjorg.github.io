 Hearing Date:  March 4, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. Plaintiff’s motion is
GRANTED as to $146.45 in “Other” costs, but is DENIED in all other
respects.    
 
On July 30,
2018, Plaintiff Farbod Melamed (Plaintiff) filed suit against Parallax Health
Sciences, Inc., Edward W. Withrow III, Calli Bucci, and Shala Melamed
(collectively, Defendants). On November 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint (FAC) against Defendants, alleging: (1) failure to pay wages;
(2) failure to indemnify; (3) wrongful termination; (4) retaliation—Government
Code 12940, subdivision (h); (5) retaliation—Labor Code section 6310; (6)
retaliation—Labor Code section 1102.5; (7) fraud; (8) failure to produce employee
file; (9) failure to provide wage statements; 
and (10) harassment. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to tax $7,637.28 in Defendant’s costs. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to tax the following costs:
 
-        
$2,061.30 for costs of “Court Reporter
for Hearings”
-        
$864.86 for costs of “Advanced Attorney
Service” 
-        
$437.25 for costs of “Copies of Trial
Exhibits”
-        
$146.45 for costs of “Other”
-        
$1, 170.0 for costs of
“CourtCall/Remote Appearance” 
-        
$1,039.30 for costs of process on
counsel
-        
$50.00 for service of process on Ferring
Research Institute
-        
$1,820.12 for non-itemized electronic
filing or service 
 
As for the
first challenged cost, Court reporter fees as established by statute are
expressly recoverable costs. (Code Civ. 4 Proc. § 1033.5(a)(l1).) Defendant’s
opposition sets forth a table showing the individual fees that total $2,061.30.
Accordingly, the Court finds these costs were reasonably and actually incurred.
 
As for the
second challenged cost, it is well settled messenger services are properly
awarded in the discretion of the court. (Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007)
149 10 Cal.App.4th 836, 858.) Here, Defendant’s counsel set forth an
itemization that shows that these services were reasonably incurred to provide
courtesy copies as required by this Department. 
Accordingly, the Court finds these costs were reasonably and actually
incurred.
 
As for the
third challenged cost, trial exhibits are recoverable under CCP section
1033.5(c). Defendant set forth evidence showing the itemized fees that totally
the $437.25 in costs. Accordingly, the Court finds these costs were reasonably
and actually incurred.
 
As for the
fourth challenged cost, Defendant concedes that she is not able to prove these
costs at this time. Accordingly, the Court strikes $146.45 for “Other” costs. 
 
As for the
fifth challenged cost, Court Call and remote appearance fees are discretionary.
Notably, the Court awarded Plaintiff costs related to Court Call and remote
appearances. The Court agrees that it was reasonable and necessary for Defendant
to have her San-Diego based attorney attend as many remote hearings as he
could. Accordingly, the Court finds these costs were reasonably and actually
incurred. Accordingly, the Court finds these costs were reasonably and actually
incurred. 
 
As for the sixth
challenged cost, Defendant submitted evidence to corroborate the service of
process fee on Ferring Research Institute. Accordingly, the Court finds this
cost was reasonably and actually incurred.
 
As for the
sixth challenged cost, Defendant set an itemized electronic filing/service
list, and has shown that each cost was actually incurred.  Accordingly, the Court finds this cost was
reasonably and actually incurred.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is granted in part, denied in part. Plaintiff’s
motion is granted as to $146.45 in “Other” costs, but is denied in all other
respects.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
