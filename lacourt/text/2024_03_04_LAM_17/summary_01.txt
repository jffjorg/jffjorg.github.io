English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer, without leave to amend, in an unlawful detainer action brought by Mural Media, LLC 401 K Plan against Linda J. Maultsby and others. The court finds that the plaintiff lacks standing and capacity, and that the three-day notice to quit the property is defective, rendering the court without subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The court also finds that the plaintiff's notice is ambiguous and incomplete in two regards, including the failure to state that it is a Three-Day Notice to Quit and the failure to include the required caption statement in the complaint.
