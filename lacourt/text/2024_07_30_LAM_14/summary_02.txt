And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Plaintiff v. Creative Artists Agency, LLC, David Bugliari, Jon Teiber, Michael Katcher, and DOES 1-10. The Plaintiff alleges that his talent agents worked against his best interests in the compensation negotiations for his appearance on the hit television show 'Empire.' The Court has sustained Creative Artists' demurrer with 15 days leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred and that he failed to plead facts showing he could not have discovered the alleged harm earlier. The Judge has also refused to consider Plaintiff's late-filed opposition, citing the Court's broad discretion to refuse to consider papers filed and served beyond the deadline without a prior court order finding good cause for the late submission.
