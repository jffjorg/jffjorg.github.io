Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Jui Chuan's motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed based on alleged lack of jurisdiction over Chuan. However, the Court finds that service was proper despite an error on the proof of service of summons. The error was that the address listed did not exist, but the Court infers that the papers were served at the correct address because the process server referenced a hospital in the declaration and the address is a medical facility. The Court also finds that there is no evidence that the address is not Chuan's usual place of business.
