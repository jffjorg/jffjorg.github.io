And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses Lakewood Regional Medical Center's motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case. The defendants contend that they complied with the standard of care at all times and that their actions did not cause or contribute to the decedent's death. The hospital also argues that it is not liable for the doctor defendants' negligence because they were not its agents or employees.

The court notes that the standard of care in a medical malpractice action is a matter within the knowledge of experts, and that expert testimony is required to prove a breach of the standard of care. The court also cites several California cases that support the principle that a medical practitioner is not necessarily negligent simply because they choose one medically acceptable method of treatment or diagnosis that turns out to be unsuccessful.

The court finds that the expert declaration of William W. Stringer, M.D. is sufficient to meet the defendants' burden to establish that their care and treatment of the decedent complied with the standard of care and did not cause or contribute to the decedent's death. The court also notes that the declaration of Stephanie Sioson supports the defendants' contention that the doctor defendants were not their agents or employees.

Because the plaintiffs failed to meet the shifted burden to raise a triable issue of material fact, the court grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court orders the defendants to give notice and advises the parties to submit on the tentative or arrange to appear remotely.
