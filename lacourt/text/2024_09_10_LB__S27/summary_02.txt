And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) filed by the Plaintiff. The motion concerns Set Two of RPDs, which the Plaintiff propounded on April 1, 2024. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has a separate motion to compel deposition of PMK scheduled for September 24, 2024.

The Judge continues the hearing on the motion to compel further responses to RPDs to September 24, 2024, to be heard concurrently with the hearing on the motion to compel deposition of PMK. The Judge reminds the parties that they must meet and confer on all outstanding issues with this trial court's prior orders.

If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding issues, they must file a joint statement of items in dispute at least seven court days prior to the continued hearing date. The joint statement must list each discovery item in dispute, the most current response to that item, and each party's statement of why a further response should or should not be ordered.

If the parties are unable to resolve all outstanding issues, the Judge will consider appointing a discovery referee at the September 24, 2024 hearing. The Judge sets an order to show cause (OSC) regarding the appointment of a discovery referee for September 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
