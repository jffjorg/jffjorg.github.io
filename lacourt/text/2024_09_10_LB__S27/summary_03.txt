And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the plaintiffs (Tamika Jones, Debra Danield, Jordan Cofey, and Zarian Jenkins) against the defendants (Equity Residential and Hathaway and Equity Residential Management, LLC). The motions relate to the production of documents and the scheduling of depositions.

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motions to compel the production of responsive documents, ordering the defendants to produce all relevant documents within ten days. The judge has also scheduled second sessions of the depositions to be held at a later date.

The judge has continued the hearing on Jones's motion to quash/for a protective order to 10/08/24. The judge has recommended that the plaintiffs produce a broad range of medical records from five years prior to the onset of symptoms until the present in order to support their claims.

The judge has also advised the parties to meet and confer in good faith to resolve the remaining discovery issues without the need for further litigation. The judge has noted that the parties must discuss alternative sources of proof of lost income, such as bank statements and pay stubs, before the tax return privilege will be overcome.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to facilitate the resolution of the discovery issues and the scheduling of depositions, while also providing guidance on the scope of the plaintiffs' claims and the production of relevant documents.
