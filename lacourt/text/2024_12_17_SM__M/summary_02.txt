And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to comply with the October 17, 2024, Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) order, which required the defendant to turn over the electronic devices of Alec Celestin to a forensic examiner for inspection. The judge found that the parties did not agree to turn over the devices, but instead agreed to meet and confer to select a forensic examiner to review the devices. The parties did meet and confer, but were unable to come to an agreement on the production of the devices, and the plaintiff did not file a motion to compel. The judge also granted the defendant's motion to seal a portion of its cross-complaint, specifically pages 4:10-16 and Figure 1, to protect the confidentiality of the information contained therein.
