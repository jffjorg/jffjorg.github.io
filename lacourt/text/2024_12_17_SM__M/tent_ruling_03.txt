LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.)

ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant the City of West Hollywood demurs to the third cause
of action for Dangerous Condition of Public Property. Government
Code section 835 provides that “a public entity is liable for injury caused by
a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the
property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that the injury
was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that the dangerous condition
created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred,
and that either: (a) [a] negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee
of the public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous
condition; or (b) [t]he public entity had actual or constructive notice of the
dangerous condition under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury
to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.” (Gov. Code,
§ 835.) Section 830 provides that “‘dangerous condition’ means a condition of
property that creates a substantial . . . risk of injury when such property or
adjacent property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably
foreseeable that it will be used.” (Id., § 830(a).) “[A] claim alleging
a dangerous condition may not rely on generalized allegations [citation] but
must specify in what manner the condition constituted a dangerous condition.” (Brenner
v. City of El Cajon (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 434, 439.)  
 
Under the Government
Claims Act, any party with a claim for money or damages against a public entity
must first file claim directly with that entity; only if that claim is denied
or rejected may the claimant file a lawsuit. (Gov. Code §§ 905, 945.4; City
of Ontario v. Superior Court (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 894.) This provides the
public entity with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and decide as to
whether it will pay on the claim. (Roberts v. County of Los Angeles
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 474.) Failure to allege facts in the complaint
demonstrating compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims
presentation requirements subjects the complaint to a general demurrer. (State
of Calif. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.)
 
The facts and causes of
action of the complaint must also “fairly reflect” facts of the government
claim. “Section 910 provides that the claim must include a general
description of the injuries and the names of the public employees who caused
them. Furthermore, ‘If a plaintiff relies on more than one theory of recovery
against the [governmental agency], each cause of action must have been
reflected in a timely claim. In addition, the factual circumstances set forth
in the written claim must correspond with the facts alleged in the complaint;
even if the claim were timely, the complaint is vulnerable to a demurrer if it
alleges a factual basis for recovery which is not fairly reflected in the
written claim.” (Fall River Joint Unified Sch. Dist. v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 431, 434.) 
 
The complaint cannot
allege a set of facts “entirely different from those first noticed.” (Id.
at 435-436.) In Fall River, the court refused to excuse these
requirements under the substantial compliance doctrine, where the plaintiff sought
“to impose upon the defendant public entity the obligation to defend a lawsuit
based upon a set of facts entirely different from those first noticed. Such an
obvious subversion of the purposes of the claims act, which is intended to give
the governmental agency an opportunity to investigate and evaluate its
potential liability, is unsupportable. [citations omitted] Here, defendant was
given no warning that it might be sued for its employee's failure to supervise
plaintiff and his fellow students, and had no opportunity to consider the
validity of such a claim until the filing of the amended complaint.
Accordingly, insofar as his third cause of action is concerned, plaintiff did
not even rise to the level of minimal, much less substantial, compliance with
the claim filing prerequisites.” (Ibid.; see Rowan v. City etc. of
San Francisco (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 308 [e.g., substantial compliance met
when claim described place of accident as ‘3350 Scott St.’ instead of
‘3358-3360 Scott St.’ or similar mistakes].) Mere “technical deficiencies” such
as typographical errors do not render the claim defective. (City of San Jose
v. Superior Court (1974) 12 Cal. 3d 447, 456.) Thus, the central question
for determination is whether “there is sufficient information disclosed on the
face of the filed claim to reasonably enable the public entity to make an
adequate investigation of the merits of the claim and to settle it without the
expense of a lawsuit?” (Id.)
 
Here,
the first amended complaint (FAC) alleges that the City is liable for a
dangerous condition of public property, where there was a) no adequate lighting,
b) no publicly maintained security cameras, and c) no police or security patrol
or presence during the incident. On August 3, 2023, Plaintiffs dined at Craig’s
Restaurant located at 8826 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, CA 90069. (FAC ¶¶
15-16.) At about 11:30 p.m., Plaintiffs left the restaurant and waited in the
valet area. (Id.) Three male assailants were waiting near the valet area. (¶¶ 16-17.)
Two assailants attacked Plaintiffs, stole a necklace and Rolex watch, and held guns
to Plaintiffs. (Id.) The restaurant security guard was distracted by other
patrons and made no effort to intervene. (¶18.) Around that time, there had
been a number of violent armed robberies in West Hollywood within a few miles
of Craig’s restaurant. (¶ 19.) Defendants had no other security personnel
inside or around Craig’s. (¶ 21.) Plaintiffs were outside Criag’s at the valet
and there was no law enforcement in sight. (¶22.)
Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs and also failed to warn Plaintiffs of
harm. (¶ 23.) The City allegedly owned and/or
controlled the property where the subject incident occurred and/or were
responsible for providing law enforcement for this area. (¶ 48.) These
conditions created a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm of a mugging, such as
the subject incident. (¶ 50.) 
The
City cites Plaintiffs' pre-litigation claims for damages. (RJN Exs. E, G.) The
City notes that the FAC does not reflect any theory of liability claimed within
the claims for damages. The judicially
noticeable claims stated that on August 3, 2023, claimants were outside of
Craig’s Restaurant where they were held up at gun point during an armed robbery
and assaulted/battered. As for why the City was responsible, Plaintiffs provided
that the robbery/assault/battery incident “occurred in the City.” This
statement would not put a reasonable public entity on notice to make an adequate
investigation of the merits of the claim and to settle it without the expense
of a lawsuit. The City would not be liable for an assault by a third party
simply because the assault occurred “within” the City. Moreover,
the City would have no general duty to provide
police or lighting absent further facts. (Gov. Code § 845; Summerfield v.
City of Inglewood (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 983, 998; Mixon v. State (2012)
207 Cal.App.4th 124, 135.) The claims also do not substantially comply as the claims do not reflect the only viable basis for liability here—the
City’s alleged ownership/control over the Property or their alleged
failure to maintain the property’s lighting, security
cameras, and police/security presence. The government claims put forth no information
on such facts or theories regarding control or any such “dangerous condition” of public property. 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
The unopposed motion to strike punitive damages is MOOT.
Alternatively, it is GRANTED without leave. Punitive damages cannot be
recovered, as a matter of law, against a public entity. (Gov. Code §§ 818, 825(a).)
