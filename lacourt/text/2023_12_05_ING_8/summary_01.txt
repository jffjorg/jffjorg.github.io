And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering four motions to compel further responses from the defendant to discovery requests. The defendant has failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff has sent letters to the defendant to discuss the insufficiencies in the responses. The judge notes that the defendant appears to be representing himself in pro per and has successfully appeared at previous minute orders.

The judge orders the parties to meaningfully meet and confer about the allegedly insufficient responses by January 9, 2024. The plaintiff is required to provide a status update as to the result of the meet and confer efforts by January 23, 2024. The judge also orders the parties to provide additional guidance on discovery proceedings in California, including the importance of providing timely and complete responses to discovery requests.

The judge continues the hearing to January 29, 2024, at 8:30 am, and will address the issue of sanctions at that time. The plaintiff is ordered to give written notice of this ruling.
