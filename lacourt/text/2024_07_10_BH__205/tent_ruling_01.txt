  Case Number:  24SMCV01139    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   JOSEPH ARIEL HAZANI,   Plaintiff, v.  USG CORPORATION,   Defendant.    Case No.:  24SMCV01139     Hearing Date:  July 10, 2024     [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO AMEND    COMPLAINT       This hearing is on Plaintiff Joseph Ariel Hazani’s motion to amend complaint.  The motion is 46 pages long and exceeds the page limit of 15 for an opening memorandum.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113 subd. (d) (“Except in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages.”).)   “A memorandum that exceeds the page limits of these¿rules must be filed and considered in the same manner as a late-filed paper.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113 subd. (g).)  “[A] trial court has broad discretion to accept or reject late-filed papers.”  (Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v. Hazelbaker¿(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262.)  Accordingly, a trial court also has discretion to reject oversize briefs.  The Court exercises its discretion to disregard Plaintiff’s motion to amend. Even if Plaintiff’s motion were not oversize, it is moot.  The Court sustained Defendant USG Corporation’s demurrer to the complaint and gave Plaintiff 20 days’ leave to amend.  (June 14, 2024 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, there is no need for a separate motion to amend.   Plaintiff also failed to properly serve Defendant with its motion.  Plaintiff filed his motion on June 18, 2024.  There is no proof of service showing the motion was served.  Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve, the Court cannot properly consider the motion without depriving Defendant of its due process rights.     Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to amend.   IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED:  July 10, 2024   ___________________________ Edward B.
