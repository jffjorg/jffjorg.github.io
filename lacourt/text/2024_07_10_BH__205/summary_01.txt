And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Joseph Ariel Hazani's motion to amend the complaint. The motion, which is 46 pages long, exceeds the page limit of 15 pages and was not properly served on the Defendant. The Court sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the complaint and gave the Plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend. As a result, the Court exercises its discretion to disregard the motion to amend. Additionally, the Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to properly serve the Defendant with the motion, which would deprive the Defendant of its due process rights. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint.
