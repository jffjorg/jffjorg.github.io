 Case Number:  23PSCV02704    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  H Ramirez
v.  American Honda Motor Company,
Case No. 23PSCV02704
ORDER ON MOTION TO COMPEL

Plaintiff Ana Cecilia Lerma Ramirez’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents is DENIED in part (i.e., as to Nos. 9, 23, 24 and 109) and GRANTED in
part (i.e., as to Nos. 27-30,
41, 42, 45, 46, 51-54, 80, 81, 119, 120, 129 and 130, as limited by this order).
 
Background
Plaintiff Ana Cecilia Lerma Ramirez
(“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:

On April 24, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a warranty
contract with American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) regarding a 2021
Honda Civic, VIN No. 2HGFC2F69MH552933 (the “subject vehicle”). The subject
vehicle is equipped with a computerized driver-assisting safety system known as
“Honda Sensing,” which includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure
warnings and steering inputs, and autonomous braking. The Honda Sensing system
suffers from a defect that causes the various subsystems within it to
malfunction dangerously while the vehicles are driven (the “Sensing Defect”).
Defendant knew or should have known about the Sensing Defect before the subject
vehicle was sold and failed to disclose same.
 
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint (the “Operative Complaint” or “FAC”), asserting
causes of action against Defendant and Does 1-10 for:
 
1.       Violation
of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; 
2.       Violation of
Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; 
3.       Violation of
Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; 
4.       Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability; and5.       Fraudulent
Inducement—Concealment.

 
On February
6, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action,
with leave to amend[FN1].

 
The Final
Status Conference is set for May 13, 2025. Trial is set for May 27, 2025.



Legal Standard 
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or that] (3) An objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a).)
The motion must include a meet
and confer declaration which “state[s] facts showing a reasonable and good
faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”
(Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of a separate statement
required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents must “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
If the moving party has shown good cause for the production of documents, the
burden is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)  
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)

 
Discussion 

Plaintiff
moves the Court for an order striking Defendant’s
objections and compelling its further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One (i.e., Nos. 9, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30,
41, 42, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 80, 81, 109, 119, 120, 129, and 130).
Plaintiff’s counsel NaQuia Brown (“Brown”)
represents, and/or the accompanying documents reflect, as follows: 


On
December 20, 2023, Plaintiff propounded the subject discovery on Defendant (Brown
Decl., ¶ 14, Exh. 3); that day, Brown sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant’s
counsel regarding discovery of electronically stored information, creation of a
search protocol and institution of a litigation hold (Id., ¶ 24, Exh. 7.)
After obtaining a couple of extensions, Defendant provided responses on March 4,
2024. (Id., ¶¶ 17-19, Exhs. 4-6.) On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
Hannah C. Theophil (“Theophil”) sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant’s
counsel, along with a copy of a proposed Stipulation and Protective Order
modeled after the Los Angeles Superior Court Protective Order. (Id., ¶¶ 25-26,
Exhs. 8 and 9.) On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Request for Informal
Discovery Conference.” (Id., ¶ 28, Exh. 10.) On or about May 20, 2024,
the parties appeared for an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”), but the judge
continued the hearing to May 28, 2024 and ordered counsel to meet and confer
telephonically in the interim. (Id., ¶ 29.) On May 28, 2024, counsel met
and conferred telephonically, during which time Theophil agreed to limit the
documents sought to only those of the same year, make and model as the subject
vehicle sold in the State of California and the parties agreed to new
definitions for the terms “Sensing Defects” and “Brake Defects.” (Id., ¶
30, Exh. 11.) On May 28, 2024, the Court continued the IDC to May 30, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 31.) During the May 30, 2024, IDC, the Court advised that the instant motion
could be filed. (Id., ¶ 32.) 
Plaintiff
has categorized the requests in issue as follows: (1) Subject Vehicle Discovery
(i.e., No. 9); (2) Internal Knowledge & Investigation Discovery (i.e., Nos.

23,
24, 27-30, 41, 42, 45, 46, and 51-54); (3) Summary Documents and Deposition
Testimony Regarding These Documents (i.e., Nos. 80 and 81); (4) Policies and
Procedures Discovery (i.e., No. 109); (5) Communications with Governmental
Agencies and Suppliers (i.e., Nos. 119 and 120); and (6) Other Documents
Related to the Subject Vehicle’s Defects (i.e., Nos. 129 and 130). The Court
addresses each of these categories in turn. 
 
Subject
Vehicle Discovery (i.e., No. 9) 
No.
9 seeks documents regarding records and data transmitted from the subject
vehicle to Defendant through the following remote monitoring and connected
systems: “a) Vehicle-to-Manufacturer (V2M) communications or its equivalent,
including but not limited to performance data, issue reports, and any other
related data. b) Remote Vehicle Diagnostic and Maintenance records or its
equivalent, including any instances of remote diagnosis or repair. c)
Telematics data, including but not limited to data about the vehicle’s
location, speed, fuel consumption, crash notification events, and remote
lock/unlock operations. d) Connected Car System records, including any data
related to the vehicle’s infotainment system or its equivalent. e) Over-the-Air
(OTA) Systems update history or its equivalent, including details of software
updates, the reasons for those updates, and the results of those updates.” 
The
Court agrees that the request is vague, ambiguous, and overly broad, and seeks irrelevant
information unsupported by a showing of good cause. No further response is
warranted. 
 
Internal
Knowledge & Investigation Discovery (i.e., Nos. 23, 24, 27-30, 41, 42, 45,
46 and 51-54) 
Nos.
23 and 24 seek documents regarding any internal investigation regarding root
cause problems, problem-solving efforts, or efforts to identify any actual or
potential problems, failures, malfunctions, conditions, and/or defects,
regarding the braking system or sensing system[FN2] in Honda
Civic vehicles.[FN3]
Nos.
27 and 28 seek documents concerning field reports, dealer contacts, warranty
claims, customer complaints, claims, and/or reported failures regarding brake defects[FN4] or sensing
defects[FN5] in Honda
Civic vehicles.
Nos.
29 and 30 seek documents regarding the brake defects or sensing defects in Honda
Civic vehicles equipped with the same braking system or sensing system as the subject
vehicle.
Nos.
41 and 42 seek documents to/from Defendant’s agents, representatives,
engineers, employees, or part suppliers, concerning common parts failures for
the braking system or sensing system in Honda Civic vehicles.
Nos.
45 and 46 seek documents from Defendant’s engineers or suppliers with
information relating to suggested repair procedures for commonly observed
problems regarding brake defects or sensing defects in Honda Civic vehicles.
Nos.
51 and 52 seek documents regarding Honda Civic vehicles that were repurchased
or replaced by Defendant and (1) underwent two or more warranty repair
attempts; or (2) were unable to be repaired within 30 days for concerns
regarding the brake defects or sensing defects.
Nos.
53 and 54 seek all vehicle warranty history reports for Honda Civic vehicles that
Defendant repurchased or replaced with two or more warranty repair attempts to
the braking system or sensing system.
At
the outset, the Court agrees that the definitions of “sensing defect(s),” “Honda
sensing system,” “brake defect(s),” and “Honda Civic vehicles” are
impermissibly overbroad. As set forth above, Theophil has since offered to
limit the documents Plaintiff seeks to 2021 Honda Civic vehicles sold in the
State of California, to refine the term “sensing defect(s)” to mean “(1)
malfunctioning warning message(s) to intermittently appear; or (2) vehicles
applying brakes although no obstruction is present,” and to redefine the term “brake
defect(s)” to mean “squealing, grinding noises, and/or vibration when braking.”
(Brown Decl., ¶ 30, Exh. 11.)
The
Court will limit the above definitions to the same conditions, defects, or
nonconformities which Plaintiffs submitted the subject vehicle to Defendant or
Defendant’s authorized facilities for repair on or about April 25, 2022 and on
or about August 29, 2022. (Id., ¶¶ 4-6, Exh. 1.) Additionally, every
category shall be limited to documents pertaining to vehicles of the same year,
make, model, and engine type as Plaintiffs’ vehicle, for vehicles in
California. The Song-Beverly Act and its lemon law provisions limits its
application to goods sold in California and has certain provisions that afford
protections greater than the requirements of the federal Magnuson Moss
Act. (See Civil Code §§ 1792, 1792.1; Atkinson v. Elk Corp of Texas (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 212,
231.) As the statute’s application to lemon law is for vehicles “sold in
this state,” such phrase is interpreted to restricting the scope to goods sold
in California. (California State
Electronic Ass’n v. Zeos Int’l Ltd. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1270,
1277.) 
The
Court agrees that Defendant properly objected to Plaintiff’s “root cause”
discovery (i.e., Nos. 23 and 24) on the basis of relevance. Plaintiff is not
required to show what caused a nonconformity. (See Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1102,
fn. 8 [“Isuzu
also argues it was incumbent on Oregel to prove not only that the car leaked
oil but also to show the cause of the leak, and that he failed to meet this
burden because he produced no expert testimony proving the cause of the leak.
However, the statute requires only that Oregel prove the car did not conform to
the express warranty, and proof that there was a persistent leak that Ron Baker
could not locate or repair suffices. We do not interpret the statute as
depriving a consumer of a remedy if he cannot do what the manufacturer, with
its presumably greater expertise, was incapable of doing, i.e. identify the
source of the leak”].) No further responses are warranted to Nos. 23 and
24.
 
The Court determines Plaintiff has
otherwise established the general relevance of the information sought because
the documents, as limited above, are reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence regarding whether Defendant knew of the
defects at issue, yet failed to repurchase the subject vehicle. In Donlen v. Ford Motor Company (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 138, 143, the appellate court upheld a trial court’s determination
that evidence of “the transmission model Ford installed in plaintiff’s truck
and other vehicles” should not be excluded from trial as prejudicial in a
Song–Beverly Act case brought by a single plaintiff.  (Id.
at 154.) Donlen thus provides a basis
for permitting discovery to extend beyond Plaintiff’s specific vehicle. A
defendant’s knowledge of the defect is relevant to whether Defendant willfully
violated the statute.  (Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc.
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136; Kwan v.
Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186 [“A
decision made without the use of reasonably available information germane to
that decision is not a reasonable, good faith decision.”].)
Defendant
also claims, with respect to Nos. 27-29, 41, 42, 45, 46, and 51-54, that documents
Plaintiff is seeking “may call for information that is confidential,
commercially sensitive, proprietary, and/or trade secret.” Objections based on
confidentiality are not proper grounds for withholding responsive information.
(See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 23 [“We know of no case holding
that this is a proper ground for objection to an otherwise proper
interrogatory. Assuming that the information called for by this interrogatory
is of a confidential nature which defendants do not want to have included in a
public record, they presumably could have applied for a protective order. .
.”].) Defendant, however, has not produced any admissible evidentiary materials
showing that any of the documents contain protectable “confidential, commercially
sensitive, proprietary, and/or trade secret” information; at any rate, the
Court believes that any such concerns may be adequately safeguarded by the
protective order and/or redaction of personally identifiable information. Defendant
claims, with respect to Nos. 27-29, 41, 42, 45, 46, and 51-54, that Plaintiff
seeks information “protected by the right to privacy.” Again, the Court
believes that any such concerns may be adequately safeguarded by the protective
order and/or redaction of personally identifiable information.
Finally, although Defendant objected
on the basis of the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine as
to Nos. 51 and 52, Defendant has not met its burden of justifying this
objection. Any documents withheld from production on this basis must be
accompanied by a privilege log.
The
Court determines that further responses are warranted as to 27-30, 41, 42, 45,
46, and 51-54, as limited.
 
Summary
Documents and Deposition Testimony Regarding These Documents (i.e., Nos. 80 and
81)
Nos.
80 and 81 seek documents regarding software release notes for all software
released for the brake defects or sensing defects in Honda Civic vehicles
equipped with the same braking system or sensing system as the subject vehicle.
The
Court determines that further responses are warranted as to Nos. 80 and 81,
subject to the limitations set forth above.
 
Policies
and Procedures Discovery (i.e., No. 109)
No. 109 seeks the user manual for every
database where any of the following information is stored: warranty records,
customer complaints, field reports, technician line contact, field service
reports, and dealer contacts.
Defendant
properly objected to No. 109 as vague, ambiguous, overly broad, irrelevant, and
seeking “discovery on discovery.” No further response is warranted.
 
Communications
with Governmental Agencies and Suppliers (i.e., Nos. 119 and 120)
Nos.
119 and 120 seek communications with and documents provided to or received from
the supplier of the braking system or sensing system in Honda Civic vehicles regarding
an actual or suspected braking system or sensing system condition, issue,
problem, or defect.
The
Court determines that further responses are warranted as to Nos. 119 and 120,
subject to the limitations set forth above.
 
Other
Documents Related to the Subject Vehicle’s Defects (i.e., Nos. 129 and 130)
Nos.
129 and 130 seek documents concerning performance standards relating to the braking
system or sensing system in Honda Civic vehicles.
 
The
Court determines that further responses are warranted as to Nos. 129 and 130, subject
to the limitations set forth above.
 
Conclusion
The
motion is denied in part (i.e., as to Nos. 9, 23, 24 and 109) and
granted in part (i.e., as to Nos. 27-30, 41, 42, 45, 46, 51-54, 80, 81, 119, 120, 129
and 130, as limited). Defendant is ordered
to produce verified, code-compliant responses within 20 days, subject to the
limitations contained herein.
