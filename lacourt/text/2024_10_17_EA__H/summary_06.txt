And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling defines several key terms related to Honda Civic vehicles and the Honda Sensing System. The terms include "Honda Sensing System", which refers to a suite of safety and driver-assistive technologies, and "Brake Defect(s)" and "Sensing Defect(s)", which refer to defects within the braking system and Honda Sensing System of Honda Civic vehicles, respectively. The court notes that these defects can result in a range of issues, including malfunctioning warning messages, fluctuation in highway speed, and false lane departure alerts.

The court's ruling does not address the existence or nature of these defects, nor does it assign responsibility or provide compensation for damages. Instead, the ruling merely defines the terms and sets the stage for further discussion and argument at the upcoming court hearing.
