v. Zouhair, Case No. 23PSCV02533

ORDER
ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATIONPlaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.BackgroundPlaintiff Orlando Garcia (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:            Plaintiff suffers from cerebral palsy,
has manual dexterity issues, cannot walk, and uses a wheelchair for mobility.
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff went to the Jug & Jigger (the “Store”) located
at 2612 E. Garvey Ave. S. in West Covina, but encountered ADA non-compliant
conditions pertaining to paths of travel, which denied Plaintiff full and equal
access. The Store was and is owned by George Safar Zouhair (“Defendant”). On August 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against Defendant and Does 1-50 for:          1.       Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act,
and          2.       Violation of the California Disabled
Persons Act.On February 6, 2024, Defendant’s default was entered.On February 24, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Does 1-50,
without prejudice.Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for
Default Judgment.
 DiscussionPlaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:1.       Plaintiff
is directed to resubmit his attorney’s fees request in compliance with Local Rule
3.214.

2.       Paragraph
8 of the proposed judgment seeks “injunctive relief, prohibiting Defendant from
violating the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Unruh
Civil Rights Act.” The aforesaid language is overbroad and does not match the
injunctive relief request set forth in Paragraphs 2-4 of the prayer in
Plaintiff’s complaint.  Accordingly, the application is denied
without prejudice, and Plaintiff is directed to submit a revised default
judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned issues.
