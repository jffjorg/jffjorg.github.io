And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge H Garcia in the case of Orlando Garcia v. Zouhair, Case No. 23PSCV02533. The Plaintiff, Orlando Garcia, alleges that he suffered from cerebral palsy, manual dexterity issues, and uses a wheelchair for mobility, and that he was denied full and equal access to the Store, a business owned by the Defendant, George Safar Zouhair, due to ADA non-compliant conditions. The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging causes of action against the Defendant for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act.

The Defendant's default was entered on February 6, 2024, and the Plaintiff has applied for default judgment. However, the Judge has denied the application without prejudice, citing several defects, including a need for the Plaintiff to resubmit his attorney's fees request in compliance with Local Rule 3.214 and to revise the proposed judgment to match the injunctive relief request set forth in the complaint. The Judge has directed the Plaintiff to submit a revised default judgment packet addressing these issues.
