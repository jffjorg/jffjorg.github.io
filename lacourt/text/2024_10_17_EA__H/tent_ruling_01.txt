Background
This
is a credit card collection case. On May 6, 2019, Plaintiff Capital One Bank (USA), Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint,
asserting breach of contract and common counts causes of action against Jiazheng Lu (“Lu”).
On
October 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed a “Settlement Agreement.” On October 16,
2019, Plaintiff filed a conditional “Notice of Settlement of Entire Case;” that
day, an “Order on Settlement Agreement and Stipulation for Judgment” was filed
and the case was dismissed, without prejudice.

 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the Court for an
order, per Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, vacating the dismissal in
this case and entering judgment against Lu.
The
Court will continue the hearing on the motion to November 15 at 9:30 a.m.,
inasmuch as there is no indication in the record that Lu was provided notice of
the continued hearing date of October 17, 2024.[FN1] Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to provide notice of the above continued hearing
date forthwith and to file a proof of service with the Court reflecting such
notice no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date.
