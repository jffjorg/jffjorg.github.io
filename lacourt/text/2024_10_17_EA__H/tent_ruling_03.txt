Background 
In
this breach of contract case, Plaintiffs Zia Abhari and Amir Shamloo (together,
“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
On May 2, 2020, Gordes Hospitality, Inc. (“Gordes”),
through Ganyu Huang aka Gary Huang, and Shamloo, with Abhari serving as a
silent partner, entered into an “Asset Purchase Agreement” and a “Security
Agreement” with Gordes for the transfer of ownership of Hamilton’s Steakhouse
(“Hamilton”) from Gordes, as seller, to Plaintiffs, as buyers. On June 18,
2020, LVGEM Hotel Corporation (“LVGEM”), through Huang, and Shamloo, with
Abhari serving as a silent partner of Shamloo, entered into a “Lease Agreement”
for the lease of the property upon which Hamilton is located. Gordes, LVGEM,
and Huang have refused to transfer the existing liquor license for Hamilton to
Plaintiffs, failed to provide Plaintiffs with the insurance information and
have undertaken efforts to deprive Plaintiffs of their real estate leasehold
possessory interest in the premises upon which the Hamilton is located. 
Plaintiffs’
Second Amended Complaint asserts 10 causes of action against Gordes, LVGEM, and
others, including for breach of contract, tortious breach of implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, fraud in the inducement, negligent
misrepresentation, and fraud by false promise. 
Gordes
and LVGEM have filed a Cross-Complaint, asserting 14 causes of action against
Abhari, Shamloo, and Xicheng Qian (“Qian”), including for conversion, money had
and received, fraud based on intentional misrepresentation, fraud in the
inducement, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duties. 
Pending
before the Court is Gordes and LVGEM’s motion to compel Qian to (1) attend his
deposition, (2) produce documents responsive to their request for production of
documents, and (3) pay sanctions in the amount of $2,533.45. For the reasons
stated herein, the motion is granted, though sanctions are awarded in the
reduced amount of $1,393.45. 
 
Legal
Standard 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection . . ., fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
A
motion to compel deposition “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The motion shall also “set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).) 
A
court shall impose monetary sanctions if the motion to compel is granted,
“unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
 
Discussion 
Gordes
and LVGEM move the Court for an order compelling Qian to (1) attend his
deposition, (2) produce documents responsive to their request for production of
documents, and (3) pay sanctions in the amount of $2,533.45. 
Gordes
and LVGEM’s counsel Caixing Ma (“Ma”) represents as follows:
On February 16, 2024, Ma confirmed with Qian’s counsel
Matthew Malczynski (“Malczynski”) that Qian would be available for his
deposition in late March 2024. (Ma Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) On February 20, 2024,
Gordes and LVGEM served Qian with a “Notice of Taking Deposition. . . and
Request for Production of Documents,” wherein Qian’s remote deposition was scheduled for March 28, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3, Exh. 2.) 
On March 26, 2024, Malczynski emailed Ma and stated
that he had a hearing in Chatsworth that he needed to personally attend on
March 28 and thus needed to reschedule the deposition (Id., ¶ 4, Exh.
3); however, when Pasha Vafaei, counsel for Shamloo and Abhari, asked why the
March 28, 2024 deposition needed to be rescheduled, Malczynski responded that he “had the flu.” (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. 4.)
On April 16, 2024, Malczynski confirmed
that May 17, 2024 would be “perfect” for Qian’s rescheduled deposition (Id., ¶ 5, Exh. 5); as such, Gordes and LVGEM served Qian with the first amended notice of deposition for a May 17, 2024 deposition. (Id., ¶ 5, Exhs. 6 and 7.) On May 16,
2024, Malczynski emailed Ma and said he would “prefer
to continue [the deposition] one last time,” which Ma agreed to do, to June 11,
2024. (Id., ¶ 6, Exhs. 7 and 8.) On May 17, 2024, Gordes and LVGEM
served Qian with the second amended notice of deposition for a June 11, 2024
deposition. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. 9.)
On June 10, 2024, at 2:52 p.m., Malczynski asked to move
the deposition “one FINAL time” from June 11, 2024 to the following Tuesday. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. 10.) Ma
agreed; as such, Gordes and LVGEM served Qian with the third amended
notice of deposition for a June 18, 2024 deposition. (Id.,
¶ 7, Exh. 11.)
On June 18, 2024, at 9:24 a.m., 36 minutes prior to the
scheduled deposition, Malczynski emailed Ma that Qian “is out of the country.” (Id., ¶ 8, Exh. 12.) Counsel for Gordes and LVGEM thereafter unsuccessfully attempted on multiple
occasions to rescheduled Qian’s deposition. (Id., ¶ 9.) Counsel for
Gordes and LVGEM filed an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) brief on July
25, 2024 in an attempt to resolve scheduling Qian’s deposition, but the IDC was
taken off-calendar when the case was reassigned to Department H. (Id., ¶
9. Exh. 13.)
On September 5, 2024, Counsel for Gordes and LVGEM emailed
Malczynski and asked that he provide her by September 9, 2024 with available
dates in late September or early October 2024 for Qian’s deposition; no
response was received. (Id., ¶ 10, Exh. 14.) As of the filing date of
the motion, Qian has not appeared for his deposition, nor has he provided any
objections, responses, or documents to the concurrent document requests. (Id.,
¶ 11.)
The
motion is granted. Qian is ordered forthwith
to provide Gordes and LVGEM with three dates Qian is available for deposition
within the 20-day period from the date of the notice of ruling.
As to the request for sanctions, Gordes and LVGEM seek
sanctions against Qian in the amount
of $2,533.45 [calculated as follows: 0.4 hours preparing IDC form, plus 1.9
hours preparing IDC brief, plus 2.5 hours preparing motion and declaration,
plus 1 hour reviewing opposition, drafting reply and preparing for/attending
hearing at $300.00 /hour, plus $60.00 filing fee, plus $583.45 in court
reporter fees for the last-minute cancellation of deposition].
Utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court
finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is
$1,393.45 (i.e., 2.5 hours at $300.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee, plus
$583.45 in court reporter fees). Sanctions are payable within 20 days from the
date of the notice of ruling.
