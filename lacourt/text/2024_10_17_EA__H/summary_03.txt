And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel the deposition of Xicheng Qian, a cross-defendant in a breach of contract case. The motion was filed by Gordes Hospitality Inc. and LVGEM Hotel Corporation, who are seeking to compel Qian's deposition and obtain documents responsive to their request for production of documents. The judge finds that Qian has failed to cooperate in scheduling the deposition and has not provided any objections, responses, or documents to the concurrent document requests. As a result, the judge orders Qian to provide Gordes and LVGEM with three dates he is available for deposition within the next 20 days. The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,393.45 to Gordes and LVGEM for the work they performed in connection with the motion.
