 Case Number:  22STCV06985    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
February 25, 2022, Plaintiff Jessica Rosas
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants City of Downey (“Downey”),
City of Los Angeles (“City of Los Angeles”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), Assured
Income LLC (“Assured”), and Does 1-25 for general negligence and premises
liability. 
On
October 18, 2023, the County filed an answer. 
On
November 28, 2023, the City of Los Angeles filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Downey, Assured, and Roes 1-10 for indemnification,
apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. 
On
December 18, 2023, The Court sustained Downey’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s claims
for negligence, premises liability–negligence, premises liability–willful
failure to warn, and premises liability–allegations about other defendants,
with 30 days leave to amend. The Court overruled Downey’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s claim for premises liability based on a dangerous condition of
public property. 
On
January 31, 2024, Downey filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission served on Plaintiff and for sanctions.  The motion was set to be heard on March 20,
2024.  The Court continued the hearing to
April 22, 2024.  On March 18, 2024,
Downey filed a notice of non-opposition, stating while Plaintiff had provided
some responses to the requests for admission, she had not provided a
verification. 
On
February 1, 2024, Downey filed an amended motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to form interrogatories, set one, to be heard on March 20, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to April 22,
2024.  Plaintiff did not file an
opposition.  On March 18, 2024, Downey
filed a notice of non-opposition, stating that Plaintiff had served
supplemental verified responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories which Downey deemed sufficient.  Downey
asked the Court to grant sanctions to compensate it for its time and effort to
obtain the responses. 
On
February 22, 2024, the Court dismissed the County without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request.  On February 26,
2024, the Court dismissed Assured without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
March 21, 2024, Downey filed an answer to the premises liability claim in
Plaintiff’s complaint and filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Williams
Pipeline Contractors, Inc. and Moes 1-50 for express indemnification, implied
indemnification, and equitable relief. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for February 24, 2025. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Downey
asks the Court (1) to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission
served on Plaintiff and impose sanctions on Plaintiff and (2) to impose
sanctions on Plaintiff based on Downey’s motion to compel further responses to form
interrogatories. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
A.   Motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission 
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
B.   Motion to compel further responses to interrogatories  
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides: 
“(a) On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of
the following apply: 
“(1) An
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 
“(2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
“(b) (1) A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu
of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response
to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a
party then fails to obey an order compelling further response to
interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.) 
DISCUSSION  
A.   Downey’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission 
On
November 29, 2023, Downey served requests for admission, set one, on
Plaintiff.  On December 18, 2023,
Plaintiff served responses to the requests. 
However, Plaintiff did not provide a verification for the responses. 
Downey
argues that Plaintiff’s unverified responses are “tantamount to no responses at
all” and therefore Downey is entitled to an order deeming admitted the matters
specified in the requests for admission. 
But as
Downey acknowledges, Plaintiff’s responses included numerous objections (16 of
33 responses).  “[N]o verification is
required to preserve objections [citation].” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1364.2, p. 8G-22 (Cal. Practice Guide); see Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.240, subd. (a).)  “Therefore, an unverified
response containing both answers and objections is effective to preserve those
objections.  The
lack of verification . . . does not result in a waiver of the objections
made.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1364.2, p. 8G-22, citing Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657 (Food 4 Less).) 
In Food
4 Less, the Court of Appeal concluded that the defendants served timely
discovery responses.  As a result, “[t]he
lack of verification did not render their objections untimely” and the trial
court “erred in finding defendants had waived their objections and in imposing
monetary sanctions upon defendants.” (Food 4 Less, supra, 40
Cal.App.4th at p. 658.) 
Here
too, Plaintiff served timely objections to Downey’s requests for admission.  Therefore, despite the lack of verification, Plaintiff
has not waived her objections to requests for admission numbers 3, 4, 5, 12,
14, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 31, 32, and 33.  If Downey disputed the objections, Downey’s
remedy was to move to compel further responses.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §2033.290, subd. (a)(2)
[“On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting
admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party
deems that . . . [a]n objection to a particular request is without merit or too
general”].) 
Plaintiff’s
remaining unverified responses to the requests for admission consisted of 15
denials and 2 admissions.  “The lack of
verification renders the fact-specific answers untimely[,] . . . [creating] a
right to move for orders and sanctions (under [Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280] [citation]).”  (Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1364.2, p. 8G-22.)  The Court therefore grants Downey’s motion to
deem admitted the matters specified in the remaining requests for admission
(numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 30). 
Downey
asks the Court to award $975.00 in sanctions based on five hours of attorney
time at a rate of $195.00 per hour. 
Counsel spent three hours to prepare the motion and anticipated spending
one hour to review an opposition and prepare a reply and one hour to prepare
for and attend the hearing. 
Considering
Downey’s partial success in this motion and Plaintiff's lack of opposition, the Court awards Downey $195.00 in
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c),
based on one hour of attorney time. 
B.   Downey’s motion to compel further responses to form
interrogatories 
On
November 29, 2023, Downey served form interrogatories, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff served responses on
December 18, 2023.  On February 23, 2024,
the parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference.  On February 1, 2024, Downey filed a motion to
compel further responses to the form interrogatories.  Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition. 
Downey states that Plaintiff has now served supplemental verified responses to the
form interrogatories, which Downey deems sufficient.  Downey asks the Court to grant sanctions to
compensate it for its time and effort to obtain the responses. 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), the Court “shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Plaintiff has not made or opposed a motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories. 
Therefore, the statute does not authorize a sanctions award against
Plaintiff. 
Downey
also relies on the statutory definition of misuse of the discovery
process.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 2023.010.)  But Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010
is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on
[the statute].  Monetary sanctions may be
imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1900,
p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse
of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing
any particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of
Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion
for its persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in
authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose
between sides of any such conflict.”) 
The
Court denies Downey’s request for sanctions on the motion to compel further responses
to form interrogatories. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant
City of Downey’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission, set one, and deems admitted the matters specified in requests for
admission numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 30.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the
motion. 
          The
Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant City of Downey’s request for sanctions on its
motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission and orders
Plaintiff Jessica Rosas to pay Defendant City of Downey $195.00
by May 22, 2024.

Court DENIES Defendant City of Downey’s request for sanctions on its motion to
