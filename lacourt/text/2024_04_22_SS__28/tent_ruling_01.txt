  Case Number:  21STCV31743    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  28 On August  26, 2021, Plaintiff Malvina Mkchyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Margaret Mary Lewis (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle  tort and general negligence.  On  May 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.  On November  3, 2023, Defendant’s counsel received Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s  special and form interrogatories.   (Kelian decs. ¶ 5.)  On January 19  and 30, 2024, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel for a 60-day extension of time to file a motion to  compel further responses to the interrogatories.  (Exhs. G & H.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to the  request.  (Kelian dec. ¶¶ 11-12.)  On  February 22, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel further responses to  special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, and (2) a motion to compel  further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and request for sanctions.  The motions were set for hearing on April 22, 2024.  Plaintiff did not file oppositions.  “Unless  notice of [a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories] is given  within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental  verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the  propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the  propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the  interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c).)  The statutory deadline  for a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories is mandatory and  the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a belated motion to compel. (See Golf  & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 215,  137; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681,  683.)  Defendant  filed her motions to compel further responses to the special and form  interrogatories well beyond the 45-day limitation period.  Although Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s  counsel to extend the time to file the motions, Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond  to the request.  It  is unclear, however, if Plaintiff’s interrogatory responses were verified.  “The 45-day clock begins only upon service of  verified responses where the responses contain any substantive responses (more  than just objections).”  (L. Edmon &  C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶  8:1147.1, p. 8F-61.)  Defendant’s motions  do not appear to assert the responses were unverified, but the responses  attached to the motions as exhibits contain only the signatures of Plaintiff’s  counsel.  “The party to whom the  interrogatories are directed shall sign the response under oath unless the  response consists only of objections.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.250, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff’s responses do not consist only of  objections.  The  Court continues the hearing and orders Defendant to file a supplemental  declaration or brief explaining whether her motions are timely under Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c).  Plaintiff may file a response to Defendant’s  supplemental filing.  CONCLUSION            The Court CONTINUES the hearing on Defendant Margaret Mary  Lewis’s motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set  one, and form interrogatories, set one to a date to be provided  at the April 22, 2024 hearing.            No later than ten days before the continued hearing, Defendant  Margaret Mary Lewis shall file a supplemental declaration or brief explaining  whether her motions to compel further responses to interrogatories are timely  under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c).            No later than five days before the continued hearing,  Plaintiff Malvina Mkchyan may file a responsive  declaration or brief explaining whether Defendant Margaret Mary Lewis’s motions  to compel further responses to interrogatories are timely under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c).            Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
