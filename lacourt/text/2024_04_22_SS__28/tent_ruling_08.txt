 Case Number:  22STCV36601    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as follows.  In addition, the Court clarifies the basis
for its January 26, 2024 order granting Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s unopposed motion to deem
admitted matters specified in requests for admission and imposing sanctions on
Plaintiff Carmeletta Mobley. 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 21, 2022, Plaintiff Carmeletta Mobley (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Starbucks Corporation (“Defendant”) and “William, No Last
Name (Agent)” for general negligence, products liability, and premises
liability. 
On
February 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendant
for general negligence, products liability, and
premises liability. 
On
March 13, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
November 27, 2023, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses
to request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions, and (2) a
motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special and form interrogatories, set
one, and for sanctions.  The motions were
set for hearing on March 1, 2024.  The
Court continued the hearing to April 22, 2024.  On January 26, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one, deemed the matters admitted, and ordered Plaintiff to pay Defendant $412.00 in monetary sanctions by February 25, 2024.
On
February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition to Defendant’s motion
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents.  Plaintiff did not properly serve the
opposition, leading Defendant to purchase a copy from the Court’s website.  The Court exercises its discretion to consider
the untimely and improperly served opposition.  Plaintiff did not file a separate opposition
to the motion to compel responses to the special and form interrogatories. 
On
March 18, 2024, Defendant filed a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition to
Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the request for production of
documents (“Reply”). 
Trial
is currently scheduled for August 28, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, and
to impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny Defendant's motion to compel responses to the request for
production of documents and to deny Defendant's requests for sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   
C.
Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The Court clarifies its January 26, 2024 order 
On
January 26, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to deem
admitted matters specified in requests for admission and for sanctions.  In making this
order, the Court stated that Plaintiff did not provide timely responses to
Defendant’s requests for admission and had not provided responses by the time
Defendant filed its motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admissions on November 27, 2023. 
In preparing
the Court’s ruling on Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
Defendant’s requests for production of documents and interrogatories, however,
the Court found that Plaintiff served unverified responses to the requests for
admission on August 10, 2023, before the January 10, 2024 hearing. 
The
Court may not deem admitted the truth of matters specified in requests for
admission if “it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).) 
Defendant
argued that Plaintiff’s unverified responses were tantamount to no response at
all.  But “no verification is required to
preserve objections [citation].”  (L.
Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(Rutter 2023) (Cal. Practice Guide) ¶ 8:1364.2, p. 8G-22; see Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.240, subd. (a) [“The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed shall sign the response under oath, unless the response contains only
objections”].)  “Therefore, an unverified
response containing both answers and objections is effective to preserve those
objections.  The lack of verification renders
the fact-specific answers untimely; but that only creates a right to move for
orders and sanctions (under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280]
[citation]).  It does not result in a
waiver of the objections made.”  (Cal.
Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1364.2, p. 8G-22, citing Food 4 Less
Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.) 
The
Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s responses to the requests for admission
(attached to Plaintiff’s opposition to Defendant’s motion to compel responses
to requests for production of documents). 
Plaintiff provided fact-specific responses with no objections.  Therefore, the lack of verification rendered
the responses untimely. 
Plaintiff
has provided a verification, dated February 26, 2024, to her responses to the
requests for admission as Exhibit A to her opposition to Defendant’s motion to
compel responses to request for production of documents.  The verification was due no later than the
January 26, 2024 hearing on the motion to deem admitted matters specified in
the requests for admission.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
Therefore, the February 26, 2024 verification does not change the Court's ruling on the motion. 
Accordingly, the Court's January 26, 2024 order (1) granted Defendant Starbucks
Corporation’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission, set one, and deemed the matters admitted and (2) ordered Plaintiff Carmeletta
Mobley to pay Defendant Starbucks Corporation $412.00 in sanctions.  The Court now continues the deadline for payment of the sanctions to May 21, 2024. 
B.   Defendant’s request for production of documents 
On
June 5, 2023, Defendant served request for production of documents, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide
timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed its motion to compel. 
In
her opposition to Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the request for
production of documents, Plaintiff asserts that she served responses on August
11, 2023, citing Exhibit B to her opposition. 
Exhibit B, however, are copies of Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s
requests for admission and interrogatories. 
Plaintiff evidently has not served responses to the request for
production of documents.  
The Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by May 21, 2024. 
Defendant
asks the Court to impose $368.00 in sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, subdivision (c).  The Court finds that imposition of sanctions
would be unjust in light of the Court’s previous imposition of $412.00 in
sanctions and Plaintiff’s financial condition. 
C.   Defendant’s request for special and form
interrogatories 
On
June 5, 2023, Defendant served special interrogatories, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff. 
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff served unverified responses. 
Plaintiff
has now provided a verification as an exhibit to her opposition to Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to request for production of documents.  The motion therefore is moot.
Defendant
requests sanctions to compensate it for the fees and expenses it incurred to
file its motion.  The Court finds that
imposition of sanctions would be unjust in light of the Court’s previous
imposition of $412.00 in sanctions and Plaintiff’s financial condition. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court CLARIFIES its
January 26, 2024 order.  The Court's January
26, 2024 order (1) GRANTED Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s motion
to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one, and deemed
the matters admitted and (2) ORDERED Plaintiff Carmeletta Mobley to pay
Defendant Starbucks Corporation $412.00 in sanctions.  The Court now continues the deadline for Plaintiff
Carmeletta Mobley to pay Defendant
Starbucks Corporation $412.00 in sanctions to May 21, 2024. 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s motion to compel Plaintiff Carmeletta
Mobley’s responses to request for production of documents, set one.  The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide
verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by May 21, 2024.  The
Court DENIES Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s request for sanctions on this
motion. 
The Court DENIES
AS MOOT Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s motion to compel Plaintiff Carmeletta
Mobley’s responses to special interrogatories, set one.  The Court DENIES Defendant Starbucks
Corporation’s request for sanctions on this motion. 
The
Court DENIES AS MOOT Defendant Starbucks Corporation’s motion to compel
Plaintiff Carmeletta Mobley’s responses to form interrogatories, set one.  The Court DENIES Defendant Starbucks
Corporation’s request for sanctions on this motion. 
The
Court reminds Defendant Starbucks Corporation that separate motions to compel
should be filed for each type of discovery at issue.  Here, Defendant Starbucks Corporation should
have filed a separate motion, and paid a separate filing fee, for (1) the motion
to compel responses to special interrogatories and (2) the motion to compel
responses to form interrogatories.  The
Court waives the additional filing fee. 
Moving
party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling. 
Moving
party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
