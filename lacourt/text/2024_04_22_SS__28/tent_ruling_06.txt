PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Carbone
asks the Court to grant relief from the order deeming admitted the matters
specified in Serrano’s request for admission. 
Serrano
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.300 provides: 
“(a) A party may withdraw or amend an admission made
in response to a request for admission only on leave of court granted after
notice to all parties. 
“(b) The court may permit withdrawal or amendment of
an admission only if it determines that the admission was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained
the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s
action or defense on the merits. 
“(c) The court may impose
conditions on the granting of the motion that are just, including, but not
limited to, the following: 
“(1) An order
that the party who obtained the admission be permitted to pursue additional
discovery related to the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended admission. 
“(2) An order
that the costs of any additional discovery be borne in whole or in part by the
party withdrawing or amending the admission.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300.) 
“The
trial court's discretion in ruling on a motion to withdraw or amend an
admission is not unlimited, but must be exercised in conformity with the spirit
of the law and in a manner that serves the interests of justice. Because the
law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying
section 2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.  Accordingly, the court's discretion to deny a motion under the statute is
limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence, or
neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the withdrawal or amendment
would substantially prejudice the party who obtained the admission in
maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.”  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420–1421 (New Albertsons).) 
The
party against whom an order deeming admitted matters specified in requests for
admission has been entered “may seek relief . . . by filing a motion to
withdraw or amend the ‘deemed admission’ under [Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.300].”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1369.5, p.
8G-23 (Cal. Practice Guide).)  The court
will permit a party to withdraw or amend an admission only if the court finds
(1) the admission resulted from mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and
(2) the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially
prejudiced.  (Id., ¶ 8:1386.1, p.
8G-30, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300, subd. (b).) 
“The
requirements for relief under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300] are
similar to those governing relief from default under [Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b)].  The terms
‘mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect’ as used in [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.300] are given the same meanings as similar terms found
in [Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)].”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶
8:1386.2, p. 8G-30, citing New Albertsons, supra, 168 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1419.)  
DISCUSSION 
On
February 7, 2023, Serrano served request for admission, set one, on Carbone.  Serrano asked Carbone to admit only one fact: 
“Admit that you cannot establish financial
responsibility as required [b]y California Civil Code Section [3]333.4, enacted
by the voters of the State of California through Initiative Measure Proposition
213 and effective November 5, 1996, for the time of the accident which forms
the basis of this lawsuit.” 
On
April 22 or 23, 2023, Carbone served an unverified response.  The response asserted 15 “general” objections
and then stated: 
“Objection. This Request seeks a legal conclusion.
Plaintiff further objects to this request for statement of admission on the
basis that it is vague and ambiguous, seeks legal conclusions, lacks
foundation, calls for speculation, and seeks expert witness information in
violation of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code§§ 2034.210,2034.220, and 2034.270. [¶]  Subject [to] and without waiving the
objection Responding Party Responds: Deny.” 
On November
13, 2023, Serrano filed a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the
requests for admission.  Serrano’s motion
asserted that “[Carbone] has failed, and continues to fail, to provide
responses to [the requests for admission].” 
(Motion for order that request for admission propounded on Plaintiff be
deemed admitted p. 3.)  Serrano did not
attach a copy of Carbone’s response to the request for admission.  Carbone did not file an opposition to Serrano’s
motion. On December 21, 2023, the Court granted the motion and deemed admitted
the matters specified in the request for admission. 
Carbone
now asks the Court to grant relief from the December 21, 2023 order, arguing
the ruling resulted from Carbone’s counsel’s inadvertence, mistake, or reasonable
neglect.  Carbone points to her service
of an unverified response to the request for admission on April 23, 2023.  (Motion p. 3.)  Moreover, Carbone argues, her counsel
attempted to file an opposition to Serrano’s motion to deem admitted matters specified
in the request for admission and believed the opposition had been filed. 
On
December 20, 2023, having learned that her opposition had not been filed or
served, Carbone’s counsel attempted to file her opposition and an ex parte
request to shorten the time to oppose Serrano’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in the request for admission.  The
Court rejected the filings as untimely. 
On
December 20, 2023, Carbone served a verification of her response to Serrano’s
request for admission. 
Based
on this chronology, the Court finds that the mistake, inadvertence, and
excusable neglect of Carbone’s counsel in failing to bring (1) Carbone’s April
22 or 23, 2023 response to the request for admission and (2) Carbone’s December 20,
2023 verification to the Court’s attention at or before the December 21, 2023
hearing caused the Court to grant Serrano’s motion to deem admitted the matter
specified in his request for admission. 
“[N]o
verification is required to preserve objections (see [Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.240, subd. (a)]).  Therefore, an unverified
response containing both answers and objections is effective to preserve those
objections.  The lack of verification
renders the fact-specific answers untimely; but that only creates a right to
move for orders and sanctions [under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280]
[citation].  It does not result in a
waiver of the objections made.”  (Cal.
Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1364.2, p. 8G-22.)  Therefore, Carbone’s unverified response to
Serrano’s request for admission preserved the objections asserted in the
responses.  Moreover, Carbone’s service
of a verification on December 20, 2023 – before the December 21, 2023 hearing –
left Serrano without a viable motion.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
Serrano
argues that he would suffer substantial prejudice if the Court relieves Carbone
of the ruling deeming admitted the matters specified in the request for
admission because (1) “it would affect [Serrano’s] ability and intent to file a
Motion for Summary Judgment based on the deemed admission” (Opposition p. 2), (2) “the withdrawn admission may allow for [Carbone] to recover more
general damages for pain and suffering” (Opposition p. 8), and (3) granting
Plaintiff’s motion would force Defendant to incur further costs and expense on
additional discovery in preparation for the fast-approaching May 21, 2024 trial
date in this matter, which may be continued per Stipulation but nonetheless,
cause further financial hardship on defense (Opposition p. 8). 
The
Court concludes that granting Carbone’s motion for relief from the order
deeming admitted request for admission will not substantially prejudice Serrano
in maintaining his action or defense on the merits. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300, subd. (b).) 
The
Court grants the motion and vacates the portion of the December 21, 2023 order
that deemed admitted the matters specified in Serrano's request for admission. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Victoria Carbone’s
motion for relief from the Court’s order granting Defendant Juan Gonzalez Serrano’s motion to deem admitted
matters specified in his request for admission. 
The Court vacates the portion of the Court’s December 21, 2023 order granting
Defendant Juan Gonzalez Serrano’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in his request for admission and deeming the matters admitted.  The Court does not modify the other rulings
in the December 21, 2023 order. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
