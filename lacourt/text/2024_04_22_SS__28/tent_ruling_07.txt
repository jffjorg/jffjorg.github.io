[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on  the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior  Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et  seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.)  To  obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner  must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and  must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of  the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.  (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  DISCUSSION       The  gross settlement amount is $6,500.00.  Of  that amount, $2,000.00 will be used to pay or reimburse medical expenses, $1,625.00  will be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $449.05 will be used to pay  costs.  The remaining net settlement  amount of $2,425.95 will be deposited in an insured account in Chase Bank,  Tarzana Branch, 18705 Ventura Boulevard, Tarzana, CA 91356, (818) 758-2770,  subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  The  Court grants the petition.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Nessia  Ohev Shalom’s claims filed by Petitioner Morris Ohev Shalom on April 12, 2024.  The  Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Distribution of Net Settlement on June 21,  2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
