And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial to March 4, 2025. The defendants had requested the continuance due to the need for additional discovery and the unavailability of their trial counsel. The plaintiff had opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants had not shown good cause. The judge finds good cause and grants the motion, continuing the trial to March 4, 2025. The judge also orders that all discovery and related dates will be based on the new trial date.
