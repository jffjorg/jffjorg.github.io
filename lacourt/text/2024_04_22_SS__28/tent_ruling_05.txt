            Moving
Defendants describe their filing as a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2). 
Subdivision (a)(2) authorizes a settling party to “give notice of
settlement to all parties and to the court, together with an application for
determination of good faith settlement and a proposed order.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 877.6, subd. (a)(2).)  A nonsettling
party may then move to contest the good faith of the settlement. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(1), authorizes
a party to file a motion seeking a good faith settlement determination.  (See L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:855-12:856, p.
12(ll)-100.)
The
parties have treated Moving Defendants’ filing as a motion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(1). 
The Court will do the same.
