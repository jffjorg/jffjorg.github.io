And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Carbone's motion for relief from the order deeming admitted the matters specified in Serrano's request for admission. The court finds that Carbone's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect in failing to bring Carbone's response to the request for admission and failing to serve a verification of the response to the court's attention at the December 21, 2023 hearing caused the court to grant Serrano's motion to deem admitted the matters specified in his request for admission. The court concludes that granting Carbone's motion will not substantially prejudice Serrano in maintaining his action or defense on the merits. The court vacates the portion of the December 21, 2023 order that deemed admitted the matters specified in Serrano's request for admission.
