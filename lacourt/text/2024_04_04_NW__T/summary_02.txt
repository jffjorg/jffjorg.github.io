Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three requests from the plaintiff. Request #1 grants the plaintiff's request for an order to preserve property videos, with conditions including the use of a form for video preservation requests and the submission of the form to the Business Manager. Request #2 grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide a verified compliant privilege log, which must include specific information about each allegedly privileged document. Request #3 is a question from the plaintiff asking if she is required to oppose the LLC's motion to vacate default, which the court answers as a matter of litigation strategy, leaving the decision to the plaintiff.
