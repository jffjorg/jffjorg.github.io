  Case Number:  23VECV00122    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  T [TENTATIVE]
ORDER:  Petitioner/Defendant Hi-Tech
Builders, Inc.’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.  
Introduction

            Petitioner/Defendant
Hi-Tech Builders, Inc. petitioner to confirm the arbitration award awarded
against Respondent/Plaintiff JiaoJiao (Lucy) Fu (Plaintiff).  The arbitration awarded Defendant
$23,404.76.  

            Discussion 
            Defendant submitted a copy of the
arbitration award levied against Plaintiff that was entered on January 30, 2024.  Unless a petition or response seeking to
correct or vacate an arbitration award was filed properly based upon valid
grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts are required to enter judgment
in conformity with the award.  (Code of
Civ. Proc. sec. 1286; Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space
Facility (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) 
Because Plaintiff did not file a separate petition to correct or vacate
and did not file a response/opposition to the instant Petition despite
sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard, the Petition is persuasive.  
The
Petition to Confirm the Award is GRANTED. 
The court will enter judgment accordingly.

JUDGMENT
The
court enters judgment in favor of defendant Hi-Tech Builders, Inc. and against
