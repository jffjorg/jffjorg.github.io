And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike, and overruled their demurrer. The plaintiff, Lillian H. Michaels, alleged that the defendants, Southern California Hospital at Culver City, et al., pushed her to perform exercises despite her pain and failed to protect her from health and safety hazards. The judge found that the defendants' actions could show a claim for elder neglect, as they continued to subject Ms. Michaels to physical therapy sessions despite her severe pain and refusal to participate. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim for elder abuse and neglect, and that defendants' managing agents may have ratified the acts and omissions of the defendants. The judge ordered that the defendants' motion to dismiss be denied and that the case proceed.
