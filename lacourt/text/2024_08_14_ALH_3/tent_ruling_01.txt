I.      INTRODUCTION
         On November
30, 2023, plaintiff Danny Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
defendants Ming C. Peng (“Peng”) and City of San Marino (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff  asserts a cause of action for
negligence and alleges that on or about November 16, 2022, he was involved in
an automobile collision when Peng failed to stop at an intermittent flashing
red light. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to maintain
the traffic light and is liable under Government Code sections 815.2(a), 815.6,
820, and 830.8. (Compl., ¶¶ 13-16.) 
          On
April 12, 2024, Defendant filed this demurrer to the entire complaint. 
          On
July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief. 
          On
August 1, 2024, Defendant filed a reply brief. 
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face. (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.) A
demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause
of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) “We treat the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of
the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be judicially
noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell v.
California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are
deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be
liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) In construing the allegations,
the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or
limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd
764, 769.) 
III.    DISCUSSION
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails
to state sufficient facts establishing a claim for negligence because none of
the statutes cited in the Complaint provide a basis for liability. First,
Defendant argues that Government Code sections 815.2(a) and 820, which provide
that a public entity is vicariously liable for an act or omission of its
employee (who is liable to the same extent as that of a private person except
as otherwise provided by statute), are inapplicable because public employees
cannot be held personally liable for an alleged dangerous condition of public
property. (Gov. Code, § 840.) Government Code section 815.6 is also not an
appropriate basis for liability because Plaintiff identifies no mandatory duty
that Defendant allegedly failed to discharge. Last, Plaintiff’s citation to Government
Code section 830.8 fails to establish a basis for liability. Government Code
section 830.8 provides immunity to a public entity for the failure to provide
traffic or warning signals, signs, makings, or devices “unless such were
required to warn of a known dangerous condition, which would not be reasonably
apparent to, and would not have been anticipated by a person exercising due
care.” Plaintiff does not allege facts identifying a dangerous condition because
Government Code section 830.4 states that a condition is not dangerous due to
the public entity’s failure to provide traffic control signals, stop signs, or
other signs or roadway markings. Additionally, in Chowdhury v. City of Los
Angeles (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1187, the court held that a traffic signal rendered
inoperable by a power outage does not constitute a dangerous condition because motorists
are required to treat an inoperative signal as a four-way stop pursuant to
Vehicle Code section 21800, and four-way stops are not dangerous when used with
due care by the general public. 
The Court notes that Plaintiff argues
in opposition that the intersection was also confusing because there were six
different ways to enter it. However, this allegation is not included in the
complaint, nor does Plaintiff allege that he was confused. Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained.  
IV.    CONCLUSION
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with
20 days’ leave to amend. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
