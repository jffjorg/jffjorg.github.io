And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the City of San Marino's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges negligence and failure to maintain a traffic light. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for negligence, as the statutes cited in the complaint do not provide a basis for liability. The court notes that the plaintiff's allegations of a confusing intersection are not included in the complaint and do not establish a basis for liability. The demurrer is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend.
