And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration in a case involving Incentax, LLC (the plaintiff) and Martini Akpovi Partners, LLC, et al. (the defendants). The plaintiff is seeking to avoid arbitration of derivative claims, while the defendants are seeking to compel arbitration of individual claims.

The judge has ruled that the arbitration agreement does not clearly and unmistakably delegate the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, and therefore the derivative claims are not covered by the arbitration agreement. However, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of individual claims against Martini LLP and Passmore.

The judge has also stayed the action pending completion of arbitration. The parties are required to file a joint report within five days before the status conference, which is scheduled for August 13, 2024.
