And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside/vacate judgment in favor of the defendants. The motion was filed on August 26, 2024, and the judgment was entered on February 27, 2024. The plaintiff claims that he mistakenly believed defense counsel was representing him during the non-jury trial, but the court finds that this claim is implausible and unsupported by the record. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) and holds that the mistake must be one that a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances might have made, and that the plaintiff's actions do not align with what a reasonably prudent person would have done.
