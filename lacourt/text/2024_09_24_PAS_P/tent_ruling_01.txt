  Case Number:  20STCV30438    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING MOTION BY PLAINTIFF ANTHONY ADEFUYE TO SET ASIDE/VACATE JUDGMENTI.        INTRODUCTION
          On August 11, 2020, Plaintiff Anthony Adefuye (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Cabo Cantina LLC (“Cabo Cantina”) alleging
he sustained injuries when he was attacked by a security guard. On March 2,
2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) asserting
causes of action for negligence, assault and battery, intentional infliction of
emotional distress (“IIED”), and premises liability against Cabo Cantina,
Sunset 26, LLC, Cabo Cantina L.A., LLC, Southwest Traffic Corp., CC HLWD LLC,
RMG Sunset Inc., Milton Zampelli, Bohdan Nalepa, and Michael Bezerra (except as
to the fourth cause of action for premises liability). Cross-complaints were
filed but later dismissed. 
On
January 18, 2024, following a non-jury trial, the Court granted the motion for
non-suit as to Defendants Michael Bezerra, Milton Zampelli, and Sunset 26 LLC.
The Court also granted the motion for judgment per Code of Civil Procedure §631.8
for Defendants Cabo Cantina, Southwest Traffic Corp., and Bohdan Nalepa. On
February 27, 2024, judgment was entered in favor of CC HLWD LLC (dba Cabo
Cantina), Cabo Cantina L.A., LLC, RMG Sunset Inc, Michael Bezerra, Milton
Zampelli, Sunset 26 LLC, Southwest Traffic Corp., and Bohdan Nalepa, and
against Plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s
initial motion to vacate/set aside judgment was denied by the Court on August
19, 2024, due to improper service. Plaintiff subsequently refiled the motion on
August 26, 2024. The matter now returns before the Court as Plaintiff seeks to
set aside/vacate judgment. 
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Code Civ. Proc. §473(b) provides that the court “may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.”
 
          III.     DISCUSSION
In
this instant motion, Plaintiff seeks to set aside the judgment entered on
February 27, 2024, in favor of Defendants following the bench trial held from
January 16 to January 18, 2024. Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants CC
HLWD LLC (dba Cabo Cantina), Cabo Cantina L.A., LLC, RMG Sunset Inc., Michael
Bezerra, Milton Zampelli, Sunset 26 LLC, Southwest Traffic Corp., and Bohdan
Nalepa. Plaintiff’s prior motion to set aside the judgment, filed on August 19,
2024, was denied due to procedural deficiencies. 
The
Plaintiff’s proof of service was initially served directly on the parties, and
the deadline for electronic service was untimely. (Min. Order 8/19/24).
However, on August 26, 2024, the Plaintiff subsequently executed service electronically
through another individual. (Declaration of Service by E-Mail). Therefore, the
Court finds that the Plaintiff has cured the procedural defects in the present
motion. 
Plaintiff
moves to set aside the judgment on the grounds of mistake, alleging that he
mistakenly believed the Court had appointed counsel to represent him during
trial—specifically, Mr. Anthony D. Ross and Ms. Laurie Stayton. Plaintiff
contends that this misunderstanding constitutes a mistake under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b) and seeks relief on that basis.
As
noted above, the motion to set aside judgment under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b)
requires the moving party to meet three basic requirements: (1) the motion must
include a copy of the proposed answer or other pleading to be filed, (2) the
motion must be made within a reasonable time, not exceeding six months from the
date of entry of judgment, and (3) the default or dismissal must have occurred
due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
 
Copy of proposed
answer/other pleadings
In
support of his motion, Plaintiff has submitted the following: Proposed Answer
to Defendant’s Nonsuit Motion; Joint Exhibit List and Defendants’ CC HLWD LLC (dba
Cabo Cantina); Michael Bezerra, Milton Zampelli; and Sunset 26 LLC, Motion for Judgment
on Non-Suit. Therefore, the Plaintiff has satisfied this requirement.
 
Timeliness of Motion
Plaintiff
filed the motion to vacate the judgment on August 26, 2024. The judgment was
entered on February 27, 2024, giving Plaintiff until August 27, 2024, to file
the motion under the six-month statutory period set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure §473(b). Since Plaintiff’s motion was filed on August 26, 2024, it is
within the required timeframe and is therefore timely.
 
Mistake, Inadvertence,
Surprise or Excusable Neglect
In
Plaintiff’s motion, he asserts that he interpreted the Court’s dismissal of the
case for non-suit on January 18, 2024, as a signal that attorneys — namely,
Defendant’s counsel, Mr. Anthony D. Ross and/or Ms. Laurie Slayton – would now
handle the proceedings. Plaintiff further claims that he believed the Court had
appointed counsel to represent him. As a result, Plaintiff misunderstood the
proceedings, believing that a jury trial had been conducted.
Under
California law, for a mistake to warrant relief under Code of Civil Procedure
§473(b), it must be one that a reasonably prudent person under similar
circumstances might have made. As held in Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting
Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258, the mistake must be excusable and
not a result of negligence or unreasonable assumptions.
Here,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s actions do not align with what a reasonably
prudent person under the same or similar circumstances would have done.
Throughout the proceedings, Plaintiff has represented himself in pro per, and
it was clear from the outset that Ms. Slayton and Mr. Ross were attorneys
representing the Defendants, not the Plaintiff. This was explicitly stated at
every stage of the proceedings. Plaintiff’s claim that he believed opposing
counsel had been appointed to represent him is not only implausible but also
unsupported by the record.
Plaintiff
cites Melde v. Reynolds (1900) 129 Cal. 308, to support his claim
that his mistake is excusable. In Melde, the plaintiff’s counsel was
mistakenly informed by the court that the trial would not take place for at
least three months. Relying on this information, the defendant left the
country, and as a result, no appearance was made when the case was transferred
to another department and judgment was entered. The court held that plaintiff’s
failure to appear was excusable because the plaintiff had made a good faith
effort to ascertain the status of the trial by directly inquiring with the
court, and the court’s incorrect information led to the mistake.
By
contrast, in the present case, Plaintiff’s purported mistake was based solely
on his unsupported belief that defense counsel, Mr. Ross and Ms. Slayton, were
representing him. Unlike Melde, where the plaintiff was directly misled
by the court’s incorrect information regarding the trial date, no such
misleading or incorrect information provided to Plaintiff here. Plaintiff’s claimed
belief that he was represented by opposing counsel was not based on any
communication or action by the court or the attorneys involved. 
It
is unreasonable for Plaintiff to have believed that defense counsel would
assume responsibility for his legal representation during the civil
proceedings. Plaintiff has consistently represented himself from the filing of
the complaint on August 11, 2020, until present. Given this, a reasonably
prudent person would not have made the same mistaken assumption. 
Additionally,
Plaintiff’s own filings in this case reflect an awareness of his pro per
status, further undermining any claim of confusion regarding representation.
Therefore, the Court finds no basis for setting aside the judgment based on
Plaintiff’s claims of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect. 
          
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Plaintiff’s motion to set aside/vacate judgment is DENIED.
