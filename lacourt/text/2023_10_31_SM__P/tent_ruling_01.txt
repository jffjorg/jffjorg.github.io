Essex Management
Corp. v. Johnson, Case No. 23SMUD01577
Hearing Date
October 31, 2023 
Ex Parte
Application to Set Aside Default Judgment 
 
Public policy
favors resolving contested cases on their merits, rather than via default. Hodge
Sheet Metal Products v. Palm Springs Riviera Hotel (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d
653, 657.
 
In this unlawful
detainer matter, defendant Johnson states she was never personally served with
the complaint and summons. The proof of service states Johnson was personally served
at home on July 17, 2023 at 2:20 PM. Johnson states she was at a doctor’s
appointment on that date and time. Johnson declaration ¶¶3-5. Johnson also
states she never received the summons and complaint by mail. Id. ¶7. 
 
Essex argues defendant’s
claims regarding service are insufficient to defeat the rebuttable presumption
of proper service created by Cal. Evid. Code §647. The court finds Johnson’s
evidence regarding the doctor’s appointment on July 17 (Johnson’s declaration and
a patient portal message referencing the appointment and a medical work excuse
note signed by Johnson’s provider) to be convincing. Johnson declaration
exhibits 1-2. 
 
If service was
never properly completed, the default is void. Dill v. Berquist Construction
Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444. Considering this, and the strong
public policy in favor of resolving cases on the merits, default will be set
aside. GRANTED. Defendant to file a responsive pleading within 5 days.
