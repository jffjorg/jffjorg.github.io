Judge's Tentative Ruling:

In the unlawful detainer matter between Essex Management Corp. and Johnson, the court has tentatively ruled to set aside the default judgment. Johnson claims she was never personally served with the complaint and summons, and that she was at a doctor's appointment on the date and time listed on the proof of service. The court finds Johnson's evidence convincing and believes that if service was never properly completed, the default is void. Considering the strong public policy in favor of resolving cases on their merits, the court grants Johnson's application to set aside the default judgment. Johnson is required to file a responsive pleading within 5 days.
