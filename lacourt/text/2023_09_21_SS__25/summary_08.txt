## English-text Summary:

This tentative ruling is about a case where Delbert Cannon is suing Douglas Center Partners LLC, Hojas Premium Tea House, LLC, and Alma Rosa Ortiz for alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  

The Plaintiff, Delbert Cannon, filed a Motion to Compel, requesting the court to force Douglas Center Partners LLC to answer his Special Interrogatories. No opposition was filed by the defendant. The judge found that Douglas Center Partners LLC failed to respond to the interrogatories and that this constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.  

Therefore, the judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel and orders Douglas Center Partners LLC to provide verified answers to the interrogatories within 10 days. The judge also grants the Plaintiff's request for $500 in monetary sanctions due to the defendant's failure to respond.  

Furthermore, the judge strikes the Answer filed by Douglas Center Partners LLC because it was filed by a non-lawyer, Kathie Hira, who is the Managing Member of the company.  The judge notes that entities must be represented by lawyers in legal proceedings and cannot represent themselves. Finally, the judge sets an Order to Show Cause hearing for November 30, 2023, to address the issue of Douglas Center Partners LLC failing to file proof of service for the complaint.

### English Summary
The tentative ruling, related to Case Number 23STLC01692, involves Plaintiff Delbert Cannon’s Motion to Compel Defendant Douglas Center Partners LLC’s Answers to Interrogatories. The Plaintiff had filed an action against the Defendants, including Douglas Center Partners LLC, under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The key issue was Douglas Center Partners LLC’s failure to respond to discovery requests despite being served with Special Interrogatories. The Plaintiff attempted to resolve the issue informally before filing the motion. The Court, citing relevant codes and case law, decided to grant the Motion to Compel, ordering Douglas Center Partners LLC to provide verified responses without objections. Additionally, the Court granted monetary sanctions of $500 to the Plaintiff due to Defendant’s misuse of the discovery process. Notably, the Court also struck the Answer filed by Douglas Center Partners LLC on its own motion, citing the entity’s unauthorized practice of law by filing through its managing member without proper legal representation. The Court scheduled an Order to Show Cause regarding the failure to file proof of service for a later date. Overall, the ruling emphasizes the importance of adhering to discovery processes and proper legal representation in court proceedings.
