## English-text Summary:

This tentative ruling is about a case where Delbert Cannon is suing Douglas Center Partners LLC, Hojas Premium Tea House, LLC, and Alma Rosa Ortiz for alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  

The Plaintiff, Delbert Cannon, filed a Motion to Compel, requesting the court to force Douglas Center Partners LLC to answer his Special Interrogatories. No opposition was filed by the defendant. The judge found that Douglas Center Partners LLC failed to respond to the interrogatories and that this constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.  

Therefore, the judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel and orders Douglas Center Partners LLC to provide verified answers to the interrogatories within 10 days. The judge also grants the Plaintiff's request for $500 in monetary sanctions due to the defendant's failure to respond.  

Furthermore, the judge strikes the Answer filed by Douglas Center Partners LLC because it was filed by a non-lawyer, Kathie Hira, who is the Managing Member of the company.  The judge notes that entities must be represented by lawyers in legal proceedings and cannot represent themselves. Finally, the judge sets an Order to Show Cause hearing for November 30, 2023, to address the issue of Douglas Center Partners LLC failing to file proof of service for the complaint.
