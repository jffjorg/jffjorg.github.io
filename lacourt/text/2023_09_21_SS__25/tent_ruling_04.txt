 Case Number:  23STCP01049    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  25  Guita Sassoon v. Steven Kritanovich 23stlc01049ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On February 10, 2023, Plaintiff Guita
Sassoon (“Plaintiff”) brought an action against Defendant Steven Krilanovich[1] (“Defendant”)
for breach of contract and common counts, arising out of Defendant’s alleged
failure to pay rent pursuant to a rental agreement between the parties.
 
On April 26, 2023, Defendant filed
a Declaration of Demurring Party in Support of Automatic Extension.
 
On May 26, 2023, Defendant filed a
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  The
Court sustained the Demurrer with twenty (20) days leave to amend.  (6-29-23 Minute Order.)
 
On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
On August 7, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant Demurrer to the FAC (“Demurrer”).
 
In response, Plaintiff attempted to
file the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”); however, the SAC was rejected
because Plaintiff could not file another amended complaint without leave of
Court.  (8-17-23 Notice of Rejection.)
 
On August 28, 2023, the Court, on
its own motion, continued the hearing on the Demurrer to September 21,
2023.  (8-28-23 Minute Order.)
 
On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Response to Demurrer.  No reply
has been filed.
 
II.             
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is a pleading that may
be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the
complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
430.10.)  There are two types of
demurrers – general demurrers and special demurrers.  (See McKenney v. Purepac
Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
 
General demurrers can be used to
attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e); McKenney,
167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such
demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable;
evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 430.30, 430.70;
Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the
purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material
facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does
not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.
[Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at
318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.). At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.
App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the
complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence."  (Holland v.
Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
Special demurrers can be used to
attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract
is oral or written.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10(f).)  However, special demurrers
are not allowed in limited jurisdiction civil actions and any grounds for
special demurrers must be raised as affirmative defenses in the answer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 92(c).)
 
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure
§ 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file
and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(3).)
 
When a demurrer
is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility
that the defect can be cured by amendment. 
(Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set
of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.”  (Reed v. Norman (1957)
152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the
court will allow leave to amend on at least the first try, unless there is
absolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue.  (See Angie M. v. Superior Court
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of leave to amend constitutes an
abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of
amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the
rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.").)
 
III.           
Discussion
 
A.    
Meet and Confer Requirement
 
Defense
counsel states that on July 21, 2023, he called Plaintiff’s counsel in order to
meet and confer prior to filing the instant Motion.  (Stelnick Decl. ¶ 3.)  He was informed that Plaintiff would be filing
a second amended complaint.  (Ibid.)  As of the date of the Demurrer, a second
amended complaint has not been filed.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 4.)
 
The
Court finds that Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is sufficient to satisfy the
meet and confer requirement.
 
B.    
Plaintiff’s Allegations
 
Plaintiff
has filed a form complaint with the following allegations.  Around March 2020, Plaintiff and Defendant
made an oral agreement whereby Defendant would occupy “units belonging to
Sasoon in the building located at 7062 Hawthorne Ave., Los Angeles, California
90028 for an agreed rental of $3600 per month.” 
(FAC BC-1.)  On or about October
2020, Defendant breached the agreement by “failing to pay rentals then two
months in arrears as promised, and monthly thereafter through March 2021.”  (Ibid. at BC-2.)  Plaintiff performed all obligations pursuant
to the agreement.  (Ibid. at
BC-3.)  Defendant breached the agreement
and as a result, Plaintiff suffered damages in the amount of $25,000 in unpaid
rent.  (Ibid. at BC-4.)  Plaintiff is also entitled to attorney’s fees
by agreement or statute, according to proof. 
(Ibid. at BC-5.)
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff sets forth a claim for common counts. 
Defendant became indebted to Plaintiff “within the last four years (1)
on an open book account for money due (2) because an account was stated in
writing by and between plaintiff and defendant in which it was agreed that
defendant was indebted to plaintiff.”  (FAC
CC-1.)  Defendant also became indebted to
Plaintiff “within the last two years (6) for past occupation of Plaintiff’s
condominium by defendant for defendant’s benefit.”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff alleges that $25,000.00 is the
reasonable value due and unpaid to Plaintiff despite Plaintiff’s demand, “plus
prejudgment interest according to proof from October 2020” and attorney’s fees
by agreement or statute.  (CC-2, CC-3.)
 
C.   
Defendant’s Demurrer
 
Defendant
demurs to the Complaint on the following grounds.
 
First,
the Complaint “is vague, uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible.”  (Dem. pp. 3-5.)  It requests damages in the amount of $25,000,
which is over the jurisdictional limit in a limited civil action.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff also demands attorney’s fees, even
though there is no lease agreement attached to the FAC that provides for
attorney’s fees.  (Ibid.)
 
Second,
it cannot be ascertained from the pleadings whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied in conduct.  (Ibid.
at pp. 3-5.)  There is no indication that
there is a provision allowing for attorney’s fees in the agreement.  (Ibid.)
 
D.   
Plaintiff’s Opposition
 
Plaintiff
opposes Defendant’s Demurrer.  Plaintiff
states that the instant action is for breach of oral contract and common counts
to collect unpaid rent.  (Oppos. p.
1.)  Plaintiff attempted to file a second
amended amendment; however, the pleading was rejected.  (Ibid. at pp. 1-2.)
 
E.    
Analysis
 
First, Defendant demurs to the FAC
on the basis that it is vague, uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible and
fails to allege whether the contract is oral or written.  However, these are special demurrers that are
not permitted in limited jurisdiction actions.
 
Second, Defendant demurs to the FAC
on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the instant action because
Plaintiff seeks damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit of a limited
civil court.  Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 430.10,
a party may demur to a complaint on the basis that the court lacks jurisdiction
over the cause of action alleged in the pleading.  This is a form of general demurrer that is
permitted in limited civil cases.  According to Code of Civil Procedure § 85(a), an action may be brought as a limited
civil case if “[t]he amount in controversy does not exceed twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000). As used in this section, ‘amount in controversy’
means the amount of the demand, or the recovery sought, or the value of the
property, or the amount of the lien, that is in controversy in the action,
exclusive of attorneys’ fees, interest, and costs.”  The Court finds that Plaintiff does not seek
damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit of a limited court, as the
damages sought do not exceed $25,000. 
Thus, this Court has jurisdiction over the matter.
 
The Court also notes that Plaintiff
has previously amended the Complaint.  In
order to file a second amended complaint, Plaintiff must seek leave of Court
pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 473(a) and 576.
 
Based on the reasons discussed
above, the Court OVERRULES Defendant’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.
 
IV.           
Conclusion & Order
 
For the foregoing reason,
 
Defendant Steven Krilanovich’s Demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
