## English Summary:

The Court is considering a petition from Richard and Gary Bairos (Plaintiffs) to compel arbitration with 7174 Melrose Avenue, LLC (Respondent) regarding disputes arising from their lease agreement.  While both parties agree to arbitration, they disagree on the selection of an arbitrator and the venue. 

The Lease Agreement includes an arbitration clause but does not specify a particular venue or arbitrator.  The Plaintiffs prefer JAMS while the Respondent wants to arbitrate before Judge Victor Person. 

The Court finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists and the parties must arbitrate. However, because they cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Court will require both parties to submit a list of potential arbitrators. The Court will then nominate five individuals from that list, and the parties will have five days to jointly select an arbitrator.  If they fail to agree, the Court will appoint one from the nominated list.
