## English Summary:

The Court is considering a petition from Richard and Gary Bairos (Plaintiffs) to compel arbitration with 7174 Melrose Avenue, LLC (Respondent) regarding disputes arising from their lease agreement.  While both parties agree to arbitration, they disagree on the selection of an arbitrator and the venue. 

The Lease Agreement includes an arbitration clause but does not specify a particular venue or arbitrator.  The Plaintiffs prefer JAMS while the Respondent wants to arbitrate before Judge Victor Person. 

The Court finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists and the parties must arbitrate. However, because they cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Court will require both parties to submit a list of potential arbitrators. The Court will then nominate five individuals from that list, and the parties will have five days to jointly select an arbitrator.  If they fail to agree, the Court will appoint one from the nominated list.

**Case Number:** 23STCP01609

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Department:** 25

**Parties:** Richard Bairos, Gary Bairos (Plaintiffs) v. 7174 Melrose Avenue, LLC (Defendant)

**Background:**

* Plaintiffs Richard and Gary Bairos filed a petition on May 11, 2023 to compel arbitration against Defendant 7174 Melrose Avenue, LLC.
* Defendant filed a response on July 13, 2023.
* The hearing was initially set for September 14, 2023 but was continued to September 21, 2023.

**Legal Standard:**

* Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1281.2, the court must grant the petition unless it finds that no written agreement to arbitrate exists, the right to compel arbitration has been waived, grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or litigation is pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting rulings on common issues.
* The initial burden lies with the moving party (Plaintiffs) to demonstrate the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of evidence.

**Discussion:**

* Both parties have entered into a Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease – Net, which includes an Addendum with an AIR CRE Arbitration Agreement.
* The Arbitration Agreement provides that the parties agree to resolve any and all claims arising under the Lease through arbitration with JAMS or AAA.
* Disputes arose in March 2023, and Plaintiffs served a notice to apply for a Court order compelling arbitration.
* Plaintiffs seek to refer the matter to JAMS, while Defendant argues that the parties agreed to arbitrate before Judge Victor Person of ADR Services, Inc.
* The Court finds that a valid arbitration agreement exists, and the right to compel arbitration has not been waived.
* The matter at issue is the selection of a neutral arbitrator, and the parties have not agreed on a method of appointing an arbitrator.

**Order:**

* The Court requests that the parties jointly present a list of potential arbitrators.
* Once the list is presented to the Court, the Court will nominate five persons and the parties will have five days from receipt of notice to jointly select the arbitrator.
* If the parties do not select the arbitrator within five days, the Court will appoint the arbitrator from the list of nominees.
* The hearing on the Petition is continued, and both parties are ordered to file supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed herein at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so will result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.
