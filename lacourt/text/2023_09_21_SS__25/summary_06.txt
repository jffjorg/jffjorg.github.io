The judge has reviewed the petition to compel arbitration and has determined that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties. The judge has also found that the parties have not agreed on a method of appointing a neutral arbitrator. Therefore, the judge has ordered the parties to jointly present a list of potential arbitrators and has scheduled a hearing to continue the matter. The judge has also ordered the parties to file supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed in the ruling.
