**Case Number:** 23STLC01503

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Department:** 25

**Parties:**
- Plaintiffs: Saini Investments LLC (“Saini”), S. Arora Consulting, Inc. (“Arora”)
- Defendants: Mayra A. Martinez (“Mayra”), Victor Martinez (“Victor”), Rodolfo Martinez (“Rodolfo”)

**Summary:**

On March 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Defendants. Defendants Victor and Rodolfo responded to the complaint on May 8, 2023. Plaintiffs filed two motions on August 2, 2023, seeking to deem Defendants Victor and Rodolfo's failure to respond to requests for admission as an admission of the requested facts, and requesting monetary sanctions. No opposition was filed, and the hearing was continued to September 21, 2023.

Under Code of Civil Procedure 2033.280(b), failure to respond to requests for admission allows the requesting party to move for an order deeming the truth of the request. The court must grant the motion unless the responding party serves a proposed response before the hearing. By failing to timely respond, the party waives any objection, including those based on privilege or work product.

The court grants Plaintiffs' motions, deeming the requests for admission admitted by Defendants Victor and Rodolfo. The court also imposes monetary sanctions for the Defendants' failure to respond to the discovery requests. Plaintiff requested $850 in sanctions for each Motion, but the court grants $455 for each Motion and associated filing fees.

**Monetary Sanctions:**
- $455 to be paid by Defendant Victor Martinez
- $455 to be paid by Defendant Rodolfo Martinez

**Order:**

The court grants Plaintiffs' motions, deems the requests for admission admitted by Defendants Victor and Rodolfo, and imposes monetary sanctions on both Defendants. The Defendants must pay the sanctions within thirty (30) days of notice of the court's order.
