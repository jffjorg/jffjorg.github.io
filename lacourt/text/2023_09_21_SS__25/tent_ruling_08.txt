 Case Number:  23STLC01692    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  25  Delbert Cannon v. Douglas Center Partners LLC, et  al. 23stlc01692ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff Delbert  Cannon (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Douglas Center Partners  LLC (“Douglas Center”), Hojas Premium Tea House, LLC (“Hojas”), Alma Rosa Ortiz  aka Alma R. Ortiz aka Alma Ortiz (“Ortiz”) (collectively “Defendants”) for an  alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.   Defendant Douglas Center, in  propria persona, filed an Answer to the Complaint on April 21, 2023.  Defendant Ortiz filed an Answer on May 16,  2023.   On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Defendant  Douglas Center Partners LLC’s Answers to Interrogatories (“Motion”).  No opposition has been filed.   II.               Legal  Standard & Discussion   A.     Special Interrogatories   A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days  after service.  (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2030.260(a).)  If a party to whom  interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting  party may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).)  Once compelled to respond, the party waives  the right to make any objections, including ones based on privilege or  work-product protection.  (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290(a).)  There is no  time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the  cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020(a),  2030.290.)  No meet and confer efforts  are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.  Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   Plaintiff  moves to compel Defendant Douglas Partners to provide verified answers to Special  Interrogatories (Set One).  (Mot. p. 1.)  Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions in  the amount of $500.  (Ibid.)   On June 15,  2023, Plaintiff served Defendant Douglas Partners with Special Interrogatories,  Set One.  (Mehrban Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.)  Plaintiff has not received verified responses  to the discovery request.  (Ibid.  at ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel sent a  follow-up email to defense counsel on July 27, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Here, Plaintiff has demonstrated that he has propounded special  interrogatories on Defendant and Defendant has not provided any responses.  Although Plaintiff was not obligated to meet  and confer with Defendant, he has attempted to resolve the issue informally.   For this reason, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to  Compel Douglas Center Partners LLC’s Answers to Interrogatories.   B.      Sanctions   Code of Civil Procedure §  2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary  sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the  reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of  that conduct.  Misuse of discovery  includes “failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d)).   Furthermore, § 2030.290 authorizes the  Court to impose monetary sanctions if a party fails to respond to  interrogatories.  Sanctions are  calculated based on “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred  by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Ibid. § 2023.030(a)).   Plaintiff requests $500 in  sanctions for Defendant Douglas Center Partners LLC’s  failure to respond to the instant discovery request.  (Mehrban Decl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel states that his hourly  rate is $500.00 per hour, and he has “spent and will spend a cumulative total  of no less than one hour in communicating with defense counsel regarding this  motion, preparing the motion, and appearing at the hearing on the motion.”  (Ibid.)   Given that the Court grants  Plaintiff’s Motion, Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions.  Moreover, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s  request is reasonable.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request  for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $500.   C.     Other Orders   The Court makes the following  additional orders.   The Court, on its own motion,  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 436 strikes the Answer filed by Defendant Douglas Center  Partners LLC.   Since the passage of the State Bar Act in  1927, persons may represent their own interests in legal proceedings, but may  not represent the interests of another unless they are active members of the  State Bar. [Citation.]”  (Hansen v.  Hansen (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 618, 621.) An entity must be represented by a  lawyer in legal proceedings and may not represent itself (either directly or  through a non-lawyer agent) in litigation, as such an act would be the  unauthorized practice of law.  (See  e.g. Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002)  99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101) (corporation); Albion River Watershed Protection  Ass’n v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1993) 20 Cal. App.  4th 34, 37 (unincorporated association); Aulisio v. Bancroft (2014)  230¿Cal.¿App.¿4th 1518, 1519-20 (trustee for trust).)  Here, Douglas Center filed its Answer through  its Managing Member Kathie Hira.  There  is no indication that Hira is licensed to practice law in the State of  California.  Accordingly, the Court, on  its own motion, strikes the Answer filed by Douglas Center.   Moreover, the Court sets Order to Show  Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service for November 30, 2023 at 9:30 a.m., in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.   III.             Conclusion  & Order   For the foregoing reasons:   The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Delbert Cannon’s Motion to  Compel Douglas Center Partners LLC’s Answers to Interrogatories.  Defendant Douglas Center Partners LLC is  ordered to submit verified responses, without objections, within ten (10) days  of notice of the Court’s Order.   The Court also GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary  sanctions in the amount of $500, to be paid within thirty (30) days of notice  of the Court’s Order.   The Court makes the following  additional orders.   The Court, on its own motion,  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 436, STRIKES the Answer filed by Defendant Douglas Center  Partners LLC.   Moreover, the Court sets Order to Show  Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service of Complaint for November 30, 2023 at  9:30 a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.   Moving party is ordered to  give notice.
