II.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
A
judgment creditor is entitled to recover the reasonable and necessary costs
incurred in enforcing a judgment.  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 685.040.)  Costs authorized
by § 685.040 may be claimed by filing a memorandum of costs or via noticed
motion before the judgment is satisfied in full but not later than two years
after the costs have been incurred. 
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 685.070(b), 685.080(a).) Allowed costs include, but
are not limited to, those costs outlined in § 685.070. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 685.080(a).)  The notice of motion
must describe the costs claimed, must state their amount, and must be supported
by “an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating that to the
person’s best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, and reasonable and
necessary, and have not been satisfied.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080(b).) 
The motion must be served personally or by mail. (Ibid.)  The court must make an order allowing or
disallowing the costs to the extent justified under the circumstances of that
particular case. (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080(c).)
 
Assignee
Sullivan seeks to recover costs of $265.00 incurred in enforcing the Judgment.  (7-11-23 Sullivan Decl. ¶ 1.)  The costs sought are broken down as follows
(1) $65 in service fees to hire a registered process server in October 28,
2022, to serve Debtor with four Notices of Renewal of Judgment, dated November
9, 1995, November 15, 2005, November 20, 2012, and January 22, 2019; (2) $50 to
serve Debtor with Notice of Court’s November 10, 2022, Ruling, and Notice of
Prevailing Party’s Proposed Order, dated November 12, 2022; (3) $50 service fee
for serving Debtor with February 2023, Memorandum of Costs; (5) $50 fee to
serve Debtor with June 2023 Memorandum of Costs; and (6) $50 service fee for serving
the instant Motion.  (7-11-23 Sullivan
Decl. pp. 4-6; Tables 1-3.)
 
The
Motion is timely and is supported by an affidavit from Assignee Sullivan
explaining the basis for the costs incurred and attesting that the costs
incurred are reasonable and necessary and have not been satisfied.  (7-11-23 Sullivan Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6-7.)
 
Having
reviewed the costs sought, the Court finds that these costs are reasonable and
necessary to enforce the Judgment against Judgment Debtor.  Thus, Assignee Sullivan’s Motion is GRANTED in
the amount of $265.
