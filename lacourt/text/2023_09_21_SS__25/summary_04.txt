Summary:
The judge issues a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by a tenant (Plaintiff) against a landlord (Defendant) for breach of contract and common counts, arising from the Defendant's failure to pay rent. The Plaintiff previously filed an amended complaint, and the Defendant demurred, arguing that the complaint is vague, uncertain, and unintelligible, and that the court lacks jurisdiction over the cause of action due to the amount of damages sought exceeding the jurisdictional limit of a limited civil court. The judge finds that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied and that the court has jurisdiction over the matter. The judge OVERRULES the Defendant's Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.
