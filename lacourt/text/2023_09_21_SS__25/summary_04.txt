English text:
This tentative ruling is for the case 23STCP01049, which will have a hearing on September 21, 2023 in Dept 25. The case involves Plaintiff Guita Sassoon suing Defendant Steven Krilanovich for breach of contract and common counts, related to Defendant's alleged failure to pay rent. The Plaintiff has previously filed a First Amended Complaint, and the Defendant has now filed a Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff had attempted to file a Second Amended Complaint, but it was rejected.

The Court finds that the Defendant's counsel's declaration is sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement. The Plaintiff's complaint alleges that the Plaintiff and Defendant made an oral agreement for the Defendant to occupy a unit for an agreed rental of $3600 per month, and that the Defendant breached the agreement by failing to pay rent. The Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $25,000 in unpaid rent, as well as attorney's fees.

The Defendant's Demurrer argues that the complaint is vague, uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible, and that it is unclear whether the contract is written or oral. These are special demurrers, which are not allowed in limited jurisdiction actions. The Defendant also argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction because the Plaintiff seeks damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit of a limited civil court. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff does not seek damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit, as the damages do not exceed $25,000. Therefore, the Court has jurisdiction over the matter.

Based on these reasons, the Court overrules the Defendant's Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. The moving party is ordered to give notice.

This case involves a dispute over unpaid rent.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by defendant Steven Kritanovich to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff Guita Sassoon. The plaintiff sought damages for breach of contract and common counts arising from the defendant's alleged failure to pay rent. The defendant argued that the complaint was vague, uncertain, and ambiguous, and failed to allege whether the contract was oral or written.

The court found that the defendant's demurrer was based on special demurrers, which are not permitted in limited jurisdiction actions. The court also determined that the plaintiff's complaint did not seek damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit of a limited civil court, and therefore the court had jurisdiction over the matter.

The court noted that the plaintiff had previously amended the complaint and must seek leave of court to file a second amended complaint. The court overruled the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint and granted the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.

**Case Number:** 23STCP01049

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Dept:** 25

**Parties:** Guita Sassoon (Plaintiff) vs. Steven Krilanovich (Defendant)

**Background:**

- Plaintiff Guita Sassoon sued Defendant Steven Krilanovich for breach of contract and common counts regarding unpaid rent.
- Defendant filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, which was sustained with leave to amend.
- Plaintiff's second amended complaint was rejected, and Defendant filed a meet and confer declaration.

**Legal Standard:**

- A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of factual allegations in a complaint.
- General demurrers challenge defects on the face of the pleading or judicially noticeable matters; special demurrers challenge uncertainty, ambiguity, or unintelligibility.
- Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 requires a meet and confer before filing a demurrer.

**Discussion:**

- Defendant met the meet and confer requirement.
- Plaintiff's allegations include an oral agreement for $3600 monthly rent, Defendant's breach, Plaintiff's performance, and $25,000 in unpaid rent.
- Defendant demurs on vagueness, exceeding jurisdictional limits, and failure to allege contract type; only the jurisdictional limit demurrer is valid in limited civil cases.
- Plaintiff does not seek damages over the $25,000 jurisdictional limit, so this Court has jurisdiction.
- Plaintiff must seek leave of Court to file a second amended complaint.

**Order:**

- Defendant Steven Krilanovich's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
- Moving party is ordered to give notice.
