 Case Number:  21STLC04630    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  25  Nerfitte  Wanzo v. Dameon Powell 21stlc04630ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On June 21, 2021, Plaintiff Nerfitte  Wanzo (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Dameon Powell  (“Defendant”) for motor vehicle and general negligence arising out of an  alleged motor vehicle accident on June 1, 2019.   On October 27, 2021, pursuant to  Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered default against Defendant.  (10-27-21 Request for Entry of Default.)  On February 15, 2023, the Court granted  Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default and vacated the default.  (2-15-23 Minute Order.)  Defendant filed an Answer on the same day.   On November 17, 2021, Plaintiff  filed a Notice of Related Case.   On May 8, 2023, the Court denied  Counsel Philip Paul DeLuca’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel without  prejudice.  (5-8-23 Minute Order.)   On May 10, 2023, Counsel DeLuca  filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel as to Plaintiff Nerfitte  Wanzo (“Motion”).  No opposition was  filed.   On July 18, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Motion to allow Counsel an opportunity to file  supplemental papers showing that Plaintiff was properly served with the moving  papers.  (7-18-23 Minute Order.)  On July 20, 2023, Counsel filed supplemental  papers.  On August 21, 2023, the Court noted  that Counsel had not presented sufficient evidence that Plaintiff was properly  served with the moving papers and continued the hearing one final time.  (8-21-23 Minute Order.)  On August 22, 2023, Counsel filed another  supplemental declaration.   II.               Legal Standard   Code of Civil Procedure § 284 states that “the attorney in  an action…may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final  determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both client and attorney…;  (2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or  attorney, after notice from one to the other.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 284; CRC 3.1362.)  The withdrawal request may be denied if it  would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's  discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably.  (See Mandell v. Superior (1977) 67  Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161,  1173.)   In making a motion to be relieved as counsel, the attorney  must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.  The motion must be made using mandatory forms:   1.     Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel  directed to the client – (MC-051); 2.     Declaration “stating in general terms and without  compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship” the  reasons that the motion was brought (MC-052); 3.     Proposed Order (MC-053).   (Ibid.)  The  forms must be timely filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the  case.  (Ibid.)  If these documents are served on the client by  mail, there must be a declaration stating either that the address where client  was served is “the current residence or business address of the client” or “the  last known residence or business address of the client and the attorney has  been unable to locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to  do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d)(1).)   III.             Discussion   Counsel Philip Paul DeLuca, Esq.  (“DeLuca”) moves to be relieved as counsel as to Plaintiff Nerfitte Wanzo.  Counsel properly filed a Notice of Motion and  Motion (MC-051).  Counsel also filed a  Declaration in Support of the Motion (MC-052) stating that “[t]here has been a  breakdown in the attorney/client relationship that is irreconcilable  necessitating that counsel be relieved, as it presents a conflict of interest  were the representation to continue.”   (MC-052 ¶ 2.)  Counsel has also  filed a Proposed Order, Form MC-053.   Defendant has been properly served  with the moving papers.  (MC-351 pp. 5-6;  MC-352 pp. 3-4; MC-053 pp. 3-4.)   On July 18, 2023, the Court noted  the following.  (7-18-23 Minute Order.)   On Form MC-052, Counsel indicates  that Plaintiff Wanzo has been served with the moving papers by mail at her last  known address, confirmed within the past 30 days “by other means.”  (MC-052 ¶ 3.)   Counsel explains that he has requested Plaintiff’s mailing address;  however, Plaintiff has not responded.  (Ibid.  at ¶ 3b(1)(d).)  Thus, Plaintiff has been  served by certified mail.  (Ibid.)   On June 29, 2023, Counsel submitted  the Declaration of Greg Lowther, a paralegal at his firm, detailing his  attempts to locate and serve Plaintiff.  Mr.  Lowther explains that he sent Plaintiff an email on May 8, 2023, asking her to  confirm her last known address; Plaintiff did not respond.  (Lowther Decl. ¶ 1, Ex. 1.)  On May 10, 2023, he emailed Plaintiff the  moving papers, but she did not respond.   (Ibid. at ¶ 2, Ex. 2.)  On the  same day, Mr. Lowther sent Plaintiff the moving papers by certified U.S. mail  to her last known address (661 N. Harbor Blvd., Apt. 128, San Pedro, CA 90731)  and a possible new mailing address he retrieved from a Google.com search (2036  W. Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90062); Plaintiff did not  respond.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4, Ex.  3.)  On May 16, 2023, the mail sent to  the San Pedro address was returned to sender, indicating that Plaintiff had  moved, and listing the following new address: 7426 Del Rio, Vis., Yucca Valley,  CA 92284-3610.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5, Ex.  4.)  Mr. Lowther emailed Plaintiff  requesting that she confirm her new Yuca Valley address; however, she did not  respond to his email.  (Ibid. at ¶  6, Ex. 5.)  Mr. Lowther forwarded the  moving papers to JPL Attorney Service in order to personally serve Plaintiff at  her Yuca Valley address.  (Ibid.  at ¶ 7, Ex. 6.)  The process server  attempted to serve Plaintiff on May 20, 26, and 30, and June 2 and 5,  2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8, Ex. 7.)  On June 8, 2023, the process server spoke to  Plaintiff’s father at the Yuca Valley address, who stated that Plaintiff was at  work and was not around “much.”  (Ibid.)  The process server also left a voicemail  message after attempting to contact Plaintiff by phone, but did not receive a  response.  (Ibid.)  Finally, on June 29, 2023, Mr. Lowther sent  the moving papers to Plaintiff via certified U.S. mail to 7426 Del Rio Vi.,  Yucca Valley, CA 92284-3610, as well as her email address; Plaintiff has not  responded.  (Ibid. at ¶ 9, Ex. 8.) Mr. Lowther has submitted the  Summary of Service provided by JPL Process Service.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8, Ex. 7.)  The Summary lists the attempts made by the  process server to personally serve Plaintiff.   (Ibid.)  The last entry, on  June 8, 2023, states that the process server spoke to Plaintiff’s father, who  explained that Plaintiff was at work.  (Ibid.)  However, this entry also states “PLEASE NOTE  DEL RIO VISTA IS NO LONGER, THE NEW ADDRESS IS 7419 PALM AVE.”  (Ibid.)  Mr. Lowther does not address this new address  and states that he served Plaintiff at 7426 Del Rio Vi., Yucca Valley, CA  92284-3610.  Thus, the Court noted that  it could not discern whether Plaintiff had been properly served and continued  the hearing to allow Counsel an opportunity to file supplemental papers explaining  why Plaintiff was not served at the last address listed on the process server’s  Summary of Service.  (7-18-23 Minute  Order.)               On July 20,  2023, Counsel filed the Declaration of Kayla Waymire.  Waymire explains that she is an owner of  Kayway Attorney Service and the process server who attempted to serve  Plaintiff.  (Waymire Decl. ¶ 1.)  She states that she was not able to serve  Plaintiff at the 7426 Del Rio Vis., Yuca Valley, CA 92284-3610 address.  (Ibid.)  The address has changed and is now 7419 Palm  Avenue, Yucca Valley, CA 92284, located “in a newer gated community  development.”  (Ibid. at ¶ 2.)   After several attempts, Waymire was able  to enter the gated community and speak to Plaintiff’s father who told her that  Plaintiff is not around much and refused to accept the documents.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 3-4.)  On August 21, 2023, the Court noted that  Counsel did not present sufficient evidence showing that the 7426 Del Rio Vis.  And 7419 Palm Avenue addresses belong to the same location.  (8-21-23 Minute Order.)  Thus, the Court was not convinced that  Plaintiff had been properly served with the moving papers and continued the  hearing on the Motion one final time.  (Ibid.)   On August 22, 2023, Counsel filed a  supplemental declaration of Greg Lowther, a paralegal at his firm.  Mr. Lowther explains that the 7426 Del Rio  Vis. Address is owned by Plaintiff’s father Donald Wanzo and is part of a gated  community called Desert Visa Community, which is listed under the address 7419  Palm Avenue, Yucca Valley, 92284.  (Supp.  Lowther Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. 3-4.)  This is  why Ms. Waymire refers to these addresses interchangeably.  (Ibid.)  Mr. Lowther also states that despite  Counsel’s and his firm’s best attempts to locate Plaintiff, they have been  unable to confirm contact with Ms. Wanzo.   (Ibid.)   The Court finds that Plaintiff’s  Counsel Philip Paul DeLuca, Esq. has shown that he has attempted to contact and  serve Plaintiff through various means and has not been successful.  The Court finds Counsel’s efforts to be  sufficient.   Accordingly, Counsel Philip  Paul DeLuca’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel as to Plaintiff Nerfitte Wanzo  is GRANTED.     IV.             Conclusion & Order   For the foregoing reasons,   Counsel Philip  Paul DeLuca’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel as to Plaintiff Nerfitte Wanzo  is GRANTED, and the Order will be signed at the hearing.  “After the order is signed, a copy of the  signed order must be served on the client and on all parties that have appeared  in the case.”  (Cal.¿Rules of Court, rule  3.1362(e).)  The Order on this Motion  will not be effective “until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on  the client has been filed with the court.” (Ibid.)Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for December 5, 2023 at 9:30 a.m., in Departement 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
