And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings will be continued to October 31, 2023. The defendant is ordered to file supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed in the ruling at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied. The judge notes that the defendant's notice of motion was defective and must be corrected. The judge has not yet made a final decision on the motion to compel arbitration, but will consider the issues discussed in the ruling when making a final determination.
