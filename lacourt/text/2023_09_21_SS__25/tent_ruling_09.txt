 Case Number:  23STLC03476    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  25  NYC Construction, Inc. v. Alumacovers of California,  Inc. 23stlc03476ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff NYC Constructions, Inc. dba  Teamwork Remodeling Group (“NYC Construction”) filed an action against Defendant  Alumacovers of California, Inc. (“Alumacovers”) for (1) breach of contract, (2)  California Commercial Code § 2201, (3) Business and Professions Code §  17538(D), (4) Business and Professions Code § 7159, and (5) unjust enrichment.               On June 30, 2023, Defendant filed  the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration of Complaint and Stay Proceedings  (“Motion”).  Plaintiff filed an  Opposition on July 10, 2023, and Defendant filed a Reply on August 21, 2023.               On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff  filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).   II.               Legal  Standard   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  §1281.2, generally, on a petition to compel arbitration, the court must grant the  petition unless it finds either (1) no written agreement to arbitrate exists;  (2) the right to compel arbitration has been waived; (3) grounds exist for  revocation of the agreement; or (4) litigation is pending that may render the  arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting¿rulings on common issues.   When seeking to compel arbitration, the  initial burden lies with the moving party to demonstrate the existence of a  valid arbitration agreement by prepondernace of evidence.  (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group (2014)  232 Cal.App.4th 836, 841-42; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021), 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164-65.)  It is sufficient for the moving  party to produce a copy of the arbitration agreement or set forth the  agreement’s provisions.  (Gamboa,  72 Cal.App.5th at 165.)  The  burden then shifts to the opposing party to prove by a preponderance of  evidence any defense to enforcement of the contract or the arbitration clause.  (Ruiz, 232 Cal.App.4th at 842; Gamboa,  72 Cal.App.5th at 165.)  Subsequently,  the moving party must establish with the preponderance of admissible evidence a  valid arbitration agreement between the parties.  (Ibid.)  The trial court then weighs all the evidence  submitted and uses its discretion to make a final determination.  (Ibid.)  “California law, ‘like [federal law], reflects  a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial  scrutiny of waiver claims.’”  (Wagner Const. Co. v. Pacific Mechanical  Corp. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 19, 31.)   If the court orders arbitration, then the court shall  stay the action until arbitration is completed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)   III.             Discussion   Defendant  seeks to a Court order compelling Defendant to arbitrate a dispute arising out  of a written agreement entered into between Plaintiff and Defendant.  (Pet. pp. 3-4.)  Defendant also requests that the Court stay  the proceedings pending arbitration.  (Ibid.) As a  preliminary matter, the Court notes that Defendant has filed a defective Notice  of Motion that lists the wrong courthouse and judge presiding over the  matter.  Accordingly, the Court continues  the hearing on the Motion and orders Defendant to correct the Notice, listing  the Honorable Thomas J. Griego as the judge presiding over the hearing in Department  25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, located at 312 N. Spring Street, Los  Angeles, CA 90012.  IV.             Conclusion   For the reasons discussed above,   The hearing on the Motion to Compel  Arbitration and Stay Proceedings, filed by Defendant Alumacovers of California,  Inc., is CONTINUED to October 31, 2023 at  10:30 a.m., in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.  Defendant is ordered to file supplemental papers addressing the issues  discussed herein at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing.  Failure to do so  will result in the Motion being placed off calendar or denied.   Moving party is ordered to  give notice.
