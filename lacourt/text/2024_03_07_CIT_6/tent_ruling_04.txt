 Case Number:  23PSCV02810    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Tricia Liu’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Louie Angel David Feria 
TENTATIVE RULING           
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice to Plaintiff
seeking to recover damages in a separate civil action.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an unlawful detainer action. On September 14, 2023, plaintiff Tricia Liu
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Louie Angel David Feria
(Defendant) for unlawful detainer. On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff obtained a
default judgment for possession. On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request
for Court default judgment seeking monetary damages.         
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $60,247,
comprised of $45,667 in holdover damages and $14,580 for repair costs. The
Court finds multiple problems with Plaintiff’s request for entry of court default
judgment. First, Plaintiff did not submit a proposed form of judgment or a
memorandum of costs and disbursements. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,
subds. (a)(4), (a)(6).) Second, Plaintiff’s declaration references a written
lease agreement between the parties, but no copy of the lease agreement is
attached to Plaintiff’s declaration or the complaint. (See Liu Decl., ¶ 4; see
generally, Compl; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(8)
[required documents for default judgment packages include “[e]xhibits as
necessary”].) 
Third,
the purported Notice(s) to Pay Rent or Quit do not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1161(2) in that it does not state the name, telephone number, and address of the person to whom the
rent payment shall be made, and, if payment may be made personally, the usual
days and hours that person will be available to receive the payment. (See
Compl., Exs. EE-1 and EE-2; Civ. Proc. Code § 1161(2).) Moreover,
the Complaint alleges that the Notice period expired on April 8, 2023 and that
the Notice was personally served on April 8, 2023, and a copy posted on the
premises and also left with Louie Angel David Feria on April 7, 2023 and April
10, 2023. (Compl., ¶¶ 9.b., 10.a.), but the Certificate of Service only indicates
that the Notice was mailed on April 7, 2023, which alone is not proper service
under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162(b). (See Compl., ¶ 9.b.(1) and Ex.
EE-1; see also Civ. Proc. Code § 1162(b)(1)-(3).) Further, the Declaration
states that the Notice expired on August 6, 2023 and was served by posting and
mailing on August 3, 2023. (Liu Decl.,  ¶¶
9, 7.) However, the Proof of Service, signed on February 5, 2024, shows only
that the Notice was mailed on August 3, 2023, which alone is not proper
service. (Liu Decl., Ex. 8b; see also Civ. Proc. Code § 1162(b)(1)-(3).) 
Fourth, Plaintiff’s
damage calculations do not add up. Plaintiff calculates holdover damages in the
amount of $45,667 beginning from April 1, 2023 through January 10, 2024. (Liu
Decl., ¶ 12.) However, the second notice to pay or quit that Plaintiff purportedly
served on Defendant indicates that it covers $16,000 for the period between
April 1, 2023 and July 25, 2023. (Liu Decl., Ex. EE-2.) Thus, the $16,000 is
past due rent, not holdover damages. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1161, subd. (2); ¶
8:58.1, B. Unlawful Detainer Complaint, Cal. Prac. Guide Landlord-Tenant
Ch. 8-B [“The amount of ‘rent’ recoverable is limited to rent accruing from the
tenant’s last payment… through the current period covered by the three-day
notice.”]) However, the $16,000 in past due rent also conflicts with the Eviction
Notice served on April 7, 2023 and paragraph 12 of the complaint which says the
amount of rent due at the time the notice to pay rent or quit was served was
$1,333. (See Compl., ¶ 12 and Ex. EE-1; Liu Decl., Ex. EE-2.) 
Fifth, without a copy of the
written lease agreement, the Court is unable to confirm whether the rental rate
Plaintiff claims is correct. Plaintiff also inconsistently claims that the fair
value of the rental premises is $133 per day in the complaint, (Compl., ¶ 13),
but then claims in the declaration that it is $160.23 per day, (Liu Decl., 10.)[1] Additionally, Plaintiff claims the notice of termination somehow constituted a
notice of future rent increase beginning May 1, 2023. (Liu Decl., Ex. 5d.) 
Finally, the $14,580 Plaintiff seeks in
repair costs is beyond the scope of an unlawful detainer action. (See Liu
Decl., Ex. 15a, subd. (5); Civ. Code, § 1952, subd. (b); ¶ 8:87, B. Unlawful
Detainer Complaint, Cal. Prac. Guide Landlord-Tenant Ch. 8-B [landlord relief
limited to judgment awarding possession, forfeiture of the lease, unpaid rent,
and holdover damages].) 
CONCLUSION 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
has not established that she has satisfied the requirements to prove a cause of
action for unlawful detainer and that she is entitled to the damages requested.
Accordingly, the request for entry of a Court default judgment for damages is
DENIED without prejudice to Plaintiff seeking to recover damages in a separate
civil action.
