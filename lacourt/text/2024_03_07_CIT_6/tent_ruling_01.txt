NAME:  Pedro
Gonzalez v. General Motors, LLC 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of $45,109.50. The issue of costs will
be addressed at the hearing Defendant’s motion to tax costs on April 22, 2024. 
              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a lemon law case. On February 9, 2024, plaintiff Pedro
Gonzalez (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant)
and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for violation of subdivision
(d) of Civil Code section 1793.2, violation of subdivision (b) of Civil Code
section 1793.2, violation of subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2,
Civil Code section 1791.2, breach of express written warranty, and breach of
the implied warranty of merchantability. 
On February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorneys’ fees
and costs. On February 22, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On February 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
“The
following items are allowable as costs under Section 1032:… (10) Attorney's fees, when authorized by any of the
following: (A) Contract. (B) Statute. (C) Law.” (Civil Code, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).) “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer
shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to
the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.” (Id., § 1794, subd. (d).) 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a
touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney… involved in the
presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.
[Citation.] The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002)
99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) 
DISCUSSION 
Summary of Arguments 
Plaintiff seeks to recover $79,025.53 in attorney’s fees and costs
from Defendant, comprised of $61,995.50 in attorney’s fees, $11,842.53 in
costs, additional attorney’s fees in the amount of $2,490.00 incurred in
connection with this motion, and attorney’s fees in the amount of $2,697.50 anticipated
to be incurred in connection with Defendant’s motion to tax costs. Plaintiff
contends that the motion is timely per Rule 3.1702 of the California Rules of
Court, and that the parties stipulated Plaintiff is the prevailing party here,
thus entitling Plaintiff to an award of attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses. 
Plaintiff contends the lodestar fees are reasonable, based on the
hourly rates for Plaintiff’s counsel, ranging from $400.00 to $515.00 an hour
for attorneys, citing various court decisions throughout Los Angeles County and
Orange County, plus a federal district court decision. Plaintiff then contends
the hours incurred are reasonable in light of the amount of work required for
this case, due to Defendant’s denial of liability and obstruction and delay
tactics in connection with discovery matters and Defendant’s refusal to pay
fair value for this case until trial approached. Plaintiff further contends the
amount of attorney’s fees and costs sought here is consistent with fee awards
in other lemon law cases. Plaintiff argues that the paralegal fees are
recoverable as attorney’s fees, and that the hourly billing rate for
Plaintiff’s counsel’s paralegals ranged from $175.00 to $225.00 an hour.
Plaintiff also notes that Plaintiff’s counsel took this case on a contingency
basis. 
In opposition, Defendant does not dispute the applicability of the
lodestar method or contend that recoverable fees are limited in proportion to
Plaintiff’s recovery here. Defendant instead disputes various fees claimed by
Plaintiff as being excessive given the duplicative nature of these types of
lawsuit and the parties’ regular reliance on templates in handling such
lawsuits, citing Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424. Defendant
also contends more than one-fifth of Plaintiff’s counsel’s costs are not
properly compensable. 
In reply, Plaintiff contends Defendant’s opposition is based on
the flawed premise that Plaintiff is not entitled to recover reasonably
incurred litigation costs because this is a straightforward breach-of-warranty
case. Plaintiff contends Defendant misconstrues Hensley, which only held
that billing need only describe the general nature of the general subject of
the expenditure. Plaintiff argues Defendant takes no issue with ambiguity or
vagueness concerning Plaintiff’s billing entries, but rather only argues that
Plaintiff expended time on necessary tasks, or that the time spent on specific
tasks was not reasonable. Plaintiff contends all of these hours were incurred
because Defendant refused to honor its obligations under the warranty, which
necessitated extensive discovery and other work to prepare this case for trial. 
Plaintiff further contends Defendant’s arguments are based on
conclusory opinions and conjecture, and that Plaintiff is entitled to a
presumption of reasonableness since Plaintiff submitted itemized fee bills and
declarations attesting to their accuracy. Plaintiff also argues that
Defendant’s opposition relies on questionable legal authority, and reiterates
that paralegal fees are recoverable as attorney fees. 
Analysis           
            The Court finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to attorney’s fees, but not necessarily in the amount requested. The
Court first notes that Defendant admits Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees. (Opp., 11:20-21.) The Court also notes that Defendant does not
dispute the hourly rates of Plaintiff’s counsel, which the Court construes as a
tacit admission that those rates are reasonable. (See Holden
v. City of San Diego (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C.
Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.
Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) The Court also agrees with Plaintiff
that paralegal fees can be recovered as attorney’s fees. (Sundance v.
Municipal Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 268, 274.) However, clerical or
secretarial tasks performed by paralegals or attorneys cannot be recovered. (Missouri v.
Jenkins (1989) 491 U.S. 274, 288, fn. 10.) 
With respect to Hensley, the Court finds that Defendant
merely cites to it for the unremarkable proposition that a prevailing party may
not recover attorney’s fees against the losing party where the fees billed to
the prevailing party were improper from the outset. (See Hensley, supra, 461
U.S. at p. 434.) This is already an issue that the Court considers when
reviewing a motion for attorney’s fees, so its citation does not add anything
new to the Court’s analysis. The Court otherwise agrees with Plaintiff that the
cases of Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor Am. (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, Morris
v. Hundai Motor Am. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, and Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of
N.Am., LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240 are not dispositive here. The Court of
Appeal in Glaviano v. Sacramento Unified School Dist. (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 744, 755-756 noted that Nightingale stated its holding did
not apply to contingency-fee agreements, and that it was called into question
by subsequent California Supreme Court precedent. Also, both Morris and Mikhaeilpoor
involved issues of overstaffing, which is not an issue here. (See Morris,
supra, 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38; Mikhaeilpoor, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th
240, 256.) 
            The Court does note, however, that Plaintiff’s reply did
not directly address the specific billing entries discussed in Defendant’s
opposition. While Plaintiff correctly contends that a verified fee bill is
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were
reasonable, (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682), it
overlooks the declaration from Defendant’s counsel, Xylon Quezada, which notes
that Plaintiff’s counsel’s work is dedicated to lemon law cases and is
comprised of substantially similar issues between each case, (Quezada Decl., ¶
18). The Court finds this sufficiently persuasive evidence that the work
expended by Plaintiff’s counsel on matters such as discovery can be routinized to
minimize costs and expenses. 
            As for the specific entries Defendant disputes, the Court
finds the following entries subject to reduction, as the Court is persuaded
that such matters include clerical/secretarial tasks, routine matters addressed
in lemon law cases that can be performed in lesser time than for which
Plaintiff seeks recovery, or duplicative entries.

o  
(reduced by 1.9 hours,
multiplied by Ms. Gonzalez’s $415.00 hourly rate = $788.50) 
This leads to a total reduction in attorney’s fees by $21,036.00
(3.7 hours, multiplied by Ms. Astorga’s $175.00 hourly rate; 49 hours,
multiplied by Ms. Gonzalez’s $400.00 hourly rate; 1.9 hours, multiplied by Ms.
Gonzalez’s $415.00 hourly rate.) The Court otherwise finds Defendant’s
arguments regarding status updates throughout three years of litigation to be
unavailing and unsupported by any references to legal authority. 4.1 hours’
worth of status updates over a span of three years is not an unreasonable
amount of fees to incur in keeping a client adequately apprised of litigation. The
Court further finds 5 hours each to be reasonable for Plaintiff’s anticipated fees
for this fee motion and the motion to tax costs. 
As for the $11,842.53 in costs, the Court declines to
address that issue at this time, given Defendant’s pending motion to tax costs
set for hearing on April 22, 2024. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of $45,109.50, comprised of $40,959.50
($61,995.50 - $21,036.00) in incurred attorney’s fees, $2075.00 in additional
attorney’s fees in connection with this motion, and $2075.00 in attorney’s fees
anticipated to be incurred in connection with Defendant’s motion to tax costs. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of $45,109.50. The issue of costs will
be addressed at the hearing on Defendant’s motion to tax costs on April 22,
2024. 
              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
