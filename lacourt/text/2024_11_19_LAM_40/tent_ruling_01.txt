I.      
BACKGROUND
      Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant issued a written warranty in connection with Plaintiff’s
purchase of a 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan. The vehicle developed defects that
Defendant could not repair and did not repurchase or replace the vehicle.
Plaintiff alleges claims for violations under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (“SBA”). 
II.    
ARGUMENTS
      Plaintiff
served all the discovery at issue on November 17, 2023. Defendant failed to
serve verified responses by December 22, 2023. Plaintiff attempted to meet and
confer with Defendant failed to respond or serve verified responses. 
      Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has not suffered any prejudice from the delayed responses
to all discovery at issue October 3, 2024. The “oversight” was due to counsel’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Imposition of sanctions
are not warranted. 
      In
reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not shown evidence of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Defendant cannot show excusable
neglect because the responses to form interrogatories were verified on June 17,
2024, but Defendant served them October 3, 2024. 
III.   
DISCUSSION
      Where a
party fails to timely respond to interrogatories and a document request, the
court has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290(b),
§2031.300(b).). Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290(a), § 2031.300(a).) The parties do not dispute that Defendant
has since served verified responses without objections to the form and special
interrogatories and document request, albeit nearly one year after Plaintiff
served the requests.  Therefore, an order
compelling responses is no longer necessary. 
      Where a
party fails to respond to requests for admission, the court can deem the
requests admitted against the non-responding party unless it finds that the
non-responding party has subsequently served, before the hearing, a proposed
response to the requests that substantially complies with statutory
requirements. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).) Imposition of sanctions is mandatory
where a party’s failure to respond to the requests necessitates the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c). )
      Since
Defendant served verified responses, an order deeming matters admitted against
Defendant is DENIED.  
      Plaintiff,
however, is entitled to the imposition of sanctions against Defendant for fees
and costs incurred. Defendant has not shown any evidence that counsel failed to
timely respond because of “counsel’s” mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Counsel’s declaration is devoid of any facts relevant to
excusable neglect. (Gregory G. Brezovec Decl.)
 
IV.  
CONCLUSION
      Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s four motions to compel responses from Defendant is GRANTED. The court
finds that $350 per hour is a reasonable rate. The court finds that two hours
to prepare each motion and reply brief is reasonable. The court permits .5
hours to appear. Accordingly, Defendant, FC US LLC, is ordered to pay to Plaintiff
within 10 days, total sanctions of $2975.00, (8.5 hours x $350) incurred in
preparing four motions.
