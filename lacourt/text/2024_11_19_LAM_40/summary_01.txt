The Judge finds that the Defendant's failure to serve verified responses was not due to excusable neglect, and therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. The Judge orders Defendant to pay Plaintiff $2975.00 in sanctions for fees and costs incurred in preparing the motions. The Judge also denies Plaintiff's request to deem the truth of matters admitted against Defendant.
