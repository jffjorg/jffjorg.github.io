And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors, LLC (GM) against Lottie Mae Patterson Shumate (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff filed a Complaint on May 26, 2023, alleging causes of action for violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(d), violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(b), violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(a)(3), breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and fraudulent inducement-concealment. GM demurred to the Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff's fraud claim fails due to lack of specificity and transactional relationship.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment are insufficient to state a claim. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not plead a transactional relationship between the parties, and that the Plaintiff's reliance on GM's advertising materials was not reasonable. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff did not plead a duty to disclose prior knowledge of a component or system being the subject of repair procedures.

The Judge sustains the demurrer to the fraudulent concealment cause of action and moots the motion to strike. The Judge invites oral argument on the point and grants leave to amend if counsel believes additional allegations would bolster support for the duty to disclose.
