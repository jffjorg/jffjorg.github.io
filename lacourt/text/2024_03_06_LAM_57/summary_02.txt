And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the motion of Azul Vision Management Services, L.P., Azul Vision, Inc., and California Eye Management Services, L.P. (collectively, "Defendants") to compel plaintiff Louis Hook's attendance at a deposition scheduled for March 20, 2024. The Court also denies Hook's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendants. The Court finds that Hook did not fail to appear at the previously scheduled deposition on February 8, 2024, which was cancelled by the Defendants. The Court concludes that the motion is premature and that there has yet to be a failure of Hook to appear at a deposition. The Court directs the parties to tone down their rhetoric in future briefs and orders the motion denied without prejudice.
