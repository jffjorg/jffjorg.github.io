OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff Angie Marie Elie 




On
December 18, 2020, Plaintiffs Angie Marie Elie and Robert Wayne Elie III filed a complaint against Defendants William Berger and Does
1-50 for negligence, negligence per se, and statutory liability. On August 10,
2021, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to add Defendant Estate of William
Berger, Deceased, as Doe 1 (“Defendant”). On December 16, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed a first amended complaint. On February 3, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer. On March 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. 
Defendant
moves the Court for orders compelling Plaintiff Angie Marie Elie (“Plaintiff”)
to provide further responses to the following discovery requests: 
Motion
A: 
Form
interrogatories, set one, propounded to Plaintiff  (8.1-8.8,
9.1-9.2 and 10.1-10.3) 
a.     Propounded:     March 1, 2023 
b.    Responded:       April 3 and June 29, 2023 
c.     Motion filed:    July 14, 2023 
Motion
B: 
Special
interrogatories, set one, propounded to Plaintiff  (1-7,
11-13, 15-17, and 19) 
a.     Propounded:     March 1, 2023 
b.    Responded:       April 3 and June 29, 2023 
c.     Motion filed:     July 14, 2023 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.            
Informal
Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
The
parties participated in an IDC on June 20, 2023. 
B.            
Timeliness
of Motion 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before
any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c).)  Failure to file a motion within this time
period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to
interrogatories. 
Defendant
filed its motions on the dates set forth above. 
Plaintiff does not dispute the timeliness of the motions. 
C.   Meet and Confer 
“A
motion to compel must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1), 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration must state
facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Plaintiff
argues Defendant did not meet and confer (or schedule and attend another IDC) after
Plaintiff provided supplemental discovery responses on June 29, 2023.  The Court finds that Defendant’s meet and
confer efforts (and participation in an IDC) prior to June 29, 2023 satisfied Defendant’s
obligations. 
D.      Separate Statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
Defendant
has filed a separate statement for each motion. 
Plaintiff argues the separate statements are defective because they do
not include the definitions of terms and instructions.  However, Plaintiff does not show how this omission
prevents the parties or the Court from understanding any relevant information
contained in the separate statement.  The
Court finds the separate statements are adequate. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
A.
Motion to compel further discovery responses 
 “The purpose of the discovery rules
is to enhance the truth-seeking function of the litigation process and
eliminate trial strategies that focus on gamesmanship and surprise.  In other words, the discovery process is
designed to make a trial less a game of blindman’s bluff and more a fair
contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable
extent.”  (Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 389.) 
1.    Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), provides:   
 “On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
“(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general.”(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).) 
B.
Discovery sanctions 
“The court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The
court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that
another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney
who advised that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by
any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
“Misuses
of the discovery process include . . .  * * * 
“(d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)DISCUSSION 
A.      Motion to compel further responses to form
interrogatories 
“In
response to a motion to compel answers [citation], the burden is on the party
claiming a privilege to establish whatever preliminary facts are essential to
the claim.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:192, p. 8C-61, emphasis omitted (Cal.
Practice Guide).)  “For example, upon
asserting the attorney-client privilege, the client, or the attorney in the
client’s absence, must prove that the attorney-client relationship existed when
the communication was made.  Once this
showing is made (typically through declarations), the communication between the
lawyer and client are presumed to have been made in confidence.”  (Ibid., emphasis omitted.)  “Upon such showing, the burden shifts to the
party seeking discovery to disprove those facts or to prove some applicable
statutory exception . . . .”  (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff
has not carried her initial burden of proving the existence of the
attorney-client privilege, work product protection, right of privacy, or other
privileges asserted in response to the discovery requests. 
          Granted: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5,
8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.2,[1] 10.1, 10.2 
          Denied: 9.1, 10.3 
          Defendant requests $810 in sanctions based on three hours
of attorney time consisting of two hours to prepare the moving papers and one
hour to appear at the hearing at counsel’s billing rate of $250 per hour plus
one $60 filing fee.  The Court grants
sanctions of $560 based on two hours of attorney time and one filing fee.  The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions. 
B.
      Motion to compel further responses
to special interrogatories 
Granted:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 16, 17, 19 
Denied:
6, 7, 12, 13, 15 
Sanctions:  Defendant requests $810 in sanctions.  Plaintiff requests $1,200 in sanctions.  The Court declines to award sanctions to
either party in light of the mixed outcome of this motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories,
set one (Motion A), numbers 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.2, 10.1, and

Plaintiff Angie Marie Elie is ordered to produce further verified and
code-compliant responses to these special interrogatories, without objections,
