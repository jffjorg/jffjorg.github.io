PARTY’S REQUEST 
Moving
Defendant requests that the Court deem admitted the truth of the matters
specified in its first set of requests for admissions served on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission
are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied:  
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”  

(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION  
          On March 14, 2023, Moving Defendant served its first set of
requests for admission on Plaintiff.  (Sewell Dec. ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff’s responses were due on April 18,
2023.  (Sewell
Dec. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff did not serve
responses by the deadline and had not served any responses by May 12, 2023.
(Sewell Dec. ¶¶ 3-4.) 
          The Court grants the motion and orders that the matters
specified in Moving Defendant’s first set of requests for admission are deemed admitted. 
          Although sanctions are mandatory under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, Moving Defendant has provided no information about
the expenses it incurred as a result of Plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely
response to Moving Defendant’s requests for admission.  Therefore, the Court does not award
sanctions.         
CONCLUSION  
The
Court GRANTS Moving Defendant Charter Communications, Inc.’s motion to deem
admitted the truth of matters specified in Moving Defendant’s first set of
requests for admission served on Plaintiff Gladis
Anabella Garcia.  The matters specified
in Moving Defendant’s requests for admission are deemed admitted. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling.
