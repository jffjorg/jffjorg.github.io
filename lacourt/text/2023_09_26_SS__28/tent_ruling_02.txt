 Case Number:  20STCV03156    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 24, 2020, Plaintiff Ignacio Escalante (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendant Daniel Canizales (“Defendant”) for assault, battery, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
On
July 7, 2022, Plaintiff submitted a request for default. A statement was
damages was attached to the request with a proof of service showing service on
June 14, 2023 at the hospital facility in Susanville where Defendant is
incarcerated. The clerk entered Defendant’s default the same day. 
On
September 1, 2022, Defendant wrote the Court from his place of incarceration
asking for an extension of time to file his answer. On September 13, 2022,
Defendant filed an answer. Defendant has not filed a request to vacate the
default. 
On
December 23, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
because Plaintiff did not provide adequate evidence to support the request for
over $4.5 million in damages. 
On
March 13, 2023 and May 15, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s requests for
default judgment due to defects in the applications. 
On
July 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for court judgment to be heard on
September 12, 2023.  On September 12,
2023, the Court continued the hearing to September 26, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $1,564,399.88, consisting of $125,279.24 in special damages,
$1,000,000.00 in general damages, $412,800.31 in prejudgment interest,
$26,000.00 in attorney’s fees, and $320.33 in costs. 
DISCUSSION 
On
September 12, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the application for
default judgment to give Plaintiff an opportunity to respond to the Court’s
inquiries about the following apparent defects in the application: 
·        Plaintiff
requests $25,279.24 in medical damages based on the amount Medi-Cal paid for
his injuries. However, the April 7, 2022 Medi-Cal letter lists $18,959.43 as
the “DHCS Reimbursement Amount” and lists $25,279.24 as “Medi-Cal Paid
Services.” Plaintiff should explain why he is requesting $25,279.24 when
$18,959.43 is the DHCS Reimbursement Amount. 
·       Plaintiff requests $412,800.31 in prejudgment
interest, applying a 10 percent interest rate. Plaintiff does not explain the
legal basis for recovery of prejudgment interest at a 10 percent rate. (See Z. Haning
et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Personal Injury (Rutter 2022) ¶¶ 3:61-3-82, pp.
3-14 to 3-18.) Plaintiff should explain the legal basis for his request for
prejudgment interest at a 10 percent rate on both the special and general
damages components of the damages he is seeking. (See id., ¶ 3:71, p.
3-16 [interest awarded under Civ. Code, § 3288 “is only awardable on
plaintiff’s established ‘special’ or ‘economic’ damages” and “cannot be awarded
on plaintiff’s ‘general damages’”].) 
·       Plaintiff requests $26,000 in attorney fees. Plaintiff
does not explain the legal basis for the recovery of attorney fees. (See id.,
¶ 3:91, p. 3-20 [“Each party must pay his or her own attorney fees unless the
parties otherwise agree or statute otherwise provides. [Citation.]
Consequently, attorney fees generally are not an element of tort damages”
(emphasis omitted)].) Plaintiff should explain the legal basis for his request
for attorney fees. 
Plaintiff
has not submitted supplemental documentation addressing the Court’s inquiries.  The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES the application for default judgment filed
on July 11, 2023 by Plaintiff Ignacio
Escalante. 
 Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
