English text:
A tentative ruling has been made in the case numbered 22STCV30815, scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2023, in Dept. 28. The ruling is as follows:

The background of the case is that Plaintiff George Leong filed a lawsuit against Defendants Xie Zhijing, Uber Technologies, Inc., and Does 1-50 for negligence and motor vehicle tort on September 21, 2022. Uber filed an answer on February 15, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel, Kaveh Keshmiri, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel on July 11, 2023, which was continued to September 5, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel filed a revised motion on September 6, 2023.

The request made by Plaintiff’s counsel is to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. The legal standard for this motion requires notice of motion, a declaration, service of motion papers, and a proposed order relieving counsel.

The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw if it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice and there is no prejudice to the client.

The discussion of the case includes the submission of MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 forms, a declaration of irreconcilable differences between Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, and proof of service on all parties that have appeared. Plaintiff's counsel was unable to confirm the current address of Plaintiff after making several attempts.

The conclusion is that the court grants Plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
