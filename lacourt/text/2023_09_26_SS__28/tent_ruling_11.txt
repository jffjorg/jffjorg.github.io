 Case Number:  22STCV30815    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  28 


Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules
  as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On September 21, 2022, Plaintiff George Leong
  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Xie Zhijing (“Zhijing”),
  Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”), and Does 1-50 for negligence and motor
  vehicle tort. 
On February 15, 2023, Uber filed an answer. 
On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, Kaveh
  Keshmiri, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on September
  5, 2023.  No opposition was filed. 
On September 5, 2023, the Court continued the
  hearing to September 26, 2023. 
On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a
  revised motion to be relieved as counsel and a proof of service. 
Trial is currently scheduled for March 20, 2024. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Kaveh Keshmiri, requests to be
  relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4)
  the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting
  Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to
  withdraw.  The motion should be granted
  if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
  of justice. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
 Counsel has submitted MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053
  forms.  Counsel has provided a declaration stating that
  counsel and Plaintiff have “[i]rreconcilable differences.”  Counsel stated
  that he served Plaintiff by mail at Plaintiff’s last known address with
  copies of the motion papers served with counsel’s declaration.   Counsel was unable to confirm that the address is
  current or locate a more current address for Plaintiff after making the
  following efforts: mailing the motion papers to Plaintiff's last known
  address, return receipt requested, calling Plaintiff's last known telephone
  number or numbers, and conducting a search using “[i]nvestigative services.” 
 Counsel has submitted proof of service on all
  parties that have appeared.  The Court
  grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s counsel's motion to be relieved
  as counsel.  Counsel will be relieved
  upon filing proof of service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney’s
  Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
