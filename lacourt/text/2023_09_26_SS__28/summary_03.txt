And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) to re-open discovery in the case of Bennett Falaughn against LACMTA and others. LACMTA requested to re-open discovery because it needs additional time to evaluate and investigate Plaintiff's injuries. The judge found that LACMTA has shown good cause to re-open discovery and that it has acted diligently after learning about Plaintiff's recently-disclosed information. The judge also found that reopening discovery is unlikely to prejudice Plaintiff or prevent the case from going to trial on the date currently set. The motion is granted, and fact discovery is reopened. All related dates will trail the new trial date of January 2, 2024.
