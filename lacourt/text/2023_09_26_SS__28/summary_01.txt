Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the City of West Hollywood's motion for summary judgment in this case. The case involves a car accident that occurred on Hammond Street in West Hollywood, California, in which the plaintiff, Gloria Edel, collided with a concrete bollard protruding from the street.

The judge found that the City has carried its initial burden of showing lack of actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the bollard. The plaintiff does not know how long the bollard was protruding from the street, and the City had not received any reports prior to the accident that the bollard had unexpectedly risen. The City regularly inspects its roadways, including the accident location.

The judge also found that the plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact on the issue of actual or constructive notice. The plaintiff's theory of the case is that the bollard was a dangerous condition because it was protruding into the street at a time when it should have been retracted below ground. However, the City employees visiting the bollard to raise and lower it would have no reason to consider the lack of red tape a dangerous condition because the bollard was supposed to be below ground when a driver might drive in its direction.

As a result, the judge has granted summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim for dangerous condition of public property and on her negligence claim.

The judge finds that the City had no actual or constructive notice of the bollard's condition and that the plaintiff's claims are therefore barred.
