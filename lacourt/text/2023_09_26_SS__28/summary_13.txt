This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action. The plaintiff, Joshua Seth Hernandez, is seeking to settle his case and create a special needs trust using the settlement proceeds. The court has reviewed the petition and the proposed special needs trust instrument and has found that it is ready for approval. The court grants the petition and approves the creation and funding of the special needs trust, subject to some minor modifications.
