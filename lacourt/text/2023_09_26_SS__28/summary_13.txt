And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Joshua Seth Hernandez and has made the following ruling. The court grants the amended petition to approve the compromise of the action and approves the creation and funding of a special needs trust using the settlement proceeds. The court finds that the trust beneficiary has a disability that substantially impairs their ability to provide for their own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap. The court also finds that the money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the trust beneficiary's special needs.

The court grants the trustee authority to invest in proprietary funds, mutual funds, and bonds with maturity dates greater than five years to provide for diversification and a higher rate of investment return. The court also sets certain conditions for the trust, including the requirement for trust accounting in one year, notice of commencement of proceedings for a court-supervised trust, and an order to show cause to ensure funding of the settlement and purchase of an annuity if relevant.

The court sets an order to show cause for November 27, 2023, at 8:30 am in Department 28 at Spring Street Courthouse, and orders the petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.

  + The Court approves the creation and funding of a special needs trust (SNT) using the settlement proceeds

### English Text Summary
The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding the case of Joshua Seth Hernandez, a plaintiff who has a disability and is represented by his guardian ad litem, Dalia Gamboa. The case involves a motor vehicle tort and has been ongoing since 2017. The Judge has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action and the creation of a special needs trust (SNT) to manage the settlement proceeds. The Judge finds that the SNT is necessary to meet the plaintiff's special needs and that the money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet those needs. The Judge grants the amended petition and approves the creation and funding of the SNT, subject to some minor modifications to the proposed order. The Judge also sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Opening of Probate Case for November 27, 2023, and orders the petitioner to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service with the Court within five days.
