significant\_statements:
  - statement: "In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled by a plaintiff."
  - statement: "In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth."
  - statement: "Punitive damages may not be pleaded generally."
  - statement: "The act of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated may constitute an act of ‘malice’ under section 3294 if performed under circumstances which disclose a conscious disregard of the probably dangerous consequences."
  - statement: "There is a very commonly understood risk which attends every motor vehicle driver who is intoxicated. One who willfully consumes alcoholic beverages to the point of intoxication, knowing that he thereafter must operate a motor vehicle, thereby combining sharply impaired physical and mental faculties with a vehicle capable of great force and speed, reasonably may be held to exhibit a conscious disregard of the safety of others. The effect may be lethal whether or not the driver had a prior history of drunk driving incidents."

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to strike the punitive damage claim and reference to despicable conduct in the Complaint. The Judge found that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a punitive damage award and the allegations are conclusory in nature and fail to satisfy pleading requirements entitling a party to such recovery under Civil Code section 3294. The Judge also found that the allegation of driving under the influence is sufficiently specific to withstand a motion to strike. The Plaintiff is given 30 days leave to amend the Complaint.
