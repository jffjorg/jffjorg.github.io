One who willfully consumes alcoholic beverages to the point of intoxication, knowing that he thereafter must operate a motor vehicle, thereby combining sharply impaired physical and mental faculties with a vehicle capable of great force and speed, reasonably may be held to exhibit a conscious disregard of the safety of others. The effect may be lethal whether or not the driver had a prior history of drunk driving incidents."

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to strike the punitive damage claim and reference to despicable conduct in the Complaint. The Judge found that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a punitive damage award and the allegations are conclusory in nature and fail to satisfy pleading requirements entitling a party to such recovery under Civil Code section 3294. The Judge also found that the allegation of driving under the influence is sufficiently specific to withstand a motion to strike. The Plaintiff is given 30 days leave to amend the Complaint.

**Case Number:** 23STCV07505

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Plaintiff:** Victor Campos

**Defendant:** Braulio Martinez

**Facts:**

* On April 5, 2023, Plaintiff Victor Campos filed a negligence action against Defendant Braulio Martinez for a vehicle collision on August 31, 2021.
* Defendant Martinez filed a motion to strike the complaint on August 31, 2023, requesting the removal of the request for punitive damages and references to driving under the influence and despicable conduct.
* The trial is set for October 2, 2024.

**Legal Standards:**

* A motion to strike can remove irrelevant, false, or improper matter from a pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a))
* In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, punitive damages may be awarded for oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subds. (a), (c))
* To survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing entitlement must be pled. (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255)

**Discussion:**

* The driving under the influence allegation is specific enough to withstand a motion to strike.
* The complaint sufficiently alleges driving under the influence at the time of the accident. However, other factual allegations in the complaint do not support a punitive damage claim for purposes of a motion to strike.
* The complaint alleges negligence but not malice, oppression, or fraud required for punitive damages.

**Ruling:**

* The Court grants Defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages claim and reference to despicable conduct with 30 days leave to amend.
* Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
* Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
