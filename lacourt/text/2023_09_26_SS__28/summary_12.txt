The judge is considering a motion to strike the complaint's request for punitive damages and references to driving under the influence and despicable conduct. The defendant argues that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a punitive damage award. The judge concludes that the complaint does not allege facts showing that the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, and therefore grants the motion to strike the punitive damages claim and reference to despicable conduct. The judge gives the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint.
