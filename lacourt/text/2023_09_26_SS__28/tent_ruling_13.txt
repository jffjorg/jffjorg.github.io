On
July 17, 2023, Petitioner Dalia Gamboa (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s pending action, to be heard on August 30,
2023. On August 23, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended petition to approve the
compromise of Plaintiff’s action. The petition includes a request to pay or
transfer the settlement proceeds “to the trustee of a special needs trust
established under Probate Code section 3604" for Plaintiff's benefit. 
On
August 30, 2023, the Court continued the hearing to September 26, 2023, to give
the Court’s Probate Legal Unit an opportunity to review the special needs trust
instrument. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Dalia Gamboa asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Joshua Seth Hernandez. 
DISCUSSION 
The
Court’s Probate Legal Unit has reviewed the SNT instrument and found that it is
ready for approval.  The proposed order
will require some relatively minor modifications, discussed below. 
The
Court grants the amended petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff’s case and approves the creation and funding of a special needs trust (SNT) using the settlement proceeds.  The Court
finds that: 
•        The SNT
beneficiary has a disability which substantially impairs the individual’s
ability to provide for his own care or custody and constitutes a substantial
handicap;
•        The SNT
beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not be met without the
trust; 
•        The
money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears
reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs. 
The
proposed trustee is not required to post a bond.  The Court grants Petitioner’s request for the
trustee to have authority to invest in proprietary funds, mutual funds, and
bonds with maturity dates greater than five years to provide for
diversification and a higher rate of investment return.  (Attachment 18b(4), court’s pdf at p. 324.) 
The
proposed order should be modified to include the following: 
·       Trust accounting is required in one year.  The Court will set a calendar due date for
filing in 14 months.
·       Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a Court
Supervised Trust on LASC Form PRO 044 must be filed within 60 days.  
·       The Court will set an OSC in approximately 60 days to
ensure funding of settlement, purchase of annuity if relevant, and filing of
LASC Form PRO 044 to open trust supervision action in probate. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the amended petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff
Joshua Seth Hernandez’s pending action, filed by
Petitioner Dalia Gamboa on August 23, 2023, subject to the Court’s review of
the revised order that Petitioner is to submit to the Court. 
The
net balance is ordered distributed according to the special needs trust
instrument. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Opening of Probate Case for 11/27/2023 at
08:30 AM in Department 28 at Spring Street Courthouse. 
The
due date for the accounting is November 27, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
