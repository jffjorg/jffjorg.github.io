Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and orders the plaintiff to produce further verified and code-compliant responses. The judge also grants sanctions of $560 on Motion A and denies the request for sanctions on Motion B. The plaintiff had failed to fully respond to the defendant's discovery requests, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's assertions of privilege and objections to some of the requests are not sufficient to justify their failure to respond. The judge finds that the defendant made a reasonable and good-faith attempt to resolve the issues through informal discovery conferences and meet and confer declarations, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond was unjustified.

## English Text Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Defendant, the Estate of William Berger, is seeking additional information from the Plaintiff, Angie Marie Elie, through discovery.  

The Defendant filed motions to compel further responses to form and special interrogatories, claiming that the Plaintiff's initial responses were insufficient. The Plaintiff argued that some of the requested information was protected by privilege.

The judge found that the Defendant had adequately attempted to resolve the discovery disputes before filing motions and that the Plaintiff had not sufficiently demonstrated the existence of any privilege.  

Therefore, the judge granted the Defendant's motions to compel further responses to specific interrogatories, denying the Plaintiff's objections. The judge also awarded the Defendant $560 in sanctions for the Plaintiff's failure to adequately respond to discovery.

## English Text Summary:

The judge has reviewed two motions filed by the Defendant in this negligence case. The Defendant wanted additional information from the Plaintiff through a set of formal and special questions called interrogatories. After reviewing the arguments and procedures followed, the judge partially granted both motions. This means the Plaintiff must provide more answers to some of the questions, but not to others. 

The judge also imposed a $560 sanction on the Plaintiff for not adequately responding to some of the discovery requests. However, no sanctions were awarded to either party regarding the special interrogatories. The Plaintiff has until October 27th to provide the requested answers and the Defendant must pay the sanction by the same date.
