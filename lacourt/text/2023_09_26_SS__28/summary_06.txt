Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and orders the plaintiff to produce further verified and code-compliant responses. The judge also grants sanctions of $560 on Motion A and denies the request for sanctions on Motion B. The plaintiff had failed to fully respond to the defendant's discovery requests, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's assertions of privilege and objections to some of the requests are not sufficient to justify their failure to respond. The judge finds that the defendant made a reasonable and good-faith attempt to resolve the issues through informal discovery conferences and meet and confer declarations, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond was unjustified.
