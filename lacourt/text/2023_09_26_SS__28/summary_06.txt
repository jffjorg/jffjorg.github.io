Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, and orders the plaintiff to produce further verified and code-compliant responses. The judge also grants sanctions of $560 on Motion A and denies the request for sanctions on Motion B. The plaintiff had failed to fully respond to the defendant's discovery requests, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's assertions of privilege and objections to some of the requests are not sufficient to justify their failure to respond. The judge finds that the defendant made a reasonable and good-faith attempt to resolve the issues through informal discovery conferences and meet and confer declarations, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond was unjustified.

The Defendant filed motions to compel further responses to form and special interrogatories, claiming that the Plaintiff's initial responses were insufficient. The Plaintiff argued that some of the requested information was protected by privilege.

The judge found that the Defendant had adequately attempted to resolve the discovery disputes before filing motions and that the Plaintiff had not sufficiently demonstrated the existence of any privilege.  

Therefore, the judge granted the Defendant's motions to compel further responses to specific interrogatories, denying the Plaintiff's objections. The judge also awarded the Defendant $560 in sanctions for the Plaintiff's failure to adequately respond to discovery.

This tentative ruling is for case number 20STCV48417, scheduled for hearing on September 26, 2023, in department 28. The moving party is the Defendant Estate of William Berger, Deceased and the opposing party is Plaintiff Angie Marie Elie.

The plaintiff filed a complaint on December 18, 2020, and the defendant filed an answer on February 3, 2023. The defendant has filed two motions, motion A and motion B, on July 14, 2023, requesting the court to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, propounded to the plaintiff on March 1, 2023. The plaintiff responded on April 3 and June 29, 2023.

The court finds that the defendant has satisfied the procedural requirements, including an informal discovery conference on June 20, 2023, and timely filing of the motion. The defendant has also met and conferred with the plaintiff, and the separate statements filed by the defendant are adequate.

In motion A, the court grants the defendant's request to compel further responses to form interrogatories 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.2, 10.1, and 10.2, and denies the request for 9.1 and 10.3. The court grants sanctions of $560 to the defendant and denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.

In motion B, the court grants the defendant's request to compel further responses to special interrogatories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 16, 17, and 19, and denies the request for 6, 7, 12, 13, and 15. The court declines to award sanctions to either party.

Overall, the court grants motion A and motion B, grants sanctions to the defendant on motion A, and denies sanctions to the plaintiff on both motions. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
