The Judge finds that the Plaintiff waived any objection to the requests for admission and grants the motion. The Judge also finds that the mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 are not applicable in this case since the moving party did not provide information about the expenses it incurred as a result of the Plaintiff's failure to serve a timely response.
