## English Summary

The Judge has tentatively ruled on a motion by Charter Communications, Inc. to have certain facts in the case deemed admitted. Charter made these requests to Plaintiff, Gladis Anabella Garcia, back in March, but Plaintiff did not respond by the deadline. 

As a result, the Judge has granted Charter's motion and will consider the facts in Charter's requests as admitted. Although the law typically requires a monetary penalty for failing to respond to requests for admission, the Judge has not imposed one in this case because Charter did not provide information about the expenses they incurred. The case is scheduled for trial in May 2024.

The Court has considered the motion filed by Charter Communications, Inc. (Moving Defendant) to deem admitted the truth of matters specified in its first set of requests for admissions served on Plaintiff Gladis Anabella Garcia. The Court grants the motion and orders that the matters specified in the requests for admission are deemed admitted.

The Court's ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which governs the procedure for requesting admissions.
