## English Summary

The Judge has tentatively ruled on a motion by Charter Communications, Inc. to have certain facts in the case deemed admitted. Charter made these requests to Plaintiff, Gladis Anabella Garcia, back in March, but Plaintiff did not respond by the deadline. 

As a result, the Judge has granted Charter's motion and will consider the facts in Charter's requests as admitted. Although the law typically requires a monetary penalty for failing to respond to requests for admission, the Judge has not imposed one in this case because Charter did not provide information about the expenses they incurred. The case is scheduled for trial in May 2024.

**Ruling:** The Court grants Charter's motion and deems the matters in their first set of requests for admission admitted.
