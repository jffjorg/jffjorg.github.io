 Case Number:  20STCV15807    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  28 Claimant
Mark-Anthony Rodriguez (“Claimant”) struck his head on a bridge of Defendant’s
playground structure, resulting in a scalp laceration. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, as long as Petitioner Eddy Rodriguez
(“Petitioner”) uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain
conditions.  The conditions are: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.
2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.
3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.
4. There are no unresolved
liens.
5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.
6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.
7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.
8. The settlement, exclusive
of interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the
amount payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing
parties would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance
policy limits AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT: $5,000.00 
INJURIES: Scalp laceration 
MEDICAL EXPENSES: $379.19 
COSTS: $0.00 
ATTORNEY’S FEES: $0.00 which
is 0% of the gross settlement. 
BALANCE OF PROCEEDS:
$4,620.81 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13 of the petition states that total medical expenses, before reductions, were
$20,587.53.  The petition states this
amount was reduced by $20,332.33.  That
should mean the remaining amount -- $255.20 – still needs to be paid or
reimbursed.  However, the petition states
that $379.19 in medical expenses need to be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  Petitioner should
clarify these figures. 
 The Court denies the
petition without prejudice.
