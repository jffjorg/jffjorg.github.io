 Case Number:  21STCV06871    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On February
22, 2021, Plaintiff Hilda Zamara Galvez Pineda (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Alex Filatoff (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle
and general negligence. 
On January
26, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
May 15, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. 
The motion was set for hearing on September 26, 2023.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for March 4, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
requests that the Court issue an order compelling Plaintiff to serve full and
complete verified responses without objections to special interrogatories, set
one, and award sanctions of $860. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
“Within
30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories
are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the propounding
party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the
time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court has
extended the time for response.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.260.) 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230,
and 2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
B.   Discovery sanctions 
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).) 
“Misuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, . . . 
* * *
 “(d) Failing
to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §2023.010,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Special interrogatories 
Defendant
served special interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff on January 31, 2023.  Responses were due on March 6, 2023.  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses. 
On
March 28, 2023, and May 10, 2023, Defendant’s counsel tried to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel.  Plaintiff’s
counsel did not respond. 
Plaintiff
had not served responses to the special interrogatories when Defendant filed this
motion on May 15, 2023. 
 The
Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff Hilda Zamara Galvez Pineda to
serve verified responses to the special interrogatories, set one, compliant
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210, subdivision (a), and 2030.220,
without objections, by October 17, 2023. 
B.   Sanctions 
Defendant
is entitled to reasonable sanctions due to Plaintiff’s failure to provide
timely discovery responses. 
Defendant
requests sanctions totaling $860.00, based on 4 hours of attorney’s work at a
rate of $200.00 per hour and 1 $60.00 filing fee.  Defendant’s counsel spent 2 hours drafting the
motion and anticipated spending 1 hour replying to any opposition and 1 hour attending
the hearing on the motion. The motion is unopposed. The Court awards sanctions of
$460.00 based on 2 hours of attorney’s work and one filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Alex Filatoff’s motion to compel
Plaintiff
Hilda
Zamara Galvez Pineda’s responses
to special interrogatories, set one.  Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses to the special interrogatories, set one,
compliant with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210, subdivision (a), and
2030.220, without objections, by October 17, 2023. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Alex Filatoff’s request for sanctions.  Plaintiff Hilda Zamara Galvez Pineda and her
counsel are ordered to pay Defendant $460 in sanctions by October 17, 2023.
