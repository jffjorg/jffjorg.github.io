may ask the responding party to identify documents as to which a privilege is
claimed.  The existence of a privileged
document is not generally privileged. 
Therefore, an adequate response must include a description of the
documents, even if the party has the right to object to a demand for their
production.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1050.5, p.
8F-39, emphasis omitted.)
