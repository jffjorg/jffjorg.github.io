And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the petition without prejudice. The petition was filed by Eddy Rodriguez, the petitioner, on behalf of his son, Mark-Anthony Rodriguez, the claimant, who suffered a scalp laceration after striking his head on a playground structure. The petition was filed as an expedited petition without a hearing, permitted under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5. The court notes that the settlement amount is $5,000.00, and the petitioner's attorney did not become involved at the request of the defendant or the insurance carrier. However, the court requires clarification on the medical expenses and settlement proceeds, as the petition states that $379.19 in medical expenses need to be paid or reimbursed, but this amount is not consistent with the figures provided in the petition. The court denies the petition without prejudice, allowing the petitioner to correct the discrepancies and refile if necessary.

## English Text Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a petition for settlement in a personal injury case. Claimant Mark-Anthony Rodriguez suffered a scalp laceration after hitting his head on a playground structure owned by the Defendant.  Petitioner Eddy Rodriguez, representing Claimant, filed an expedited petition for settlement. 

The judge notes that while the settlement meets the requirements for expedited petitions, there is a discrepancy in the reported medical expenses. The petition states that total medical expenses were reduced by a significant amount, but then indicates a different amount still needs to be paid.  

Due to this inconsistency, the judge denies the petition without prejudice, meaning Petitioner can refile with corrected information.
