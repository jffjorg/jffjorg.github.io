## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case No. 20STCV03156

**Case Number:** 20STCV03156
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** 28

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Ignacio Escalante

**Previous Rulings:**

*  The Court denied Escalante's default judgment requests on December 23, 2022, March 13, 2023, and May 15, 2023 due to inadequate evidence and procedural defects.

    * $1,000,000.00 in general damages

    * $26,000.00 in attorney fees
    * $320.33 in costs

**Issues:**

*  Escalante's request for $25,279.24 in medical damages (based on Medi-Cal payments) is inconsistent with the actual DHCS Reimbursement Amount of $18,959.43. 
*  Escalante's requested 10% prejudgment interest rate lacks legal justification.
*  Escalante's request for $26,000 in attorney fees requires legal basis explanation.

**Ruling:**

* The Court denies Escalante's application for default judgment.

**Reasoning:**

* Escalante failed to address the Court's inquiries regarding the inconsistencies and legal basis for his requested damages.


**English Summary:**

The judge is tentatively denying the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant.

- **Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
- **Dept:** 28

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Ignacio Escalante
- Defendant: Daniel Canizales

- December 23, 2022: The Court denied Plaintiff's request for default judgment due to insufficient evidence for over $4.5 million in damages.

  - $412,800.31 in prejudgment interest

**Discussion:**

- The Court identified apparent defects in Plaintiff's application for default judgment:
