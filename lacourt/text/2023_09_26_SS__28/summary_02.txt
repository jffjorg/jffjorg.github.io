## English Summary:

The Judge is tentatively denying Plaintiff's request for a default judgment against Defendant. 

Though Defendant defaulted on the lawsuit, the Court found issues with the application for default judgment. Specifically, the Judge questioned the amount of medical damages requested, the legal basis for the 10% prejudgment interest rate, and the justification for requesting attorney fees. 

The Plaintiff was ordered to provide further information and clarification regarding these points. Since the Plaintiff did not respond to the Court's requests, the default judgment motion was denied.
