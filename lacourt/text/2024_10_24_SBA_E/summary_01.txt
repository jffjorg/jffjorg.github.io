Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Muhamad Awadallah, argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him because the plaintiff, Darius Hoosman, improperly named Awadallah in an action that concerns a contractual relationship between two corporate entities, Chores LLC and Lion Heart Delivery LLC. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, and therefore has not met their burden of proof to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court finds that the defendant's contacts with the forum state are not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction, and therefore grants the motion to quash service of summons.
