SUMMARY OF ACTION 
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff Elliott Wolfe (Plaintiff)
filed a complaint with six causes of action for Assault, Battery, Trespass to
Chattels, Conversion, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Elder
Abuse. It is unclear from the complaint who Defendants Jodi Rosen, David Rosen,
Michelle Fluke, and Michael Fluke (Defendants) are or what their relationship
is to Plaintiff.
 
Defendants filed their demurer on October 24, 2023. Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint on February 27. At the hearing on Defendant
Judith Wolfe’s demurrer on February 29, 2024, the Court found that the amended
complaint was untimely filed and did not comply with CCP 477(a). The Court ordered
the amended complaint stricken.
 
ANALYSIS
Defendants bring a demurrer to the First through Sixth
Causes of Action on the basis that they fail to state a cause of action and are
uncertain.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
All of Plaintiff’s causes of action are devoid of specific facts
against Defendants. It is impossible to tell from Plaintiff’s complaint what
Plaintiff is alleging happened. Rather than state facts, Plaintiff has made
conclusory statements under each cause of action. These conclusory statements
seem designed to simply check the boxes for the requirements of the causes of
action, and do not state any facts specific to Plaintiff’s case. 
 
The Court sustains Defendants’ demurrer on the basis that
Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any causes
of action against Defendants.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff has 20 days to file an Amended Complaint.
