And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the default entered against him. The defendant claims he did not learn of the complaint and request for entry of default until December 13, 2023, and that he did not receive a response from the plaintiff's attorney after attempting to meet and confer. The judge takes judicial notice of several documents filed with the court and finds that the defendant has excusable neglect and surprise in this case. The defendant has also met the requirements of CCP Section 473, including filing a copy of his proposed answer and making the motion within six months of entry of default. The judge notes that the law favors hearings on the merits and resolves any doubts in the defendant's favor. The defendant's demurrer is deemed filed and will proceed with a hearing.
