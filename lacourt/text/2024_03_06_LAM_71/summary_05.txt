Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's unopposed demurrer to the defendants' answer is sustained in its entirety with 20 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff's motion to strike is denied as moot.

The judge found that the defendants' answer is an unverified general denial and fails to answer each paragraph positively and specifically, which is a defect under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 431.30(d) and (f).

The judge also found that the defendants' affirmative defenses fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and do not contain any "new matter" as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.20(a).

Therefore, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the defendants' answer and has given them 20 days to amend their answer. The motion to strike is denied as moot.
