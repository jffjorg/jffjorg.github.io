  Case Number:  22STCV34320    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  71 Superior  Court of California County  of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 71   TENTATIVE  RULING      MARKELLA    THANOU, et al.,               vs.   CEDARS-SINAI    MEDICAL CENTER.    Case No.:     22STCV34320        Hearing Date:  March 6, 2024      Plaintiff  Markella Thanou’s unopposed motion to vacate and set aside the judgment  of dismissal entered on October 26, 2023, on the Court’s own motion, is  granted.   Plaintiff  Markella Thanou (“Thanou”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for this Court  to vacate and set aside the judgment of dismissal entered on October 26, 2023,  on the Court’s own motion, on thirteen grounds, including that Plaintiff’s  Counsel admitted that due to excusable neglect, mistake, inadvertence, he was  unable to appear at 8:30am on October 26, 2023 and was unable to connect to the  LA Court Connect to appear absent a prior court reservation.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-3; C.C.P. §§473(b),  128.)   Background           On October 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed  her Complaint in pro per against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center  (“Cedars-Sinai”) (“Defendant”) alleging a single cause of action for general  negligence arising from Defendant’s alleged failure to take proper care of Demetrios  Fontinatos.  (See Complaint.) On  October 26, 2023, this Court ordered Plaintiff’s Complaint dismissed without  prejudice pursuant to C.C.P. §583.150.   (10/26/23 Minute Order.) Plaintiff  filed the instant motion on October 30, 2023.   As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.   Motion to Vacate/Set Aside Dismissal The  court is empowered to relieve a party “upon any terms as may be just . . . from  a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her  through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).) C.C.P.  §473(b) consists of two distinct parts: “a discretionary provision, which  applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies as of right.” (Minick  v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25-26; Bailey v. Citibank,  N.A. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 335, 348.) “[W]henever  an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of  judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn  affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or  neglect, [the court shall] vacate any resulting . . . dismissal entered against his or her client.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)  The court must set  aside the dismissal “unless the court finds that the . . .  dismissal was not in fact caused by the  attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (C.C.P. §473(b).) Although  C.C.P. §473(b) relief normally must be sought within six (6) months after the  dismissal is entered, an  unauthorized dismissal may be vacated at any time; i.e., “within a reasonable time after [the client’s] learning of  it, regardless of the time limitations  in section 473.”  (Whittier Union High  School District v. Superior Court (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 504, 509.) Plaintiff’s  counsel declares Plaintiff filed this case and has prosecuted the same in pro  persona, but Plaintiff recently engaged counsel when she could not continue to  prosecute the same in pro per due to her age and health.  (Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares the case was  filed last year, and the case became statute barred on October 25, 2022.  (Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶5.)   Plaintiff’s  Counsel declares a dismissal of this case has significant implications on the statute  of limitation, and this makes it impossible for refile this case without being  barred; all Plaintiff’s negligence were effectively statute barred by October  25, 2022.  (Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares that if the  dismissal is allowed to stand, Plaintiff will be effectively barred from filing  any claims for negligence, which is integral to the case at hand.  (Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶6.) Plaintiff’s  Counsel declares that once Plaintiff engaged him as legal counsel, he took  steps to have the Plaintiff execute his Substitution of Attorney to enable me  properly to get into the case.  (Decl. of  Opia-Enwemuche ¶7.)   Plaintiff’s Counsel  declares that although that was on-going, he attempted to join the court  proceeding via LA Court Connect but could not do so since he did not make a  prior reservation.  (Decl. of  Opia-Enwemuche ¶7.)  Plaintiff’s Counsel  admits that due to excusable neglect, mistake, inadvertence, he was unable to  appear at on October 26, 2023.  (Decl. of  Opia-Enwemuche ¶11.)   There  is also no prejudice to any of the parties in this case and it is less than six  months since this Court, on its own motion, dismissed the case and the instant motion  was filed. Plaintiff’s  motion is timely and within the time allowed by the Code, and Defendant will  also not be prejudice by the setting aside of the judgment. Therefore, relief is  granted because the conduct is excusable.    The Court imposes a sanction of $100 payable by Attorney Opia-Enwemuche  for not appearing at the hearing. (Code of Civil Procedure 473(c)(1)(A).   Conclusion                          Plaintiff’s  unopposed motion to set aside the judgment of dismissal entered on  October 26, 2023, is granted.  The Court  sets a hearing on an Order to Show Cause on April 22, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. why the  case should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for Plaintiff’s  failure to file proof of service of the complaint.  Attorney  Opia-Enwemuche is ordered to pay $100 by April 5, 2024 for failing to appear on  October 26, 2023.
