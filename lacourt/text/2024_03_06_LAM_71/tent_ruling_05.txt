 Hearing Date:  March 6, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Eastern Funding, LLC’s, unopposed demurrer to Defendants 1553 LLC’s,
Jason Arrow’s, and Jamie Lynn Arrow’s Answer is sustained in its entirety with
20 days leave to amend. 
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion
to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Plaintiff Eastern
Funding, LLC (“Eastern Funding”) (“Plaintiff”) demurs unopposed to Defendants
1553 LLC’s (“1553”), Jason Arrow’s (“Jason”), and Jamie Lynn Arrow’s (“Jamie”) answer
(“Answer”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§430.20(a), (b).)  Plaintiff also
moves to strike portions of the Answer. 
(Notice of MTS, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed
the operative Complaint against Defendants on July 19, 2023, alleging two
causes of action: (1) breach of secured promissory note and modifications; and
(2) breach of guarantees.  (See
Complaint.)
Defendants filed
their operative Answer on September 1, 2023. 
(See Answer.)
On October 17,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of
Demurrer
Plaintiff demurs
on the basis that Defendants filed an unverified general denial to a verified
complaint and their Answer is therefore improper and must be stricken.  (Demurrer, pg. 3; C.C.P. §§431.30(d), (f),
430.20(a).)  Plaintiff also demurs to the
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th affirmative defenses on the basis they fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute defenses and are uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible.  (Demurrer, pgs. 3-4;
C.C.P. §§430.20(a), (b).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis
added.)  A declaration must be filed with
a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration states that he never received an Answer from Defendants
and was surprised to learn there was an Answer filed with the Court without a
proof of service.  (Decl. of Alper ¶¶2, 3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration states he
immediately sent an email to counsel for Defendants, Parisa Fishback, advising
her of the issues and deficiencies and to meet and confer.  (Decl. of Alper ¶7, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares after not
receiving a response to his email, the next day he called Defendants’ counsel
and left a voicemail.  (Decl. of Alper
¶8.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares he
finally received a response from Defendants’ counsel indicating that she lost
contact with her clients and therefore she cannot take any further action at
this time.  (Decl. of Alper ¶10, Exh.
2.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration is
proper.  Therefore, the Court will
consider the instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
A demurrer to an answer is appropriate when the answer contains
allegations proffered in the form of brief legal conclusions rather than as
facts.  (FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-386 [affirmative defenses of fraud
in the inducement and failure of consideration, consisting of “terse” legal
conclusions rather than facts, were not well pled, and would not have survived
a demurrer].)
In addition, the affirmative defenses in an answer are limited to “a
statement of any new matter constituting a defense.”  (C.C.P. §431.30(b).)  The “new matter” should be an independent
reason which a defendant claims should bar plaintiff from recovery, even if all
of the allegations in the complaint were true.  (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community
College District (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546 [claim that plaintiff
failed to perform is not an affirmative defense].)

 
Unverified Answer
C.C.P. §446(a) provides,
“[w]hen the complaint is verified, the answer shall be verified.” 
Here, the
Complaint is a verified Complaint, and it is not within a limited jurisdiction
Court.  Defendants’ Answer is not
verified.  Therefore, as a matter of law Defendants’
pleading is an improper Answer, and a demurrer must be sustained.
C.C.P §431.30(d)
provides, “[i]f the complaint is subject to Article 2 (commencing with section
90) of Chapter 5.1 of Title I of Part 1 or is not verified, a general denial is
sufficient but only puts in issue the material allegations of the complaint. If
the complaint is verified, unless the complaint is subject to Article 2
(commencing with section 90) of Chapter 5.1 of Title I of Part 1, the denial of
the allegations shall be made positively or according to the information and
belief of the defendant.”  
Pursuant to C.C.P.
§431.30(f), “the denials of the allegations controverted may be stated by reference
to specific paragraphs or parts of the complaint; or by express admission of
certain allegations of the complaint with a general denial of all of the
allegations not so admitted; or by denial of certain allegations upon
information and belief, or for lack of sufficient information and belief, with
a general denial of all allegations not so denied or expressly admitted.”
Here, Defendants’
Answer is nothing more than a form general denial.  Defendants are required to answer each
paragraph positively and specifically.  Defendants
have failed and refused to do that.  Therefore,
the Demurrer to Defendants’ Answer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Failure to State
an Affirmative Defense
Defendants’ 2nd through 6th affirmative defenses fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense, and do not contain any “new matter.”  (C.C.P. §430.20(a).)  Boilerplate conclusions are not allowed as a
matter of law; each affirmative defense must plead ultimate facts establishing
the defense in the same manner.  (See
Greiss v. State Investment Etc. Co. (1893) 98 Cal. 241, 244; California
Packing Corp. v. Larsen (1921) 187 Cal. 610, 612.)  If there are no facts pled as to any of the
affirmative defenses, they must be stricken. 
(FPI Development, Inc., 231 Cal.App.3d at pgs. 382-386.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendants’ 2nd through 6th
affirmative defenses in their Answer is sustained with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed
demurrer to Defendants’ Answer is sustained in its entirety with 20 days
leave to amend.
Moving Party to
give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
In light of the
Court’s ruling on Plaintiff’s demurrer, Plaintiff’s motion to strike is denied
as moot.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to strike is denied as moot.
Moving Party to
give notice.
