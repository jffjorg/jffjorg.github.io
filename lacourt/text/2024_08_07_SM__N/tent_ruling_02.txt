On or before October 21, 2024, Defendants Geronimo Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP shall file a supplemental declaration describing the work performed and including billing sheets with sufficient detail to allow the Court to determine whether the work was reasonable and necessary to the litigation. Plaintiffs Susan Jeffers and 2444 Fourth Street, LLC may file a responsive brief of no more than five (5) pages on or before October 25, 2024.Moving parties to give notice. REASONINGOn May 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendants Geronimo Perez (“Perez”) and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP and Defendant Larry Moore (“Moore”) (collectively “Defendants”)’s special motions to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The Court entered an order granting the motions on that date and entered judgment in Defendants’ favor on June 24, 2024. Defendants now move for awards of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c), which provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP move for an award of $37,453.35 in fees and costs, which consists of $37,070 in fees and $383.35 in costs, while Moore moves for an award of $68,371.80, which consists of $67,365.50 in fees and $1,006.30 in costs.The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)First, Plaintiffs Susan Jeffers and 2444 Fourth Street, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) have asked the Court to stay these motions while their appeal of the Court’s order is pending. While an appeal from an order granting a special motion to strike automatically stays all further proceedings on the merits of the affected causes of action under Code of Civil Procedure section 916, subsection (a) (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 190-192), the trial court retains jurisdiction to decide a motion for attorney fees (Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461; Doe v. Luster (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 139, 144, Nazemi v. Tseng (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1633, 1639). The automatic stay rule exists “to protect the appellate court’s jurisdiction” and to “prevent[] the trial court from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order.” (Elsea v. Saberi (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 625, 629.) Thus, if a matter will not “have any impact the ‘effectiveness’ of the appeal,” it is not a matter embraced in or affected by the appealed order, and the proceedings are permitted. (See ibid.)It follows that the Court has jurisdiction to rule on Defendants’ motions for attorney fees awards because the appeal only stays proceedings on the merits of the causes of action affected by the special motions to strike, and the determination of whether Defendants are entitled to recover attorney fees does not affect or modify the order granting Defendants’ special motions to strike that is now subject to the appeal. Further, it is axiomatic that Defendants are entitled to recover attorney fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c), given that they prevailed on their special motions to strike.However, Defendants have not sufficiently set forth the basis for their fees request. “It is well established that California courts do not require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.” (Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698.) Nonetheless, it is axiomatic that the hours worked must be reasonable, and the Court cannot conclude that 81.4 hours of work and 149.7 hours of work are reasonable amounts as to a single motion and related matters. The parties have provided only block billing descriptions for the work performed, and the Court cannot conclude that the hours were reasonable when counsel also bills at a high rate per hour, i.e., the rates imply that the time spent working on the special motions to strike and related matters could have been done in less time given counsel’s years of experience.Accordingly, Defendant Larry Moore’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is CONTINUED to November 1, 2024, and Defendants Geronimo Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP’s Motion for Attorneys [sic] Fees and Costs Pursuant to Cal. Code Civil Proc. Section 425.16(c) is CONTINUED to November 1, 2024. On or before October 21, 2024, Defendant Larry Moore and Defendants Geronimo Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP shall file supplemental declarations describing the work performed and including billing sheets with sufficient detail to allow the Court to determine whether the work was reasonable and necessary to the litigation. Plaintiffs Susan Jeffers and 2444 Fourth Street, LLC may file a responsive brief of no more than five (5) pages on or before October 25, 2024.
