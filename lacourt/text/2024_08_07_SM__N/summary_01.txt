```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied XL Hog, Inc.'s motion to strike University of Southern California's (USC) Roe amendment to its cross-complaint and to dismiss USC's cross-action against XL Hog with prejudice. The motion was based on alleged unreasonable delay in filing the amendment, which named XL Hog as a party to the lawsuit. The court found that USC was aware of XL Hog's identity since June 28, 2022, and waited over a year to file the amendment. However, the court lacked a basis to conclude that XL Hog would suffer substantial prejudice from the amendment, as the case is seeking to determine responsibility for damage incurred and USC's cross-action is for indemnity and contribution. Therefore, the court denied the motion and allowed USC to proceed with its cross-action against XL Hog.
