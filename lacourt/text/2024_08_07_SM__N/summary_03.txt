And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Culver City has moved for a protective order regarding the deposition of William Neumann, a road design expert retained by the plaintiffs. The City claims that the plaintiffs' counsel denied them the opportunity to effectively depose and cross-examine Neumann due to repeated interruptions and an unnecessarily lengthy deposition. The plaintiffs argue that they offered to continue the deposition with a discovery referee, but the City declined to use one and instead requested a new deposition.

After reviewing the deposition transcript, the judge finds that the initial deposition consisted of lengthy discussions by both parties' attorneys, and that the plaintiffs' counsel was entitled to assert objections to avoid questions outside the scope of the expert's purview. The judge also notes that the City declined to use a discovery referee, despite the plaintiffs' offer to continue the deposition in this manner.

As a result, the judge denies the City's motion for a protective order and finds that the City's request for monetary sanctions is not justified. The judge concludes that the City's motion was made with substantial justification, as the plaintiffs' counsel made lengthy objections that were warranted under the circumstances.
