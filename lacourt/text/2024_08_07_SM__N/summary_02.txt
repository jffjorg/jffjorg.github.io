And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the motions for attorney fees and costs filed by Defendants Larry Moore and Geronimo Perez, and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP, pending the November 1, 2024 hearing date. The Judge requires the moving parties to file supplemental declarations describing the work performed and including billing sheets with sufficient detail to allow the Court to determine whether the work was reasonable and necessary to the litigation. The Plaintiffs, Susan Jeffers and 2444 Fourth Street, LLC, may file a responsive brief of no more than five pages on or before October 25, 2024. The Judge notes that the Court has jurisdiction to rule on the motions for attorney fees awards, despite the pending appeal, as the determination of attorney fees does not affect the order granting the special motions to strike. The Judge also finds that the moving parties have not sufficiently set forth the basis for their fees request, and requires more detailed information to be provided.
