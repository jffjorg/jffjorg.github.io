English-text summary:

The City of Culver City has moved for a protective order regarding the deposition of William Neumann, a road design expert retained by the Plaintiffs. The City argues that Plaintiffs' counsel repeatedly interrupted the deposition and increased the length of the deposition, thereby causing unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. The Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that they offered to continue the deposition with a discovery referee, but the City declined. The Court has reviewed the deposition transcript and finds that a protective order is not warranted. The Court also finds that the City's motion was made with substantial justification, and therefore, denies the City's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs.
