And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted is denied. The defendants had moved to deem the RFAs admitted against the plaintiff, citing that the plaintiff failed to serve responses to the RFAs. However, the plaintiff has since provided responses to the RFAs, albeit with frivolous objections. The Judge has denied the motion to deem the RFAs admitted, stating that if the defendants are unsatisfied with the responses, they may move to compel further responses after properly meeting and conferring with the plaintiff. Additionally, the Judge has denied the defendants' request for sanctions.
