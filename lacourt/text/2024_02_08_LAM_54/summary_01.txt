And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a petition to vacate an arbitration award and a petition to confirm the same arbitration award. The plaintiff, Marion Lynette Chatmon-Eutsey as Assignee of Interest of Ashlei C. James, is seeking to vacate the arbitration award issued by arbitrator Irene M. Guimera on June 7, 2023, which granted the defendant's dispositive motion. The plaintiff argues that the arbitrator exceeded her authority by granting the motion without a formal evidentiary hearing and that the arbitrator incorrectly interpreted the law. The court finds that the arbitrator did not exceed her authority in refusing to allow the deposition and that the plaintiff had ample time and opportunity to investigate and argue her claims.

The defendant, Novastar, LLC, is seeking to confirm the arbitration award and issue a final judgment. The court finds that the arbitrator's findings are correct and that the plaintiff's arguments fail. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's petition to vacate the arbitration award and grants the defendant's petition to confirm the arbitration award. The defendant is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within 10 days and to notice the plaintiff.
