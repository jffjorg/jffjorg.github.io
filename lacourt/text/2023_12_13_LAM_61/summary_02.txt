The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production from the plaintiffs, California Equity Partners and Trancas Canyon Partners, LLC.

The plaintiffs' previous responses were deemed incomplete and non-compliant, as they failed to provide specific information and identified only broad collections of documents without specificity.

As a result, the plaintiffs are required to provide further responses within 30 days.
