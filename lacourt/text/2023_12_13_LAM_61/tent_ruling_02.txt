I.      
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
“A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Defendant Robert Huizenga (Defendant) moves
to compel further responses from Plaintiffs California Equity Partners LLC and
Trancas Canyon Partners LLC (Plaintiffs) to Form Interrogatories No. 9.2 and
50.1(c), as well as Requests for Production No. 1–3, 5, 7, 16, 20, 21, and 25. 
 
Interrogatory No. 9.2 asked Plaintiffs to
identify any documents that supported the existence or amount of any item of
damages identified in a previous interrogatory, to which Plaintiffs answered,
“All of the documents produced by Defendant and Plaintiff herein.” (Separate
Statement at p. 1.) Interrogatory No. 50.1 asked, for each agreement alleged in
the pleadings, to provide, among other things, identification of all documents
evidencing any part of the agreement. (Separate Statement at p. 2.) Plaintiff responded
by noting “The Escrow Mart documents.” (Ibid.) 
 
Requests for Production No. 1–3, 5, 7, 16,
20, 21, and 25 sought communications with or about parties to the transaction
at issue, as well as documents related to the transaction. Plaintiffs responded
to these requests with objections based on overbreadth and irrelevance, but
concluded with the statement that “Plaintiff will produce documents related to
the subject matter of this action, nos. 1–557.” (Separate Statement.)
 
Further responses are warranted. The
interrogatories and requests for production here are related to the subject
matter of this action and are supported by good cause. “Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as
complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (a).) But when
asked to identify pertinent documents related to items of damages or evidencing
the agreement at issue, Plaintiff cited only broad collections of documents
without specificity. Likewise, Plaintiffs’ responses to the document requests
are insufficient, as offer neither a statement of compliance nor an
identification of documents being withheld pursuant to objections. Indeed,
Plaintiffs’ qualification that they will produce documents “related to the
subject matter of this action” suggests that they are withholding unidentified
documents based on a unilateral assessment of relevance not articulated in the
requests. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.220; 2031.240.) These responses
are noncompliant.
 
The motions are therefore GRANTED.
