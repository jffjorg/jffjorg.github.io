And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Defendant, Gregory K. Walker, has moved to vacate the renewal of judgment filed by the Plaintiff, Reymond K. Ohanian, for the amount of $31,818.45 in prejudgment interest in addition to the $109,583.52 judgment amount. The Plaintiff had appealed the judgment, but it was rejected. The Defendant has paid the judgment and interest, plus an additional 20 days of interest. The Judge grants the motion to vacate the renewal of judgment, as the Plaintiff cannot obtain interest needlessly accrued beyond the date of the rejection of his appeal. The Judge relies on the case law of Montano v. Superior Court (1971) 13 Cal.App.3d 446, which holds that a plaintiff assumes the risk of losing the use of the money pending the appeal when he refuses to accept the tender of the judgment amount.
