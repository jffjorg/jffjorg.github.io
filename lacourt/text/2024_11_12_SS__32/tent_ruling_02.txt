Plaintiff also attempts to invoke Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) to
excuse the failure to complete discovery before the cut-off. (Motion, 6.)
Plaintiff has not adequately discussed whether this section is applicable given
the controlling section 2024.050 here. Nevertheless, even if section 473(b)
applies, Plaintiff fails to provide a declaration from former counsel
demonstrating the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
