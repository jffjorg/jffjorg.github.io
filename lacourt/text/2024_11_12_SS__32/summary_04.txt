```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motions to compel the deposition of Defendant's person most qualified and Tierra Charles. The Court finds that the motions are untimely, as the discovery motion cut-off date was October 28, 2024, and the motions were heard on November 12, 2024. The Court notes that the parties did not engage in meet and confer efforts to schedule the depositions after Defendant's objection was served. The Court also finds that the discovery cut-offs are associated with the previous trial date of November 12, 2024, and therefore, the motions to compel depositions are denied.
