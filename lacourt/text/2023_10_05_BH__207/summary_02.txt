  - "An injunction is an unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff."

Summary:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The Plaintiff, Joseph Robert Giannini, sought to enjoin the Defendants, Gold's Gym California, LLC and Gold's Gym Club Holding, LLC, from denying him entry to the Venice Gym at the contract rate of $29 per month. The Judge found that the Plaintiff had not demonstrated immediate or irreparable harm that is non-pecuniary in nature, and therefore denied the motion. The dispute centers around the amount of the Plaintiff's monthly dues, and the Judge ruled that pecuniary damages alone cannot support a preliminary injunction.
