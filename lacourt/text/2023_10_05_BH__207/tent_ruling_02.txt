MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Joseph Robert Giannini
(“Plaintiff”) sued Defendants Gold’s Gym California, LLC and Gold’s Gym Club,
Holding, LLC (“Defendants”) for refusing to honor his prior gym contract at $29
per month, and refusing to let Plaintiff enter the Gold’s Gym in Venice without
paying either $900 per year or $100 per month. 
(Complaint ¶¶ 13-14.)  Plaintiff
moves to enjoin Defendants from denying him entry to the Venice Gym at the
contract rate of $29 per month. 
Defendants oppose the motion and Plaintiff has replied.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 527, subdivision (a), “[a]
preliminary injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a
verified complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the
affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist
therefor.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).)  “The purpose of a
preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution
upon a trial.”  (Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp. (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316.)   The status quo has been defined to mean the
last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.) Preliminary injunctive relief requires the use of
competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds for
relief. (See, e.g., ReadyLink Healthcare
v. Cotton (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016; Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green (1974) 41
Cal.App.3d 146, 150.) 
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining whether to issue
a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the
merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely
to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is
likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a); Husain
v. McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67.)  The balancing of harm between the parties
“involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other remedies, the
degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the status quo.” (Husain
v. McDonald’s Corp., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 867.)  
 
“The decision to grant a preliminary injunction rests in the sound
discretion of the trial court . . .  before the trial court can exercise its
discretion the applicant must make a prima facie showing of
entitlement to injunctive relief.  The applicant must demonstrate a real
threat of immediate and irreparable injury.”  (Triple A Machine Shop,
Inc. v. State of Cal. (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 131,
138.)  “[A]n injunction is an unusual or extraordinary equitable
remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually damages) will
adequately compensate the injured plaintiff,” and the party seeking injunctive
relief bears the burden to prove its absence.  (Department of Fish
& Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist. (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1564-1565.)   
 
ANALYSIS
 
·        
IMMEDIATE AND IRREPARABLE HARM
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 526, an injunction may be granted “[w]hen it
appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of
some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable
injury, to a party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a)(2).)  The threat of irreparable harm must be
imminent as opposed to a mere possibility of harm sometime in the future.  “An injunction cannot issue in a vacuum based
on the proponents’ fears about something that may happen in the future.  It must be supported by actual evidence that
there is a realistic prospect that the party enjoined intends to engage in the
prohibited activity.”  (Korean
Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California Presbytery (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.)  Plaintiffs need
not wait until they have suffered actual harm before applying for an
injunction, however, they may seek injunctive relief against threatened
infringement of their rights.  (Maria
P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292.) 

 
An
injunction may be granted “[w]hen pecuniary compensation would not afford
adequate relief.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
526, subd. (a)(4).)  “Specific
performance of a contract will not be compelled when an adequate remedy exists
at law, and if monetary damages afford adequate relief and are not extremely
difficult to ascertain, an injunction cannot be granted.”  (Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler
Motors Corp. (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 306.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff has attached a declaration to the Motion, indicating in relevant
part:
 
·        
In 1997, Plaintiff accepted a lifetime contract with
Gold’s Gym, where, in exchange for $135 up front, Plaintiff’s monthly dues
would be frozen at $29 per month. 
(Giannini Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
·        
In March 2023, Plaintiff “was denied gym admission
to Gold’s in Venice, CA., unless I began paying $100 per month dues, or more
than triple my previous rate.  I have
suffered severe emotional distress and physical injuries as direct consequences
of Gold’s breach of this contract.” 
(Giannini Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
·        
“I have lower back weaknesses that began many
years ago.  To combat this weakness, on
every gym visit, I perform 15 minutes of stomach and lower back exercises on a
machine that I have used for 20 years. 
This machine is only available at the Venice facility.  These exercises are preventative
maintenance.”  (Giannini Decl. ¶ 7.)
 
·        
“I was told that I could sign up for and work
out at the Gold’s Gyms in Culver City, Hollywood, and Playa del Vista and work
out there.  Travel to these locations
would triple my commuting time.” 
(Giannini Decl. ¶ 9.)[1]
 
Plaintiff
has therefore alleged that beginning March 2023, Gold’s Gym in Venice began
requiring that he pay $100 in monthly dues to access their facility.  In other words, Plaintiff is still able to
access the unique gym equipment he contends is only available in the Gold’s Gym
Venice location to do his preventative maintenance exercises to “combat [the]
weakness” in his lower back, so long as he pays $100 per month in dues.  This dispute therefore centers around the
amount of Plaintiff’s monthly dues.  But
easily ascertainable pecuniary damages alone, like those at issue here, cannot
substantiate a preliminary injunction. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated immediate or irreparable
harm that is nonpecuniary in nature, to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.[2]
As such, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
