[1] Plaintiff has also attached several unauthenticated
documents to the Reply brief, and on October 2, filed an “Exhibit List” of additional
unauthenticated exhibits in support of the motion.  The Court declines to consider this
evidence.  (See Jay v. Mahaffey
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538 [The “general rule of motion practice
[…] that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers” applies to requests
for preliminary injunction.])


[2] Because
the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established immediate or irreparable
nonpecuniary harm, it need not address whether Plaintiff is likely to prevail
on the merits.
