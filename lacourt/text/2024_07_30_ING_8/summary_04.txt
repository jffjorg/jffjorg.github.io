And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Tesla Motors, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in this case. The parties entered into a Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and Order Agreement that included an arbitration agreement, which requires disputes to be resolved through the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.

The judge found that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and does not violate any public policy. The unconscionability of the arbitration agreement was considered, but the judge found that it was low. The judge also found that the discovery limitations in the AAA rules do not rise to the level of substantive unconscionability.

The judge ordered that Defendant's motion to compel arbitration be granted, and that Tesla be required to give notice.
