And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and production of documents. The court is inclined to grant the compelled deposition for a date sooner than December 2024. The court will also discuss which of the 16 categories of documents remain at issue given the defendant's non-specific opposition on this aspect of the motion to compel.

The court notes that the defendant failed to provide a PMK witness for deposition and failed to provide alternative dates for the deposition despite being given multiple opportunities. The court finds that the plaintiff has made good faith efforts to meet and confer with the defendant prior to bringing this motion.

The court will entertain oral argument as to a reasonable time period for the defendant to gather responsive documents in advance of the PMK deposition, whenever it occurs. The court will also discuss the document production aspect of the motion to compel, as the defendant's opposition was minimal and did not address the specific categories of documents at issue.
