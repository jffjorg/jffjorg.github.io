roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiff
  - Defendant

significant_statements:
  - The defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
  - The burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.
  - The Court's review of the deposition testimony of Seargeant Barlin shows that he did not make any determination as to whether Mr. Gloth could have avoided the accident, and that he did not determine Mr. Gloth's speed before the accident occurred.
  - The doctrine of negligence per se is not a separate cause of action, but creates an evidentiary presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for negligence.
  - The Court Grants summary adjudication as to the alleged cause of action that is not a viable separate cause of action, but is a separate theory of negligence upon which recovery may be based.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Barry Alan Gloth. The ruling denies the motion for summary judgment, but grants summary adjudication as to the negligence per se claim.

The court's analysis focused on the elements of the negligence cause of action, including breach of duty and causation. The court found that Defendant Gloth had not met his initial burden of proof to establish that no triable issue of material fact exists as to the breach or causation elements. The court noted that the deposition testimony of Seargeant Barlin and Officer Valdez does not establish, as a matter of law, that Gloth did not violate Vehicle Code section 22350.

The court also analyzed the doctrine of negligence per se, finding that it is not a separate cause of action, but rather creates an evidentiary presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for negligence. The court granted summary adjudication as to the alleged cause of action that is not a viable separate cause of action, but is a separate theory of negligence upon which recovery may be based.

The court ordered that Plaintiffs provide notice of the tentative ruling.
