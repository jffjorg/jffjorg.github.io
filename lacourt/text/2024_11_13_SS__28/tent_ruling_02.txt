D.   Notice of settlement and petition for approval of
minor’s compromise 
On
February 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On October
17, 2024, Petitioner Eddy Rodriguez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve
the compromise of Plaintiff’s action.  The petition was set for hearing on November 13, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor
Plaintiff Mark-Anthony Rodriguez. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition provides the following information: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $5,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $21,170.53
Medical
expenses paid:                                  $603.80 (paid by Medi-Cal)
Reductions:                                                    $348.60
          To be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:            $255.20 (to satisfy Medi-Cal lien)
          Liens:                                                             $0
          Attorney’s fees:                                             $0
          Costs:                                                             $0
          Net balance:                                                   $4,744.80
 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $21,170.53.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that the
total medical expenses were reduced by $348.60. 
This should mean that the remaining amount ($20,821.93)
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the petition
states that only $255.20 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  The Court cannot approve a
petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or
reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
The
Court has reviewed counsel’s declaration. 
The declaration does not resolve the issue of Section 12a’s failure to
show that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced (i.e., $20,821.93)
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
A statement
from Huntington Hospital attached to the petition suggests that the hospital
may have reduced its charges by $19,004.69. 
If the hospital reduced its charges, the reduction amount should be
listed in Section 12a(3) of the petition. 
Although
Medi-Cal has agreed to accept $255.20 to satisfy its lien, Petitioner erroneously
lists “$0” as the lien amount in Section 12a(5) of the petition.  Petitioner has not filled out Section 12b(5)(b) of the petition. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Mark-Anthony Rodriguez’s claims filed by Petitioner Eddy Rodriguez on
October 17, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
