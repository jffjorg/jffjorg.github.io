On

On

the City’s demand for inspection and production of documents, set one, and for
sanctions and (2) a motion to compel Contreras’ responses to special
interrogatories and form interrogatories and for sanctions. (The City should

providing the date of Contreras’s death, (2) providing a death certificate if
one exists, (3) providing the date Contreras’s counsel learned of Contreras’s
death, and (4) stating whether counsel plans to dismiss Contreras from the case
or seek appointment of a successor-in-interest to pursue Contreras’s claims. 
On

PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
The
City asks the Court to compel Contreras to serve full and complete verified
responses, without objections, to the City’s demand for inspection and
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The
City also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Contreras and her counsel. 
Contreras
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
July 18, 2023, the City served demand for inspection and production of
documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories,
set one, on Contreras.  On September 19,
2023, Contreras served unverified responses to the inspection demand and
interrogatories. 
Arguing
that the unverified responses are the equivalent of no responses, the City asks
the Court to order Contreras to serve verified responses.  In opposition, counsel for Contreras asks the
Court to deny the motions because, “[o]n information and belief,” Contreras
recently passed away.  In its reply, the
City asks the Court to impose sanctions on Contreras’s counsel for failing to
advise the City of Contreras’s death before the City filed its motions to
compel. 
In
Contreras’s counsel’s declaration filed on November 7, 2024, counsel states
that (1) he joined the law firm that represents Contreras on or about February 5,
2024, (2) he is not the attorney who drafted Contreras’s discovery responses, (3)
he did not know that Contreras’s discovery responses were unverified and did
not know that Contreras had passed away when he received the City’s meet and
confer letter on August 14, 2024, (4) it “appears” that Contreras passed away
on February 8, 2024, (5) “it appears” that he learned on September 4, 2024 that
Contreras had passed away, and (5) he plans to amend the complaint. 
Counsel
does not state whether he attempted to determine if any other attorney at his firm
learned about Contreras’s death before September 4, 2024. 
The
Court denies the City’s motions without prejudice.  If the City determines that an attorney at the firm which represented Contreras knew, before the City filed its motions, that Contreras had passed away,
the City may renew its request for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to compel
Plaintiff Carmen Velasquez-Contreras’s
responses to demand for inspection and production of documents, set one, and
for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to compel
Plaintiff Carmen Velasquez-Contreras’s responses to special interrogatories,
set one, and for sanctions.

Plaintiff Carmen Velasquez-Contreras’s responses to form interrogatories, set
one, and for sanctions.
