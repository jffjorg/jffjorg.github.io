PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to extend the length of Plaintiff’s deposition by seven hours. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.290 provides in part: 
“(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), or by any
court order, including a case management order, a deposition examination of the
witness by all counsel, other than the witness’ counsel of record, shall be
limited to seven hours of total testimony. The court shall allow additional
time, beyond any limits imposed by this section, if needed to fairly examine
the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance
impedes or delays the examination. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.290,
subd. (a).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.290, subdivision (a), “makes the seven-hour
limit merely presumptive and applicable only if the court does not order
otherwise.”  (Certaineed Corp. v.
Superior Court (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1053 (Certaineed), superseded
on other grounds by statute as stated in Cahill Construction Corp., Inc. v.
Superior Court (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 777, 786-788.)  The
provision “require[es] the court to allow additional time to examine a deponent
‘beyond any limits imposed by this section’ if additional time is ‘needed to
fairly examine the deponent....’ ”  (Certaineed,
supra, 222 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061.) 
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
asks the Court to add seven hours to the length of Plaintiff’s deposition
because Defendant did not finish its examination of Plaintiff at the June 24,
2024 and July 3, 2024 sessions of Plaintiff’s deposition.  Defendant contends that “frequent speaking
objections and use of an interpreter . . . reduced [Defendant’s] ability to
complete its examination of [Plaintiff].” 
(Motion p. 2.)  Defendant estimates that the need to repeat questions and answers in Spanish
and English “reduced the amount of time for questions by at least half.”  (Motion p. 7.)  Defendant also argues that “the sheer number
of objections and tone was disruptive” and delayed Plaintiff’s examination.  (Motion p. 8.) 
According to Defendant, it still needs to examine Plaintiff about “her
relationship with daughter Melanie Ramos (‘Decedent’),” “Decedent’s history of
drug use and purchases on or off campus” (Motion p. 5), “Decedent’s
relationship with Plaintiff’s live-in boyfriend, Bulmaro Diaz” (Motion p. 12) and other issues. 
Plaintiff
opposes the motion, arguing that Defendant’s counsel had sufficient time during
the two sessions of Plaintiff’s deposition to examine Plaintiff.  According to Plaintiff, Defendant’s counsel
caused any delays by asking poorly framed questions and questions about irrelevant and immaterial matters. 
The
Court has reviewed the excerpts from Plaintiff’s two deposition sessions, which are attached to the parties' papers.  The Court finds that Defendant has failed to
show that additional time, beyond the seven hours provided by Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.290, is “needed to fairly examine [Plaintiff]” or that “[Plaintiff],
another person, or any other circumstance impede[d] or delay[ed] the
examination . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.290, subd. (a).)  The
Court therefore denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s motion to extend
the length of Plaintiff Elena Perez’s deposition by seven hours. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
