And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, to extend the length of the plaintiff, Elena Perez's, deposition by seven hours. The defendant claims that it did not finish examining the plaintiff at the previous deposition sessions due to frequent speaking objections and the need to translate questions and answers into Spanish and English. The plaintiff, however, opposes the motion, arguing that the defendant's counsel had sufficient time to examine the plaintiff and that any delays were caused by poorly framed questions and irrelevant and immaterial matters. The judge finds that the defendant has failed to show that additional time is needed to fairly examine the plaintiff and denies the motion.
