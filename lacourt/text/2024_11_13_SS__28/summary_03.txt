And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Los Angeles's motions to compel Plaintiff Carmen Velasquez-Contreras's responses to demand for inspection and production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The motions were filed on August 22, 2024, and the City alleged that Contreras's responses were unverified and that her counsel failed to advise the City of Contreras's death before filing the motions. Contreras's counsel filed a declaration on November 7, 2024, stating that Contreras passed away on February 8, 2024, and that he did not know about the death until September 4, 2024. The judge found that the City's motions were denied without prejudice and that the City may renew its request for sanctions if it determines that an attorney at Contreras's law firm knew about the death before the City filed its motions.
