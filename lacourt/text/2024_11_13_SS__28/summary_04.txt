Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add claims against the defendant's employee. The plaintiff was injured on November 12, 2020, while walking down stairs at the Santa Monica Pier, which had a nail protruding from them. The plaintiff did not check the box alleging that the defendant's employees created the dangerous condition. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff should have sought to amend the complaint earlier. The judge found that the motion was timely and granted it, ordering the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint within 15 days. The judge also ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
