The Court has considered the petition for approval of the compromise of minor plaintiff Mark-Anthony Rodriguez's claims. The petition seeks approval of a settlement in the amount of $5,000.00, with a net balance of $4,744.80 after medical expenses and reductions. However, the Court finds that the petition fails to show that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The Court also notes errors in the petition, including the listing of a lien amount and the failure to fill out a section of the petition. Therefore, the Court denies the petition without prejudice and orders Petitioner to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
