And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for an accounting to determine reassignment of the assignment order regarding the motion filed by Defendant Jack Joseph Puig. The motion requests an order for accounting, turnover of Matador and Rose 99, payment of all funds necessary to bring the entities into compliance, and indemnification against tax liabilities. The Judge disagrees with Plaintiff's contention that this is an improper attempt to appeal the turnover order and finds that there is no basis for Defendant's demand that Plaintiff bring Rose 99 and Matador into tax compliance. The Judge orders Plaintiff to file a declaration with supporting evidence concerning the transactions and judgment calculation no later than 5 court days prior to the hearing. The purpose of the turnover was to assist Plaintiff in satisfying the judgment with Defendant's royalties, and once the judgment is satisfied in full, it would be a material change in circumstances to order a reassignment.
