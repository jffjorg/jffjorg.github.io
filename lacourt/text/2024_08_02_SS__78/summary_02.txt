And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for protective order sought by the defendants to prevent the deposition of Elsie I. Wynn, a 97-year-old woman who is bedridden and has dementia. The defendants argued that Wynn is not competent to be deposed due to her poor health and lack of mental and physical capacity. However, the Judge found that the defendants did not provide sufficient medical evidence to establish Wynn's incompetence and that the deposition would not be an exercise in futility. The Judge noted that the defendants' medical evidence was informal and contradicted by other evidence, and that the plaintiffs were willing to take Wynn's deposition at her home to accommodate her physical restrictions. The Judge concluded that there was no good cause to grant a protective order and denied the motion.
