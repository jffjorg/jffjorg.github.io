And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings in this case. The defendant, Doe School District, had argued that the case should be stayed until the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218) is determined, as the bill allows claims of childhood sexual assault to be brought regardless of how long the abuse occurred. The defendant also expressed concerns that a settlement may violate the law.

The plaintiff, LL John Doe MB, argued that staying the proceedings would be prejudicial, as it would delay the trial and potentially lead to the death of witnesses due to age. The plaintiff also noted that the decisions made by the Court of Appeals in the pending writs may not create a definitive ruling on the issue, and that the case may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

The judge agreed with the plaintiff, finding that staying the matter would be prejudicial and that there is no guarantee that the decisions made by the Court of Appeals would create a definitive ruling on the issue. The judge also noted that the case may be appealed to the Supreme Court, which would further delay the trial. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings.
