The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to amend the second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Minas Michael Avsharian, is seeking to amend the complaint to reduce the remaining breach of contract and negligence claims against the remaining defendants, James Wellbaum, Triwell Properties Inc., and 14936 Ventura LLC. The defendants have stipulated to the requested relief and do not intend to oppose the motion. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file the proposed third amended complaint within 20 days. The decision to grant the motion is based on the plaintiff's argument that there is good cause to amend the complaint due to the dismissal of co-defendants Arpy Gouloomian and RP&A LLC.
