Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Steve Kessedjian's Motion for Summary Judgment and alternative Summary Adjudication. The ruling is based on several procedural and substantive defects in Defendant's pleadings. Specifically, the judge found that Defendant's Separate Statement of Facts failed to identify specific causes of action, affirmative defenses, claims for damages, or issues of duty, and that Defendant's Memorandum of Points and Authorities exceeded 10 pages without a table of contents and table of authorities. Additionally, the judge found that Defendant's arguments and evidence failed to meet the burden of showing that no triable issue of fact exists on the first cause of action for fraud, and that Defendant's reliance on a handwriting expert's opinion and alleged evidence of foreclosure by non-party U.S. Bank was insufficient to meet the burden. The judge also noted that Plaintiff disputed the validity of the "Trust Transfer Grant Deed" and that Defendant's arguments and evidence failed to address the allegations of fraud and forgery. As a result, the judge denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication.
