[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER TO
  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 14, 2023



 
On March 23, 2023, Plaintiff
TL Veterans Construction, Inc. filed a fourth amended complaint (“4AC”) against
Defendant State National Insurance Company, Inc. and others.  
On
March 30, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the eighth cause of action.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
The
eighth cause of action alleges negligent misrepresentation.  “The essential elements of a count for intentional
misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent
to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.  [Citations.] 
The essential elements of a count for negligent misrepresentation are the
same except that it does not require knowledge of falsity but instead requires a
misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no reasonable grounds for believing
it to be true.  [Citations.]”  (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
217, 230-231.)  “Causes of action for intentional
and negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must
be pleaded with specificity.”  (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  “‘This particularity requirement necessitates
pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.’  [Citation.]”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.)
Defendant
argues that the claim lacks specificity. 
(Demurrer at p. 3.)  Plaintiff alleges
that State provided a certificate of insurance that names Plaintiff as an additional
named insured on the project.  (4AC ¶ 87.)  In reliance on this statement about Plaintiff
being as additional named insured under subcontractor JNH’s policy, Plaintiff hired
JNH to work on the project.  (4AC ¶ 90.)  Plaintiff would not have entered into the contract
without proof of actual insurance covering Plaintiff.  (4AC ¶¶ 86.) 
This sufficiently alleges the representation, justifiable reliance, and harm.
Defendant
also argues that “[a]s a matter of law, a certificate of insurance contains no representations
concerning the terms and conditions of an insurance policy and cannot provide a
basis for Plaintiff’s negligent misrepresentation claim.”  (Demurrer at p. 4.)  Therefore, “[a]s a matter of law, Plaintiff could
not and cannot rely on the certificate of insurance to provide the policy terms
and conditions.”  (Id. at p. 5.)  In this cause of action, Plaintiff is not relying
on the certificate of insurance to prove coverage.  Instead, Plaintiff alleges that because of Defendant’s
representation within the certificate—that Plaintiff was an additional named insured—it
relied on that representation and entered into a subcontract with JNH.
Finally,
Defendant argues that “the negligent misrepresentation claim cannot rest on the
unsupported conclusion that State National knew the subject project involved a hospital.”  (Demurrer at p. 5.)  The Certificate of Liability Insurance that was
allegedly produced by Defendant expressly states: “TL Veterans Construction Inc.
is listed as additional insured.  Project
: DSH-Metropolitan SNF Building Roof Replacement[.]  11401 Bloomfield Ave., Norwalk, CA 90650.”  (4AC, Notice of Errata, Ex. 2.)  Accordingly, the claim can rest on an allegation
that Defendant knew that the roofing project was for the Skilled Nursing Facility
of the Department of State Hospitals.  (See
4AC ¶ 12.)
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
