Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling overruling the demurrer filed by the defendant to the eighth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. The plaintiff, TL Veterans Construction, Inc., alleges that the defendant, State National Insurance Company, Inc., provided a certificate of insurance that stated the plaintiff was an additional named insured on a project. The plaintiff relied on this representation and entered into a subcontract with JNH. The defendant argued that the claim lacks specificity and that the certificate of insurance does not provide a basis for the negligent misrepresentation claim. The judge found that the claim sufficiently alleges the representation, justifiable reliance, and harm, and that the plaintiff is not relying on the certificate of insurance to prove coverage. The judge also found that the claim can rest on an allegation that the defendant knew that the roofing project was for the Skilled Nursing Facility of the Department of State Hospitals. The demurrer is therefore overruled, and the defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
