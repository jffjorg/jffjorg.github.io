Significant Statements:
  - The court accepts the disbarment of F. Bari Nejadpour, but declines to address the alleged suspension of business operations for purposes of determining standing within the confines of the subject motion.
  - The motion lacks a proof of service.
  - The court finds the subject items demonstrate insufficient prejudice warranting a terminating sanction, thereby leading to a default on the entire action.
  - The court hesitantly imposes terminating sanctions, where the result leads to a potential windfall for the prevailing party and an effective “avoidance of a decision on the merits.”
