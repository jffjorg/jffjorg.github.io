SUMMARY
OF ACTION 
Plaintiff
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. alleges Defendant Shahrzad Shahili failed to pay
for outstanding legal services rendered in association with a marital
dissolution. Plaintiff alleges an outstanding balance of $32,555.57. 
 
On
July 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Quantum
Meruit for Services Rendered, Account Stated, Book Account, and Fraud.
Defendant answered the complaint on October 17, 2022, and filed a
cross-complaint against F. Bari Nejadpour, Susan Winchester, and Law Offices of
L.A. Law, Inc. on October 18, 2022, for Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach of Contract,
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress. 
 
On
December 15, 2022, the court denied the motion to
strike the one day after the answer filed cross-complaint. On January 30, 2023,
the court sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint with leave to amend. A
first amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, was filed on February 27, 2023. 
 
On April 20, 2023,
the court struck the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint. On May 30,
2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint.
 
On June 20, 2023,
the second amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress was filed. On
September 21, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer to the third and fourth
causes of action, and sustained the demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint
for the first, second and fifth causes of action. 
 
On November 20,
2023, the third amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, and Breach
of Contract, was filed. On January 16, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer
to the Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Breach of Contract, causes of action
without leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of
action for fraud and deceit. Cross-Defendants answered the third amended
cross-complaint on February 15, 2024. 
 
RULING:
Denied.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. presents a
motion for terminating sanctions only, with no alternative request for issue,
evidentiary, or monetary sanctions. The motion comes due to the failure to
comply with the order compelling further responses to Form Interrogatories (set
one), numbers 15.1 and 17.1 from Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Shahrzad Shahili.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant submitted a declaration presenting a June 28, 2024,
order of disbarment of F. Bari Nejadpour. The declaration represents LA Offices
of LA Law, Inc. ceased operations on July 1, 2024. Defendant/Cross-Complainant
therefore challenges the motion on grounds of lack of standing.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant challenges any imposition of terminating sanctions
as overly drastic. Plaintiff in reply challenges of a lack of any meaningful
meet and confer efforts. Plaintiff defends its right to proceed with the case,
and challenges the order for disbarment as inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiff
maintains the responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1 were “intentionally
improper” thereby supporting the motion. Finally, Plaintiff challenges any
request for monetary sanctions by Defendants.
 
The
court accepts the disbarment of F. Bari Nejadpour, but declines to address the
alleged suspension of business operations for purposes of determining standing
within the confines of the subject motion.
 
The
motion lacks a proof of service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiff untimely filed a proof of service representing
personal service on August 15, 2024—the last possible day to effect service.
The court accepts the late filed proof service given the declaration in
opposition concedes to service. The court addresses the merits of the motion.
 
Following
the May 2, 2024, order compelling further responses to form interrogatories
15.1 and 17.1, Defendant served the following response to number 15.1: 
 
Supplemental
Response to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1: 
1. Plaintiff
re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 31 as they are fully restated herein in this
cause of action. NEJADPOUR made the following representation to SHAHILI: a.
That NEJADPOUR will get SHAHILI at least $1,000,000.00 from her former husband,
being that she has a great case. Until Nejadpour filed and served his complaint
against Shahili in 2022, and Susan Winchester, Nejadpour's former associate
approached SHAHILI and disclosed facts and events as to her dissolution case,
SHAHILI did not know that at the time of settlement, NEJADPOUR had financial
difficulties and was desperate to settle SHAHILI'S case so that he can get his
fees paid. Had SHAHILI known the above facts, she would not have filed her
complaint in a timely manner and prior to the one-year statute of limitation.
b. That NEJADPOUR will be assisted by WINCHESTER who is a very experienced
Family Law Trial Attorney. Clearly, until the facts were disclosed to Shahili
by Winchester recently, SHAHILI was unaware that Winchester had been hired to
represent the client, during the suspension of Nejadpour's license by the State
Bar of California and Winchester had no family law experience at all. c. The
total litigation fees and costs charges will not exceed $25,000.00. Prior to
the filing of the complaint by Plaintiff, SHAHILI was unaware of the charges by
Cross-Defendants, until she was sued by Plaintiff since no bills were ever
given to Shahili prior to the filing and serving of Plaintiff's Complaint. d.
At the initial meeting with NEJADPOUR, SHAHILI, whose ability to read or write
English is limited, was told by NEJADPOUR to sign various documents in order
for the Cross-Defendants to represent her. Cross-Defendant did not bother to
explain any of the terms or contents of said document to SHAHILI, before
SHAHILI was told to sign the above documents in order for NEJADPOUR to
represent her. It was not until the complaint by Cross-Defendants was filed and
served that SHAHILI discovered that the documents that she had signed were a
retainer agreement and related documents which are attached hereto marked as
EXHIBIT "A". e. On November 18, 2019, or anytime thereafter, neither
NEJADPOUR nor anyone else told SHAHILI that State Bar of California had filed
action against NEJADPOUR to disbar or suspend NEJADPOUR's license. In fact,
NEJADPOUR had hired attorney WINCHESTER, who had no prior family law experience
order to represent SHAHILI during his suspension period. Furthermore, NEJADPOUR
never told SHAHILI that WINCHESTER had no family law experience and was only hired
by NEJADPOUR in order to mislead the State Bar of CA into believing that he
would not practice law during his suspension. Additionally, NEJADPOUR had
neither told WINCHESTER that she was hired for the purpose of misleading the
State Bar of CA nor had he told her that he would continue practicing law and
bill his clients during his suspension. 2. Plaintiff, defendant, Susan
Winchester, and Plaintiff's other employees unknown to defendant. 3. a.
Defendant's billing statement. b. Defendant's retainer. c. Other documents to
be identified during discovery.”
 
Defendant
apparently served no supplemental request to number 17.1, as ordered by the
court.
 
“Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119
citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) A prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal
sanction is that the party has willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young
v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) Preventing parties
from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic measure; terminating
sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance
with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would not be
effective.  (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1326; Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell¿(2017)
18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191 [“Terminating sanctions are to be used sparingly
because of the drastic effect of their application.”].) “The trial court
may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the
totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores,
Inc. v. Gomez¿(2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)  
 
A
prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal sanction is that the party has
willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) “Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119
citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) Preventing parties from presenting their cases on the
merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be ordered when
there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a
less severe sanction would not be effective. 
(Link v. Cater (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326.)
 
“The discovery statutes
thus ‘evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of termination.’ (Citation.) Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure (Citations), a
terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society
of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving that a discovery violation was not
willful is on the party on whom the discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa
Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.)
 
The
court adheres to a policy of robust discovery in order to facilitate the
parties’ presentation of their best, thereby allowing a fair prosecution and
defense of the action. In cases of extreme practice, the court will follow the
progression of evidentiary and issue sanctions, with terminating sanctions only
reserved for the most extreme of cases, as well established in the standard.
The court hesitantly imposes terminating sanctions, where the result leads to a
potential windfall for the prevailing party and an effective “avoidance of a
decision on the merits.” (See Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238
Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194.)
 
The
court finds the subject items demonstrate insufficient prejudice
warranting a terminating sanction, thereby leading to a default on the entire
action. While the responses are somewhat non-responsive and incomplete in that
Defendant fails to systematically identify and categorically respond by
affirmative defense, material information was presented. Again, Plaintiff
elected to forego seeking any issue and evidentiary sanctions. The motion for
terminating sanctions is therefore DENIED.
 
Trial remains set for September 23,
2024. The discovery and discovery motion cutoff is now in effect. The court
will NOT extend any such deadlines or cutoffs even if a trial date continuance
is sought. Any cessation of operations and assignment of rights on the subject
action may be addressed at the time of the FSC on September 12, 2024.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice.
