The party filing the complaint or cross complaint shall not make any change to the complaint or cross complaint other than those required to correct the errors which caused the document to be rejected.”  (CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E).) Plaintiff provides the declaration of her counsel, Arick Fudali, Esq. Mr. Fudali states that Plaintiff submitted her complaint and supporting document to the court’s e-filing platform on December 29, 2023 through the electronic service provider USA Express Legal & Investigative Services, Inc. (“EFSP”).  (Fudali Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.)  On December 29, 2023 at 4:47 p.m. Plaintiff’s paralegal, Deondra Richardson, received a court e-file Order Confirmation via email from EFSP indicating that Plaintiff’s December 29, 2023 filing had “been electronically transmitted to the court today (Fri, Dec 29, 2023).”  (Id., Ex. 6, Ex. A.)   On January 2, 2024, Ms. Richardson received an email from EFSP that Plaintiff’s December 29, 2023 filing had been rejected.  (Id., ¶7, Ex. B [rejection email], Exs. C-F [attached complaint, notice of e-filing rejection, civil case cover sheet, and summons].)  The notice of rejection indicated that the Court received the documents on December 29, 2023 at 4:47 p.m. and that Defendants’ names varied throughout the summons, complaint, and e-filing portal.  (Id., ¶8, Ex. D.)  Mr. Fudali states that the only variation he saw was that the complaint’s caption listed as a defendant “ANIBAL MICHAEL LOPEZ, individually and in his official capacity as a police officer for the Los Angeles Police Department,” but the summons listed him only as “ANIBAL MICHAEL LOPEZ.”  (Id., ¶9.)  He states that Ms. Richardson was not in the office on January 2, 2024 and did not view the rejection email until January 3, 2024.  (Id., ¶10.)  Ms. Richardson then proceeded to update the December 29, 2023 filing to cure the stated reason in the rejection and refiled the documents on January 3, 2024 at 9:19 a.m.  (Id., ¶11, Ex. G.)  The January 3, 2024 updated filing was accepted by the Court on January 3, 2024 at 10:57 a.m.  (Id., ¶12, Ex. H.)  The Court finds that there is substantive merit to granting this motion.  The Court will toll the statute of limitations from December 29, 2023 to January 3, 2024. As indicated above, City and Officer Lopez do not oppose this motion.  The motion is granted. CONCLUSION AND ORDERPlaintiff Lisa Alfonso’s motion for an order tolling the statute of limitations on Plaintiff’s causes of action is granted.  The statute of limitations is tolled from December 29, 2023 (when the complaint was initially filed and then later rejected) to January 3, 2024 (when the complaint was refiled and accepted after curing the defects).
