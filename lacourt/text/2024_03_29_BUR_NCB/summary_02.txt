And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions to compel initial responses filed by Plaintiff IRENE GARCIA and has denied all of them. The motions were filed because Defendant SMART & FINAL LLC failed to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner. However, the judge finds that the responses were eventually provided on March 20, 2024, making the motions moot. The judge also denied Plaintiff's motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted. Finally, the judge denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,810 for each motion, but noted that the court would consider awarding sanctions in the future if there are further discovery delays and issues.
