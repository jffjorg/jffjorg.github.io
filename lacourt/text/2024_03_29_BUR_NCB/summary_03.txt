And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, Tanesha S. B. Wilson. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant, Kimura Enterprise, Inc. dba Susi Stop, to provide further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 5, 10, 12, and 20. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the home address and telephone numbers of its employees constitute an invasion of privacy and would violate the rule against ex parte communications.

The judge grants the motion as to SROG Nos. 5 and 12, which ask for the address and telephone number of Max Soto, the store manager, and the name, address, and telephone number of the person who was in an altercation with the plaintiff. The judge also grants the motion as to SROG No. 20, which asks if the defendant condones the actions of the person who was in an altercation with the plaintiff.

However, the judge denies the motion as to SROG No. 10, which asks if the defendant condones the actions of Max Soto involving the plaintiff. The judge finds that the complaint fails to allege what actions Max Soto undertook for the defendant, and the special interrogatory is too vague.

The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses within 20 days of notice of this order.
