And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to stay execution of a default judgment filed by Defendant LBN TV Networks LLC. The Plaintiff, AVB Studio City, LP, had filed an unlawful detainer complaint against the Defendant, alleging that the Defendant had failed to pay rent and was in default. The Judge notes that the Defendant, a corporate entity, cannot represent itself and that the papers filed by the Defendant are not proper. The Judge also notes that the Defendant is in default and that the motion to stay is improper as the Defendant is a defaulted party. The Judge further notes that the motion is not accompanied by a proof of service, and therefore, the Plaintiff did not have notice of the motion to stay or the hearing on the motion. Based on these reasons, the Judge has stricken the motion for a stay and taken it off-calendar. The Judge orders that if the Defendant intends to defend this action, it must retain an attorney to represent it.
