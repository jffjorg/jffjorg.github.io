And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery responses filed by Plaintiff Syomara Perl against Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Plaintiff filed the motion on February 21, 2024, seeking to compel Defendant to provide initial responses to discovery requests served on October 31, 2023. The Defendant served unverified responses with objections on January 22, 2024, and requested additional time to provide additional responses. The judge finds that the Defendant's responses are not in compliance with California law, but notes that the Defendant has represented that it will provide substantive responses with objections before the hearing. The judge denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses and instead recommends that the Plaintiff file a separate motion to compel further responses detailing why the Defendant's objections lack merit. The judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
