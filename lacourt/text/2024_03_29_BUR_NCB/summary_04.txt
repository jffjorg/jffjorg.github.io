And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite being served on November 14, 2023, and despite the plaintiff's counsel sending a letter requesting a response on January 22, 2024. The defendant's counsel has forwarded the discovery requests to the defendant but has not received a response. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of notice of this order.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $620, which consists of $500 in reasonable attorney's fees and $120 in filing fees. The judge has ordered the defendant to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff by and through counsel within 20 days of notice of this order.

The judge has also noted that the defendant's counsel has been cooperative with the plaintiff's counsel and has been communicating with the plaintiff about reaching a settlement, and therefore has requested that sanctions not be imposed against counsel.
