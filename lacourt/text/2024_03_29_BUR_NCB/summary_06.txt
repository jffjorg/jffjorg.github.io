And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Emerson Mikasa's motion for an order granting preference in trial setting. The Plaintiff, who is a minor, is seeking to expedite the trial due to his age and the severity of his injuries. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 36(b), which mandates a trial preference for minor plaintiffs who are under the age of 14 unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case.

The judge grants the motion for trial preference and sets a new trial date for July 29, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. The judge also sets a new Final Status Conference date for July 18, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. All discovery, motion, and expert cut-off dates will be calendared from the new trial date.
