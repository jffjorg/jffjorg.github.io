And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the production of documents responsive to request for production of documents nos. 22 and 23. The plaintiffs had objected to the requests, citing overbreadth, vagueness, and other issues, but had also agreed to produce non-privileged responsive documents. However, despite this representation, the plaintiffs have not produced any documents. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to produce documents responsive to the requests and/or a privilege log within 20 days of notice of this order.
