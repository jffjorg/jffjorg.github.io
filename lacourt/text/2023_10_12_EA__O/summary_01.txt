And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, BMO HARRIS BANK N.A., is seeking to recover a loan and security agreement from the defendants, SUN LOGISTICS INC and ANNIE YEH. However, the judge has denied the application because the interest computation provided by the plaintiff is usurious. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a supplemental declaration that provides a correct computation of interest, and the court may grant the application at the hearing if the supplemental declaration is filed.
