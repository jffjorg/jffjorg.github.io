And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to consolidate cases 21STCV13383 and 21STCV26619. The motion is denied without prejudice because the cases are not in the same department. The Judge notes that the cases were deemed related on October 7, 2021, and were assigned to different departments. The Defendant has not filed the necessary notice of motion to consolidate in the related case 21STCV26619, and therefore has not complied with the California Rules of Court. The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent adjudications. However, in this case, the motion cannot be granted due to the cases being in different departments.
