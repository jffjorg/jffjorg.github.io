And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants defendant H.M. Investments, Inc.'s motion to compel a second independent medical examination (IME) of plaintiff Maria Luisa Obando Balladares. The defendant argues that good cause exists to compel the plaintiff to submit to an orthopedic examination of her knee, as she has claimed injuries to her neck and spine and is now alleging that her knee injuries may require surgery. The court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the second IME, as the examination involves the examination and testing of a different injury (the knee) than the first IME (neck and back), and the proposed independent medical examiner specializes in knees. The court orders the plaintiff to submit to an independent medical examination with Dr. Scott K. Forman, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in knee injuries, on April 5, 2024, at 1:30 p.m., at 360 San Miguel Suite 701, Newport Beach, CA 92660.
