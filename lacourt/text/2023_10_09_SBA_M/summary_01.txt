And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel non-party deponents Anphon Medical Center and Medvantage Orthocare, LLC to comply with deposition subpoenas issued by defendant Don's Frozen Express, Inc. The court has granted the motion, ordering that Anphon Medical Center and Medvantage Orthocare, LLC comply with the deposition subpoenas within 15 days. The court's decision is based on the fact that the subpoenas were properly served and that the deponents failed to respond. The court also found that defendant has shown good cause for the motion. The court notes that medical records are protected by the right to privacy, but the court must balance this right against the need for discovery in the litigation. The court concludes that the subpoenas are necessary to achieve a fair resolution of the lawsuit, and therefore, the motions are granted.
