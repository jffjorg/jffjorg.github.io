  Case Number:  19STCV24643    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  74 Colorado
Seasons, Inc. v. Norman Yatooma, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant Norman Yatooma & Associates to Appear
for Deposition and Request for Sanctions
 
            The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
The
court orders defense counsel to appear at the hearing with four proposed dates at
which defendant Norman Yatooma & Associates can appear for its deposition.
The
court denies plaintiff’s request for a discovery referee.
The
court orders defendant to pay plaintiff $3,600 (8 hrs x $450/hr) in attorney’s
fees as discovery sanctions by November 30, 2023. Plaintiff’s request to recover
fees for 41.5 hours of legal work is unreasonable for a motion that, as
plaintiff notes, amounts to selecting a date for defendant to appear for its
deposition.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
