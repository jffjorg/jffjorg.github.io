The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply to the Defendants' demurrer. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the Plaintiff's complaint, alleging breach of contract and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court finds that the Plaintiff has not complied with the Tort Claims Act, has not alleged any facts supporting her breach of contract claim, and has not followed the proper procedure to challenge the termination of her housing assistance benefits. The court grants the Defendants' demurrer with leave to amend, and the Plaintiff is given 30 days to file an amended complaint.
