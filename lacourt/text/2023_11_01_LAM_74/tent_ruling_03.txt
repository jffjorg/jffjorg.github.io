 Case Number:  23STCV04761    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  74 Sonya Howard v. Norma Serena, et al.
Defendants’ Demurrer
The court considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            On
March 2, 2023, Plaintiff Sonya Howard (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendants Norma Serena and HACLA Housing Authority of Los Angeles, California
(Defendants). The complaint alleges breach of contract.
            On
August 1, 2023, Defendants filed this demurrer.  
LEGAL STANDARD          
            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not admit contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) 
DISCUSSION  
Tort Claims Act
            In support of their demurrer,
Defendants first argue the complaint does not allege facts showing Plaintiff
complied with the Tort Claims Act. A party cannot sue a public entity, such as
Defendant HACLA, for money or damages until a written claim has been presented
to the public entity and acted upon or rejected by the board. (Gov. Code, §
945.4.) This also applies to public entity employees, such as Defendant Norma
Serena. (Gov. Code, § 950.2.) Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she has
complied with the applicable claims statue by checking the relevant box on the
form complaint.
Breach of Contract
            Defendants contend Plaintiff has not
alleged any facts supporting her breach of contract claim. The elements for
this cause of action are as follows: (1) existence of a contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance (or excuse for nonperformance), (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) resulting damages. (Professional Collection Consultants v. Lujan (2018)
23 Cal.App.5th 685, 690.) The complaint alleges a contract was formed on
January 14, 2023. But Plaintiff has not named the parties to the contract. Nor
has Plaintiff provided the relevant contractual terms or a copy of the contract
so the court may assess whether a breach occurred. In addition, Plaintiff has
not alleged any facts supporting Defendants’ supposed breach. 
Failure to Exhaust Administrative
Remedies
            Defendants point out that Plaintiff
was terminated from the Section 8 program because she failed to provide
necessary documents at an annual review. Defendants argue that, to the extent Plaintiff
is challenging this termination, she has not followed the proper procedure. The
Code of Federal Regulations provides Plaintiff with an administrative remedy
from Defendants, in this case a hearing before termination. (24 C.F.R., §
982.555, subds. (a) & (e).) Exhaustion of administrative remedies is
necessary before a plaintiff can resort to the courts. (Fiscus v. Department
of Alcoholic Beverage Control (1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 234, 236.) Here,
Plaintiff has not alleged that she sought or attended an administrative
hearing.
Petition of Writ of Administrative
Mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5
 
            Defendants
argue that if Plaintiff is challenging the termination of housing assistance
benefits, her sole remedy is a petition for writ of administrative mandamus. Here,
Plaintiff was entitled to a hearing about the termination. (24 C.F.R., §
982.555, subds. (a) & (e).) Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (Section
1094.5) provides that it is the requirement of an administrative hearing that
triggers the availability of mandamus review. (Pomona College v. Superior
Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1716, 1729.) Section 1094.5 is the exclusive vehicle
for judicial review of the quasi-adjudicatory administrative action of a
local-level agency. (City of Santee v. Superior Court (1991) 228
Cal.App.3d 713, 718.) If Plaintiff contests the termination, she must follow
the applicable procedures. (Code Civ. Proc., §§1094.5 and 1094.6.)
CONCLUSION 
            Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend.
            Plaintiff
may file an amended complaint within 30 days of this order.
            Defendants shall give notice.
