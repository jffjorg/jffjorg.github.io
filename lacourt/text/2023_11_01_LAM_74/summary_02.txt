Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the defendants, Tommy Wang, et al. The defendants seek to strike several paragraphs and exhibits from the FAC, alleging that they are irrelevant, false, or improper.

The court has denied the defendants' motion to strike paragraphs 21 and 1, which refer to an unsigned settlement agreement and the agreement itself, respectively. The court finds that the agreement is relevant to the case and is not being used to prove liability.

The court has granted the defendants' motion to strike paragraphs 50, 56, 62, 68, and 76, as well as certain lines of the FAC, which relate to punitive damages. The court finds that the allegations in the FAC do not sufficiently support an award of punitive damages.

The court has also granted the defendants' motion to strike paragraph 102 and certain lines of the FAC, which relate to attorney's fees. The court finds that the FAC does not allege a basis for recovery of attorney's fees.

The court grants the defendants' motion to strike with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the FAC with the requested changes.
