And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Accutec, Inc. dba Accutec Blades, Inc.'s application for a right to attach order and order for issuance of writ of attachment against Defendant Traxx Corporation. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant owes $100,465.58 for merchandise sold and delivered, but Defendant contests the existence of the contract and the amount of the debt. The court finds that the Plaintiff has not shown the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based, as the Plaintiff has failed to provide admissible evidence demonstrating that it is more likely than not that it will obtain a judgment against Defendant on the contract claim.
