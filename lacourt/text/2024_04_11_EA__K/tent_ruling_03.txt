Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to submit a full and complete
application for default judgment. On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff submitted,
without more, a two-page affidavit and a proposed judgment. Plaintiff has not
provided the court with a brief summary of the case, as per California Rules of
Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(1). Plaintiff has not dismissed the
Doe Defendants, or applied for a separate Code of Civil Procedure § 579
judgment as against them, er per subdivision (a)(7). Plaintiff previously filed
a Judicial Council Form CIV-100 Request for Entry of Default on October 5,
2023; however, the amounts identified in Paragraphs 2 (i.e., $245,000.00 in
special damages and $650,000.00 in general damages) and 7 (i.e., $700.00 in costs)
do not correspond with the amounts sought in the proposed judgment (i.e.,
$100,000.00 in damages and $1,380.00 in costs).
2.                 
Plaintiff has not attached any documentary evidence to
her declaration regarding the accident and the cause thereof, nor as to her
contentions that CHL was Wen’s employer at the time of the accident, that the
vehicle Wen was driving was owned by CHL, that her car was a “total loss,” that
she received emergency treatment at the hospital “for cervical symptoms, along
with bruising, swelling and pain in [her] left leg, arm, and chest” and that
she incurred $25,000.00 in medical charges. (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶¶ 2-4 and 6).
Plaintiff attests that she has followed up with her primary physician and with
physical therapy but provides no medical records of her current condition or
provide any information as to any future medical specials.
