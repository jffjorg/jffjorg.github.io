  Case Number:  22PSCV00895    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Marjorie
Sobosky’s unopposed Motion to Substitute Personal Representative as
Plaintiff is GRANTED. 
Background   
Plaintiff Marjorie Sobosky (“Marjorie”)
alleges as follows:
On or about August 20, 2021, Marjorie was
hospitalized at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center (“PVHMC”). During Marjorie’s
hospitalization, PVHMC’s nursing and care staff failed to timely diagnose and
treat her obstructed bowel and UTI and failed to take pressure wound
precautions, which resulted in Marjorie developing a stage 4 ulcer. Marjorie was
also given blood thinners which caused bowel bleeding.
On February 2, 2023, Marjorie filed
a Second Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action against PVHMC and Does
1-50 for:
1.                 
Professional Negligence
2.                 
Reckless Neglect in Violation of Elder Abuse and
Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act
An Order to Show Cause Re: Why Sanctions Sho0uld Not Be
Imposed for Defendant’s Failure to Appear on February 26, 2024 is set for April
11, 2024.
A Post-Mediation Status Conference is set for November 5,
2024.
The Final Status Conference is set for November 19, 2024.
Trial is set for December 3, 2024.
Legal Standard
“On motion after the
death of a person who commenced an action or proceeding, the court shall allow
a pending action or proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the
decedent's personal representative or, if none, by the decedent's successor in
interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.31).
Discussion
Paul Eugene Sobosky (“Paul”), as
Marjorie’s duly appointed personal representative, moves the court for an order
allowing him to substitute in as plaintiff on this case.
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court rules on Paul’s Request for
Judicial Notice as follows: Granted as to Exhibit B (i.e., “Order for Probate”
entered August 10, 2023 in case styled Estate of Marjorie Faith Sobosky,
Case No. PR0882300842 [“Probate Action”]) and Granted as to Exhibit C (i.e.,
Letters Testamentary issued September 5, 2023 in the Probate Action). 
 
Merits
 
The motion was originally heard on
February 26, 2024; at that time, the court did not adopt its tentative ruling
and continued the hearing to April 8, 2024.
 
The court agrees with Paul’s assertion
that Code of Civil Procedure § 377.32[1]
is not applicable because he is seeking an order to prosecute the litigation as
a “personal representative” and not as a “successor in interest.” 
Paul has submitted a declaration,
wherein he attests that he is Marjorie’s successor in interest (Paul Decl., ¶
1); that Marjorie died on May 11, 2023 at San Antonio Regional Hospital, 999 San
Bernadino Road in Upland, California (Id., ¶ 2; see also “Notice of
Errata Relating to Exhibit A in Motion to Substitute Plaintiff”); that he was
appointed the executor of Marjorie’s will on August 10, 2023 and letters
testamentary were issued on September 5, 2023 (Id., ¶ 3, Exhs. B and C)
and that no other person has a superior right to continue this action or to be
substituted for the decedent in this pending action (Id., ¶ 4). 
The motion is granted.
