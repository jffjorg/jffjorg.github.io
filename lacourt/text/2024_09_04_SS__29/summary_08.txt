Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Walmart, finding that there are disputed issues of material fact that cannot be decided as a matter of law. The judge concludes that a finder of fact could reasonably infer that the item that fell on the plaintiff was not safely secured and displayed, and that Walmart either created the dangerous condition or had constructive knowledge of it. The judge also denies the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Sims, as she was previously dismissed from the action.
