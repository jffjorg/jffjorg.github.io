 Case Number:  21STCV00584    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  29 Clark v. City of Redondo Beach
21STCV00584
Motion for Reconsideration or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This case arises out of a tragic accident on October 8, 2019, in
which a vehicle driven by Jesus Manuel Gonzalez Cornejo (“Cornejo”) struck pedestrian
George Arthur Clark in or near the intersection of a sidewalk and a driveway of
Maderos Cocina Mexican Restaurant (“Restaurant”), which is located
at or near 231 S. Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach.  According to the complaint, Mr. Clark died
several months later from the injuries he sustained in the accident.
On January 7, 2021, Plaintiff Rosenda Ramirez Clark (“Plaintiff”) initiated
this wrongful death action against Defendants City of Redondo Beach (“City”), Rodolfo
Garcia Muro (“Muro”), Magdalena Garcia (“Garcia”), Restaurant, Adriatica
International Inc. (“Adriatica”), Cornejo, Martha Coronel and Santiago Coronel
(collectively, “Coronels”), and Does 1 through 100, asserting the following
causes of action: (1) premises liability against City; (2) premises
liability against Muro, Garcia, Restaurant, and Adriatica; and (3) motor
vehicle negligence against Cornejo and the Coronels.
In the period from June through August 2021, all of the named
defendants filed answers to the complaint.
On May 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal, with
prejudice, of the claims in the complaint against Muro, Garcia, and Restaurant.
In or about June or July 2023, Plaintiff settled with Adriatica.  On September 20, 2023, the Court granted
Adriatica’s motion for a good faith settlement determination.
In or about January or February 2024, Plaintiff settled with
Cornejo and the Coronels.  On April 11,
2024, the Court granted the application of Cornejo and the Coronels for a good
faith settlement determination.
A number of cross-complaints were also filed in this action; these
cross-complaints are not at issue in this motion.
The remaining parties in the suit are Plaintiff and City.
On September 25, 2023, City filed a Motion for Summary
Adjudication of the First Cause of Action, the only cause of action asserted
against City.  City also filed a Request
for Judicial Notice. The motion was noticed for hearing on December 22, 2023.  At the request of Plaintiff, the hearing was
continued to April 3, 2023.  
On March 20, Plaintiff filed her opposition to the motion.  On March 29, City filed its reply, along with
objections to Plaintiff’s evidence.
On the Court’s own motion, the hearing on City’s motion was
continued to April 16.
The motion was heard on April 16.  At the close of the hearing, the Court took
the motion under submission.  On June 4,
2024, the Court issues its ruling granting City’s motion.
On June 25, 2024, the Court entered judgment
against Plaintiff and in favor of City.
On July 2, Plaintiff filed this motion for
reconsideration or, in the alternative, for a new trial.  City filed its opposition on July 24, and
Plaintiff filed her reply on July 29.
The hearing was initially set for August 5 in
Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Effective August 5, however, the case was transferred to Department E of
the Torrance Courthouse.  On that date,
the Court set the hearing on this motion for September 4 at 1:30 pm in Department
29.
Legal Standard
Motion for Reconsideration 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides:
“When an application for an order has been made to
a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
“A motion for reconsideration may only be brought
if the party moving for reconsideration can offer ‘new or different facts,
circumstances, or law’ which it could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion. ... A motion for
reconsideration will be denied absent a strong showing of diligence." 
(Forrest v. Dep’t of Corporations (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202,
disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal. 4th
1164, 1172; see also Baldwin v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal.
App. 4th 1192, 1199 (noting that 1992 amendment to CCP §1008 tightened
diligence requirements); 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2024), ¶¶ 9:328-329.) 
“[M]otions to reconsider allow the trial court to
consider new facts or law relevant to its order.”  (Morton v. Wagner
(2007) 156 Cal. App. 4th 963, 973; accord Wiz Tech., Inc. v. Coopers &
Lybrand (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17-18.  Disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact
that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd
v.  AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.) 
A court may not grant a motion for reconsideration
after judgment has been entered.  (Branner
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1058; APRI Ins.
Co. v. Super. Ct. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176, 181.)  Once judgment has been entered, a party
seeking to challenge the order or the judgment in the trial court must proceed
through a motion for a new trial, a motion to vacate the judgment, or some
other statutorily authorized motion.  (APRI
Ins. Co., supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at p. 181; Ramon v. Aerospace Corp.
(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1238; 2 Weil & Brown, supra, ¶¶ 9:332.1-332.4.)
New Trial
Code of Civil Procedure section 657 provides, in
part:  
“The verdict may be vacated and any other decision
may be modified or vacated, in whole or in part, and a new or further trial
granted on all or part of the issues, on the application of the party
aggrieved, for any of the following causes, materially affecting the
substantial rights of such party: 
1. Irregularity in the proceedings of the court,
jury or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by
which either party was prevented from having a fair trial. 
2. Misconduct of the jury; and whenever any one or
more of the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or special
verdict, or to a finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a
resort to the determination of chance, such misconduct may be proved by the
affidavit of any one of the jurors. 
3. Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence
could not have guarded against. 
4. Newly discovered evidence, material for the
party making the application, which he could not, with reasonable diligence,
have discovered and produced at the trial. 
5. Excessive or inadequate damages. 
6. Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the
verdict or other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law. 
7. Error in law, occurring at the trial and
excepted to by the party making the application.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 657.)
Motions for new trial based on subdivisions (1)-(4) must be supported
by declarations (or affidavits), and the moving party bears the burden of
producing admissible evidence that establishes the specified ground for the
motion for new trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 658; Phipps v. Copeland
Corporation LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 319, 339; Barboni v. Tuomi
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 340, 345.)   
A party seeking relief under subdivision (6) must show that
there is no substantial evidence to sustain the verdict or other decision. (Musgrove
v. Ambrose Properties (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 44, 56.)  To sustain the
motion, the evidence must be without conflict in any material point and
insufficient as a matter of law to support the result. (Ibid.; Fergus v.
Songer (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 552, 567-69.)  And the court’s finding
must be “so inconsistent, ambiguous and uncertain that they are incapable of
being reconciled and it is impossible to tell how a material issue is
determined” to grant a new trial. (Renfer v. Skaggs (1950) 96 Cal.App.2d
380, 385; see also Shaw v. Hughes Aircraft Co. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
1336, 1344.)
A motion may be granted under subdivision (7) when the decision
is erroneous as a matter of law.  (Tun v. Wells
Fargo Dealer Servs., Inc. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 309, 323; Collins v.
Sutter Memorial Hosp. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1, 17-18; Ramirez v. USAA
Casualty Ins. Co. (1991) 234, Cal.App.3d 391, 397.) 
A notice of an
intention to motion for a new trial must generally be filed no later than 15
days after the mailing of the notice of entry of judgment by the clerk or
service by another party of the written notice of entry of judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 659, subd. (a)(2).)
Discussion
Motion for Reconsideration
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied for two
independent reasons.
First, the motion was filed after judgment was entered.  On that basis alone, the Court must deny the
motion.  (Branner
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1058; APRI Ins.
Co. v. Super. Ct. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176, 181; Ramon v. Aerospace
Corp. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1237-1238; 2 Weil & Brown, supra,
¶¶ 9:332.1-332.4.)
(To be clear, the Court is not ruling that the motion was untimely
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a).  Plaintiff has shown that the motion was filed
within 10 days service of written notice of the order.  (Graham Decl., ¶ 2.)  Rather, this ruling is based on the case law
holding that a trial court does not have the power to grant a motion or
reconsideration after entry of judgment.)
Second, and independently, even if judgment had not been entered
prior to the filing of the motion, the Court would still deny the motion on the
ground that Plaintiff does not offer any new facts or law.  The Court understands that Plaintiff disagrees
with the ruling, but a disagreement with a court’s ruling is not – without more
– a basis for a reconsideration motion under section 1008.
Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
Motion for New Trial
Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial is timely.  It was filed within 15 days after written
notice of entry of judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 659,
subd. (a)(2).)
Although Plaintiff’s motion is not clear on the grounds that
she is asserting for a new trial, the Court understands that Plaintiff is
moving under Code of Civil Procedure section 657, subdivisions (6) and (7),
arguing that the Court’s order is contrary to law and/or erroneous.  To the extent that Plaintiff is moving under
any other subdivision of section 657, the motion is denied on the ground that it
is not adequately supported and that no basis for relief has been shown in the
moving papers.
Plaintiff’s argument is essentially that the Court erred in
granting City’s motion for summary judgment because there were disputed issues
of material fact as to the elements of Plaintiff’s cause of action for a dangerous
condition of public property under Government Code section 835.
As set forth in more detail in the Minute Order dated June 4,
2024 (the “Order”), the Court granted City’s motion on three independent grounds.
First, the Court held that the allegedly dangerous condition
was not on property owned or controlled by City; rather, it was on privately
owned property within the geographical boundaries of the City of Redondo Beach,
and section 835 liability for a dangerous condition does not extend to conditions
on privately owned property simply because it is under the jurisdiction of a
public entity defendant and the public entity could have done, or not done,
something differently to address the allegedly dangerous condition on private
property.  (Order, at p. 7.) 
Second, and independently, the Court held that there was no dangerous
condition, whether on public or private property, that proximately caused the
accident.  To the contrary, although
Plaintiff alleged that the dangerous condition at issue obstructed the vision
of a driver exiting the driveway at the scene of the accident, on the facts here
the driver – Mr. Cornejo – testified that he could see “the whole sidewalk” and
nothing was blocking or obstructing his view. 
(Order, at pp. 8-9.)
Third, and independently, the Court held that Plaintiff’s
theory of liability was barred by statutory immunity under Government Code
sections 818.4 and 821.2.  (Order, at p.
10.)
In her motion for a new trial, Plaintiff does not address the
first and third independent bases for the Court’s ruling.  On that ground alone, the motion for new
trial is denied.
Moreover, even on the second basis for the Court’s ruling,
Plaintiff has not shown that the order was erroneous or contrary to law.  Plaintiff argues that before Mr. Cornejo
struck the decedent with his truck, Mr. Cornejo stopped his vehicle in the
driveway at a spot that blocked the sidewalk. 
(Motion, at p. 4.)  That is true,
but that is not when the accident occurred. 
Mr. Cornejo did not strike decedent when he initially drove his vehicle and
stopped within the intersection of the driveway and the sidewalk.  He struck decedent when, after stopping, he
began to move his truck forward so that he could enter Pacific Coast Highway
(PCH).  It was at that time that Mr.
Cornejo simply (and tragically) failed to see that the decedent was in front of
the truck and struck him.  Whatever else
might be true in theory about the existence or non-existence of an obstruction
or lack of visibility at other locations, on the facts here, at the site of
this accident, there was no obstruction of Mr. Cornejo’s vision.  Mr. Cornejo did not see that the decedent was
there, even though, according to his Mr. Cornejo’s own testimony, his vision
was not blocked or obstructed. 
Accordingly, at the time and place of the accident, there was no
dangerous condition of property (public or private) present.
Finally, at the very end of the motion, Plaintiff in two sentences
that the Court failed to consider that City never “refuted or denied” her “trap”
theory of liability, set forth in the Complaint, paragraph Prem-L-1g.  (Motion, at p. 7.)  But this paragraph of the Complaint does not
set forth a separate cause of action or theory of liability; in that paragraph,
Plaintiff simply alleges that City was on actual or constructive notice of the dangerous
condition (on private property) and improperly issued permits that created
and/or made wore the dangerous condition. 
Plaintiff did not oppose the summary judgment motion on the basis of
this being a separate cause of action, and, in any event, the Court’s reasoning
set forth in its Order, including all three independent grounds for the Court’s
ruling, applies with full force to this allegation as well.
Accordingly, the motion for a new trial is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration or, in
the alternative, for a new trial.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
