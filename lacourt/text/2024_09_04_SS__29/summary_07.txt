And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to appear for deposition without prejudice. The motion was filed after several prior attempts to take the defendant's deposition, and the parties had agreed to produce one or more persons most qualified (PMQs) for deposition. The judge notes that the motion is, to some extent, both moot and unripe, as the deposition notice that was the subject of the motion was previously scheduled but is now no longer relevant. The judge also notes that the parties may still have disagreements regarding the topics of examination and the requests for production set forth in the subsequent deposition notice. If the defendant fails to produce a PMQ to testify on any topic in the notice, or fails to produce any documents requested in the notice, the plaintiff may bring any appropriate motion after the deposition.
