And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff, Emmanuel Vazquez, had filed a complaint against Lyft, Inc., Doe Driver, and Does 1 through 100 for negligence arising from an automobile accident on March 25, 2019. The plaintiff's failure to timely post jury fees was inadvertent, and no opposition was filed. The court considered the factors outlined in TriCoast Builders, Inc. v. Fonnegra, including the timeliness of the request, whether the requester is willing to comply with applicable requirements for payment of jury fees, and the reasons supporting the request. The court found that granting relief from waiver would not result in any hardship to other parties or to the court and that the plaintiff's failure to timely post jury fees was not a deliberate tactical decision. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and to allow a trial by jury.
