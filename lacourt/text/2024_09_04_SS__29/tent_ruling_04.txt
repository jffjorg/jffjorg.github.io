 Case Number:  21STCV15566    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  29 Castillo v. Brooks
21STCV15566
Defendant’s Motion for Court to Issue Order to Show Cause and Set Hearing
regarding Contempt 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted, with some revisions to
the proposed order.
Background
According to the Complaint, on April 26,
2019, Plaintiff Rogelio Magana Castillo (“Plaintiff”)
met with Defendant Kimberly Brooks
(“Defendant”) at Zen Buffet in Monrovia, California.
Plaintiff alleges (among other things)
that Defendant “raised her glass of water towards Plaintiff, stared at him and
sta[r]ted yelling obscene words at Plaintiff right before she threw the glass
at Plaintiff from a distance of less than four (4) feet from Plaintiff.”
(Complaint, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff asserts (among other things) that the glass hit him
“on the left cheekbone area injuring Plaintiffs cheekbone, left eye socket and
left ear.” (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff filed the complaint against
Defendant and Does 1 through 50 on April 26, 2021,
alleging causes of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery.
Defendant filed her answer on November
15, 2022.
 
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
was relieved as counsel.  Since that
time, Plaintiff has been representing himself in pro per.
 
On May 24, 2024, Defendant filed a motion
for an Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt. No opposition has been filed. These motions were continued from June
25 to August 12. At the August 12 hearing, the Court noted Defendant did not
satisfy one procedural requirement, a proposed OSC that clearly identifies how
many counts of contempt are asserted and the basis for each charge. 
 
The
matter was continued to September 4.  Defendant
filed a new proposed OSC on August 14, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The following acts
or omissions in respect to a court of justice, or proceedings therein, are
contempts of the authority of the court: . . . (5)¿Disobedience of any lawful
judgment, order, or process of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1209, subd. (a)(5).)
“When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the
court or judge, a warrant of attachment may be issued to bring the person
charged to answer, or, without a previous arrest, a warrant of commitment may,
upon notice, or upon an order to show cause, be granted . . . .” (Code Civ.
Proc. §¿1212.)  
 
“The facts essential
to establish jurisdiction in the contempt proceeding are: (1) the making of the
order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability of the accused to render compliance,
and (4) willful disobedience of the order.” (Application of Ny¿(1962)
201 Cal.App.2d 728, 731.) “All elements of charged contempt must be averred in
affidavit of accuser and must be developed in the proofs.” (Id.) The
party seeking to have a person held in contempt has the burden of proving the
ability to comply beyond a reasonable doubt. (Application of Liu¿(1969)
273 Cal.App.2d 135, 141-42; In re Cassil¿(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1081,
1087.) 
 
Discussion
 
Contempt proceedings
are different from, and require far more procedure than, a standard
law-and-motion matter.  Because a
contempt places a person’s liberty at issue, these procedures must be strictly
followed.
 
The alleged contempt
at issue is an indirect contempt.  In
general, the first step in an indirect contempt proceeding is an application
for an issuance of an Order to Show Cause. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211, subd. (a).) 
The application must be supported by an affidavit or declaration that
sets forth the facts of the alleged contempt, and the moving party must submit
a proposed order (the proposed OSC re Contempt).  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211-1211.5; 2 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial [2023], ¶¶ 9:713-714.1.)  The application may be made through the ordinary
procedures for an ex parte application (including ex parte notice to opposing
counsel).  (2 Weil & Brown, supra,
¶ 714.2.)
 
If the application is
granted, the Court will then issue an OSC re Contempt that, among other things,
describes the alleged contempt and sets the date and time for a hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1212; 2 Weil & Brown,
supra, ¶ 9:715.)  (The Judicial Council
has published an OSC re Contempt form for use in family law cases; although
that form is not used in civil law cases, it may provide some guidance to
counsel in how to prepare an OSC re Contempt in a civil law matter.)  The moving/citing party must then serve the
OSC re Contempt and supporting affidavits/declarations on the cite/respondent
in the same manner as a service of summons – usually personal service.  (Lund v. Super. Ct. (1964) 61 Cal.2d
698, 713; Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group v. Super. Ct. (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286.)
 
At the date and time
set for hearing, the citee will be arraigned; the arraignment generally
includes (among other things) advisements of the charges against the citee and the
rights of the citee, including the right to counsel.  Most commonly, at the arraignment, the matter
is set for an evidentiary hearing, or trial, on a future date.  
 
There is no right to
a jury trial in civil contempt proceedings, even though such proceedings may
result in a fine or imprisonment.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1209.)  The citor/moving
party has the burden of proof and is held to a standard similar to that of a
prosecutor in a criminal proceeding.  The
citee is presumed innocent, and the proof of the contempt must be beyond a
reasonable doubt.
 
Here, Defendant has
filed a motion for an Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt based on
Plaintiff’s failure to comply with certain orders, including the Court’s
January 17, 2024 Minute Order. The Court on January 17, 2024 compelled
Plaintiff to comply with his statement of compliance and produce all documents
in his possession responsive to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents
nos. 11 and 12. Plaintiff has failed to do so. (Bitan Decl., ¶ 15.)   
 
In the proposed OSC,
Defendant lists 5 counts for contempt as follows:
1.      Plaintiff Rogelio
Castillo has violated this Court’s January 17, 2024 Order by failing to produce
all documents in his possession responsive to Defendant’s Requests for Production
Nos. 11 and 12 and failing pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of
$900.00.
2.      Plaintiff Rogelio
Castillo has violated this Court’s August 14, 2023 Order by failing to pay
monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $900.00.
3.      Plaintiff Rogelio
Castillo has violated this Court’s August 16, 2023 Order by failing to pay
monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $900.00.
4.      Plaintiff Rogelio
Castillo has violated this Court’s August 18, 2023 Order by failing to pay
monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $900.00.
5.      Plaintiff Rogelio
Castillo has violated this Court’s August 21, 2023 Order by failing to pay
monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $900.00.
 
Accordingly, the
motion for an Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt is GRANTED.
 
Defendant also
requests monetary sanctions for bringing this motion.  The request for sanctions will be adjudicated
at the time of the contempt trial.  The
request is deferred to that time.
 
The Court orders the
following modifications to the OSC.
 
First, in the initial,
unnumbered paragraph, the final sentence is stricken and replaced with the
following: “After considering the moving papers, any opposition, any oral
argument, and all other evidence presented at or prior to the hearing, and good
cause appearing, the Court hereby ORDERS that Plaintiff is CHARGED with
contempt as follows:”
 
Second, paragraph 7
is modified to read as follows: “Plaintiff is notified that Defendant will seek
an order in connection with the contempt trial requiring Plaintiff to pay
Defendant the sum of $4,250 for the fees and costs incurred in prosecuting this
contempt.”
 
Third, paragraph 9 is
stricken.  The Court has made its
orders.  An order compelling compliance with
an order is redundant and unnecessary (and is not the proper subject of an OSC
re contempt in any event).   
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for an Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt.
The Court sets the OSC re Contempt for a date on or after 11/18/23 at 1:30 pm in
Dept. 29 at SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
 
The Court
DIRECTS THE JUDICIAL ASSISTANT to modify the proposed order as follows:
 
First, in the initial,
unnumbered paragraph, the final sentence is stricken and replaced with the
following: “After considering the moving papers, any opposition, any oral
argument, and all other evidence presented at or prior to the hearing, and good
cause appearing, the Court hereby ORDERS that Plaintiff is CHARGED with
contempt as follows:”
 
Second, paragraph 7
is modified to read as follows: “Plaintiff is notified that Defendant will seek
an order in connection with the contempt trial requiring Plaintiff to pay
Defendant the sum of $4,250 for the fees and costs incurred in prosecuting this
contempt.”
 
Third, paragraph 9 is
stricken.  
 
The Court advises
Defendant that in most circumstances personal service of the OSC re Contempt on
the citee is required.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
