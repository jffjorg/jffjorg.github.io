And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The motion was filed after the complaint was dismissed without prejudice due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at an Order to Show Cause. The judge finds that the dismissal was the result of an inadvertent error by the plaintiffs' counsel and that the motion is timely. As a result, the judge sets aside the dismissal and vacates the Order of Dismissal. The judge also sets a new deadline for the plaintiffs to serve the defendants with the summons and complaint, or a trial setting conference, in approximately 60 days.
