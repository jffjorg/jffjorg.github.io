Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions of Patricia Casado, individually and as Trustee of the Lucy Casado Trust, to file a Second Amended Cross-Complaint and a Second Amended Answer. The court finds that Casado has not attempted to avoid defects in the prior complaint by omitting them, as argued by Plaintiffs. The court also finds that the proposed amendments are not an abuse of process and do not constitute a sham pleading. The court notes that the parties have had ample time to conduct discovery and that there is no evidence of significant prejudice to the Plaintiffs. The court grants the motions and orders Casado to file a separate copy of the proposed pleadings within 10 days of the date of the order.
