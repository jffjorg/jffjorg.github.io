English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant Hochiki America Corporation's motion to transfer the case to Orange County. The plaintiff, Hisham Harake, was terminated from his employment with the company and filed a complaint alleging discriminatory practices favoring Japanese employees. The defendant claims that the proper venue for the case is in Orange County, where the company is headquartered, rather than Los Angeles County, where the plaintiff claims to have worked remotely. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that the alleged unlawful practices occurred in Los Angeles County and that the defendant has shown that the action should be maintained in Orange County. The judge has ordered the case to be transferred to Orange County and has denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
