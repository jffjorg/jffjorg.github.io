And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to add Charles Hasbun, administrator of the estate of Gary Paul O'Connor, as a cross-defendant in place of the deceased O'Connor. The motion was filed by Greta Curtis, who alleged that O'Connor breached his fiduciary duty to her. The judge's ruling is based on Curtis' filed creditor's claim against O'Connor's estate, which was deemed rejected as of November 9, 2023. The judge found that Curtis satisfied the requirements of Probate Code § 9370, which allows a pending action to be continued against the estate of a deceased person if a creditor's claim is filed and rejected. The judge ordered Curtis to serve Hasbun and his counsel with an amended complaint within 20 days of the ruling.
