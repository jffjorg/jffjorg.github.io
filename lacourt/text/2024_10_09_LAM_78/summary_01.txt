And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment filed by Shayan Capital, LLC (Plaintiff) against defendants Palmdale Center, LLC, et al. The motion was filed on July 24, 2024, and the Plaintiff alleges default on a business loan. The Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint sets forth three causes of action: breach of written contract, breach of written guaranty, and declaratory relief. The Judge notes several deficiencies in the Plaintiff's motion, including excessive page count and incomplete separate statement. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff failed to cite its own separate statement in the memorandum, making it unclear which facts are relevant to the motion. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is denied, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
