  motion for summary

BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer action.  The real property at issue is located at 911
Loma Vista Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (commonly referred to as “917
Loma Vista Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210”) (the “Property”).  
In
May 2006, third party borrower Gennady Moshkovich (“Borrower”) obtained a
$5,325,000.00 loan (“Loan”), which was secured by a Deed of Trust that was
recorded against the Property; the Deed of Trust designated third party Horizon
Mortgage Bankers (“Horizon”) as “Beneficiary” of the Deed of Trust.  (Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts
“SSUF” Nos. 1 – 2.)  
In
May 2020, Horizon assigned its beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust (and
the underlying loan) to CSMC 2018-SP3 Trust (“CSMC”).  (SSUF No. 3.) 
In May 2022, CSMC assigned its beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust
(and the underlying loan) to Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, not in its
individual capacity but solely as Owner Trustee of CSMC 2018-SP3 Trust
(“Wilmington”).  (SSUF No. 4.)  In October 2022, Wilmington substituted in
Quality Loan Service Corporation (“Quality”) as the Trustee of the Deed of
Trust.  (SSUF No. 5.) 
As
of November 13, 2023, Borrower was in default on the Loan; thus, Quality
recorded a Notice of Default against the Property.  (SSUF No. 6.)  As of February 13, 2024, Borrower remained in
default on the loan; thus, Quality recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale against
the Property.  (SSUF No. 7.) Ultimately,
on April 9, 2024, Quality held a trustee’s sale of the Property.  (SSUF No. 8.)  Plaintiff was the winning bidder at that sale.
 (SSUF No. 9.) Quality subsequently
issued a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale to Plaintiff, which was recorded on June 28,
2024—which perfected Plaintiff’s title to the Property.  (SSUF No. 10.) 
Defendant
claims that, at the time of the sale, he possessed the Subject Property
pursuant to a “month-to-month” lease with the former owner of the Property.
Specifically, he claims to have entered into a lease dated July 10, 2021, which
had an end date of November 10, 2021. (SSUF No. 11.)  Despite the November 10, 2021 termination
date for the lease, Defendant claims he continued to make monthly payments to
the prior owner of the Property, at least through July 2024.  (SSUF No. 12.)  If true, this created a “month-to-month”
tenancy with the former owner of the Property, at least through July 2024.  (SSUF No. 13.) 

Plaintiff
caused a 90-Day Notice to Quit to be served on Defendant via a registered
process server. (SSUF No. 14.) Plaintiff’s process server subsequently executed
an Amended Proof of Service, attesting to the aforementioned service of the
90-Day Notice to Quit.  (SSUF No. 15.)  Despite the passage of 90 days, Defendant
failed to deliver possession of the Property to Plaintiff.  (SSUF No. 16.) 
This action was filed thereafter. 
This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for
summary judgment.  Plaintiff argues that there
is no undisputed facts as to all elements of his unlawful detainer claim
because Defendant cannot dispute: (1) the sale to Plaintiff was conducted in
compliance with Civil Code section 2924, et seq.; (2) a notice to quit was
properly served on Defendant; and (3) Defendant failed to vacate the Property within
the time prescribed in the notice to quit. 
LEGAL
STANDARD    
The function of a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party
cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order
of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Ritchfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  Code Civ. Proc.
§437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Minor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.”  (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67). 

As to each claim as framed by the complaint,
the plaintiff moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to establish each essential element of the claim.  (Code Civ. Proc. §437c(p)(2); Scalf v.
D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) 
Once the plaintiff has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998)
68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
Plaintiff
requests judicial notice of (1) “Deed of Trust” in favor of Horizon Mortgage
Bankers (ending in -732), securing a loan obtained by Gennady Moshkovich, which
was recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on or about May 9,
2006; (2) “Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust,” assigning the Deed of Trust
to CSMC 2018-SP3 Trust, which was recorded in the Official Records of Los
Angeles County on or about May 13, 2020; (3) “Corporate Assignment of Deed of
Trust,” assigning the Deed of Trust to Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB,
not in its individual capacity but solely as Owner Trustee of CSMC 2018-SP3
Trust, which was recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on or
about May 10, 2022; (4) “Substitution of Trustee,” designating Quality Loan
Service Corp. as the Trustee of the Deed of Trust, which was recorded in the
Official Records of Los Angeles County on or about October 5, 2022; (5) “Notice
of Default Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust” recorded in the Official
Records of Los Angeles County on or about November 13, 2023; (6) “Notice of
Trustee’s Sale” recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on or
about February 13, 2024; (7) “Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale,” executed by Quality
Loan Service Corporation, conveying real property to Sam Ostayan, which was
recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on or about June 28,
2024; (8) “First Amended Complaint” filed by Plaintiff in this Court, and in
this action, on or about October 31, 2024; (9) “Answer” filed by Defendant in
this Court, and in this action, on or about December 3, 2024; (10) “Demurrer to
First Amended Complaint” filed by Defendant in this Court, and in this action,
on or about December 3, 2024; and (11) “Notice of Ruling” filed by Plaintiff in
this Court, and in this action, on or about November 21, 2024.  
The
Court grants the request for judicial notice as to (1)-(8) pursuant to Cal.
Evid. Code § 452 subd. (h) as
“[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are
capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy”. 
Further, the Court grants the request pursuant to § 453 which requires
the court to take judicial notice of any matter specified in § 452 if a party requests it, and “(a) Gives each
adverse party sufficient notice of the request, through the pleadings or
otherwise, to enable such adverse party to prepare to meet the request; and
(b) Furnishes the court with sufficient information to enable it to take
judicial notice of the matter.” 
The
Court denies the request as to (9)-(11). 
It is unnecessary to ask the Court to take judicial notice of materials
previously filed in this case. “[A]ll that is necessary is to call the court's
attention to such papers.”  (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2016) ¶ 9:53.1a.)
DISCUSSION
The
elements of an action for unlawful detainer based upon sale of real property at
a trustee’s sale are set forth in Code Civ. Proc. § 1161a.  Section 1161a provides that any party who
purchases property at a trustee’s sale is entitled to immediate possession of
the property via the unlawful detainer procedure as long as they can show: (1)
the sale was conducted in compliance with Civil Code § 2924, et seq.; (2)
proper service of a notice to quit; and (3) the defendant’s failure to vacate
the subject property within the time prescribed in the notice to quit.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1161a, subd. (b) and (c).)
As
to the first element, the undisputed facts show that the
trustee’s sale of the Property to Plaintiff was conducted in accordance with
Civil Code section 2924 et seq.  Defendant
concedes he does not have “sufficient information or belief” to refute that
fact.  (SSUF Nos. 19-22.)
There
is a common law presumption that a foreclosure sale has been conducted
regularly and fairly.  (See Royal
Thrift and Loan Co. v. County Escrow, Inc. (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 24,
32.)  Moreover, there is a statutory
presumption that a foreclosure sale has been conducted regularly and
fairly.  (Civ. Code § 2924, subd. (c).) 
A
recital in the trustee’s deed upon sale of compliance with all of the
requirements of Civil Code section 2924, et seq., regarding the mailing of
copies of notices, or the publication of a copy of the notice of default, or
the personal delivery of the copy of the notice of default, or the posting of
copies of the notice of sale or the publication of a copy thereof shall
constitute prima facie evidence of compliance with these requirements and shall
be conclusive evidence of the propriety of the sale.  (Civ. Code § 2924, subd. (c).) 
Further,
an express provision in a deed of trust may provide that such recitals in a
trustee’s deed may be prima facie proof of the regularity of the sale, and that
no further evidence is necessary to establish title and right to possession of
the purchaser.  (Sorensen v. Hall (1934)
219 Cal. 680, 682 – 83 (“This provision . . . must be taken as conclusive in a
case involving only the legal title, such as the case at bar”); Pacific
States Savings & Loan Co. v. O’Neill (1936) 7 Cal.2d 596, 599.) 
Here,
in May 2006, Borrower executed a Deed of Trust to secure the $5,325,000.00 loan
provided to him by Horizon; the Deed of Trust contained a provision wherein
Borrower agreed that, in the event of a default and sale of the Subject
Property, the recitals contained in any trustee’s deed would be “prima facie
evidence” of same.  (SSUF No. 17.)  
The
Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale (“TDUS”) issued by Quality to Plaintiff contains a
recital of compliance with Civil Code § 2924, et seq., as well as the
provisions of the Deed of Trust.  (SSUF
No. 18.)  This recital in the TDUS is
prima facie evidence of compliance with all of the requirements of Civil Code §
2924, et seq., and the Deed of Trust, and is conclusive evidence of the
propriety of the sale.  (Civ. Code §
2924, subd. (c).)  As such, no further
evidence is needed to establish Plaintiff’s title and right to possession of
the Property.  
Defendant
has conceded that he is not aware of any facts that would refute the above. In
his verified complaint, Plaintiff alleged he is the “legal owner” of the
Property (SSUF No. 19), the foreclosure sale was “properly noticed and
conducted” (SSUF No. 20); Plaintiff “perfected its title to the Subject
Property, as reflected in the duly recorded Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale in its
favor” (SSUF No. 21). Defendant conceded he does not have “sufficient
information or belief” to tender any response to any of these allegations. (SSUF
No. 22.)  
Defendant
argues that complicated issues of title preclude the granting of summary
judgment.  But the Opposition never fully
explains what those “complicated issues” are. 
The Opposition argues “[t]he claim of defendant herein which are being
made in the civil action emanate from the requirements of Civil Code, Section
2924m, subparts (a)(2)(A)-(E), (a)(3)(A); also see: 4 Witkin, Summary 11th Sec
Trans--Real§ 170A (2024)).”  There is no
further discussion as to how Defendant meets any of the requirements of § 2924m.
 
Notably,
Defendant did not deny Plaintiff’s allegations that Plaintiff perfected its
title to the Property and conceded that he is not aware of any facts that would
refute Plaintiff’s allegations, which removes this issue from being in dispute.  (SSUF Nos. 19 – 22.)  This, in addition to the conclusive
presumption of a properly noticed sale, establishes there is no triable issue
as to whether Plaintiff has title to the Property. (Civ. Code §2924(c).) 
As
to the second element of an unlawful detainer action, the
undisputed facts establish that Defendant was served with a 90-Day Notice to
Quit in compliance with applicable law. Code Civ. Proc. § 1161b provides that a
“tenant or subtenant in possession of a rental housing unit under a
month-to-month lease or periodic tenancy at the time the property is sold in
foreclosure shall be given 90 days’ written notice to quit pursuant to Section
1162 before the tenant or subtenant may be removed from the property.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1161b(a).) 
Code
Civ. Proc. § 1162 sets forth the requirements for service of a notice to quit
and provides that such notices may be served: (1) by personally delivering a
copy to the tenant; or (2) if the tenant is absent from the residence, and from
their place of business, by leaving a copy with a person of suitable age at
either place, and sending a copy through the mail to the tenant at their place
of residence; or (3) if the place of residence and business cannot be
ascertained, or a person of suitable age cannot be found, then by affixing a
copy in a conspicuous place on the property, and delivering a copy to a person
there residing, if such person can be found, and also sending a copy through
the mail to the tenant at the place where the property is situated. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1162.) 
Here,
Defendant claims that, at the time of the trustee’s sale, he possessed the
Property pursuant to a “month-to month” lease with the former owner of the
Property. Specifically, he claims to have entered into a lease dated July 10,
2021, which had an end date of November 10, 2021.  (SSUF No. 11.)  Defendant then claims he continued to make
monthly payments to the prior owner of the Property, at least through July
2024.  (SSUF No. 12.)  If true, this created a “month-to-month” lease
with the former owner of the Property, at least through July 2024.  (SSUF No. 13.) 
Pursuant
to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1161a, and 1161b(a), Plaintiff caused to be served on
Defendant a 90-Day Notice to Quit in compliance with Code Civ. Proc. § 1162.  (SSUF No. 14.)  The notice was served on Defendant via posting
and mailing by a registered process server, who subsequently executed an
Amended Proof of Service, attesting to the service of the 90-Day Notice to
Quit.  (SSUF Nos. 14 – 15.) 
This
Amended Proof of Service creates a presumption of proper service of the 90 Day
Notice to Quit on Defendant.  (Evid. Code
§ 647 (the return of a registered process server upon process or notice
“establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the
facts stated in the return”).)  Defendant
cannot rebut that presumption or produce any evidence that he was not served
with the 90-Day Notice to Quit.  
Defendant’s
answer denied Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the service of the 90-Day
Notice to Quit.  In discovery, Defendant
was asked to state all facts supporting his denial of Plaintiff’s allegations
regarding the service of the 90-Day Notice to Quit.  (SSUF No. 23.) Rather than denying that he was
ever served with the 90-Day Notice to Quit, Defendant only attempted to justify
his denial by claiming that the Amended Proof of Service contained a reference
to a “Zip Code in Inglewood.”  (SSUF No.
24.) Defendant raised this same issue in his demurrers to the First Amended
Complaint.  (SSUF No. 25.) 
However,
the Court overruled these demurrers. (SSUF No. 26.)  This ruling was based on the fact that the zip
code referred to by Defendant appears in a section of the Amended Proof of
Service labeled “Personal Service.”  But
that box was unchecked since Defendant was not served via “Personal Service”
(thus, the zip code reference was irrelevant). Rather, he was served by posting
and mailing. And Plaintiff’s process server checked the box indicating such
service, and properly referenced the Property (not the Inglewood zip code) as
being the address where Defendant was served with a copy of the 90-Day Notice
to Quit.  In sum, the Court has rejected
the only basis for Defendant’s denial of Plaintiff’s allegation regarding
service of the 90-Day Notice to Quit. This leaves Defendant without any basis
for challenging service. 
Defendant
attests there was no proper service because he was not personally served.  This portion of Defendant’s declaration contradicts
his discovery responses, where he swore under penalty of perjury that he had no
factual grounds for disputing service.  (SSUF
Nos. 23 – 26.)  On summary judgment, a
party cannot submit a declaration that contradicts its prior discovery
responses.  (D’Amico v. Board of
Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21-22.)  In any event, Plaintiff served the Notice to
Quit under Code Civ. Proc. § 1162(a)(3).  As set forth in the declaration of registered
process server, the notice was served by posting and mailing.  (Id.)  This service satisfies § 1162(a)(3); there was
no additional requirement for personal service, as Defendant suggests.  As such, it is undisputed that service of the
90-Day Notice to Quit was properly completed. 
Defendant
next argues that the 90-Day Notice to Quit’s contents did not comply with Civ.
Code § 1946.2.  Specifically, Defendant
argues that, since he, allegedly, continuously and lawfully occupied the
Property for 12 months, Plaintiff could not evict him without “just cause.” (Opp.
at 7:17 – 9:13.)  He further argues that
such “just cause” was required to be specifically stated in the 90-Day Notice
to Quit, which it was not.  (Id.)  
However,
§ 1946.2 does not apply here. Section 1946.2(e) makes it clear that section
1946.2 does not apply to “Residential real property . . . provided that both of
the following apply”: (1) the owner is not a real estate investment trust,
corporation, or limited liability company in which at least one member is a
corporation, or management of a mobile home park; and (2) the tenants have been
provided written notice that the property is exempt from this section (with
certain language specified by statute).  (Civ. Code § 1946.2(e)(8).)  
Here,
both of these criterion are met, exempting this eviction from § 1946.2. First,
Plaintiff is clearly not a real estate investment trust, corporation, or
limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation, or management
of a mobile home park. Rather, Plaintiff is an individual.  Second, Defendant was given “written notice
that the residential property is exempt from” § 1946.2.  Section 1946.2 requires that specific
language be provided to give the tenant notice of the applicable exemption. (Civ.
Code § 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i).)  This
language is contained in the “Rent Cap and Just Cause Addendum” given to
Defendant.  (Ex. 2 to Jumaiah Decl.)  It is contained in a separately-outlined box,
where another box, titled “Notice of Exemption” is bolded and checked, alerting
Defendant to the exemption.  (Id.)
Thus, it cannot be disputed that Defendant was served with a proper 90-Day
Notice to Quit.
As
a throw-away argument, Defendant also claims that the notice was not served by
a registered process server.  There is no
evidence to support this claim.  In his
Declaration, Defendant states he “believes” Plaintiff’s process server is not
registered.  But Defendant has not stated
any facts to support this claim.  He
lacks personal knowledge or foundation to make this averment. 
As
to the third element, the undisputed facts show that Defendant
failed to vacate the Subject Property, as demanded in the 90-Day Notice to
Quit.  (SSUF No. 16.)  Defendant’s opposition does not argue
otherwise.  
As
Defendant has remained in possession of the Property despite service— and
expiration—of the 90-Day Notice to Quit, Plaintiff is entitled to damages.  For post-foreclosure unlawful detainer
actions such as this one, the property owner’s damages are the “reasonable
rental value that plaintiff might have realized had plaintiff not been denied
possession unlawfully.”  (MCA, Inc. v.
Universal Diversified Enterprises Corp. (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 170, 179.) 
Plaintiff’s
verified complaint alleged that the Subject Property has a minimum daily rental
value of $1,600.00 per day ($48,000.00/month).  (SSUF No. 27.)  Defendant concedes that he does not have
“sufficient information or belief” to refute this allegation.  (SSUF No. 28.)  As a result of the above, in addition to
restitution of possession, Plaintiff is entitled to monetary damages at a rate
of $1,600.00 per day ($48,000.00/month) from the expiration of the 90-Day
Notice to Quit through entry of judgment.
Defendant
argues there was a prior lease agreement between Defendant and the prior owner
of the Property that was $3,000.00 less per month, which he claims creates a
triable issue on the rental value of the Property. (Opp. at 4:22 – 27.)  But this contradicts his sworn response to
the complaint—to which he is bound as a judicial admission. Walker v. Dorn (1966)
240 Cal.App.2d 118, 120 (“A judicial admission in a pleading (either by
affirmative allegation or by failure to deny an allegation) . . . is not merely
evidence of a fact; it is a conclusive concession of the truth of a matter
which has the effect of removing it from the issues . . .”). Defendant’s answer
stated he did “not have sufficient information or belief” to respond to
Plaintiff’s allegation that the Property has a daily rental value of at least
$1,600.00 per day ($48,000.00/month).  (SSUF
No. 28.)  
Defendant
also did not deny the allegation that the Property has a minimum daily rental
value of $1,600.00 per day ($48,000.00/month); rather, he tendered no admission
or denial on this issue.  (Id.)  This is an admission of the daily rental
value of $1,600.00 per day ($48,000.00/month), as a matter of law. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 431.20(a) (“Every material allegation of the complaint or
cross-complaint, not controverted by the answer, shall, for the purposes of the
action, be taken as true”).)  Indeed,
“where allegations contained in a pleading are not denied, the matters therein
alleged must be deemed admitted.”  (In
re Estate of Dolley (1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 63, 69; Doll v. Good (1869)
38 Cal. 287, 290 (“The rules of pleading, under our system, are intended to
prevent evasion, and to require a denial of every specific averment in a sworn
complaint, in substance and in spirit, and not merely a denial of its literal
truth, and whenever the defendant fails to make such denial he admits the
averment”); Blankman v. Vallejo (1860) 15 Cal. 638, 644 (“the defendant
is held to an admission whenever he fails to make such denial”).  
By having
not denied Plaintiff’s allegation regarding the daily rental value, Defendant
has conceded that this is not a triable issue of fact in this case, which
relieves Plaintiff of any obligation to separately prove up this fact.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§¿431.30(b), 590; Fuentes
v. Tucker (1947) 31 Cal.2d 1, 4 – 5, 7 (“If facts alleged in the complaint
are not controverted by the answer, they are not in issue, and no evidence need
be offered to prove their existence”); Carlton v. Sup. Ct. (1968) 261
Cal.App.2d 282, 289.)  
Defendant
claims that by stating he had no information or belief to refute this
allegation, he, by implication, was denying this fact.  But Defendant simply said he had no
information or belief.  He did not say he
was denying the fact based on a lack of information or belief.  By failing to deny the fact, he admitted
it.  There is no authority cited to
support Defendant’s claim that a statement of no information or belief
constitutes a denial.  
Even
if the Court were to ignore Defendant’s admission in the answer, Defendant has
not cited any evidence in support of his challenge to the daily rental value.  Defendant’s argument is that: (1) in 2021, he
entered into a lease agreement with the former owner of the Subject Property,
wherein he agreed to pay $45,000.00 per month in rent; and (2) that the rental
amount stated in a lease creates a triable issue as to the proper rental value.
 (Opp. at 5:1 – 6). 
However,
the $45,000.00 stems from a lease entered into in 2021.  Plaintiff is seeking rental damages as of
October 2024 onward. Defendant provides no rental estimates for this time
period. Rather, his proffered valuation comes from 2021—which is 3 years earlier
than the time period at issue in this case. 

Defendant’s
opposition attempts to raise a new affirmative defense by arguing that
Plaintiff purportedly failed to comply with Civ. Code § 1962.  However, this purported defense was not pled
in Defendant’s answer and, thus, cannot be considered in ruling on this motion.  The failure to assert this affirmative
defense in the answer means it cannot be put at issue in opposition to a motion
for summary judgment and is waived. (Cal. Concrete Co. v. Beverly Hills Sav.
& Loan Assn. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 260, 272; Code Civ. Proc., §
430.80(a); Dept. of Finance v. City of Merced (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 286,
294 (“A party who fails to plead affirmative defenses waives them”).)
In
any event, this section has no applicability to this case.  Defendant argues that Civ. Code § 1962
requires that a “successor owner” must provide a notice of “change of
ownership” to tenants. He further argues that Plaintiff allegedly failed to do
so in this case and that this “gives rise to either waiver or estoppel, both of
which concepts involve questions of fact.” (Opp. at 6:24–7:16.)  But § 1962 only applies to properties
referenced in Civ. Code § 1961, which only applies to “every dwelling structure
containing one or more units offered to the public for rent or for lease for
residential purposes.” (Civ. Code § 1961.) 
Here, Defendant failed to produce any evidence that the Property was
“offered to the public for rent or for lease for residential purposes,” as was
his burden.  
Even
if there was non-compliance with § 1962, that would not affect Plaintiff’s
claim for unlawful detainer under Code Civ. Proc. § 1161a(b)(3). Indeed, as § 1962
makes clear, the only consequence for a violation of section 1962 is that the
“successor owner or manager” cannot “evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent that
accrued during the period of noncompliance . . . .” (Civ. Code § 1962(c)
(emphasis added).)  Here, Plaintiff is
not attempting to evict Defendant nor is he raising any cause of action for unlawful
detainer based on “nonpayment of rent that accrued.”  Rather, Plaintiff is pursuing his claim for unlawful
detainer based on Defendant holding over in possession of the Property
following Plaintiff acquiring the Property at a non-judicial foreclosure. 
In
sum, there are no triable issues of liability or damages, and the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
