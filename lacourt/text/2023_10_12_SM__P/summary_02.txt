And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling is about Crestwood Hills' motion to compel arbitration in a dispute with the Broumand defendants over a home being built in violation of community CC&Rs. The court is asked to determine whether the arbitration clause in the 2022 architectural guidelines is enforceable. The court finds that the clause is validly adopted under the Davis-Stirling Act and that Crestwood Hills has standing to enforce the guidelines as the successor-in-interest to the original developer. The court also finds that the arbitration clause is not substantively unconscionable, except for a provision allowing injunctive relief to be sought in court, which is severed. Finally, the court finds that Crestwood Hills did not waive its right to arbitrate by filing a complaint in Superior Court, as it moved to compel arbitration promptly after filing the action.
