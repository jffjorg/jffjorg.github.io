Summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The plaintiff, an inpatient at UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital, alleges that she was sexually assaulted by another patient and sues the Regents of the University of California and Dr. Laurie R. Casaus, M.D. for alleged violations of regulations and negligence.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's claims for failure to provide adequate equipment, personnel, or facilities, as the plaintiff failed to identify specific regulations or statutes that set a minimum standard for staffing or facilities. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's claims for elder abuse/dependent adult abuse, as the allegations are too vague and fail to specify the actions or omissions of Dr. Casaus that allegedly exposed the plaintiff to increased danger.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the plaintiff's claims for medical malpractice, as the plaintiff's claim against Dr. Casaus is not based on a determination whether to confine the plaintiff or the terms and conditions of the confinement. The court has also overruled the demurrer to the plaintiff's claims for negligent hiring, as the plaintiff has alleged that Dr. Casaus supervised unfit employees at the facility.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's claims for a dangerous condition of public property, as the plaintiff was an inpatient and her causes of action based on an alleged dangerous condition cannot proceed.

The court will not grant further leave to amend the plaintiff's complaint, as this is the plaintiff's third attempt to adequately plead the challenged cause of action.
