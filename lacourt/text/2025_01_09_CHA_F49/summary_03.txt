Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the special motion to strike cross-complaint filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Michael R. Shaar, Trustee of the Michael R. Shaar Separate Property Trust, is granted under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The court found that Shaar's service of a 3-day notice and pursuit of an unlawful detainer action are protected communicative activities under the anti-SLAPP statute. Rocio's cross-complaint, which alleges breach of contract and common counts, is deficient in providing factual allegations to support its claims and fails to meet the burden of demonstrating a probability of prevailing. Therefore, the court grants the special motion to strike cross-complaint without leave to amend.
