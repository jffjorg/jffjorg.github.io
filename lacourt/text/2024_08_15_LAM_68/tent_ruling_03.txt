Motion to Strike the Complaint
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
October 18, 2021, Plaintiff Kevin De Leon, City of Los Angeles Councilman for
District 14, met with Ron Herrera, former president of the Los Angeles County
Federation of Labor (the “Fed”), along with former Los Angeles City Council
members, Nury Martinez, and Gibert Cedillo. Plaintiff alleges Defendants Santos
Leon and Karla Vasquez surreptitiously and non-consensually recorded the
conversation. Partial content of the recording was released in October 2022,
which Plaintiff alleges was for political and reputational damage.
 
On
October 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1. Invasion Of Privacy 2.
Negligence 3. Negligence Per Se.

Defendant
Santos Leon (Santos), a former employee of Los Angeles County Federation of
Labor, moves to strike the entire complaint on grounds that the identified
allegations and claims arise from privileged and protected conduct. More
specifically, Santos denies conducting any actual recording of the
conversation, or ever publishing the recordings to internet website Reddit.
Santos was identified and terminated by Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
due to a copy of the recording, allegedly accessible from a shared work
database, found on Santos’ work issued computer. Santos maintains the instant
complaint constitutes an effort to “silence” persons exercising their
legitimate First Amendment rights as a public citizen concerned with
gerrymandering. Santos also notes that the Los Angeles District Attorney
declined to press any charges due to a lack of evidence to charge Santos or his
wife.
 
Plaintiff
in opposition counters that the operative complaint arises from non-privileged,
non-constitutionally protected conduct. Plaintiff emphasizes the gravamen of
the complaint as the violation of the right to privacy brought on by the
illegal recording of the conversation. Illegal conduct is not a protectable
activity for purposes of considering a special motion to strike.
 
All
parties dispute whether Plaintiff meets the standard for the second part of the
motion regarding probability of prevailing on the claim.
 
Santos
in reply emphasizes lack of support to any claim of wrongful conduct, including
reiteration of the separately submitted objections to Plaintiff’s counsel Marc
Geragos, and additional challenge to the declaration of Ron Herrera. The reply
also restates the position of protected activity barring the complaint.
Finally, Santos denies the claimed right of privacy by Plaintiff as superseding
Santos’ First Amendment right to the constitutional expression of opinions in a
public forum. 
 
Santos frames the subject action, as an attempt to squelch Santos’
First Amendment protected participation in public forum expression of political
opinion, which originated from the allegedly illegal recording and publication.
Santos categorically relies on the protections of the First Amendment to
support dismissal of the entire action. 
 
In addition to citation to the complaint, Santos also
submits a declaration in support, which the court can rely upon in determining
whether moving party meets the threshold for shifting the burden in a special
motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(2); Stewart v. Rolling Stone LLC (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 664, 679 [The court interprets the activities of the parties
through the allegations in order to determine free speech activity but need not
adhere to the strict form of the operative pleading in order to make such
determinations].) Santos admits to over 100 “communications with concerned
persons” both inside and outside the employer, as well as “participating in
discussion concerning” the social and political issues. [Declaration of Santos
Leon, ¶¶ 8, 11.] Santos concludes with a statement regarding the lawsuit
constituting an effort to “silence” persons criticizing and finding the content
both racist and corrupt. [Id., ¶ 14.]
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 provides that “[a]
cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in
furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United
States Constitution or California Constitution in connection with a public
issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike unless the court
determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that
the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16, subd. (b).)
Such a motion involves a two step analysis, in which the court must first
determine whether a movant "has made a threshold showing that the
challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity . . . ."
(Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 712, quoting Equilon
Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.) If the court
so finds, it must then examine whether the respondent has demonstrated a
probability of prevailing on the claim. (Taus v. Loftus, supra,
40 Cal.4th at p. 712.)
 
An act in furtherance of a person's right to petition or
free speech under the United States Constitution or California Constitution
includes: “(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a
legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made
in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,
executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law,
(3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public
or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any
other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16.)
 
The anti-SLAPP provisions apply where the allegations of the
defendant’s protected activity are the gravamen or principal thrust of the
cause of action. (Peregrine Funding, Inc. v. Sheppard Mulin Richter &
Hampton LLP (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 672 [“‘where a cause of action
alleges both protected and unprotected activity, the cause of action will be
subject to section 425.16 unless the protected conduct is “merely
incidental” to the unprotected conduct’”].) If the allegations of protected
activity are only incidental to a claim based essentially on non-protected
activity, the mere mention of the protected activity does not subject the claim
to an anti-SLAPP motion. (Martinez v. Metabolife International, Inc. (2003)
113 Cal.App.4th 181, 188 [“We conclude it is the principal
thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff's cause of action that
determines whether the anti-SLAPP statute applies (Citation), and when the
allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a
cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity, collateral
allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the
anti-SLAPP statute”].) .) “[W]hether the defendant's act qualifies as one in
furtherance of protected speech or petitioning will depend on whether the
defendant took the action for speech-related reasons.” (Wilson v. Cable News
Network, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 889.) “[T]he mere fact that an action
was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action
arose from that activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP
statute. (Citation.) Moreover, that a cause of action arguably may have
been ‘triggered by protected activity does not entail it is one arising from
such. (Citation.) In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical consideration is
whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected
free speech or petitioning activity.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002)
29 Cal.4th 82, 89.) Courts must “draw a careful distinction between a cause of
action based squarely on a privileged communication … and one based upon an
underlying course of conduct evidenced by the communication.” (White v.
Western Title Ins. Co. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 870, 888.) 
 
In determining the application of the special motion to
strike statute, the court focuses “not on the label of the cause of action,”
but on the underlying “activities” alleged in the challenged pleading. (1100
Park Lane Assocs. v. Feldman (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1484.) “If the
court determines that relief is sought based on allegations arising from
activity protected by the statute, the second step is reached.” (Baral v.
Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396.) “[A] plaintiff cannot frustrate
the purposes of the SLAPP statute through a pleading tactic of combining
allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one
‘cause of action.’” (Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc v. Paladino (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 294, 308.) “The anti-SLAPP statute's definitional focus is not the
form of the plaintiff's cause of action but, rather, the
defendant's activity that gives rise to his or her asserted
liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or
petitioning.” (Navellier v. Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 92.)
 
“The anti-SLAPP statute does not apply where protected
activity is only collateral or incidental to the purpose of the transaction or
occurrence underlying the complaint.” (California Back Specialists Medical
Group v. Rand (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1032, 1037.) “[T]he mere fact
that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean
the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP
statute. (Citation.) Moreover, that a cause of action arguably may have
been ‘triggered by protected activity does not entail it is one arising from
such. (Citation.) In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical consideration is
whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected
free speech or petitioning activity.” (Navellier v. Sletten, supra,
29 Cal.4th at p. 89.)
 
The motion itself, especially the reply, emphasizes the
protected conduct. Plaintiff offers no dispute over the legally supported
argument establishing the existence of Reddit as public forum for First Amended
protected activity. Plaintiff instead focuses on the underlying conduct leading
to the publication of the secretively recorded conversation. The actual
complaint only specifically alleges a violation of privacy rights under Penal
Code sections 632 and 637.2 caused by the unpermitted and illegal recording,
which led to specific harm upon the alleged uploading and dissemination of the
recordings one year later by Defendants. 
 
The first part of the test squarely requires
consideration of the underlying allegations in the complaint itself. Other than
a denial of any participation in the recording, the court finds a lack of
address on the substantial claim of underlying, undisputed illegal conduct. Other
than a denial of any participation in the activity, the court finds no way to
doubt the veracity of the accusation for purposes of determining privileged
activity. 
 
“[S]ection
425.16 cannot be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is
illegal as a matter of law and, for that reason, not protected by
constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition. A contrary rule would be
inconsistent with the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute as revealed by its
language.” Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 317; Collier v. Harris (2015) 240
Cal.App.4th 41, 54 [acts a plaintiff alleges are unlawful or illegal are
nonetheless protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute if the acts assist
or facilitate the defendant's free speech rights [¶ ][unless] the defendant
concedes or the evidence conclusively establishes the defendant's conduct is
illegal as a matter of law”]; Novartis Vaccines &
Diagnostics, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1296.)
 
(a) A person who,
intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential
communication, uses an electronic amplifying or recording device to eavesdrop
upon or record the confidential communication, whether the communication
is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another or by means of a
telegraph, telephone, or other device, except a radio, shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per violation,
or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state
prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment. If the person has previously
been convicted of a violation of this section or Section 631, 632.5, 632.6,
632.7, or 636, the person shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) per violation, by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding
one year, or in the state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment.
(b) For the purposes of this section, “person” means an individual, business association, partnership,

individual acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of any government or
subdivision thereof, whether federal, state, or local, but excludes an
individual known by all parties to a confidential communication to be
overhearing or recording the communication.
(c) For the purposes of this section, “confidential communication” means any
communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any
party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto,
but excludes a communication made in a public gathering or in any legislative,
judicial, executive, or administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any
other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably
expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.
 
Pen.

Every
person not a party to a telegraphic or telephonic communication who willfully
discloses the contents of a telegraphic or telephonic message, or any part
thereof, addressed to another person, without the permission of that person,
unless directed so to do by the lawful order of a court, is punishable by
imprisonment pursuant to
subdivision (h) of Section 1170, or in a county jail
not exceeding one year, or by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars
($5,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment.


Pen.
Code, § 637
 
(a) Any
person who has been injured by a violation of this chapter may bring an action
against the person who committed the violation for the greater of the following
amounts:
(1) Five
thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation.
(2) Three
times the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff.
(b) Any
person may, in accordance with Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 525) of Title
7 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, bring an action to enjoin and
restrain any violation of this chapter, and may in the same action seek damages
as provided by subdivision (a).
(c) It is
not a necessary prerequisite to an action pursuant to this section that the
plaintiff has suffered, or be threatened with, actual damages.
(d) This section shall not be construed to affect Title 4
(commencing with Section 3425.1) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Civil Code.
 
Pen.
Code, § 637.2
 
The court finds the underlying conduct leading to the
creation of recording, and the “October surprise” dissemination of the
recording one year later individually and collectively constitutes a series of
illegal acts, and therefore unprivileged conduct. Again, the court declines to
consider the factual veracity of the denial of any participation in the
recording process or dissemination. The court therefore finds Santos fails to
shift the burden of proof on the first part of the required showing on this
basis. The strongly emphasized arguments challenging the probability of
prevailing on the merits improperly “puts the cart before the horse” for
purposes of special motion to strike analysis. 
 
Even assuming the conduct remains to be factually determined
however, thereby preventing a finding of illegal conduct (though not
specifically addressed by Santos), the court finds the conflation of conduct improperly
disregards the underlying claims. As addressed in the standard, non-privileged
conduct preceding the purported protected conduct (e.g. open discussion and
expression of political and social views following public presentation of the
news reports), precludes a finding of protected conduct. (Navellier v.
Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 89, 92; Martinez v. Metabolife
International, Inc., supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 188; White v. Western
Title Ins. Co., supra, 40 Cal.3d at p. 888.) While the court
appreciates the 1913 quote from Justice Louis Brandeis, “sunlight is said to be
the best of disinfectants,” the argument of Santos engaging in First Amendment
protected expression as an entirely protected course of political activity
would effectively eviscerate any illegally underlying conduct claims on grounds
of free speech protection. The court finds no legal support for this position.
The motion is denied on this basis.
 
The court
otherwise finds no basis for challenging the probability of success on the
merits. 
The
subject motion is not presented as a means of determining the factual veracity
of whether Santos actually arranged or conducted the recording or the
publication. Santos offers no address of this particular element from the
operative complaint, and instead cites to the Brown Act under California
Government Code section 54950. 
 
“In
enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public
commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State
exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the
law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be
conducted openly.
 
“The
people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve
them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants
the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good
for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may
retain control over the instruments they have created.”
 
Gov.
Code, § 54950
 
The court
finds citation to the Brown Act and the policy of transparency in no way
supports a finding of a superseding interest of the inalienable rights of
individual privacy founded in the California Constitution and protected in this
part by the California Penal Code. [See Declaration of Kevin De Leon.] The
court also finds no support for the argument under the Public Records Act
otherwise justifying the course of alleged conduct. (See Gov. Code, § 7920.000,
et seq.) The lack of felony or misdemeanor criminal charges, or reliance on the
alleged lack of potential forensic proof of the ability to establish the civil
claim integral to the subject complaint, also lacks support for purposes of
establishing an insufficient showing of a probability of success on the merits,
even if Santos met the first element of the claim. [See Declaration of Nury
Martinez and De Leon Decl.] 
 
The
motion is denied in its entirety. 
 
The court will concurrently conduct the case management
conference.

Motion to Strike the Complaint
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
October 18, 2021, Plaintiff Kevin De Leon, City of Los Angeles Councilman for
District 14, met with Ron Herrera, former president of the Los Angeles County
Federation of Labor (the “Fed”), along with former Los Angeles City Council
members, Nury Martinez, and Gibert Cedillo. Plaintiff alleges Defendants Santos
Leon and Karla Vasquez surreptitiously and non-consensually recorded the
conversation. Partial content of the recording was released in October 2022,
which Plaintiff alleges was for political and reputational damage.
 
On
October 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1. Invasion Of Privacy 2.
Negligence 3. Negligence Per Se.
 
RULING: Denied
Defendant
Karla Vasquez a former employee of Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, moves
to strike the entire complaint on grounds that the identified allegations and
claims arise from privileged and protected conduct. More specifically, Vasquez denies
conducting any actual recording of the conversation, or ever publishing the
recordings to internet website Reddit. Vasquez was identified due to a copy of
the recording, allegedly accessible from a shared work database, found on Vasquez’s
work issued computer. Vasquez maintains the instant complaint constitutes an
effort to “silence” persons exercising their legitimate First Amendment rights
as a public citizen concerned with gerrymandering. Vasquez also notes that the
Los Angeles District Attorney declined to press any charges due to a lack of
evidence to charge Vasquez or her husband.
 
Plaintiff
in opposition counters that the operative complaint arises from non-privileged,
non-constitutionally protected conduct. Plaintiff emphasizes the gravamen of
the complaint as the violation of the right to privacy brought on by the
illegal recording of the conversation. Illegal conduct is not a protectable
activity for purposes of considering a special motion to strike.
 
All
parties dispute whether Plaintiff meets the standard for the second part of the
motion regarding probability of prevailing on the claim.
 
The
court electronic filing system shows no reply specifically from Vasquez at the
time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. 
 
Counsel
for Vasquez concedes that the subject motion substantially duplicates the
motion of Santos. (Declaration of Jeffrey Zinder.) Thus, while the orders share
similar foundations, the court acknowledges the factual differences where
applicable, such as the lack of a reply and evidentiary objections.
 
Vasquez frames the subject action, as an attempt to squelch
Santos’ First Amendment protected participation in public forum expression of
political opinion, which originated from the allegedly illegal recording and
publication. Santos categorically relies on the protections of the First
Amendment to support dismissal of the entire action. 
 
In addition to citation to the complaint, Vasquez also
submits a declaration in support, which the court can rely upon in determining
whether moving party meets the threshold for shifting the burden in a special
motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(2); Stewart v. Rolling Stone LLC (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 664, 679 [The court interprets the activities of the parties
through the allegations in order to determine free speech activity but need not
adhere to the strict form of the operative pleading in order to make such
determinations].) Vasquez admits to “many communications” with other
persons both within and outside the employer. [Declaration of Karla Vasquez, ¶¶
8, 9.] Vasquez concludes with a statement regarding the lawsuit constituting an
effort to “silence” persons criticizing and finding the content both racist and
corrupt. [Id., ¶ 14.]
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 provides that “[a]
cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in
furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United
States Constitution or California Constitution in connection with a public
issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike unless the court
determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that
the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16, subd.
(b).) Such a motion involves a two-step analysis, in which the court must first
determine whether a movant "has made a threshold showing that the
challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity . . ." (Taus
v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 712, quoting Equilon Enterprises v.
Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.) If the court so finds, it
must then examine whether the respondent has demonstrated a probability of
prevailing on the claim. (Taus v. Loftus, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p.
712.)
 
An act in furtherance of a person's right to petition or
free speech under the United States Constitution or California Constitution
includes: “(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a
legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made
in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,
executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law,
(3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public
or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any
other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16.)
 
The anti-SLAPP provisions apply where the allegations of the
defendant’s protected activity are the gravamen or principal thrust of the
cause of action. (Peregrine Funding, Inc. v. Sheppard Mulin Richter &
Hampton LLP (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 672 [“‘where a cause of action
alleges both protected and unprotected activity, the cause of action will be
subject to section 425.16 unless the protected conduct is “merely
incidental” to the unprotected conduct’”].) If the allegations of protected
activity are only incidental to a claim based essentially on non-protected
activity, the mere mention of the protected activity does not subject the claim
to an anti-SLAPP motion. (Martinez v. Metabolife International, Inc. (2003)
113 Cal.App.4th 181, 188 [“We conclude it is the principal
thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff's cause of action that
determines whether the anti-SLAPP statute applies (Citation), and when the
allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a
cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity, collateral
allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the
anti-SLAPP statute”].) .) “[W]hether the defendant's act qualifies as one in
furtherance of protected speech or petitioning will depend on whether the
defendant took the action for speech-related reasons.” (Wilson v. Cable News
Network, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 889.) “[T]he mere fact that an action
was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action
arose from that activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP
statute. (Citation.) Moreover, that a cause of action arguably may have
been ‘triggered by protected activity does not entail it is one arising from
such. (Citation.) In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical consideration is
whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected
free speech or petitioning activity.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002)
29 Cal.4th 82, 89.) Courts must “draw a careful distinction between a cause of
action based squarely on a privileged communication … and one based upon an
underlying course of conduct evidenced by the communication.” (White v.
Western Title Ins. Co. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 870, 888.) 
 
In determining the application of the special motion to
strike statute, the court focuses “not on the label of the cause of action,”
but on the underlying “activities” alleged in the challenged pleading. (1100
Park Lane Assocs. v. Feldman (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1484.) “If the
court determines that relief is sought based on allegations arising from
activity protected by the statute, the second step is reached.” (Baral v.
Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396.) “[A] plaintiff cannot frustrate
the purposes of the SLAPP statute through a pleading tactic of combining
allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one
‘cause of action.’” (Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc v. Paladino (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 294, 308.) “The anti-SLAPP statute's definitional focus is not the
form of the plaintiff's cause of action but, rather, the
defendant's activity that gives rise to his or her asserted
liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or
petitioning.” (Navellier v. Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 92.)
 
“The anti-SLAPP statute does not apply where protected
activity is only collateral or incidental to the purpose of the transaction or
occurrence underlying the complaint.” (California Back Specialists Medical
Group v. Rand (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1032, 1037.) “[T]he mere fact
that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean
the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP
statute. (Citation.) Moreover, that a cause of action arguably may have
been ‘triggered by protected activity does not entail it is one arising from
such. (Citation.) In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical consideration is
whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected
free speech or petitioning activity.” (Navellier v. Sletten, supra,
29 Cal.4th at p. 89.)
 
Plaintiff offers no dispute over the legally supported
argument establishing the existence of Reddit as public forum for First Amended
protected activity. Plaintiff instead focuses on the underlying conduct leading
to the publication of the secretively recoded conversation.  
The actual complaint only specifically alleges a violation
of privacy rights under Penal Code sections 632 and 637.2 caused by the
unpermitted and illegal recording, which led to specific harm upon the alleged
uploading and dissemination of the recordings one year later by Defendants. 
 
The first part of the test squarely requires
consideration of the underlying allegations in the complaint itself. Other than
a denial of any participation in the recording, the court finds a lack of
address on the substantial claim of underlying, undisputed illegal conduct. Other
than a denial of any participation in the activity, the court finds no way to
doubt the veracity of the accusation for purposes of determining privileged
activity.

communication, uses an electronic amplifying or recording device to eavesdrop
upon or record the confidential communication, whether the communication
is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another or by means of a
telegraph, telephone, or other device, except a radio, shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per violation,
or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state
prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment. If the person has previously
been convicted of a violation of this section or Section 631, 632.5, 632.6,
632.7, or 636, the person shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) per violation, by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding
one year, or in the state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment.
(b) For the purposes of this section, “person” means an individual, business association, partnership,
corporation, limited liability company, or other legal entity, and an
individual acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of any government or
subdivision thereof, whether federal, state, or local, but excludes an
individual known by all parties to a confidential communication to be
overhearing or recording the communication.
(c) For the purposes of this section, “confidential communication” means any
communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any
party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto,
but excludes a communication made in a public gathering or in any legislative,
judicial, executive, or administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any
other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably
expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.

Pen.
Code, § 637.2
 
The court finds the underlying conduct leading to the
creation of recording, and the “October surprise” dissemination of the
recording one year later individually and collectively constitute a series of
illegal acts, and therefore unprivileged conduct. The court therefore finds Vasquez
 fails to shift the burden of proof on
the first part of the required showing on this basis.
 
Even assuming the conduct remains to be factually determined
however, thereby preventing a finding of illegal conduct (though not
specifically addressed by Vasquez), the court finds the conflation of conduct improperly
disregards the underlying claims. As addressed in the standard, non-privileged
conduct preceding the purported protected conduct (e.g. open discussion and
expression of political and social views following public presentation of the
news reports), precludes a finding of protected conduct. (Navellier v.
Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 89, 92; Martinez v. Metabolife
International, Inc., supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 188; White v. Western
Title Ins. Co., supra, 40 Cal.3d at p. 888.) While the court
appreciates the 1913 quote from Justice Louis Brandeis, “sunlight is said to be
the best of disinfectants,” the argument of Vasquez engaging in First Amendment
protected expression as an entirely protected course of political activity
would effectively eviscerate any illegally underlying conduct claims on grounds
of free speech protection. The court finds no legal support for this position.
The motion is denied on this basis.
 
The court
otherwise finds no basis for challenging the probability of success on the
merits. 
The
subject motion is not presented as a means of determining the factual veracity
of whether Vasquez actually arranged or conducted the recording or the
publication. Vasquez offers no address of this, and instead cites to the Brown
Act under California Government Code section 54950. 
 
“In
enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public
commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State
exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the
law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be
conducted openly.
 
“The
people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve
them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants
the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good
for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may
retain control over the instruments they have created.”
 
Gov.
Code, § 54950
 
The court
finds citation to the Brown Act and the policy of transparency, while noble
neglects the inalienable rights of individual privacy founded in the California
Constitution and protected in this part by the California Penal Code. [See
Declaration of Kevin De Leon.] Nothing in the Public Records Act otherwise
justifies the course of alleged conduct. (See Gov. Code, § 7920.000, et seq.)
The lack of felony or misdemeanor criminal charges, or reliance on the alleged lack
of potential forensic proof of the ability to establish the civil claim
integral to the subject complaint, also lacks support for purposes of
establishing an insufficient showing of a probability of success on the merits,
if Vasquez even met the first element of the claim.  
 
The
motion is denied in its entirety. 
 
The court will concurrently conduct the case management
conference.
 
Defendant Vasquez to provide notice.
