SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Ritz Systems, Inc. acquired commercial premises insurance for the period of
July21, 2022 to July 21, 2023, with defendant Ascot Insurance Company. The
policy included $15,000,000 in Business Personal Property and $3,000,000 for
Business and Extra Expense. Plaintiff operated a business involving the
distribution of tobacco and nicotine products in Anaheim until moving to 3121
E. 12th St., Los Angeles. Upon the change in location, policy
coverage was reduced from $15,000,000 to $10,000,000 without the request or
approval of Plaintiff. 
 
On
November 24, 2022, a fire caused by a neighbor destroyed the entire warehouse,
thereby leading to the submission of a claim for $16,808.284. Ascot agreed to a
claim amount of $2,000,000.
 
On
November 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Reformation, Negligence
(Ascot Insurance Company), and Agent Negligence. On February 26, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for (1) Reformation (2) Negligence
(Against Ascot Insurance Company) (3) Agent Negligence (4) Breach of Contract
(5) Breach of The Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (6)
Violations of Business & Professions Code Section 17200, Et Seq. and, (7)
Civil Conspiracy. SGIB Insurance Services, Inc. answered the operative
complaint on March 29, 2024. On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Meaden and
Moore, LLP from the Civil Conspiracy cause of action. On April 15, 2024,
William Seide Agency, answered the first amended complaint. 
 
RULING: Denied.
Plaintiff
Ritz Systems, Inc. moves for trial preference. Defendant Ascot Insurance
Company (Ascot) in opposition challenges any support
for trial preference on the basis of financial hardship. Even if such an
argument were a position, Ascot challenges the lack of evidentiary support.
Ascot also maintains prejudice. Ascot concludes with a counter-request to stay
the action pending the appraisal process. Plaintiff in reply addresses the
necessity of the trial on the bad faith and potential enforcement of any appraisal
determination, and conditions said resolution on the “survival” of the
business. Plaintiff reiterates the discretionary standard, and lack of
prejudice. Plaintiff concludes by noting the lack of any opposition from any
other defendant other than Ascot. 
 
Plaintiff
moves for trial preference on grounds that the business interruption caused by
the complaint loss of inventory and delays in adjusting the claim presents an
undue burden and significant financial hardship. [Declaration of Sanad
Mustafa.] Plaintiff moves for relief under the court’s discretionary authority:
“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
court may in its discretion grant a motion for preference that is supported
by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be
served by granting this preference.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 36, subd. (e).) 
 
Unlike motions for trial preference based on age and/or health
conditions of the Plaintiff, the court finds the request for assistance, or
perhaps some leverage, in expeditiously adjudicating an otherwise drawn out
insurance dispute lacking the urgency contemplated by the public policy of the
statute. While financial hardship remains a factor for Plaintiff, the court
finds no threat of material, potential prejudicial loss of rights, such as a
potential dismissal for failure to bring the case to trial. (See Salas
v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 342, 348.) 
 
The case was ordered to appraisal,
which the court expects will facilitate further progress. The court must also
consider the rights of Defendant to bring a motion for summary judgment/summary
adjudication before trial, if requested. (See Polibrid Coatings, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 920, 923.) Given
the appraisal process requires presumed time to conclude, the court declines to
expedite the trial and potentially prejudice Defendant, given the unknown time
frame of the appraisal process. The court also denies any suggestion of a stay
pending completion of the appraisal process, as presented in the opposition to
the motion.
 
The court finds an insufficient showing for the requested relief,
and therefore denies the motion on this basis.
 
Trial remains set for May 12, 2025.


Plaintiff to provide notice.
