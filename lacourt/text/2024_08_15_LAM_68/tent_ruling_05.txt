REQUESTED
Motion
to Quash Service of the Summons
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 27, 2024, Plaintiff Jameelah Kates, in pro per, filed a complaint
regarding some form of alleged fraudulent documents and/or deceptive practice. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Request for Judicial Notice: Granted.
 
Specially Appearing Defendants Snappt, Inc. and Daniel
Berlind move to quash service of the summons and complaint on grounds of
invalid service. Defendants contends a certified mail envelop to CFO Evan
Heuser, both lacked any operative documents other than a notice of case
assignment and Alternative Dispute Resolution Packet, and the attempted mail
service itself was improper. Further, the actual identified person in the proof
of service as the intended recipient, Majoj Chalam, is not actually Heuser, but
an unknown third party unrelated to Defendants. [Declaration of Evan Heuser.] 
 
The court electronic filing system shows no opposition or
reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. Defendants filed
a notice of non-opposition.
 
A plaintiff has the initial burden to establish valid
statutory service of a summons and complaint. (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; Dill v. Berquist Const. Co.,
Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-40; Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 794.) The
April 8, 2024, filed proof of service indicates service by mail on March 29,
2024, and/or April 9, 2024 (the day after executed and filed proof of service).
The court finds no valid basis of service established from the proof of
service. The court also accepts the unchallenged declaration of Heusuer, as a
basis for finding incomplete service.
 
The service of process is therefore determined invalid. The
unopposed motion is granted.
