The court finds that Maresp Corporation is in default and cannot propound discovery, and that Cold Stone Creamery is not an identified defendant in the underlying complaint. The court also declines to consider federal case law and finds that the California discovery statute allows any party the right to discovery into issues potentially impacting its claim or defense.
