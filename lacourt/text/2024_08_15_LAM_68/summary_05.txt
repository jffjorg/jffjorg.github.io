And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint brought by the specially appearing defendants, Snappt, Inc. and Daniel Berlind. The defendants contend that the service was invalid because the certified mail envelope contained only a notice of case assignment and an Alternative Dispute Resolution Packet, and the attempted mail service was improper. Additionally, the actual person listed as the recipient in the proof of service, Majoj Chalam, is not the same person as the intended recipient, Evan Heuser. The court finds that the proof of service does not establish valid statutory service, and the declaration of Heuser supports this finding. As a result, the court grants the unopposed motion to quash service.
