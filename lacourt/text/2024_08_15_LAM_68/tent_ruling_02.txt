SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Dwain Lammey requires the use of a wheelchair. On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff
sought to enter the premises of a “restaurant” (Cold Stone Creamery) owned
and/or operated by Defendants, but maintains non-compliant counters and tables
to accommodate protected persons entering public establishments. 
 
On
June 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a verified complaint for Violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and Violation of the Unruh Act. On July 14,
2023, an answer was filed by Marlan Cooper, presumably in pro per, and
purportedly on behalf of Maresp Corporation. On July 21, 2023, GG LA Figueroa,
LLC, filed a verified answer to the complaint. On August 29, 2023, a default
was entered against Maresp Corporation. 
 
On
October 13, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the answer of GG LA
Figueroa, LLC, and denied the. motion to strike. GG LA Figueroa, LLC filed an
amended answer on November 3, 2023. On January 16, 2024, GG LA Figueroa, LLC
filed a cross-complaint against both Cold Stone Creamery, Inc. and Maresp
Corporation for Express Contractual Indemnity, Implied Indemnity, and Declaratory
Relief. 
 
On November 15, 2023, the action was transferred from the
personal injury hub court to Department 55. Plaintiff filed a 170.6 challenge
thereby leading to reassignment to Department 36. All hearings were vacated in
a series of orders from both Departments 55 and 36. On December 11, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a SECOND 170.6, which was accepted, and the case was
transferred to Department 68.  
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Dwain Lammey moves for a protective order as to
any deposition or discovery propounded Cold Stone Creamery, Inc. “on behalf of”
Defendant Maresp Corporation. Plaintiff moves on grounds that Maresp
Corporation is currently in default as to the complaint, and therefore may not
propound discovery. Plaintiff challenges any discovery by Coldstone Creamery,
Inc. (Coldstone) in that it is only named in the cross-complaint of GG LA
Figueroa, LLC. Coldstone in opposition contends it is a party in the underlying
complaint and entitled to propound discovery as a party to the cross-complaint
regardless. Plaintiff in reply maintains the cross-complaint constitutes a
separate and distinct action, thereby barring discovery from a cross-defendant
to the Plaintiff. The propounded discovery constitutes an improper effort to
circumvent rules and harass Plaintiff. Plaintiff reiterates the request for
sanctions. 
 
A Court may make any order that justice requires to protect
a party from “unwanted annoyance, embarrassment or oppression or undue burden
and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.090, subd. (b), 2031.060, subd. (b).) The burden of proof is on the party
seeking the protective order to show “good cause” for the order he or she
seeks. (Fairmont Insurance Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
A motion for a protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.090l 2031.060.) “A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
 
Plaintiff correctly challenges any discovery from Maresp
Corporation unless and until the default is vacated. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385–386 [“‘A defendant
against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not entitled to
take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff's right of action; he
cannot thereafter, until such default is set aside in a proper proceeding, file
pleadings or move for a new trial or demand notice of subsequent proceedings’”].)
The motion for protective order therefore requires consideration of the right
of cross-defendant Colstone to propound discovery.
 
Contrary to the opposition, Coldstone is not an identified
defendant in the underlying complaint and provided no answer or otherwise
appeared as a defendant. Coldstone only filed an answer/general denial to the
cross-complaint on February 20, 2024. Regardless, Coldstone maintains its right
to propound discovery as a party to the action, even as a cross-defendant.
 
“Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any
party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Discovery may relate to the claim or defense
of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action. Discovery
may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any
discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature, custody,
condition, and location of any document, electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”


Code Civ.
Proc., § 2017.010
 
The court declines to consider the federal case law cited by
Coldstone, as the instant action is NOT governed by the Federal Code of Civil
Procedure. As a matter of policy, the court reads the California discovery statute
broadly in that it allows any party the right to discovery into issues
potentially impacting its claim or defense. A valid argument can be made that
the statutory language therefore includes a defense to indemnity and
declaratory relief cross-complaint claims prompted by the filing of the action
by Plaintiff. Nevertheless, California law definitively identifies a
cross-complaint as a “separate action.” (Shepard & Morgan v. Lee & Daniel, Inc. (1982) 31 Cal.3d 256, 260-261; Bertero v. National General Corp. (1974) 13 Cal.3d 43, 51; Pacific Finance Corporation v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1933) 219 Cal. 179, 182.)  
 
The origin of the separate action
rule depends on a certain finding of independence between the actions. While
the subject cross-complaint appears solely derivative of the complaint and
would become moot upon dismissal of the action, the court cannot disregard the
plain language of the case law interpreting the statute identifying
cross-complaints as a “separate action” for purposes of interpreting the
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.80.) Furthermore,
the solution to the issue derives from Maresp Corpration seeking to vacate the
default and propounding the discovery.
 
The court therefore finds the
protective order proper in that cross-defendant cannot serve direct discovery
on the Plaintiff. The motion for protective order is GRANTED. Cross-Defendant
Coldstone remains precluded from propounding any discovery or seeking the
deposition of Plaintiff.
 
A successful motion allows for the recovery of
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.090, subd. (d); 2031.060, subd. (h).)
Plaintiff both improperly requests sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.5, and also fails to properly request sanctions within the notice
and body of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.040.) The request for
sanctions is therefore DENIED.
