And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's (Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc.) second motion for sanctions, seeking $13,555.48 in monetary sanctions against the Defendant (Shahrzad Shahili). The Judge finds that the motion lacks new or different facts and appears to be part of an effort to collect sizeable attorneys' fees. The Judge also notes that the motion is essentially a de facto motion for reconsideration, which requires a strong showing of diligence to support. The Judge further finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with previous orders and lack of diligence in pursuing this motion warrant denial. The trial is set for September 23, 2024.
