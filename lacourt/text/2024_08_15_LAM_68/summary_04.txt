And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Ritz Systems, Inc.'s motion for trial preference. The Plaintiff seeks to expedite the trial due to financial hardship caused by the fire that destroyed their warehouse. However, the Judge finds that the request is lacking in urgency and that the Plaintiff has not shown a threat of material, potential prejudicial loss of rights. The Judge has ordered the case to appraisal, which will facilitate further progress, and has denied the Plaintiff's request for a stay pending completion of the appraisal process. The trial remains set for May 12, 2025.
