SUMMARY
OF ACTION 
Plaintiff
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. alleges Defendant Shahrzad Shahili failed to pay
for outstanding legal services rendered in association with a marital
dissolution. Plaintiff alleges an outstanding balance of $32,555.57. 
 
On
July 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Quantum
Meruit for Services Rendered, Account Stated, Book Account, and Fraud.
Defendant answered the complaint on October 17, 2022, and filed a
cross-complaint against F. Bari Nejadpour, Susan Winchester, and Law Offices of
L.A. Law, Inc. on October 18, 2022, for Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach of Contract,
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress. 
 
On
December 15, 2022, the court denied the motion to
strike the one day after the answer filed cross-complaint. On January 30, 2023,
the court sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint with leave to amend. A
first amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, was filed on February 27, 2023. 
 
On April 20, 2023,
the court struck the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint. On May 30,
2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint.
 
On June 20, 2023,
the second amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress was filed. On
September 21, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer to the third and fourth
causes of action, and sustained the demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint
for the first, second and fifth causes of action. 
 
On November 20,
2023, the third amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, and Breach
of Contract, was filed. On January 16, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer
to the Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Breach of Contract, causes of action
without leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of
action for fraud and deceit. Cross-Defendants answered the third amended
cross-complaint on February 15, 2024. 
 
RULING:
Denied.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. (LA Law) presents its second motion for sanctions, but this time only for
$13,555.48 in monetary sanctions against Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Shahrzad
Shahili. 
 
LA
Law acknowledges the prior order imposing issue sanctions due to the failure of
Shahili to fully comply with the order for production of documents at
deposition, more specifically the insufficiently produced employment and school
records. LA Law now admittedly seeks additional monetary sanctions on said
order, because the court denied any monetary recovery to the last request. LA
Law also seeks monetary sanctions for a purported failure to comply with an
order compelling further responses to form interrogatories numbers 15 and 17,
though the motion and declaration lacks any actual statement of non-compliance
with said order.
 
The
court in fact denied monetary sanctions in the prior motion due to the
procedural violation, including lack of a separate statement, lack of any
statement of proposed sanctions itself, as required under the cited code
sections, and finding of LA Law in fact appearing as a self-represented entity.
Even after oral argument and taking the matter under submission, and
considering the LACK of any statements made UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY, the court
found no separate existence of legal entities. 
 
The
subject motion appears to lack any support for a new violation. The court therefore
finds the new motion in regards to the deposition documents constitutes a de
facto motion for reconsideration. 
 
“A motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the
party moving for reconsideration can offer ‘new or different facts,
circumstances, or law which it could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion. (Citations.) A motion
for reconsideration will be denied absent a strong showing of diligence.” (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690; Forrest v. State Of California Dept. Of
Corporations (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202 disapproved of and overruled on unrelated grounds in Shalant v. Girardi
(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164, 1172 (footnote 3); New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212–213; Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America. (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199.) Disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact that
will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd v. 
AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a
motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.”  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499.)  Motions for
reconsideration are restricted to circumstances where a party offers the Court
some fact or circumstance not previously considered, and some valid reason for
not offering it earlier.  (Id.) 

 
The underlying motion lacks any new or different facts. The
motion appears as part of an effort to collect sizeable attorneys’ fees. A
disagreement with the interpretation of the basis for recovery of monetary
sanctions, and subsequent renewed argument does not support reconsideration. Again,
the court also finds no basis of support for sanctions on the form
interrogatories as well.
 
The motion is DENIED in its entirety.
 
Trial Set for September 23, 2024.
