And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of North America v. The Cutler Group, Inc. et al. The defendant, The Cutler Group, Inc., had filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the plaintiff had failed to sufficiently plead a cause of action for broker negligence. The court has disagreed with the defendant's argument and has overruled the demurrer.

The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, an insurance broker, had failed to disclose material facts about an insurance policy it had sold to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had believed that the policy would cover losses resulting from an order of civil authority, but the defendant had allegedly concealed this information. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a breach of duty by the defendant and that the defendant's alleged misrepresentation had caused the plaintiff to purchase an insurance policy that did not cover the losses it had anticipated.

The court also addressed the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claim for broker negligence was time-barred. The court found that the applicable statute of limitations was two years and that the plaintiff had filed its complaint within that time period. The court therefore concluded that the plaintiff's claim was not time-barred.

The court has ordered the defendant to file and serve its answer within 20 days and to give notice to the parties. The court has also scheduled a hearing for March 20, 2024, to consider the defendant's demurrer.
