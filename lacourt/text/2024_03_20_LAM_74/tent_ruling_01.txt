  Case Number:  22STCV37565    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  74 Safer
Trucking, Inc. v. System Transport, Inc., et al.
Defendants’ Motion for Leave to File
a Cross-Complaint
The
court considered the moving papers. No
opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [“All papers
opposing a motion […] shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each
party at least nine court days […] before the hearing.”].) 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute. 
            On
November 30, 2022, Plaintiff Safer Trucking, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant System Transport, Inc. (Defendant) and Co-Defendant Don Juan
Trucking, Inc. (Co-Defendant). The complaint alleges the following causes of
action: (1) breach of written contract; (2) breach of oral contract; (3)
quantum meruit; (4) negligence; (5) implied indemnity; (6) equitable indemnity;
and (7) declaratory relief.
            On
February 13, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for leave to file a
cross-complaint.
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant
seeks leave to file a cross-complaint that, in part, alleges breach of contract
against Plaintiff. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 428.10, subdivision
(a), a defendant may file a cross-complaint alleging any cause of action
he has against the plaintiff. In addition, Defendant’s proposed cross-complaint
alleges negligence against Co-Defendant. A defendant can cross-complain against
a co-defendant if the cause of action asserted arises out of the same
transaction or occurrence set forth in the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., §
428.10, subdivision (b).) Here, Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that
Co-Defendant negligently transported a load on July 15, 2021. (Complaint, ¶
34.) Defendant’s cross-claim for negligence against Co-Defendant is based on
the same facts. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 27.) Thus, Defendant has provided grounds
for the court to grant its motion. Although Defendant has waited over a year to
pursue this motion, the court must grant leave to file a cross-complaint if
Defendant has acted in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50; see Silver
Organization Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 98-99.) Here,
Defendant’s delay did not result from bad faith. Rather, Defendant attributes
the delay to its counsel’s and corporate officer’s respective health issues.
(Goldstein Decl., ¶¶ 4-14.) 
CONCLUSION
The
court grants Defendant’s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.
Defendant
shall give notice.
