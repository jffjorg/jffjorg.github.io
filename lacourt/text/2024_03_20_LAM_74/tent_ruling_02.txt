 Case Number:  23STCV19879    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  74 Morrison
Express Corporation v. HT Pet Products, LLC 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs
Admitted and Request for Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a breach of contract.
            On
August 18, 2023, Plaintiff Morrison Express Corporation (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendant HT Pet Products, LLC (Defendant). The complaint
alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract; (2)
breach of oral contract; (3) accounts shared; and (4) quantum meruit.
            On
September 22, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with requests for admission (RFAs).

            On
November 14, 2023, Defendant’s counsel claimed to have not received the
discovery.
            Plaintiff
re-sent the RFAs and extended Defendant’s time to respond to December 14, 2023.
            However,
Defendant did not provide timely responses to the RFAs.
            On
January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to deem the RFAs admitted.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            
If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party may move for an
order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b).) Further, the Court¿shall¿make this order, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing¿on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) ¿
            While tardy
responses may defeat the motion, they will not avoid monetary sanctions. (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction [Citation] on the party
or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.”].)  

DISCUSSION  
            This
motion is moot because Defendants served responses to the RFAs on January 19,
2024. But the responses were untimely, and sanctions are mandatory. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Plaintiff’s
counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable, and he has substantiated his
request with an hourly breakdown of work performed. (Flashman Decl., ¶ 7.) But
this motion largely duplicates the work on Plaintiff’s prior motion. The court
will reduce the award accordingly.
CONCLUSION 
The
court finds this motion moot. The court grants Plaintiff’s request for attorney
fees. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel attorney fees in the sum of
$307.50 within 10 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) and
Request for Sanctions BACKGROUND             This
action arises from a breach of contract.            On
August 18, 2023, Plaintiff Morrison Express Corporation (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendant HT Pet Products, LLC (Defendant). The complaint
alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract; (2)
breach of oral contract; (3) accounts shared; and (4) quantum meruit.            On
September 22, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with requests for production
(RFPs).             On
November 14, 2023, Defendant’s counsel claimed to have not received the
discovery.            Plaintiff
re-sent the RFPs and extended Defendant’s time to respond to December 14, 2023.            However,
Defendant did not provide timely responses to the RFPs.            On
January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel the discovery responses.LEGAL STANDARD¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  DISCUSSION                          This
motion is moot because Defendants served responses to the RFPs on January 19,
2024. But sanctions are necessary because Defendant’s failure to timely respond
lacked substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is reasonable, and he has provided a
breakdown of work performed. (Flashman Decl., ¶ 7.) CONCLUSION The
court finds this motion moot. The court grants Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel attorney fees in the sum of
$703.50 within 10 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
