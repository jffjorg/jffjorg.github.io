LINDERO V LLHOA
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  THE COURT’S OSC RE: DISMISSAL IS DISCHARGED.
Introduction 
On September 16, 2024, the Court
set an OSC re: Dismissal pursuant the five-year statute in Code of Civil
Procedure, sections. 583.360, 583.310, and 583.340 (mandatory dismissal).  Plaintiff Golf Projects Lindero, Inc.
(Plaintiff) filed their opposition to the OSC on November 15, 2024.  The remaining claims in the operative
pleading, the First Amended Complaint (FAC), are the claims against Defendant
Lordon Enterprises, Inc. (Defendant). 
The FAC was filed on August 27, 2018. 
(The original complaint filed on August 6, 2018 is inapplicable to the
five-year statute since Defendant was not named in the original
complaint.)  
Discussion 
With the FAC as to Defendant
being filed on August 27, 2018, the five year deadline would have expired on
August 27, 2023, when reviewing the matter chronologically and without
application of any extension or tolling. 

Plaintiff presented facts showing
that a stay was in place between July 9, 2019 and July 22, 2019 and also for a
second period between January 22, 2020 thru August 25, 2023.  Both the stays were due to the issue revolving
around the misappropriated email address. 
A complete stay of all proceedings tolls the running of the 5 year
statute.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
583.340(b); Bruns v. E-Commerce Exchange, Inc. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 717, 726
(Bruns);  Gaines v. Fidelity National
Title insurance Co. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1081, 1087 (Gaines).)  A partial stay is not excluded from the
5-year period unless it was “impossible, impracticable, or futile” to bring the
case to trial while the stay was in effect. 
(Code Civ. Proc., sec. 583.340(c); Bruns, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p.
726.)  The time period of the stay is
excluded from the computation of the 5-year period.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 583.340.)
Pursuant to the Court’s July 9,
2019 Minute Order, the Court issued a stay “as to the issuance of any
discovery, subpoenas, or further actions taken in these matters without prior
court order.  This stay is required to
maintain the status quo until the court resolves the issues pending before the
court including possible sanctions, disqualification, dismissal or other
orders.”  (Ilana Makovoz (Makovoz) Decl.
par. 9, Exh. D.)  The stay was
subsequently lifted on July 22, 2019. 
(Makovoz Decl. pars. 10.)  A total
of 13 days elapsed.  Although the Court’s
July 9, 2019 stay was not a complete stay of the action and was a partial stay,
the stay being as to all matters except as to sanctions, disqualification,
dismissal or other orders made it impossible, impracticable, or futile to bring
the action to trial.  The court finds
that the 5 year period was tolled for 13 days. 
Plaintiff further provided that
the Court reinstituted the stay of the action except as to the Evidentiary
Hearing on the Terminating Sanctions and all discovery except as to the email
issue.  The Court allegedly reinstituted
the stay on January 22, 2020.  (Makovoz
Decl. pars. 24 & 26; Gary Salomons (Salomons) Decl. par. 16.)  However, as admitted by Plaintiff no express
order exists as to this second stay. 
(Makovoz Decl. par. 27.)  Despite
the lack of an express order, Plaintiff presented evidence showing that the
parties proceeded to prosecute the action only as to the hearing related to the
misappropriated email and the issue of sanctions, disqualification, or
dismissal.  (Makovoz Decl. pars. 29, 41,
52-54; 59-60, 62-65, 69-72.)  At a
September 16, 2021 hearing, Plaintiff provided that the Court recalled the stay
and expressly entered an order stating that “discovery is stayed except as
relating to the evidentiary hearing.” 
(Makovoz Decl. pars. 28, 69-72, Exh. O.) 
Plaintiff asserted that it was not until August 25, 2023 that the Court
lifted this subsequent stay.  (Makovoz
Decl. par. 72.)  The time that elapsed
between January 22, 2020 and August 25, 2023 is 1,311 days.  The Court finds that this subsequent stay was
not a complete stay but a partial stay of the action since the issue of
sanctions was still being litigated.  It
is noted that during this time period the Court did not set a Case Management
Conference (CMC) or a Trial Setting Conference (TSC).  With the stay of discovery and the CMC and
TSC not being conducted, the Court finds that it was impossible, impracticable,
or futile to bring the case to trial. 
However, with the uncertainty of the January 22, 2020 re-start of the
stay, the Court is unable to determine the length of the tolling.  The September 16, 2021 stay is definitive
because of the express Court order. 
Because the record expressly reflects the September 16, 2021 as the
start of the stay, the Court uses the September 16, 2021 to calculate the
tolling of the 5 year period.  There are
708 days between September 16, 2021 and August 25, 2023.  Combining the 13 days from above with the 708
days, the total days the 5 year period was tolled is 721 days or 1 year, 11
months and 22 days.  
The 5 year period, including the
time for tolling, expires on August 17, 2025. 
Because of the time for tolling, the 5 year period has not yet
expired.  
Plaintiff’s argued that the
parties stipulated to two separate continued trial dates and thus the 5 year
period was extended.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
sec. 583.330.)  However, as reviewed
above, the 5 year period has not yet expired and Plaintiff’s arguments as to
the stipulations is moot.  
Plaintiff further argued that the
5 year period is extended for six months because of Emergency Rule 10(a).  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 583.350.)  However, Plaintiff misconstrued the statute,
the Emergency Rule, and Ables v. A. Ghazale Brothers, Inc. (2022) 74
Cal.App.5th 823, 827-828 (Ables).  The
statute requires the tolling to be based upon a “statute” and the end of the
period of tolling or extension provides less than six months to bring the
action to trial.  With these two
conditions, then the 5 year period is extended for six months.  The Ables Court expressly held that Emergency
Rule 10(a) is not a statute but an administrative rule.  Because Emergency Rule 10(a) is not a statute,
the six month extension is inapplicable. 
Plaintiff’s reliance upon Code of Civil Procedure, section 583.350 is
unfounded.
In any event, the Court found
that the 5 year period has not yet expired because of the stays implemented by
the Court.  
The OSC re: Dismissal is
DISCHARGED.
