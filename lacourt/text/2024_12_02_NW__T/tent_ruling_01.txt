  Case Number:  23VECV01421    Hearing Date:   December 2, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01421
ZOMORODINIA V HANSOTIA
On
Monday, the court will advance the hearing on the Motion for Protective
Order. 
Tentative
ruling on the motion: The motion is improper.  If the deposition is
timely noticed and a party does not appear, that is the problem of that
party.  There was no basis for plaintiff to stop the deposition of
Dr. Salem, a third party witness not represented by plaintiff’s counsel,
particularly considering how difficult it was to schedule.  Mr.
Wegman did not state a valid reason to adjourn the deposition. Oddly
enough, plaintiff’s counsel stopped the deposition and then asks the court
to not let it be finished and for sanctions.  For what it is unclear.  The notice of the deposition was timely served.  The deposition should not have been adjourned
by plaintiff.
