And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the OSC re: Dismissal is discharged. The Court has reviewed the case and finds that the five-year statute has not yet expired due to the stays implemented by the Court. The case was stayed from July 9, 2019 to July 22, 2019 and again from January 22, 2020 to August 25, 2023, which tolled the running of the five-year period. The Court finds that the stays were partial and not complete, but that they made it impossible, impracticable, or futile to bring the case to trial. The Court has calculated the tolling period to be 721 days and has determined that the five-year period expires on August 17, 2025. The Court rejects the Plaintiff's arguments that the parties stipulated to two separate continued trial dates and that the five-year period is extended for six months due to Emergency Rule 10(a). The Court's ruling is based on the statute and the case law, including Bruns v. E-Commerce Exchange, Inc. (2011), Gaines v. Fidelity National Title insurance Co. (2016), and Ables v. A. Ghazale Brothers, Inc. (2022).
