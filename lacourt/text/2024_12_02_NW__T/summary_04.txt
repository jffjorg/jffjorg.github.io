And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff, Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, is entitled to summary judgment in its lawsuit against the Defendant, Poopak Sanati. The lawsuit alleges two causes of action: breach of implied warranty of title/covenant against encumbrances and restitution based on unjust enrichment. The Plaintiff issued a title insurance policy to the Insureds, Mattia Pascolini and Jessica Pascolini, for the conveyance of real property from the Defendant to the Insureds. However, unbeknownst to the Plaintiff and the Insureds, the Defendant retained a portion of the sale proceeds that should have been used to pay off a prior deed of trust. The Plaintiff paid off the prior deed of trust as a result of the Insureds filing a claim with the Plaintiff, and despite multiple demands, the Defendant failed to pay reimbursement. The judge has ruled that there are no triable issues of fact and has granted the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
