And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will be advancing the hearing on the Motion for Protective Order on December 2, 2024. The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion is improper. The plaintiff's request to stop the deposition of Dr. Salem, a third party witness, is denied. The deposition was timely noticed, and the plaintiff's counsel had no valid reason to adjourn it. The plaintiff's counsel stopped the deposition and then requested that the court not allow it to be finished and requested sanctions, but the judge does not understand why. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel should have allowed the deposition to continue, and the motion for protective order is denied.
