   [1] The  Caption Page of the Complaint also includes what appear to be a fourth cause of  action for alter ego and a fifth cause of action for damage, but the body of  the Complaint does not allege alter ego as a separate cause of action, nor is  there any separate fifth cause of action for damage. The first three causes of  action are the only causes of action alleged in the Complaint.   [2] E.g., the Agreement appears as  though it was executed on August 1, 2021 rather than August 17, 2021 as  Plaintiff alleges. (Compl., Ex. 3; see also Moran v. Prime Healthcare  Mgmt., Inc. (2016) 3 Cal. App. 5th 1131,  1145-1146) [“While the ‘allegations [of a complaint] must be accepted as true  for purposes of demurrer,’ the ‘facts appearing in exhibits attached to the  complaint will also be accepted as true and, if contrary to the allegations in  the pleading, will be given precedence.’”] [internal citation omitted].  However, this discrepancy does not constitute failure to state a cause of  action.
