Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Rui Chen to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Martin Zheng. The Judge has OVERRULED the demurrer in its entirety. The demurrer alleged that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. However, the Judge has found that the complaint sufficiently alleges facts to support these claims.

The Judge has ruled that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to apprise Chen of what is at stake in this action, namely that Plaintiff invested $100,000 with Defendants but has not received any dividends or a full refund. The Judge has also found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, including allegations that Chen failed to conduct shareholder meetings and failed to provide financial documents.

The Judge has further ruled that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support an alter ego theory of liability between the Defendants. The Judge has ordered Chen to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
