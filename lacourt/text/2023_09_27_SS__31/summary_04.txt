## English Summary

This tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim grants Defendants' motion to augment their expert witness list in the case of David Gregory Crofts v. Ronaldo Belk et al. 

The original expert witness, Griff Stelzner, had retired, necessitating the replacement with Jacqueline Nash Bloink as the medical billing and coding expert. 

The court found that Defendants acted with mistake, inadvertence, and surprise in initially designating Stelzner and that granting the motion would not prejudice Plaintiff, as no expert depositions have been taken. The trial date is approaching, but the motion was filed before discovery and motion deadlines expired.  

The ruling is tentative, meaning it can be modified based on further discussion or arguments at the hearing.

English text:
The Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California, Central District, County of Los Angeles, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by Defendants, Ronaldo Belk and Secure Sheet Metal, to augment their expert designation. The motion was filed because Defendants' original medical billing and coding expert, Griff Stelzner, had retired and they wanted to replace him with Jacqueline Nash Bloink. The trial is set for October 12, 2023, and Defendants argue that there is no prejudice to Plaintiff, David Gregory Crofts, because no expert depositions have been taken yet.

The Judge notes that Defendants suffered from mistake, inadvertence, and surprise in naming Stelzner as their billing and coding expert because they did not realize Stelzner would retire prior to trial. The Judge also notes that it appears there is no identifiable prejudice to Plaintiff since they did not oppose the motion.

Based on these findings, the Judge grants Defendants' motion to augment their expert designation. Defendants are ordered to give notice.
