And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Shengfei Yu, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Marco Villalobos, in the amount of $34,895.54. This amount includes $8,750 in special damages, $25,000 in general damages, and $1,145.54 in costs. The plaintiff has submitted medical bills for treatment obtained in August 2018, which demonstrates past medical specials in the amount of $8,750. However, the plaintiff has only generally stated that they continue to suffer from the incident without providing any supporting documentation to justify the $25,000 in general damages. The court cannot award speculative damages, which means compensation for future loss or harm that is not reasonably certain. Therefore, the court will reduce the plaintiff's request for general damages to $13,125. The court grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment in the principal amount of $21,875 (special and general damages) and $1,145.54 in costs, for a total amount of $23,020.54 against the defendant Marco Villalobos.
