## English Summary

Judge Michelle C. Kim issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elma Goytoy, et al. vs. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, et al.  The judge ruled in favor of the defendant (Metro) who sought to depose Plaintiff Brenda Jackson. 

The judge found that while Plaintiff Jackson has some cognitive impairment, the available evidence does not demonstrate she is incapable of testifying. Metro had attempted to schedule Jackson's deposition multiple times, but Plaintiff's counsel objected, claiming Jackson is incompetent due to dementia. The judge determined that the presented medical evidence was insufficient to support a protective order preventing the deposition. 

Therefore, the judge granted Metro's motion to compel Jackson's deposition, and denied Plaintiff's motion for a protective order.
