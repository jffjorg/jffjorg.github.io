And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Brenda Jackson, who is alleged to have dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order to prevent the deposition, finding that there is no evidence that Plaintiff Jackson's condition makes it impossible, oppressive, or an undue burden for her to sit for her deposition. The judge has ordered Plaintiff Jackson to appear for deposition at a date, time, and location to be determined by the defendant, and has instructed the parties to meet and confer to determine the date and time for the deposition.
