## English Summary:

The judge denied the motion filed by Plaintiff Anthony Osegueda's attorney, Jonathon Farahi, to be relieved as counsel. The reason for denial is that proper service of the motion on the Plaintiff was not provided according to California Rules of Court. 

Although Counsel claims attempts to contact Plaintiff have been unsuccessful, he failed to demonstrate proper service of the motion papers. The judge ordered Counsel to properly serve the motion on Plaintiff and all parties involved in the case, including service on the Clerk of the Court. 


The case is scheduled for a hearing on September 27, 2023,  and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer before then. They can either submit on the tentative ruling or appear for oral arguments.
