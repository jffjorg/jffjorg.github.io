And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor, Diego Ramirez, age 15. The judge finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable, and the attorneys' fees, which amount to 25% of the settlement, to be fair and reasonable as well. However, the judge denies the petition because the petitioner, Esmeralda Corrales, did not properly sign the amended petition. Specifically, she signed on the signature line for the claimant, which is not allowed since the claimant is a minor and cannot sign. Instead, she should have signed on her designated signature box. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and indicates that the petition will be granted once the petitioner signs it correctly.
