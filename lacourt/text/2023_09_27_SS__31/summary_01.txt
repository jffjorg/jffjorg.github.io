This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim regarding a motion to compel responses to supplemental discovery requests filed by Defendant Jack Swank, et al. The motion was denied because the discovery cut-off deadline had already passed, and Plaintiff had no obligation to respond to the second set of supplemental discovery requests. The Court also granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions against defense counsel in the amount of $415.00. The Judge noted that the trial date has been continued multiple times, but discovery was not reopened, and therefore, Plaintiff was not required to respond to discovery requests due after the discovery cut-off date.
