Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Chuka Foods Inc. DBA Denny's Restaurant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against All Ways Steam Cleaning for implied indemnity and contributory negligence. The slip and fall accident occurred on November 4, 2022, and Chuka Foods filed its Answer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint on the same day. The Court finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises from the same incident and that defense counsel mistakenly failed to file a cross-complaint at the time of the filing of the Answer. Since no opposition was filed, the Court grants the motion and orders Chuka Foods to file its proposed cross-complaint within ten days of the date of this Order.
