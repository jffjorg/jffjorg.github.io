Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Chuka Foods Inc. DBA Denny's Restaurant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against All Ways Steam Cleaning for implied indemnity and contributory negligence. The slip and fall accident occurred on November 4, 2022, and Chuka Foods filed its Answer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint on the same day. The Court finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises from the same incident and that defense counsel mistakenly failed to file a cross-complaint at the time of the filing of the Answer. Since no opposition was filed, the Court grants the motion and orders Chuka Foods to file its proposed cross-complaint within ten days of the date of this Order.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Terrill D. Pointer vs. Chuka Foods Inc. d/b/a Denny's Restaurant and All Ways Steam Cleaning. 

Essentially, Chuka Foods wants to file a cross-complaint against All Ways claiming that All Ways is responsible for the plaintiff's injuries because they contributed to the slip and fall incident. Chuka Foods filed their answer to the plaintiff's complaint late, missing the deadline to also file a cross-complaint.  

The judge is granting Chuka Foods permission to file the cross-complaint because:

1. Both claims arise from the same incident.
2. Chuka Foods acted in good faith and there is no harm to any party by filing the cross-complaint now.
3. The trial date is still several months away, allowing time for discovery.


The judge encourages the parties to discuss this ruling and potentially settle their dispute before the hearing.
