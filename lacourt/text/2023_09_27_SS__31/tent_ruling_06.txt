However, this time, Petitioner did not properly sign the amended petition.   On page 10 of MC-350, Petitioner signed on the signature line for Claimant. As Claimant is a minor, and therefore does not have capacity to sign, the signature line for Item 21 may be left blank. Instead, Petitioner must sign on her designated signature box in Item 23, which is located below the attorney’s signature box.  The petition filed on September 13, 2023 will be granted once Petitioner signs the petition.    Moving party is ordered to give notice.
