Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to deposition and production of documents filed by the plaintiff, Joseph Glyzewski. The plaintiff suffered injuries while on the defendants' premises and alleges that the door hatch slammed shut onto his body. The defendants, Stephen R Dixon and Stephen R. Dixon Trust, opposed the motion, arguing that it was untimely and that the plaintiff had failed to show good cause for the production of documents.

The judge granted the motion as to issues 1-6 and 8, compelling the defendants to provide further responses to deposition questions. The judge also granted the motion as to the production of documents, ordering the defendants to produce code-compliant responses and all non-privileged requested documents.

The judge imposed sanctions on defense counsel, ordering them to pay $1,060 to the plaintiff. The judge also awarded the plaintiff $1,000 in attorney's fees and $60 in costs.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to schedule the resumption of the deposition, which must be taken within 30 days.
