Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Huyen Gale, arguing that the Plaintiff's Doe Amendment naming her as a defendant is time-barred. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff was genuinely ignorant of Huyen Gale's identity at the time of the filing of the complaint, and that CCP § 474 allows for the addition of new defendants after the statute of limitations has expired. The Judge also finds that there has been no showing of actual prejudice from the delay in filing the Doe amendment. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the Plaintiff's Doe Amendment is allowed.
