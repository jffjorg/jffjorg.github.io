And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff's counsel, Brett Yorke, Esq, filed the motion on September 14, 2023, alleging that the dismissal was the result of excusable neglect due to a misunderstanding regarding the order granting their motion to be relieved as counsel. The judge has determined that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's mistake and has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and the counsel is ordered to give notice.
