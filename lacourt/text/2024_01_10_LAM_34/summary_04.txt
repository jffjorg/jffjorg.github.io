And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by John F. Bazan, attorney for Plaintiff Ramish Manglani, as moot. The motion was filed on November 22, 2023, but on January 5, 2024, the Clerk's Office dismissed Plaintiff Ramish Manglani with prejudice from the Complaint. As a result, attorney Bazan is no longer counsel for any party in the matter. Since there is no opposition or response to the motion, the judge has denied the motion as moot.
