BACKGROUND:
 
        On

Complaint against Defendant Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi (erroneously sued as Azizi
Ha Rakhamon Farhod) on causes of action arising from alleged negligence. 
 
        On
April 21, 2023, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint. 
 
        On
May 24, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi filed his
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Peter Velasquez Hernandez, Daniel
Anselmo Arroyo, and Cali Exotic Rentals. 
 
        On
November 22, 2023, Counsel for Plaintiff Ramish Manglani, John F. Bazan, filed:
(1) MC-051, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) MC-052, Declaration; (3)

Civil. Counsel Bazan had previously been counsel of record for both Plaintiffs,
however, he had substituted out as counsel of record for Plaintiff Eliyaho
Schefres as of April 21, 2023. 
 
        On
January 5, 2024, by request of Plaintiffs, the Clerk’s Office dismissed with
prejudice Plaintiff Ramish Manglani from the Complaint. 
 
        No
opposition or other response has been filed to the Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
        On April 23, 2023, attorney John F. Bazan was substituted out
of the case by his client, Plaintiff Schefres. 
(See Bazan Declaration, ¶ 6.  [The
Court notes that counsel Bazan consistently misspells the name of his former client
throughout his declaration.])  On January 5, 2024, by request of Plaintiffs, the Clerk’s Office
dismissed with prejudice Plaintiff Ramish Manglani from the Complaint. Thus, attorney Bazan is no longer counsel
for any party in this matter.  
 
        The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED as moot.
