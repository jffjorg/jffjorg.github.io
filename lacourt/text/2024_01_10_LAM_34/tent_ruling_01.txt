BACKGROUND:
 
On March 19, 2021,
Plaintiff Linkun Investment, Inc. filed its Complaint against Defendants
Salvatore Anthony DiMaria, Shing “Jacky” Lo, ADD Enterprises, Inc., Manning’s
Beef LLC, Charlie DiMaria & Son Inc., and Manning Land Company, LLC on
causes of action arising from the Parties’ business interactions. 
 
On November 29, 2022,
Plaintiff amended its Complaint to substitute Doe 1 with RNCK, Inc. 
 
On June 30, 2023, by
request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office dismissed without prejudice Defendant
Shing “Jacky” Lo from the Complaint. 
 
From July 31 to
August 4, 2023, the Court held a jury trial in this matter. 
 
On August 4, 2023,
the Jury found: 
 
(1)       in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant ADD on Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of contract
pursuant to the “Joint Venture Agreement”; 
 
(2)       in favor of Defendant
DiMaria and against Plaintiff on Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Motion
to Amend Judgment
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“When jurisdiction is,
by the Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court
or judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also
given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be
not specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process
or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187.)
 
“That a court may at any time amend
its judgment so that the latter will properly designate the real defendants is
not open to question. . . . Where there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the
separateness of the corporations has ceased and the facts are such that an
adherence to the fiction of separate existence of the corporation would under
the particular circumstances sanction a fraud or promote an injustice, separate
identity will be disregarded. Thus it has been held that where a corporation was but the
instrumentality through which an individual for convenience transacted his
business, all of the authorities, not only equity but the law itself, would
hold such a corporation bound as the owner of the corporation might be bound,
or conversely, hold the owner bound by acts which bound his corporation.” (Mirabito v. San Francisco Dairy Co. (1935) 8 Cal.App.2d 54, 57, 59, citations omitted.)

 
“We hold that Code of Civil Procedure section 187 authorizes a trial
court to amend a judgment to add a judgment debtor who is found to be an alter
ego of a corporate defendant. The alter ego doctrine does not require proof of
fraud, and can be satisfied by evidence that adherence to the fiction of the
separate existence of the corporation would promote injustice. Finally, a
plaintiff's failure to allege the alter ego doctrine in the underlying lawsuit
does not preclude a motion to amend the judgment.” (Misik v. D’Arco (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 1065, 1069.)
 
“To prevail in a motion to add judgment debtors, [the moving
party] must show that (1) the parties to be added as judgment debtors had
control of the underlying litigation and were virtually represented in that
proceeding; (2) there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the
separate personalities of the entity and the owners no longer exist; and (3) an
inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated as those of the entity
alone.” (Triya Hospitality Mgmt., LLC v. WSI (II)—HWP, LLC (2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 636, 641, citations omitted.)
 
“The alter ego doctrine was extended
to LLCs by Corporations Code section 17703.04, subdivision (b) [‘A
member of a limited liability company shall be subject to liability under the
common law governing alter ego liability’].” (Blizzard Energy, Inc. v.
Schaefers (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 832, 846.)
 
“The greatest liberality is to be
encouraged in the allowance of such amendments in order to see that justice is
done.” (Greenspan v. LADT LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508 [quotation
and internal quotation marks omitted].)
 
        However,
“when
plaintiffs ‘summarily add’
individuals to a previously entered default judgment against a corporation,
those individuals are denied due process.” (Lopez v. Escamilla (2022) 79
Cal.App.5th 646, 652, quoting Motores de Mexicali, S. A. v. Super. Ct. of
Los Angeles County (1958) 51 Cal.2d 172, 176.)
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to amend
judgment to add RNCK, Inc. as a defendant. (Motion to Amend Judgment, p.
4:27–28.)
 
Defendants oppose the motion,
arguing that Plaintiff does not satisfy the requirements of alter ego to add
RNCK, Inc. to the judgment. (Opposition, p. 2:22–23.)
 
Plaintiff replies: (1) that it
submitted substantial evidence supporting an alter ego finding; (2) that case
law favors a finding of alter ego liability; (3) that Plaintiff acted
diligently; and (4) that RNCK, Inc. would not be prejudiced by being added to
the judgment. (Reply regarding Motion to Amend Judgment, p. 1:21, 2:7, 2:26.)
 
        Plaintiff has
the better of the arguments. 
 
        Among other
things, Plaintiff submits the following evidence:
 
(1)      
portions
of the deposition of Defendant Salvatore Anthony DiMaria, including this
question and answer:
 
Q: Is it fair to say that ADD,
Manning Beef, Manning Land, Charlie DiMaria and Co. and RNCK operate as one
business?
 
MR. JEON: Objection. Legal
Conclusion.
 
THE WITNESS: They are fully
integrated. So to answer your question, ultimately it’s one company. I had
partners in all those other companies up until a couple of years ago and the
answer to your question, ultimately it’s one company.
 
(2)      
a letter
titled “Independent Accounts’ Review Report” from Genske, Mulder & Co., LLP
(a certified public accounting company), which states, among other things, that
“RNCK is 100% owned by the managing member and 100% owner of the Company.”
 
(Decl. Brucker in support of Motion to Amend Judgment, Exhs.
1, 2.)
 
        The evidence
submitted by Defendants, which includes portions of the deposition of Defendant
Salvatore Anthony DiMaria, does not defeat Plaintiff’s evidence. Indeed, while
Defendant DiMaria declares that “each of these companies keep separate books
and records,” he also admits that “I’m the sole owner of all companies.” (Decl.
Jeon in support of Opposition to Motion to Amend Judgment, Exh. 1.)
 
        Given the
evidence produced at trial and the judgment that Defendants engaged in fraud,
there is ample evidence in favor of Plaintiff’s argument that an inequitable
result will follow if RNCK, Inc. is not treated as a defendant in the judgment.  
 
        Plaintiff has
shown: (1) that there is such a unity of interest and ownership between RNCK,
Inc. and all other Defendants that the separate personalities of RNCK, Inc. and
the other Defendants no longer exist; (2) that RNCK, Inc., as an alter ego of
the other Defendants, had control of the underling litigation and were
virtually represented in that proceeding; and (3) that an inequitable result
will follow if the acts are treated as those of the existing Defendants alone.
(Triya Hospitality Mgmt., LLC, supra, 57 Cal.App.5th at p. 641.)
 
C. 
    Conclusion
 
The Motion to Amend Judgment is
GRANTED. The judgment shall be amended to add RNCK, Inc. as a defendant, with
joint and several liability for the judgment. 
 
II.      
Motions
for Attorneys Fees and to Tax Costs
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(B).)
 
Prevailing parties seeking to claim
costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a), and parties
seeking to contest costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b). 
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
1. 
    The
Parties’ Requests and Arguments
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to award
Plaintiff $1,991,565.00 in attorneys’ fees (consisting of $1,957,750.00 in fees
as of November 7, 2023 and an additional $33,815.00 in fees as of November 29,
2023). (Memorandum for Motion for Attorney Fees, p. 6:16–19; Reply regarding
Motion for Attorney Fees, p. 4:16–19.) According to information provided by
Plaintiff’s Counsel, the vast majority of this work was done by two partners,
two associates, and two paralegals, with a minor amount of work done by eleven
others (a mix of partners, associates, and paralegals). (Decl. Holden in
support of Motion for Attorney Fees, pp. 2–3.)
 
Plaintiff also requests $319,579.80
in costs, which includes:
 
(1)      
$2,022.40
in filing and motion fees;
(2)      
$747.92
in jury fees;
(3)      
$25,980.15
in deposition costs;
(4)      
$5,677.90
in service of process costs;
(5)      
$3,640.00
in witness fees;
(6)      
$5,150.60
in court reporter fees;
(7)      
$9.00 in
models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits costs;
(8)      
$12,180.64
in interpreter fees;
(9)      
$6,181.69
in electronic filing or service fees;
(10)   
$15,469.39
in electronic document hosting fees; and
(11)   
$242,520.11
in “other” fees.
 
(MC-010, p. 1.)
 
        Defendants
oppose the Motion for Attorney Fees, arguing: (1) that the rates sought are not
supported by a showing of reasonable rates in the community; and (2) that
Plaintiff does not provide competent evidence in support of the amount of hours
reasonably incurred in the prosecution of the action. (Opposition to Motion for
Attorney Fees, pp. 3:25–26, 4:20–22, 5:9–12.)
 
        Defendants also
move the Court to tax: (1) the expedited transcript costs; (2) the
investigation costs; (3) the expert witness deposition fees; (4) the court
reporter fees and transcript fees for hearings; (5) the court interpreter fees;
(6) the electronic document hosting fees; and (7) all “other” fees. (Motion to
Tax Costs, pp. 3:14, 4:1, 4:9, 4:15–16, 5:1, 5:12–13, 6:1.)
 
        As to
attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff argues: (1) that Defendants misrepresent market
rates in Los Angeles; (2) that Plaintiff’s Counsel is entitled to market rates,
not discounted rates; and (3) that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s hours are sufficiently
supported. (Reply regarding Motion for Attorney Fees, p. 3:2, 3:14, 3:25.)
 
        As to costs,
Plaintiff argues: (1) that the accounting referee’s fees are expressly
authorized; (2) that Plaintiff is entitled to recover travel expenses; (3) that
the expedited deposition transcripts were necessary; (4) that appearance fees
incurred because of continuances are recoverable; (5) that reporter fees and
real-time trial transcripts are recoverable; (6) that interpreter fees are
recoverable; and (7) electronic discovery fees are recoverable. (Opposition to
Motion to Tax Costs, pp. 2:16, 3:1, 3:17, 4:7, 4:14, 4:25, 5:4.)
 
        As to costs,
Defendants reply: (1) that the accounting referee’s fees were not reasonable
and Defendants were led to believe that the fees were being paid by Plaintiff;
(2) that Plaintiff does not mention why the travel expenses were necessary and
reasonable; (3) that reporter fees and real-time transcripts are unreasonable
and were not mandated by the Court; and (4) electronic discovery fees are
unreasonable and unnecessary. (Reply regarding Motion to Tax Costs, pp.
3:21–22, 5:23–24, 6:16–17, 7:1–2.)
 
C. 
    Attorneys’
Fees
 
1. 
    Prevailing
Party
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“‘Prevailing party’ includes the
party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is
entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,
and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief
against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in
situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff prevailed against
Defendants in this litigation, including on a cause of action for violation of
Penal Code section 496. Thus, Plaintiff is the prevailing party here. 
 
2. 
    Authority for Fees
 
Plaintiff argues that the authority
for fees comes from a provision in the Parties’ contract and the Penal Code
section 496, subdivision (c). 
 
        “Any person who
has been injured by a violation of subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action
for three times the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the
plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees.” (Pen. Code, § 496,
subd. (c).)
 
        Plaintiff does
not provide the Court with a copy of the relevant contract provision. 
 
        Defendants do
not argue that Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees. Thus, Defendants
concede this point. 
 
        As Plaintiff
prevailed against Defendants in this litigation, including on a cause of action
or violation of Penal Code section 496, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that it
is entitled to attorneys’ fees. 
 
3. 
    Method
for Calculating Recovery
 
The Parties do not dispute that the
appropriate approach for calculating recovery of attorneys’ fees is the
lodestar adjustment method, which involves multiplying the number of hours
reasonably expended by the reasonably hourly rate. (Warren v. Kia Motors Am.
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36; accord Hanna v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2019)
36 Cal.App.5th 493, 509–12.) 
 
4. 
    Reasonableness
of the Fees Requested
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“Under the lodestar adjustment methodology, the trial court
must initially determine the actual time expended and then ascertain whether
under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being
made for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include,
but are not limited to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the
attorney skill exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee
applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation,
and were
reasonable in amount. It follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet
this burden, and the court finds the time expended or amount charged is not
reasonable under the circumstances, then the court must take this into account
and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am.,
LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].)
 
b.  
    The
Hourly Rates
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel claims the
following hourly rates:
 
(1)      
$750.00
per hour for Partner Gary Brucker, Jr.;
(2)      
$750.00
per hour for Partner Amy Goldman;
(3)      
$1,000.00
per hour for Partner Craig Holden;
(4)      
$750.00
per hour for Partner Michael Magloff;
(5)      
$750.00
per hour for Partner Greg Oleson; 
(6)      
$850.00
per hour for Partner John Yung;
(7)      
$450.00
per hour for Associate Tyler Duncan;
(8)      
$450.00
per hour for Associate Josh Genzuk;
(9)      
$450.00
per hour for Associate Caitlin Higgins;
(10)   
$450.00
per hour for Associate Emily Hyatt;
(11)   
$450.00
per hour for Associate Anastasiya Menshikova;
(12)   
$450.00
per hour for Associate Daniel Velladao;
(13)   
$450.00
per hour for Associate Xuan Zhou;
(14)   
$250.00
per hour for Paralegal Deniss Bartel;
(15)   
$250.00
per hour for Paralegal Sharon Hodgson; 
(16)   
$250.00
per hour for Paralegal Melinda Timms; and
(17)   
$250.00
per hour for Paralegal Shiela Washington.
 
(Decl. Holden in support of Motion for Attorney Fees, pp.
2–3.)
 
        Plaintiff’s
Counsel only provides detailed information for the two partners (Craig Holden
and Gary Brucker, Jr.), two associates (Anastasiya Menshikova and Emily Hyatt),
and two paralegals (Dennis Bartel and Melinda Timms) – the attorneys and
paralegals who incurred the overwhelming majority of the hours in this matter.
(Decl. Holden in support of Motion for Attorney Fees, ¶¶ 2–6.)
 
        Defendants ask
the Court to consider Defense Counsels’ hourly rates in order to ascertain the
appropriate hourly rates in the relevant community. (Opposition to Motion for
Attorney Fees, p. 4:7–10.) For multiple reasons, the Court declines to do so,
not least of which is that there are many good reasons why Plaintiff’s Counsel
and Defense Counsel charge different rates. 
 
        Regarding the
attorneys and paralegals for which the Court does not have specific
information, the Court is unable to determine whether their hourly rates are
reasonable. Without that information, the Court has no reason to award them
fees rates that are higher than entry-level positions for their categories. 
 
        Regarding Craig
Holden (who has been a lawyer for thirty years), Gary Brucker, Jr. (who has
been a lawyer for nearly twenty years), Anastasiya Menshikova (who has been a
lawyer for more than five years), and Melinda Timms (who has been a paralegal
for nearly thirty-five years), the Court finds that their hourly rates are
reasonable given their comparable skills and experience in the relevant
community. 
 
        However, the
hourly rates requested by Emily Hyatt (who graduated law school in 2022) and
Dennis Bartel (who appears to have been a paralegal for only five years) as
well as the other attorneys and paralegals appear unreasonable given either their
skills and experience in the relevant community or the lack of information provided
to the Court regarding their skills and experience. The Court will reduce their
hourly rates to what it finds to be reasonable in the community. 
 
 
c.  
    The
Number of Hours
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel claims that
2,871.5 hours were incurred in this litigation, including 2,534.6 hours by
attorneys and 336.9 by paralegals. (Decl. Holden in support of Motion for
Attorney Fees, pp. 2–3.) This does not include the supplemental request for
$33,815.00 in attorney fees, of which no hourly breakdown is provided to the
Court. (See Reply regarding Motion for Attorney Fees, p. 4:16–19; see also Decl.
Brucker in support of Reply regarding Motion for Attorney Fees, ¶ 6.)
 
        For the hours
that are specifically claimed, Plaintiff’s Counsel does not provide any
invoices that show how the claimed hours were incurred. The Court only has a
few paragraphs of declarations from Plaintiff’s Counsel. (Decl. Holden in
support of Motion for Attorney Fees, ¶¶ 9–13; Decl. Brucker in support of Reply
regarding Motion for Attorney Fees, ¶¶ 3–6.)
 
        Defendants
argue:
 
“There is no way for the Court to
analyze this, and it makes it nearly impossible for Defendants to rebut. Linkun
could have simply attached redacted records or summarized by billing code—at
least the Court would be able to see how much time was expended on ‘drafting
discovery motions,’ or ‘responding to written discovery,’ or ‘preparing for
depositions,’ etc. There must be something more specific that [sic] the de
minimis and conclusory summary from lead counsel that his firm reasonably
expended 2,871.5 hours. Certainly, the law requires Plaintiff to make a greater
showing to merit $2 million in attorneys fees.”
 
(Opposition to Motion for Attorney Fees, p. 5:1–7.)
 
        The Court
agrees with Defendants. 
 
        “In California,
an attorney need not submit contemporaneous time records in order to recover attorney
fees . . . . Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a
particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees,
even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Martino v. Denevi (1986)
182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559, citations omitted.)
 
        However,
“contemporaneous time records are the best evidence of lawyers’ hourly work.
They are not indispensable, but they eclipse other proofs. Lawyers know this
better than anyone. They might heed what they know.” (Taylor v. Cnty. of Los
Angeles (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 205, 207.) 
Without such time records or billing statements, a motion for attorney
fees must be supported by declarations explaining, “in more than general terms,
the extent of services rendered to the client.” (Martino, supra,
182 Cal.App.3d at pp. 559-560.)
 
“In any event, fee motions must be
based on detailed time records, not on the memories of the attorneys involved.”
(Crespin v. Shewry (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 259, 271.)
 
        “To enable the
trial court to determine whether attorney fees should be awarded and in what
amount, an attorney should present (1) evidence, documentary and oral, of the
services actually performed; and (2) expert opinion, by the applicant and other
lawyers, as to what would be a reasonable fee for such services. In many cases
the trial court will be aware of the nature and extent of the attorney’s
services from its observation of the trial proceedings and the pretrial and
discovery proceedings reflected in the file. However, in the absence of such
crucial information as the number of hours worked, billing rates, types of
issues dealt with and appearances made on the client’s behalf, the trial court
is placed in the position of simply guessing at the actual value of the
attorney’s services. That practice is unacceptable and cannot be the basis for
an award of fees.” (Martino, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at p.
558, cleaned up.)
 
        Here,
Plaintiff’s Counsel has provided hourly rates, aggregate hours incurred (with
only a breakdown by individual, not by line item), and only a few paragraphs
explaining how the hours were incurred. While the Court could probably award
attorneys’ fees based on this marginal amount of evidence, Defendants have been
prejudiced by not being able to scrutinize or attack the records for instances
of overbilling. Further, while this case has taken three years and has been
hard-fought, the more than 2,500 hours of attorney time appears unreasonable. 
 
“If . . . the Court were required to award
a reasonable fee when an outrageously unreasonable one has been asked for,
claimants would be encouraged to make unreasonable demands, knowing that the
only unfavorable consequence of such misconduct would be reduction of their fee
to what they should have asked in the first place. To discourage such greed, a
severer reaction is needful.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
635 [cleaned up].)¿
 
“A
fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez
v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137; Serrano, supra, 32 Cal.3d at
p. 635.) 
 
However, the
Court chooses not to deny the fee application on this ground.
 
“When a ‘voluminous fee application’ is
made, the court may, as it did here, ‘make across-the-board percentage cuts
either in the number of hours claimed or in the final lodestar figure.’ These
percentage cuts to large fee requests are, however, ‘subject to heightened
scrutiny and the use of percentages, in any case, neither discharges the
district court from its responsibility to set forth a ‘concise but clear’
explanation of its reasons for choosing a given percentage reduction nor from
its duty to independently review the applicant's fee request.’” (Kerkeles v.
City of San Jose (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102, quoting Gates v.
Deukmejian (9th Cir. 1992) 987 F.2d 1392, 1399.)
 
        The Court adopts that approach here and
applies a 30% across-the-board percentage cut to the number of hours claimed. 
 
The Court recognizes that this case was hard-fought; according
to the Court’s records, there were law-and-motion hearings on at least 30 days
in this matter, and trial took 5 days.  The
Court itself has almost 170 pages of notes on this case.  This does not include numerous depositions that
were taken in this case. The extraordinarily large number of hearings has made
the Court quite familiar with all counsel and parties in this matter.  
 
Nonetheless, based on the Court’s experience presiding over
civil cases for more than 16 years , and based on its familiarity with this
case, the Court finds that no more than 1,900 hours of work (including
paralegal hours) were reasonably necessary for the outcome Plaintiff’s reached
in this litigation. Furthermore, without invoices, both Defendants and the
Court have been limited in their ability to fully scrutinize whether more attorney
hours were reasonable.
 
        In
addition, the Court will allow an additional $7,500.00 in fees for the work
done since the Motion for Attorney Fees was filed. In lieu of any invoices or
hourly breakdown for the $33,815.00 requested, the Court awards $7,500.00 in
fees based on (1) the hourly rates allowed by the Court and (2) the Court’s
experience of what occurred in the litigation during the period since the
Motion for Attorney fees was filed.  
 
 
D. 
    Costs
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
The Court separately considers each
category of contested costs, including: (1) whether they are specifically
allowable or specifically prohibited; (2) whether they were incurred, whether
or not paid; (3) whether they were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation; and
(4) reasonable in amount. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds. (a), (b), and
(c)(1)–(3).
 
“Items not mentioned in this
section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the
court’s discretion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4); see also Foothill-De Anza Cmty. Coll.
Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30.)
 
2. 
    Discussion
 
a.  
    The
Court Reporter Fees and Transcript Costs
 
“Transcripts of court proceedings
ordered by the court” are specifically allowable costs, while “[t]ranscripts of
court proceedings not ordered by the court” are specifically prohibited, except
where expressly authorized by law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (a)(9),
(b)(5).
 
        “Court reporter
fees as established by statute” are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(11).)
 
The Court did not order any
transcripts or any court reporting. Plaintiff has not pointed to any law that
specifically authorizes the recovery of transcript costs in absence of the
Court ordering the transcripts or court reporting, and Plaintiff has not
pointed to any law that authorizes court reporter fees. Thus, transcript costs
are prohibited, and the Court declines to allow the court reporter fees.
 
The Court strikes all of those
costs.  
 
b.  
    The
Investigation Costs
 
“The following items are not allowable
as costs, except when expressly authorized by law: . . . (2) Investigation
expenses in preparing the case for trial.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(b)(2).)
 
        Plaintiff does
not argue in its Opposition to Motion to Tax Costs that the investigation costs
are allowed. Thus, Plaintiff concedes this point. In any case, the Court is not
aware of any statute that would authorize investigation costs here. 
 
        The Court
strikes all of those costs. 
 
c.  
    The
Expert Witness Deposition Fees
 
        “Fees of experts
not ordered by the court” are “not allowable as costs, except when expressly
authorized by law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(1).)
 
“Taking, video recording, and
transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and one copy of those
taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by the party against
whom costs are allowed” are “allowable as costs under [Code of Civil Procedure]
Section 1032.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(A).)
 
        Defendants
argue that the expert witness deposition fees are not allowable. 
 
Plaintiff argues that the expedited
deposition transcripts were necessary. 
 
Defendants do not revisit the issue
in their Reply regarding Motion to Tax Costs. 
 
Necessary deposition transcripts,
including of experts, are recoverable, and they are different from expert
witness fees. The Court finds that these costs were reasonable and will allow
them. 
 
d.  
    The
Court Interpreter Fees
 
“Fees of a certified or registered
interpreter for the deposition of a party or witness who does not proficiently
speak or understand the English language” are “allowable as costs under [Code
of Civil Procedure] Section 1032.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(3)(B).)
 
        “Court
interpreter fees for a qualified court interpreter authorized by the court for
an indigent person represented by a qualified legal services project, as
defined in Section 6213 of the Business and Professions Code, or a pro bono
attorney, as defined in Section 8030.4 of the Business and Professions Code” are
“allowable as Costs under [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 1032.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(12).)
 
        Defendant
argues that the court interpreter fees should be stricken. 
 
Plaintiff argues that the court
interpreter fees were recoverable, reasonable, and necessary. 
 
Defendants do not revisit the issue
in their Reply regarding Motion to Tax Costs. 
 
The Court allows costs for the use
of interpreters during depositions, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (a)(3)(B). Further, the Court allows the rest of the court
interpreter costs as being reasonable and necessary to the litigation. 
 
e.  
    The
Electronic Document Hosting Fees
 
Electronic documenting hosting fees
are allowed “if a court requires or orders a party to have documents hosted by
an electronic filing service provider. This paragraph shall become inoperative
on January 1, 2022.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, sub. (a)(15).)
 
Here, part of these costs could
have been incurred when the statute was operative, as this case began before
January 1, 2022. However, the Court did not order such fees, and the Court
declines to exercise its discretion to allow such fees. 
 
The Court strikes all of those
costs. 
 
f.   
    The
“Other” Fees
 
i.           
The
Accounting Referee
 
There is no subdivision of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5 that specifically considers “accounting
referees.”
 
        Pursuant to the
Parties’ Stipulation on a “special accounting referee,” the Court entered its
Order Appointing Special Accounting Referee on April 26, 2021. The relevant
provision of the Court’s Order is “[t]he Referee will be privately compensated
with Plaintiff bearing 100% of the cost, with such costs being taxable under
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1032 et seq.” (Stipulation and Order Appointing
Special Accounting Referee, p. 2:6–7.)
 
        The language of
the Order indicates (1) that Plaintiff is to cover the entire cost of the
special accounting referee and (2) that even if Plaintiff prevailed, that cost
would be taxable. 
 
        Thus, the Court
taxes all of the costs claimed regarding the special accounting referee. 
 
ii.         
Travel
Expenses
 
“The only travel expenses authorized
by section 1033.5 are those to attend depositions. (§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(3).) Routine expenses for local travel by attorneys or other firm employees are not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation. [A declaration must]
demonstrate how any of these charges were necessary to conduct the litigation,
as opposed to being merely convenient. The expenses should not have been
allowed.” (Ladas v. Cal. State Auto. Ass’n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
775–776, all statutory references are to Code of Civil Procedure.)
 
“The only meal expenses statutorily
allowable are those for jurors while they are kept together during trial and
deliberation. (§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(2).) While section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(3) allows the cost of taking and transcribing depositions and
‘travel expenses to attend depositions,’ it does not mention meals eaten while
attending local depositions. Nor can meal expenses be justified as ‘necessary
to the conduct of the litigation’ since attorneys have to eat, whether they are
conducting litigation or not. At best, these expenses are ‘merely convenient or
beneficial’ to preparation for litigation, the recovery of which is proscribed
under section 1033.5, subdivision (c). They should have been stricken.” (Ladas,
supra, at pp. 774–775, italics omitted, all statutory references
are to Code of Civil Procedure.)
 
        Although the
Court is willing to consider whether out-of-town travel should be recoverable
as a cost in this situation, Plaintiff’s Counsel has not provided any
documentation whatsoever to break down these costs. Without sufficient
documentation in the MC-010 or the Declaration of Gary K. Brucker, Jr. in
support of the Opposition to the Motion to Tax Costs, the Court is unable to
ascertain whether these costs are reasonable. 
 
The Court taxes all of the costs
claimed regarding travel expenses.
 
E.

Attorney Fees is GRANTED in part. 
 
        The Motion to
Tax Costs is GRANTED in part.
