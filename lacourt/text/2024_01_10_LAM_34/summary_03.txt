```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition to approve the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Carl Todd, Jr. (Transferor) to J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner). The court is concerned about whether the transfer is in the best interest of the payee, given that Transferor did not receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. The court is also concerned about the 13.10% discount rate used by Petitioner to determine the purchase price, and whether Petitioner would have increased the payout to Transferor if Transferor had been represented by counsel in the negotiations. The court would like to see a copy of the settlement agreement to ensure it does not violate Insurance Code section 10138, subdivision (a)(4). Before making a ruling, the court would like to hear more from Petitioner about how it determined the discount rate, what discount rate it (or its competitors) have used in similar cases, and whether it would negotiate further with Transferor to lower the discount rate and increase the amount paid to Transferor.
