TENTATIVE RULINGS
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Stearns Bank, National Association, filed a Complaint on 7/18/2023 against
Defendants California Surgical Multi-Specialty Group, Inc. and Gevorg Mutafyan.
The first cause of action for breach of written
agreement is alleged against Defendant California Surgical Multi-Specialty
Group, Inc.
The second cause of action for breach of personal
guaranty is alleged against Defendant Gevorg Mutafyan. 
The third cause of action for account stated is
alleged against both Defendants.
Plaintiff alleges that on or about July 25, 2018,
Defendant California Surgical Multi-Specialty Group, Inc. (California Surgical)
entered into a written agreement whereby Plaintiff agreed to lease equipment to
Defendant. (See Compl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff alleges that on or about April 28, 2020,
Defendant breached the terms of the agreement by failing to make the monthly
payment required thereunder. (See Compl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
Gevorg Mutafyan (Mutafyan) executed a personal guaranty of all the obligations
under the agreement in favor of Plaintiff. (See Compl. ¶ 14.)
PRELIMINARY
The
instant hearing involves four motions to compel further responses. 
As to all four motions, Movant is Defendant,
California Surgical Multi-Specialty Group Inc. (California Surgical or
Defendant or Movant).
Motion 1 ends in Res ID 8961.
Motion 1 moves for: “(1) an order compelling further
responses from Plaintiff, STEARNS BANK, National Association to Defendants' Form
Interrogatories, Set One to DefendanSet One, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300 and (2) an award of monetary sanctions[.]” (Def.
Mot. 1, p. 1.)
Motion 2 ends in Res ID 2153.
Motion 2 moves for: “(1) an order compelling further
responses from Plaintiff STEARNS BANK NATIONAL (“Stearns Bank”) to Defendants’
Request for Admissions, Set One, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.290 and (2) an award of monetary sanctions.” (Def. Mot. 2, p.1)
Motion 3 ends in Res ID 5152.
Motion 3 moves for: “(1) an order compelling further
responses from Plaintiff STEARNS BANK NATIONAL (“Stearns Bank”) to Defendants’
Special Interrogatories, Set One, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300 and (2) an award of monetary sanctions.” (Def. Mot. 3, p. 1.)
Motion 4 ends in Res ID 6136.
Motion 4 moves for: “(1) an order compelling further
responses from Plaintiff STEARNS BANK NATIONAL (“Stearns Bank”) to Defendants’
Request for Admissions, Set One, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310 and (2) an award of monetary sanctions.” (Def. Mot. 4, p. 1.)
[The Court notes that the relief requested in Motion 4
appears to be a typographical error. Although the relief requested pertains to
RFAs, Set One, the caption in Motion 4 refers to compelling further responses
to RFPs, Set One. This further appears to be confirmed by Defendant’s separate
statement in support of Motion 4. Therefore, the Court will proceed with Motion
4 under the assumption it pertains to Defendant compelling further responses to
RFPs, Set One. ]
[The Court also notes how the relief requested in the
first paragraph of all of Defendant’s motions referred to “Defendants’.” The
Court notes that it presumes the reference to multiple Defendants in the first
paragraph of each motion is a typographical error. The Court assumes this
because Movant is a singular Defendant – California Surgical – as noted in the
caption. Therefore, all of these rulings only pertain to one Defendant –
California Surgical. If Movant is under a different impression, Movant is
incorrect. Or to phrase it differently, if the other Defendant, Mutafyan, wants
to compel further responses to Mutafyan’s discovery, Mutafyan has to file his
own motions. Movant did not attach the instant discovery that was allegedly
propounded for each motion; therefore, the Court is not able to see if the discovery
was propounded as a single set for each motion by one defendant or multiple
defendants. Since the captions refer to just Defendant California Surgical,
this Court assumes that moving Defendant is only Defendant California
Surgical.]
Papers
For
all four motions, the moving papers included a motion, a separate statement,
and a Vernon Nelson Declaration.
In Opposition, Plaintiff submitted a combined, singular
Opposition for all four motions. [Plaintiff did not submit a Separate Statement
for any of its motions.]
In Reply, Defendant submitted a combined, singular
Reply and a combined, singular Reply declaration for all four motions.
PROCEDURAL
45-Day Requirement
“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days
of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response,
or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP §2030.300(c).)
All four motion have a 45-day requirement. (See CCP §
2030.300(c) for interrogatories, 2033.290(c) for RFAs, and 2031.310(c) for
RFPs.)
Here, the Court is unable to tell if Movant met the
45-day requirement for all motions. 
On the one hand, it appears as if Movant did not meet
the 45-day requirement because Movant states that Plaintiff provided responses
on February 23, 2024. Movant states that Plaintiff granted a 30-day extension
for Movant to file a motion to compel further responses.
Notice for these motions does not appear as if it was
given until, at the earliest, September 6, 2024. 
When notice was actual received for these motions is
disputed because Opposition says that it was not made aware of Defendant’s four
motions until October 14, 2024 at the Case Management Conference and that at
the CMC the Court ordered Defendant’s counsel to serve Plaintiff by email that
day.
In Reply, Defendant argues it did in fact properly
serve Plaintiff because it used the service address that Plaintiff’s counsel
lists on eCourt. 
Either way, the Court notes that even if it views the
September 6, 2024 date as the date of notice [the date earliest and most
favorable to Movant], the Court fails to see how these motions are timely when Defendant
conceded that Plaintiff provided a 30-day extension from when responses were
provided on February 23, 2024. Serving these motions on September 6, 2024 would
not be within 45 days of the responses provided on February 23, 2024, nor would
these motions be timely based on the 30-day extension from February 23, 2024.
On the other hand, the code section pertaining to the
45-day time frame refers to when “verified” responses were served. 
Here, Movant did not provide the actual initial
response production, nor did Plaintiff. Therefore, it is unclear if the initial
responses were verified. 
Since Plaintiff did not oppose these motions on
grounds of being untimely, the Court finds these motions timely.
Meet and Confer
“A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP §2030.300(b)(1).)
All four motions have a meet and confer requirement.
(See 2030.300(b)(1) for interrogatories, 2031.310(b)(2) for RFPs, and 2033.290(b)(1)
for RFAs.)
Here, the parties met and conferred. (See Nelson Decl.
¶ 4 and Oppo. p. 2-3..)
LEGAL
STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document,
electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
(1)   An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)   An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3)   An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.
(CCP § 2030.300(a).)
If a timely motion to compel has been filed,
the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully
to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following:
(1) An answer containing the
information sought to be discovered.
(2) An exercise of the party’s option
to produce writings.
(3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.
 
(CCP § 2030.210(a).)
LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  
 
“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)


LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – RFAs
CCP
§ 2033.290(a) provides that on receipt of a response to requests for
admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a
further response if that party deems that either or both of the following
apply:
 
(1)  
An answer to a particular request is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)  
An objection to a particular request
is without merit or too general.
 
(CCP
§ 2033.290(a).)
 
ANALYSIS
Overall, both moving and opposing
papers at many times are unhelpful to the Court.
 
For
example, Defendant’s Separate Statements for Motion 1 (FROGs) and Motion 2
(RFAs) don’t comply with CRC, Rule 3.1345(c)(5). “If the response to a
particular discovery request is dependent on the response given to another
discovery request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular
discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other
discovery request, the other request and the response to it must be set forth[.]”
(CRC, Rule 3.1345(c)(5).) 
 
As
to Plaintiff’s Opposition, it is largely nonresponsive to Defendant’s motions
and at many times misstates the law.
 
Plaintiff
misstates the law by arguing that Defendant failed to show good cause as to
compelling further responses for RFAs, SROGs, and FROGs. As seen above in the
three legal standards that this Court cited, RFPs would be the only motion that
Movant has to demonstrate good cause on. 
 
Further,
Plaintiff argues it provided supplemental responses, but Plaintiff is almost
never clear as to which motions and which specific numbers that Plaintiff
provided supplemental responses to.
 
Therefore,
this Court was left to search the discovery responses that Plaintiff provided
in Opposition to find out which responses Plaintiff provided further supplemental
responses to.
 
As
to Motion 1 (FROGs, Set One) it appears as if Defendant only moved to compel
further responses as to FROG 17.1, and it appears that Plaintiff provided a
supplemental response to FROG 17.1 on November 7, 2024. Therefore, as to
compelling further responses to FROG 17.1, Defendant’s Motion 1 is denied as
moot with respect to compelling a further responses in light of the supplemental
response. However, Motion 1 is not denied with respect to sanctions because
Plaintiff did not provide the supplemental response until November 7, 2024,
which was the date Plaintiff filed its Opposition.
 
As
to Motion 2, Defendant moved to compel further responses to RFAs 5, 6, and 10,
and it appears that Plaintiff provided amended/supplemental responses to these
RFAs on November 7, 2024. Therefore, as to compelling further responses to RFAs
5, 6, and 10, Defendant’s motion is denied as moot with respect to compelling a
further response in light of the amended/supplemental responses. However,
Motion 2 is not denied with respect to sanctions because Plaintiff did not
provide the amended/supplemental responses until November 7, 2024, which was
the date Plaintiff filed its Opposition. 
 
As
to Motion 3, according to Defendant’s Separate Statement, Defendant moved to
compel further responses to SROGs 1-9, 11-21, and 28. As to the SROGs at issue
in Defendant’s Separate Statement, Plaintiff provided supplemental responses to
SROGs 1-5, 7, 11-21, and 28. Therefore, as to Defendant’s Motion 3 to compel
further responses to SROGs 1-5, 7, 11-21, and 28, Defendant’s motion is denied
as moot with respect to compelling further responses in light of the
supplemental responses. However, Motion 3 is not denied as moot with respect to
sanctions because Plaintiff did not provide the supplemental responses until
November 7, 2024, which was the date Plaintiff filed its Opposition.
 
Further
as to Motion 3, Plaintiff did not provide supplemental responses to 6, 8, and
9. 
 
Not
only did Plaintiff not provide supplemental responses to SROGs 6, 8, and 9, but
Plaintiff’s Opposition did not address SROGs 6, 8, and 9. 
 
If
a timely motion to compel has been filed, the¿burden is on the responding
party¿to justify any objection or failure fully to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior
Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
 
“While
the party propounding interrogatories may have the burden of filing a motion to
compel if it finds the answers it receives unsatisfactory, the burden of
justifying any objection and failure to respond remains at all times with the
party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.)
 
Since
Plaintiff did not make any arguments to justify its objections to SROGs 6, 8,
and 9, Defendant’s Motion 3 to compel further responses to SROGs 6, 8, and 9 is
GRANTED.
 
As
to Motion 4, Defendant moved to compel further responses to RFPs 1-24, and it
appears that Plaintiff provided supplemental responses to these RFPs on
November 7, 2024. Therefore, as to compelling further responses to RFPs 1-24,
Defendant’s Motion 4 is denied as moot with respect to compelling a further
response in light of the supplemental responses. However, Motion 4 is not
denied with respect to sanctions because Plaintiff did not provide the
supplemental responses until November 7, 2024, which was the date Plaintiff
filed its Opposition. 
 
Supplemental
Responses
To the extent that Plaintiff’s
Opposition and Defendant’s Reply argue about whether or not the supplemental
responses were code-compliant, the Court notes that those issues are not before
this Court. The Court is not going to examine supplemental responses that were
provided after the filing of this motion that were not put in issue with the
moving papers.
 
Further,
the Reply seems to argue that these motions would serve no purpose if this
Court doesn’t examine the supplemental responses because Plaintiff could just
keep serving supplemental responses. 
 
The
Court does not find the Reply’s argument availing because the Court can rule
that the motions are not moot as to sanctions, and sanctions can be imposed
even though Plaintiff provided supplemental responses. 
 
The
Reply also seems to argue that the Court should continue these hearings so
Defendant can review the supplemental responses and file a supplemental brief. 
 
The
Court does not find this argument availing because then the issue would arise
as to whether Plaintiff can respond to Defendant’s supplemental brief.
Plaintiff may argue that the supplemental brief is technically the moving
papers, and that Plaintiff is entitled to an opposition to the supplemental
brief. Further, Defendant could potentially argue that the supplemental brief
is technically the new moving papers, and Defendant is thus also entitled to a new
Reply.
 
The
Court will not go down this rabbit hole, and it prefers clarity as to precisely
which discovery is at issue before the Court. If Defendant has an issue with
the supplemental responses, Defendant can follow the applicable code sections to
compel further responses to the supplemental responses. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING ALL FOUR MOTIONS
Defendant’s Motion 1 is denied as
moot with respect to compelling further responses due to Plaintiff’s supplemental
response; however, since the supplemental response was not provided until Plaintiff
provided its Opposition, Motion 1 is not moot with respect to sanctions.
 
Defendant’s
Motion 2 is denied as moot with respect to compelling further responses due to
Plaintiff’s supplemental responses; however, since the supplemental responses were
not provided until Plaintiff provided its Opposition, Motion 2 is not moot with
respect to sanctions.
 
As
to Motion 3, according to Defendant’s Separate Statement, Defendant moved to
compel further responses to SROGs 1-9, 11-21, and 28. As to the SROGs at issue
in Defendant’s Separate Statement, Plaintiff provided supplemental responses to
SROGs 1-5, 7, 11-21, and 28. Therefore, as to Defendant’s Motion 3 to compel
further responses to SROGs 1-5, 7, 11-21, and 28, Defendant’s motion is denied
as moot with respect to compelling further responses in light of the
supplemental responses. However, Motion 3 is not denied as moot with respect to
sanctions because Plaintiff did not provide the supplemental responses until
November 7, 2024, which was the date Plaintiff filed its Opposition.
 
Further,
as to Motion 3, Plaintiff did not provide supplemental responses to 6, 8, and
9. 
 
Not
only did Plaintiff not provide supplemental responses to SROGs 6, 8, and 9, but
Plaintiff’s Opposition did not address SROGs 6, 8, and 9. 
 
If
a timely motion to compel has been filed, the¿burden is on the responding
party¿to justify any objection or failure fully to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior
Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
 
“While
the party propounding interrogatories may have the burden of filing a motion to
compel if it finds the answers it receives unsatisfactory, the burden of
justifying any objection and failure to respond remains at all times with the
party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.)
 
Since
Plaintiff did not make any arguments to justify its objections to SROGs 6, 8,
and 9, Defendant’s Motion 3 to compel further responses to SROGs 6, 8, and 9 is
GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s
Motion 4 is denied as moot with respect to compelling further responses due to
Plaintiff’s supplemental responses; however, since the supplemental responses
were not provided until Plaintiff provided its Opposition, Motion 4 is not moot
with respect to sanctions.
 
TENTATIVE RULING SANCTIONS ALL FOUR MOTIONS
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2030.300(d).)
 
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2031.310(h).)
 
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2033.290(d).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
As
to Motion 1, Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $2,100.00. Defendant’s
counsel (Vernon Nelson) alleges he incurred $2,100.00 based on spending 4.2
hours on the motion at an hourly rate of $500/hour. (See Nelson Decl. ¶6, Mot.
1.)
 
As
to Motion 2, Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $1,800.00. Vernon
alleges he incurred $1,800.00 based on spending 3.6 hours on the motion at an
hourly rate of $500/hour. (See Nelson Decl. ¶ 6, Mot. 2.)
 
As
to Motion 3, Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $2,400.00. Vernon alleges
he incurred $2,400.00 based on spending 4.8 hours on the motion at an hourly
rate of $500/hour. (See Nelson Decl. ¶ 6, Mot. 3.)
 
As
to Motion 4, Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $3,200.00. Vernon alleges
he incurred $3,200.00 based on spending 6.4 hours on the motion at an hourly
rate of $500/hour. (See Nelson Decl. ¶ 6, Mot. 4.)
 
The
Court will hear argument as to sanctions. 
 
Generally
speaking, the Court tentatively plans to grant sanctions in favor of Defendant
because Plaintiff’s argument that it acted with substantial justification does
not appear to be convincing. 
 
Plaintiff
concedes that the parties met and conferred several times, and Plaintiff
argues, “Unfortunately, Defendants’ counsel was not willing to change its
stance on any of the discovery issues they raised.” (Oppo. p. 7.)
 
Plaintiff
attempting to place the blame on Defendant by stating that Defendant wouldn’t
change its stance isn’t convincing because Plaintiff then goes on to admit that
after the October 14, 2024 Case Management Conference, the parties engaged in a
meet and confer, and Plaintiff agreed to provide supplemental responses to most
of the discovery requests.
 
Further,
the Court notes that Plaintiff didn’t provide supplemental responses until Plaintiff
filed its Opposition on November 7, 2024.
