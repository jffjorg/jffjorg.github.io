And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration filed by Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (JLRNA). The motion seeks to compel arbitration between all parties and request an order that all claims against JLRNA be arbitrated, stay the entire action until the hearing on this motion, and stay the entire action pending completion of arbitration.

The Judge has denied the motion, finding that JLRNA did not meet its burden in establishing a binding agreement to arbitrate between the parties. Specifically, the Judge found that JLRNA's arbitration provision did not contain signatures from either JLRNA or the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff did not assent to the terms of the arbitration agreement.

The Judge also noted that JLRNA's argument that the Plaintiff must have assented to the arbitration agreement because the vehicle contained an Owner's Handbook with the arbitration provision was unavailing. The Judge further found that JLRNA's argument that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied was also unavailing, as the Plaintiff's Complaint did not allege that the express warranties were in the Owner's Handbook, and the Passport to Service in the Owner's Handbook did not provide express warranties.
