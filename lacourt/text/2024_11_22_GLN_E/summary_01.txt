Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a result of a hearing on four motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The motions were filed by Defendant California Surgical Multi-Specialty Group, Inc. against Plaintiff Stearns Bank, National Association. The judge finds that the motions are generally moot due to the provision of supplemental responses by Plaintiff, but notes that Plaintiff's responses were not timely and did not fully address the discovery requests. The judge grants sanctions in favor of Defendant in the amount of $2,100.00 for Motion 1, $1,800.00 for Motion 2, $2,400.00 for Motion 3, and $3,200.00 for Motion 4. The judge will hear argument on the sanctions and may impose additional sanctions.
