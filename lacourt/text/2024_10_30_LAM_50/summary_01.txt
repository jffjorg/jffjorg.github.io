And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. Despite numerous visits to the dealer, the problem was not resolved until the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. The judge states that she does not believe this experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party, but if a party believes otherwise, they may file a verified statement of disqualification by January 2, 2025. The judge also orders the plaintiff to give notice of this disclosure to any new parties added to the case and to file proof of service with the court. The Case Management Conference is continued to January 8, 2025, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement of disqualification.
