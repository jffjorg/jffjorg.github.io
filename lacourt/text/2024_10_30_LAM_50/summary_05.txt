And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss filed by the Defendant. The Judge notes that the Defendant's memorandum of points and authorities exceeds the applicable page limit, and therefore disregards the sixth page of the document. The Judge also notes that Exhibit 1 to the Defendant's request for judicial notice shows a Complaint captioned Stefan Richter v. Deluxe Media Inc., et al., which is different from the Complaint captioned Deluxe Media Inc. in the instant action. The Judge further notes that the Defendant's PAGA claim is derivative of underlying Labor Code violations and does not raise any new issues of law or fact.

The Judge also references the case of Shaw v. Superior Court, which held that the trial court did not err in applying the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction to a dispute involving a PAGA action. The Judge finds that the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction applies to this dispute, and therefore need not and does not address the Defendant's remaining alternative arguments in the motion.
