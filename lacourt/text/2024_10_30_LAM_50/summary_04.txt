And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant's motion to stay the PAGA action pending resolution of a related class action. The Judge found that the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction applies, as the two actions allege similar Labor Code violations and a stay is necessary to avoid inconsistent rulings and prevent vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits. The Judge granted the motion to stay the PAGA action pending resolution of the related class action.
