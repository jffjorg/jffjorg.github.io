  Case Number:  23PSCV01036    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendant: ‘Matias’ Clinical Laboratory, Inc., a California Corporation, dba Health Care Providers Laboratory TENTATIVE RULING             Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff can submit a supplemental declaration and a new proposed Judgment with the correct calculations prior to the October 4, 2024 hearing date.           BACKGROUND                       This is a breach of contract case. On April 10, 2023, plaintiff McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant ‘Matias’ Clinical Laboratory, Inc., a California Corporation, dba Health Care Providers Laboratory (Defendant) and Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and common counts. On March 11, 2024, default was entered against Defendant on Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions. On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package.       LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $149,125.65, including $117,117.27 in damages, $25,862.04 in interest, $5,612.34 in attorney fees, and $534.00 in costs. The Court finds a few issues with the default judgment package. First, the declaration regarding the missing original copies of the loan agreement required under Rule 3.1806 of the California Rules of Court is from Plaintiff’s counsel, who does not set forth any basis for having personal knowledge regarding the original written agreement. (Hettena Decl. re: Copies of Documents in Lieu of Originals, ¶ 5; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subds. (a)(2), (a)(8); Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (d); Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288 [declarations submitted in support of default judgment found to be “useless as evidence” where they were unintelligible and lacked foundation].) Second, Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation is incorrect. Plaintiff calculated 806 days from August 12, 2022, but the correct number of days is 731, i.e. August 12, 2022 to August 12, 2024. (See Hettena Decl. re: Account for Entry of Default Judgment and Brief Summary of Case Pursuant to CRC 3.1800, ¶ 8.) The correct amount of prejudgment interest would be $23,457.79, i.e., 731 days x $32.09 (10% of $117,117.27, divided by 365). Third, Plaintiff’s attorney fees calculation is also incorrect. The correct amount under Local Rule 3.214 would be $3,061.17, i.e., $2,890.00 plus $171.17 (1% of $17,117.27). (Local Rule 3.214; see Hettena Decl. re: Account for Entry of Default Judgment and Brief Summary of Case Pursuant to CRC 3.1800, ¶ 9.) CONCLUSION                       Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff can submit a supplemental declaration and a new proposed Judgment with the correct calculations prior to the October 4, 2024 hearing date.
