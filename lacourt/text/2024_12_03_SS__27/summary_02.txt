And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the City's motion for summary judgment. The City's role in the Centurylink project was limited to issuing a permit and inspecting the site to ensure compliance with plans and specifications. The City did not create the open trench and did not have control over the site. The plaintiff tripped and fell into the trench and seeks damages for injuries. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact regarding the City's control over the site and its responsibility for securing the trench. The Unruh Civil Rights Act does not apply to public entities, and therefore, the plaintiff's claim under this act is also dismissed.
