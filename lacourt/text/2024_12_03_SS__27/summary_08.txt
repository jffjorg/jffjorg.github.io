English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants. The motion is granted as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) cause of action and prayer for punitive damages. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint do not establish that the defendants' conduct was directed at the plaintiff, and therefore, do not meet the pleading standards for an IIED claim. The court also finds that the allegations do not meet the heightened pleading standard for punitive damages, as they rely on conclusory statements rather than specific facts demonstrating oppression, fraud, or malice. However, the court grants leave to amend for punitive damages, as there is a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can cure the deficiencies in their pleading.
