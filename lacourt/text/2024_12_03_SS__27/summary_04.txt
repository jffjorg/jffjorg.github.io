And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied, without prejudice, the motion for substitution filed by Jasmine Brown, the decedent's surviving daughter and successor in interest. The motion was filed to continue the pending action alleging negligence against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority et al. after the death of the decedent, Andrea McClelland. The court found that the requirements for substitution had not been met because the decedent's successor in interest failed to file a declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 377.32. Specifically, the declaration did not include the required statements, including a statement that no proceeding is pending in California for administration of the decedent's estate and a copy of the final order showing the distribution of the decedent's cause of action to the successor in interest. The court advised that the parties should submit to the tentative ruling via email or appear at the hearing to argue, and that failure to do so may result in the court taking the motion off calendar or adopting the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
