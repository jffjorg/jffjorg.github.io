And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion by the Plaintiff, Dorothy Cottrell, to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was dismissed on July 15, 2024, after the Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the final status conference on July 11, 2024. The Plaintiff's counsel, Farsheed Shomloo, claims that he was dealing with personal health issues at the time, including a stroke suffered by his colleague, Paul Kingston, and his own diagnosis with lymphoma. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has met the requirements for mandatory relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The Judge has determined that the Plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at the final status conference and trial was due to a combination of surprise and neglect, and that the dismissal of the case falls within the narrow exception carved out for mandatory relief.
