MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT¿AND SUMMARY ADJUDICATION 
Hearing Date: 12/3/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV33481 RICKI WILLIAMS
vs CITY OF INGLEWOOD
Moving Party: Defendant City of Inglewood 
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: GRANTED 
 
Background
Plaintiff Ricki
Michaele Williams alleges that she is visually- impaired and on September 16,
2020, she tripped and fell into a "ditch (open trench)" located “at
or near” the intersection of S. Osage Avenue and E. Nutwood Street in the City
of Inglewood, California (“Subject Location”), resulting in injuries. 
Plaintiff asserts two
causes of action against the City of Inglewood: (1) dangerous condition of
public property and (2) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.
Legal Standard 
 
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”¿(Hinesley v.
Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) 
 
“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to
make a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.”¿(Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)¿A defendant moving
for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of
showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or
more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿If the moving party
fails to carry its burden, the inquiry is over, and the motion must be denied.
(See Id.; see also Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 454, 468.)¿Even if the moving
party does carry its burden, the non-moving party will still defeat the motion
by presenting evidence of a triable issue of material fact. (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849-50.) 
 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of action cannot
be established, a defendant must show not only “that the plaintiff does not
possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain needed evidence.”¿(Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿It is insufficient
for the defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.¿(Gaggero v. Yura
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)¿The defendant “must
also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support
his or her claim.”¿(Ibid.)¿The supporting
evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿(Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at p. 855.) 
 
“Once the defendant … has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,
but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”¿(Ibid.)¿“If the plaintiff
cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.”¿(Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
The court must “liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party,” including “all
inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.”¿(Yanowitz v.
L’Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037; Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 844-45.) “On a summary judgment motion, the court must
therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder
could reasonably draw from the evidence.¿While viewing the evidence
in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function is to
identify issues rather than to determine issues.¿[Citation.]¿Only when the
inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.¿ If the evidence is
in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.”¿(Binder v. Aetna
Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)¿Further, “the trial
court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine
whose version is more likely true.¿[Citation.]¿Nor may the trial
court grant summary judgment based on the court’s evaluation of credibility.
[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 840; see also Weiss v. People ex rel.
Department of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding
motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence
but must instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and
draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
Undisputed Facts
        The parties do not dispute that the open ditch in question
was not created by the City of Inglewood (“City”) but was instead part of a
project conducted by Centurylink/Level 3 Communications (“Centurylink”) for the
placement of fiber optic conduit within streets throughout the City of
Inglewood. The City’s role regarding the project was limited to issuing a
permit and fulfilling certain inspection obligations. Spefically:
        In February 2020, Centurylink obtained a permit from the City
for the placement of fiber optic conduit within streets throughout Inglewood
(the “Centurylink Project”), including the portion of E. Nutwood Street at the
“Subject Location.” (UMF 5.) Centurylink and its contractors were required to
comply with the permit and its corresponding requirements. (UMF 5.)
        The Centurylink Project was a private project, not a City
project. No contractor involved in the project was hired by the City, and no
work was performed by or on behalf of the City. (UMF 6.) Consequently, no
employee of the City’s Public Works Department participated in any work on the
Centurylink Project at the Subject Location. (UMF 7).
        The City did not design, plan, build, construct, or maintain
any trench or ditch at the Subject Location. These responsibilities, including
securing the trench and ensuring public safety, were entirely undertaken by
Centurylink and its contractors under the permit requirements. (UMF 8, 10.)
None of the materials used at the construction site were purchased or owned by
the City. (UMF 9.)
Initial Burden
The key issue here is
the extent of the City’s control over the Centurylink Project and whether such
control could impose liability for Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. The City
presented evidence demonstrating that its responsibilities were limited to
issuing the permit and monitoring the progression of the work through a City
Inspector to confirm compliance with the plans and specifications submitted by
Centurylink. (Decl. Fernandez, ¶ 6.)
The City presented
evidence that its inspection duties did not extend to ensuring the safety of
the premises, including securing the trench where Plaintiff allegedly fell,
during the construction phase. Under the permit terms, ensuring site safety was
the sole responsibility of Centurylink and its contractors. (Id. ¶ 5.) The
City has provided evidence that its limited role, confined to permit issuance
and technical compliance review, does not meet the threshold of control
necessary to establish liability.
In light of this
evidence, the City has met its initial burden to demonstrate that it did not
exercise control over the trenches that caused the accident or other aspects of
the construction site that could have prevented the incident. Therefore, the
burden shifts to Plaintiff to establish a triable issue of fact regarding the
City’s alleged control and resulting liability.
Triable Issue of Fact
Plaintiff argues that
"[w]hile Fernandez does state in paragraph 5 that the requirements are
typically the responsibility of the permittee, he does not exclude the
City." However, Plaintiff fails to address paragraph 6 of Fernandez's
declaration, where he explicitly states: "The City did not design, plan,
build, construct, or maintain any trench or ditch located at the Subject
Location—all of the above were the responsibility of Centurylink and its
contractors pursuant to the permit and permit requirements."
Fernandez further
clarifies that the City’s limited role regarding the project was to issue the
permit and monitor the progression of the work through a City Inspector to
ensure compliance with the plans and specifications submitted by Centurylink. Fernandez’s
declaration when read as a whole shows that securing the trench and ensuring
site safety were exclusively Centurylink's obligations, not the City’s.
To raise a triable
issue of fact, Plaintiff cites to her Disputed Material Facts, Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 27,
which collectively assert that "[t]he City still maintained control of the
project by having City Inspectors at the scene on the day of the Subject
Incident."
Plaintiff also points
to Exhibit 5 from her deposition, which is a photograph allegedly demonstrating
the presence of an open trench without warning signs and scattered plates
creating a hazardous condition, known to the City Inspector at approximately
11:47 a.m. on the day of the incident. (See Plaintiff Deposition,
99:2–15; 106:5–25; 107:11–16.[1])
Plaintiff also relies on the declaration of Expert Gary Gsell, who opines that
the City failed in its obligations regarding the project. (See Gsell
Declaration, ¶¶ 4–17.)
However, these
arguments primarily hinge on the City Inspector's presence and awareness of the
conditions at the site, which do not, on their own, establish that the City
exercised control over site safety or assumed responsibilities beyond those
outlined in the permit. The evidence must show more than the City Inspector’s
knowledge; the evidence must demonstrate the City’s active involvement or
control over the specific safety measures that Plaintiff claims were lacking,
specifically with regard to the trench. 
Plaintiff provided no such evidence.
For instance, Exhibit 5
shows an open trench; however, as declared by Fernandez, the City’s obligation
to inspect is limited to determining whether the work complied with the
specifications submitted by Centurylink. The fact that the City Inspector was arguably
present at the time of the incident (the Reply appears to indicate that is not
accurate) and took photographs does not establish that he was there to inspect
whether the site was secured. Plaintiff has not provided any evidence to
suggest that the purpose of the inspection deviated from what was outlined by
Fernandez’s declaration.
Plaintiff references
numerous photographs showing the open trench, but these images pertain to
whether the premises were secured—a responsibility that, under the permit,
belonged exclusively to Centurylink and its subcontractors. Plaintiff has not
presented any affirmative evidence, such as deposition testimony from the
City’s PMK, to contradict the City’s position or demonstrate that the City had
a duty to ensure the premises were secured.
The last piece of
evidence presented by Plaintiff is the declaration of her expert, Gary Gsell.  Gsell seeks to establish that the City
Inspector did not do his job in relation to safety of the site.  For the reasons discussed below, Gsell’s
effort falls short.
“‘[A] properly
qualified expert may offer an opinion relating to a subject that is beyond
common experience, if that expert’s opinion will assist the trier of
fact.’”  (Sanchez v. Kern Emergency Medical Transportation Corp.
(2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 146, 155 (quoting Bushling v. Fremont Medical Center
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 493, 510).)  “‘However, even when the witness
qualifies as an expert, he or she does not possess a carte blanche to express
any opinion within the area of expertise.  [Citation.]  For example,
an expert’s opinion based on assumptions of fact without evidentiary support
[citation], or on speculative or conjectural factors [citation], has no
evidentiary value [citation] and may be excluded from evidence.
[Citations.]  Similarly, when an expert’s opinion is purely conclusory
because unaccompanied by a reasoned explanation connecting the factual
predicates to the ultimate conclusion, that opinion has no evidentiary value
because an ‘expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons upon which it rests.’” 
(Id. (quoting Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health Systems, Inc.
(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1117).)  “‘An expert who gives only a
conclusory opinion does not assist the jury to determine what occurred,
but instead supplants the jury by declaring what occurred.’”  (Id.
(quoting Jennings, supra, 114 Cal.App.4th at 1117-18) (emphasis in
original).) 
While Gsell broadly
describes general practices for city inspectors, he fails to establish how
these general duties create a specific obligation for the City to inspect for
site safety or traffic control in this case. His assertion that “the Inspector
failed to do his job” is conclusory, unsupported by factual evidence, and
assumes a duty without citing any contractual, statutory, or regulatory
authority. Although he asserts that inspectors ensure compliance with building
codes and safety regulations, Gsell does not connect these general
responsibilities to any specific obligations of the City regarding safety or
traffic control compliance in this instance. Moreover, his declaration does not
address Fernandez’s statement that the City’s inspection role was limited to
ensuring compliance with plans and specifications. Gsell cites no statute, ordinance,
or legal authority imposing an obligation on the City to inspect for safety or
traffic control compliance under these circumstances. As such, Gsell’s opinion
is purely conclusory and unaccompanied by a reasoned explanation connecting the
factual predicates to the ultimate conclusion. Consequently, his opinion lacks
evidentiary value because, as stated in Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health
Systems, Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1117, an “expert opinion is
worth no more than the reasons upon which it rests.” 
Moreover, even if
Defendant’s obligations extended to inspecting the security of the site, case
law establishes that such limited involvement does not equate to control.
Both Defendant and
Plaintiff cite the same passage in Juchert v. California Water Service Co.
(1940) 16 Cal.2d 500, 514, where the California Supreme Court rejected the
argument that the state shared control over the defendant’s water pipes. The Supreme
Court concluded:
"There
is no showing that the state highway department ever exercised any control over
the pipe other than in a supervisory capacity during its installation. The mere
fact that permission would have to be requested from the highway department to
open the gravel strip in which the pipe was laid would not take the pipe from
defendant's exclusive control, especially where it was not shown that such
permission was more than a mere formality or would ever be denied." 
(Id. at 514.)
Plaintiff cites Juchert
to argue that the City "abrogated its responsibility" by not
preventing the hazard. This misinterprets Juchert, which held that
supervisory or administrative involvement, such as permitting or inspections,
does not establish control. Similarly, the City’s limited role in issuing
permits and monitoring compliance does not equate to active control over the
trenches or responsibility for their safety. Plaintiff’s argument conflates
oversight with control, which Juchert clearly rejected.
Plaintiff also fails to
address or distinguish Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation
Dist. v. Superior Court (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 424, 431, which held that
inspections alone are insufficient to establish control over property. In Alameda,
the court found that despite conducting inspections, the district did not
assume control over the culvert. Similarly, even if the factual record showed
that Defendant had a duty to inspect the premises for traffic control, case law
consistently establishes that such inspections do not amount to control for the
purposes of governmental liability. 
Because Plaintiff
failed to raise a triable issue related to  control, summary adjudication is granted as to
the first cause of action. 
Unruh Act
In Brennon B. v.
Superior Court (2022) 13 Cal.5th 662, 676 clarified the Unruh Act does not
apply to public entities by stating:
the Legislature is capable of bringing government
entities within the scope of specific legislation when it intends to do so, and
it has done so with other antidiscrimination legislation. (See, e.g., Wells,
supra, 39 Cal.4th at pp. 1190–1191 [discussing application of the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, § 12900 et seq.) to public
entities].) In the context of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, however, “the
statutory list of [covered entities] contains no words or phrases most commonly
used to signify public school districts, or, for that matter, any other public
entities or governmental agencies.” (Wells, at p. 1190.) The Act does not — as
does FEHA, for example — define the covered entities to include “the state or
any political or civil subdivision of the state, and cities.” (Gov. Code, §
12926, subd. (d).) As we have previously explained, “[t]he specific enumeration
of state and local governmental entities in one context [such as the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act], but not in the other [here, the Unruh Civil
Rights Act], weighs heavily against a conclusion” that the coverage provisions
should be understood as identical. (Wells, at p. 1190, 48 Cal.Rptr.3d 108, 141
P.3d 225.) That is especially true where, as here, the statutes’ coverage
provisions were drafted by the very same Legislature during the same
legislative session; the legislative history is, thus, strong evidence that the
Legislature crafted language for FEHA to explicitly cover governmental
entities, while simultaneously crafting language for the Unruh Civil Rights Act
that sets forth different coverage. This history shows that the Unruh Civil
Rights Act is focused on the actions of private actors. Its predecessor statute
was enacted in response to the curtailment of the federal government's ability
to legislate on the conduct of private entities, and we find nothing in the
legislative history of the Act to indicate that it drastically expanded
California's public accommodation law by imposing liability on public entities.
The
Supreme Court’s decision in Brennon B. makes clear that the Unruh Act
does not apply to public entities, such as the City. Accordingly, summary
adjudication is appropriate as to the second cause of action.
Therefore,
the City’s motion for summary judgment is granted.
