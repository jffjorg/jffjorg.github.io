Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

Judge Maurice A. Leiter issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Abnos Boghosian vs. Loretta Markarian and Alico Markarian, Case No. 23STCV09928. The case involves a jury trial where the jury awarded Plaintiff Boghosian $900,000 in damages. Defendants Markarian and Markarian move for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that the damages awarded are excessive and there is insufficient evidence to support the verdict.

The Court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply and found that the jury's damage award is excessive. The Court CONDITIONALLY GRANTS the motion for new trial unless Plaintiff consents within 30 days to a reduction of damages from $900,000.00 to $328,000.00.

The Court also DENIES the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, finding that there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict. The Court leaves in place the $25,000 award against Alico Markarian on the cause of action for isolation.

The parties are advised to submit on the tentative by emailing the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
