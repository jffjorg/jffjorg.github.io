And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by United Parcel Service (UPS) to compel arbitration in a dispute between Marvisi, who claims to have lost watches he intended to consign, and UPS. UPS argues that the arbitration clause in its contract with The RealReal, Inc. is enforceable against Marvisi because his claims are intertwined with the UPS/RealReal contract. The judge agrees, citing Rowe v. Exline, and finds that the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable against Marvisi. The judge also rejects Marvisi's argument that it would be unconscionable to compel arbitration, as he was unaware of the arbitration agreement and did not waive his right to litigate. The judge further concludes that the court lacks discretion to deny arbitration under California Code of Civil Procedure §1281.2(c) because the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies, and there is no third-party litigation exception allowing the court to deny arbitration to prevent inconsistent rulings of law or fact. Finally, the judge grants UPS's motion to compel arbitration and stays the claims against UPS.
