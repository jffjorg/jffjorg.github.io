And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the partition action brought by the plaintiff, Tamara Jeffries. The defendant, Jane Anne Jeffries Johnson, argues that the plaintiff's predecessor-in-interest waived the right to partition the property. However, the judge finds that the 1977 grant deed, which provided a 1/3 interest in the property to Johnson, Nordeck, and Robert Dan Jeffries, does not explicitly or implicitly waive the right to partition. The judge also notes that the language in the grant deed is ambiguous and requires extrinsic evidence to determine its meaning, which is not provided. Finally, the judge concludes that the motion is essentially a motion for summary judgment, which is not proper, and therefore denies the motion.
