And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court issued a tentative ruling in Case No. 21SMCV00040, Cono v. Premtaj, regarding the plaintiff's motions for an order appointing a referee, attorney fees, and service by publication. The court previously dismissed the case without prejudice on February 28, 2022, and the plaintiff appealed the dismissal, but the appeal was rejected. The court declared the plaintiff a vexatious litigant, and under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 391.7, the court enters a prefiling order requiring the plaintiff to secure counsel or obtain permission from the presiding judge before filing any new litigation. The court denied the plaintiff's motions and dismissed the case, and the plaintiff is not entitled to a new hearing regarding their vexatious status.
