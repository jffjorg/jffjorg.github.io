Cono v. Premtaj,
Case No. 21SMCV00040
Hearing Date November
30, 2023 
Plaintiff Leo Cono’s
Motions for Order Appointing Referee, Motion for Attorney’s Fees, and Motion
for Service by Publication 
 
Plaintiff Cono filed
motions for an order appointing a referee, for attorney fees and for service by
publication in this dismissed case. 
 
After a hearing on
February 28, 2022 this court dismissed the complaint for failure to serve. At
the hearing, Cono became belligerent and was escorted out of the courtroom by a
Sheriff’s Deputy. See 2/28/2022 minute order, pg. 1. Cono appealed the order
of dismissal on March 2, 2022, and on May 24, 2022 the Second District Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal. The Court’s dismissal order was based on its
conclusion that Cono, as a declared vexatious litigant, was required under Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. §391.7 to obtain leave of the administrative presiding
justice before appealing and failed to do so. See 5/24/2022 Dismissal
Order (filed with the Superior Court on Augst 1, 2022), pg. 1. 
 
On December 7,
2022 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal of this court’s January 26, 2022
order denying his motions for entry of default, for leave to intervene and to
continue trial. The dismissal was based on failure to comply with the §391.7
requirements for vexatious litigants. 
 
The court dismissed
this case without prejudice on February 28, 2022. Cono appealed the dismissal,
and his appeal was rejected. The case is no longer pending. Per the Court of
Appeal’s two dismissal orders, Cono is a declared vexatious litigant. Under
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §391.7, “the court may, on its own motion or the motion
of any party, enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from
filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propia persona without
first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of the court
where the litigation is proposed to be filed[.]” 
 
Once a plaintiff
is declared a vexatious litigant, the status follows the litigant to future
lawsuits for purposes of requiring prefiling orders. The litigant is not
entitled to a new hearing regarding their vexatious status. Bravo v. Ismaj (2002)
99 Cal.App.4th 211, 224. Additionally, a prefiling order may be issued in any
lawsuit that is “maintained or pending.” 
Prefiling orders are not restricted to newly filed claims. Forrest v.
Dep’t. of Corps. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 197.
 
Since Cono is a
declared vexatious litigant, the court enters a prefiling order under Cal. Code
of Civ. Proc. §391.7(a). No new hearing is required, per Bravo v. Ismaj.
Cono must secure counsel or obtain permission from the presiding judge before filing
any new litigation. The relief he seeks herein is not available, as the case
has been DISMISSED.
