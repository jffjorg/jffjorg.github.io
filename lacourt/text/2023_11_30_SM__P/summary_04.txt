And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant Kaiser's motion to compel further responses to Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents. The court finds that Davis's responses to Interrogatories nos. 6.4 and 6.5 were incomplete and requires Davis to supplement her responses by stating the cost of all treatment and medication identified. The court also finds that Davis's responses to Special Interrogatories were inadequate and requires Davis to respond without objection, providing a privilege log for documents alleged to be protected as attorney work product. Additionally, the court finds that Davis's responses to Request for Production of Documents were deficient and requires Davis to supplement her responses. The court grants Defendant Kaiser's motion to compel further responses and sanctions Davis's counsel for failing to act in good faith during discovery, ordering Davis to pay $2,250.00 in sanctions within 30 days.
