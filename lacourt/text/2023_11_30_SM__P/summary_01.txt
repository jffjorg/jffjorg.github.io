And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cohen et al. v. Kaplan et al., Case No. 20SMCV01214. The Kaplans, who are the defendants, have moved to enforce a settlement agreement that grants them an exclusive perpetual easement over disputed land in exchange for $60,000. The agreement requires the Cohens, who are the plaintiffs, to execute the easement, but they have refused to do so. The court has decided to enforce the settlement agreement under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §664.6 and has ordered the Cohens to sign the easement. If they fail to do so within ten days, the court will appoint an elisor to execute the documents. The Kaplans have also requested $9,630 in attorney's fees incurred enforcing the agreement, which the court has awarded in the amount of $4,500.
