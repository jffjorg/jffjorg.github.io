Cohen et al. v. Kaplan
et al., Case No. 20SMCV01214
Hearing Date
November 30, 2023 
Kaplan Defendants’
Motion to Enforce Settlement (Code of Civ. Proc. §664.6) UNOPPOSED
 
The neighbor
parties settled their dispute with the Cohens agreeing to grant the Kaplans an
exclusive perpetual easement over the disputed land in exchange for $60,000. The
Kaplans state the Cohens refuse to execute the easement and request an order
enforcing the settlement under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §664.6.
 
An elisor is a
person appointed by a court “to sign documents on behalf of a recalcitrant
party in order to effectuate its judgments or orders, where the party refuses
to execute such documents.” Rayan v. Dykeman (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1629,
1635, fn. 2. When a court enters judgment under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §664.6,
it has discretion to appoint an elisor to execute documents requiring party
signatures under the underlying settlement agreement. Blueberry Properties,
LLC v. Chow (2014) 230 Cl.App.4th 1017, 1021. 
 
The settlement
agreement states “[t]he Cohens will provide an exclusive perpetual easement to
the Kaplans for the real property commonly referred to as the landing . . . the
exclusive easement shall be in the form of Attachment B.” The agreement grants
continuing jurisdiction to enforce under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §664.6. Id.
¶22. Zuidema declaration, exhibit J, ¶3A. Mrs. Cohen “was refusing to sign the
easement despite requests...” Zuidema declaration ¶9. There is no opposition. 
 
At least one of
the Cohens refuses to sign. The court will issue a judgment to enforce the
settlement agreement under §664.6. The Cohens are ordered to sign the exclusive
easement (attachment B). If they fail to do so within ten days of entry of
judgment, the court will appoint an elisor under Blueberry Properties. 
 
The Kaplans
request $9,630 in attorney’s fees incurred enforcing the agreement. Fees are
recoverable, as the settlement states “the prevailing party in any enforcement
action shall be entitled to recover his/her/its reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs expended in enforcing this Agreement.” Exhibit J, ¶22. The Kaplans seek
15.4 hours at $450/hr., plus $2,700 in estimated fees responding to an
opposition. No reply is required, as there was no opposition. The court awards
10 hours at $450/hour, a total award of $4,500. Payable within 30 days. GRANTED.
