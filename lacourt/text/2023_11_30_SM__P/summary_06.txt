Significant Statements:
  - "The Association is the successor-in-interest to the MHA. The powers of the original architectural committee expired January 1, 1976. However, other portions remained in effect, including the preamble to the 1950 CC&Rs, which states 'the right of enforcement of said conditions and each of them vested in the Corporation and in the owner or owners of any one or more of said lots as above defined.'"
  - "The narrower language of the 1975 amendment – granting enforcement powers to 'the owner or owners of any one or more of said lots' – does not replace the broader enforcement language in the unexpired 1950 CC&Rs."
  - "The arbitration clause was not properly adopted via amendment to the CC&Rs, and the Committee lacked the authority to adopt it unilaterally. The arbitration clause is unenforceable, not because it was adopted after the Broumands bought their property, but because it was not properly adopted."
```

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Crestwood Hills Association v. Broumand et al. regarding the Association's motion to compel arbitration. The Association alleges that the Broumand defendants' construction violates architectural standards in the Crestwood Hills community. The Judge has concluded that the Association, as the successor-in-interest to the MHA, has power to enforce the CC&Rs and any valid rules issued by the architectural committee. However, the Judge has denied the Association's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration clause was not properly adopted via amendment to the CC&Rs, and the Committee lacked the authority to adopt it unilaterally. The Judge has ruled that the arbitration clause is unenforceable, not because it was adopted after the Broumands bought their property, but because it was not properly adopted.
