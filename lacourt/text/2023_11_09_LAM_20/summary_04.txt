And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the proposed PAGA settlement agreement reached between the plaintiff, Tashavea Walker, and the defendants. The settlement allocates a Gross Settlement Amount of $975,000.00, with 25% going to the plaintiff and 75% to the Labor Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) for enforcement of labor laws. The judge finds that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, considering factors such as the parties' arm's length bargaining, sufficient investigation and discovery, and the experience of counsel in similar litigation. The judge also notes that compromise is inherent and necessary in the settlement process. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for approval of the PAGA settlement.
