v. Hess
22STCV15516
Defendant City Year’s Motion for Summary Judgment
Tentative
Defendant
City Year, Inc.’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
Background
On May 10, 2022, Miguel Garcia
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Rebecca Rose Hess and Does 1 through 20
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on December 3, 2021 at the intersection of 40th Street
and South Central Avenue in Los Angeles. 
On August 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Rebecca Rose Hess, Richard Hess, and
Does 1 through 20 for the same causes of action.
On September 2, 2022, Rebecca Rose Hess and
Richard Hess filed an answer to Plaintiff’s FAC.
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff amended the FAC
to name City Year Los Angeles as Doe 1. 
On May 31, 2023, City Year, Inc.
(“Defendant”) filed an answer.
On December 5, 2023, Defendant filed a motion
for summary judgment. On July 31 and August 1, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition and supporting papers for the opposition. On August 7, 2024,
City filed its reply, along with objections to some of Plaintiff’s evidence.
Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Objections to Evidence
Defendant
asserts five objections to Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1, the transcript of the
deposition of Rebecca Hess. Evidence presented in support of, or in opposition
to, a motion for summary judgment must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536,
541-43.) The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,
except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
The Court has considered each of these five
objections. The objections are OVERRULED.
Discussion
This case arises out of a motor vehicle
accident on December 3, 2021, at the intersection of South Central Avenue and
40th Place in Los Angeles. (Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts
[“DSUMF”], No. 1.) Plaintiff alleges that Rebecca Hess (“Hess”) drove
negligently and causes the accident. (DSUMF, No. 2.) At the time of the
accident, Hess was employed as a program manager with Defendant. (DSUMF, No.
3.) 
The central issue in this summary judgment is
whether Defendant can be liable to Plaintiff for the alleged tort (negligence) of
Hess under a theory of respondeat superior. 
The law regarding respondeat superior
liability is well established in California. A “principal is responsible to
third persons for the negligence of his agent in the transaction of the
business of the agency, including wrongful acts committed by such agent in and
as part of the transaction of such business.” (Civ. Code, § 2338.) “[A]n
employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within
the scope of employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995)
12 Cal.4th 291, 296.) “The respondeat superior doctrine makes an employer
liable, irrespective of fault, for an employee’s tortious conduct in the scope
of employment.” (Diaz v. Carcamo (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1148, 1154.)
For
more than 50 years, courts in California have based respondeat superior
liability not on a theory of control by the employer but rather on the
allocation of risk: a business is responsible for the costs associated with the
business operations, including the tortious conduct of its employees that is
“typical or or broadly incidental to the enterprise [the employer] has
undertaken,” the “more or less inevitable toll of a lawful enterprise.”  (Hinman v. Westinghouse Elec. Co.
(1970) 2 Cal.3d 956, 960.) The “risks inherent in or created by the enterprise”
are properly born by the employer, particularly when the employee who committed
the tort “was on company time and was engaged in the very conduct contemplated
by the employer.” (Ibid.; see also, e.g., Carr v. Wm C. Crowell Co.
(1946) 28 Cal.2d 652, 655-656 [referring to the “risks of the enterprise”].) 
In
determining the scope of employment, the California Supreme Court has adopted
and repeatedly relied on a standard set forth by the Court of Appeal in Rodgers
v. Kemper Construction Co. (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 618-619: 
One
way to determine whether a risk is inherent in, or created by, an enterprise is
to ask whether the actual occurrence was a generally foreseeable consequence of
the activity. However, “foreseeability” in this context must be distinguished
from “foreseeability” as a test for negligence. 
In the latter sense, “foreseeable” means a level of probability which
would lead a prudent person to take effective precautions whereas
“foreseeability” as a test for respondeat superior merely means that in the
context of the particular enterprise an employee’s conduct is not so unusual or
startling that it would seem unfair to include the less resulting from it among
other costs of the employer’s business. … In other words, where the question is
one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be whether the risk was one that
may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise
undertaken by the employer.
(See,
e.g., Lisa M., supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 299 [quoting Rodgers]; Farmers
Ins. Group v. County of Santa Clara (1995) 11 Cal.4th 992, 1004 [same]; Mary
M. v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 209 [same]; see also CACI
No. 3720 (stating that conduct is within the scope of employment if it is
“reasonably related to the kinds of tasks that the [employee] was employed to
perform” or “reasonably foreseeable in light of the employer’s business or the
[employee’s] responsibilities.”) 
“To
hold an employer vicariously liable the employee must be engaged in the duties
which he was employed to perform or those acts which incidentally or indirectly
contribute to the employer’s service. Conversely, the employer is not liable
when the employee is pursuing his own ends.” (Tryer v. Ojai Valley School
(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1476, 1481 [citations and quotation marks omitted]; accord
Jeewarat v. Warner Brothers Entertainment (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 427, 435.)
Plaintiffs have the burden of proving that
“the employee’s tortious conduct was committed within the scope of employment.”
(Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 209; accord Ducey
v. Argo Sales Co. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 707, 721; Moreno v. Visser Ranch,
Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 568, 576.) “Ordinarily, the determination
whether an employee has acted within the scope of employment presents a
question of fact; it becomes a question of law, however, when the facts are
undisputed and no conflicting inferences are possible.”  Lisa M., supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 299;
accord Jeewarat, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 434.)
As a general rule, an employer is not liable under respondeat
superior for accidents or other torts committed by an employee while the employee
is commuting or otherwise traveling to or from the workplace. “Under the
so-called ‘going and coming rule,’ an employee is not regarded as acting within
the scope of his employment while going to or coming from his place of work.” (Ducey
v. Argo Sales Co. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 707, 722; accord Hinman v.
Westinghouse Elec. Co. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 956, 961; Moradi v. Marsh USA
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 886, 894; CACI No. 3725.
This rule “has particular application to
vehicle accidents of employees whose jobs do not embrace driving. Accordingly,
courts apply the rule when the employee performs the employment services at or
in a particular plant or upon particular premises.” (Tryer v. Ojai Valley
School (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1476, 1481 [citations omitted].)
There are exceptions, however, to the “going
and coming rule.” For example, under the required vehicle exception, an employer
may be liable under a theory of respondeat superior for torts committed during
an employee’s commute when “the
employer requires an employee to furnish a vehicle of transportation on the
job.” (Ducey, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 723; see also Jorge v. Culinary
Institute of America (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 382, 401; Halliburton Energy
Services, Inc. v. Department of Transp. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 87, 96; Tryer,
supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1481-1482; CACI No. 3725.)
Respondeat superior may also apply when the
employer “the employer derives some incidental benefit from the employee’s
trip.” (Anderson v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
254, 258; see also Hinman, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 962; Jorge, supra, 3
Cal.App.5th at p. 398; CACI No. 3725.) Or when the employee is “engaged in a
special errand for the employer” or when the “the employer compensates his
employee for travel time.” (Ducey, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 722.)
Here, the facts material to this motion are
undisputed. 
The accident at issue occurred at approximately
9:00 a.m. on December 3, 2021. (DSUMF, No. 1; Plaintiff’s Exhibit No. 1 [“Hess
Depo.”], at 10:24-11:2.) At the time of the accident, Hess was driving to work.
(DSUMF, No. 5; Hess Depo., at 37:3-5, 80:2-20.)
Defendant is Hess’s employer. Defendant is an
AmeriCorps affiliated organization that hires mostly young adults to provide mentoring
and tutoring services in under resourced schools. (Plaintiff’s Statement of
Additional Material Facts [“PSAMF”], No. 1; Hess Depo., at 14:8-15.) For the
2021-22 academic year, Defendant assigned Hess to work as a program manager at Nava
College Preparatory Academy on East 41st Street in Los Angeles. (DSUMF, No. 4.)
As program manager, Hess provided support and coaching to the other team
members assigned to the Nava school site. (PSAMF, No. 2.)
During the 2021-22 academic year, Hess worked
at the Nava school site four days per week. (Hess Depo., at 37:13-22, 38:17-39:3.)
There were some days that Hess worked out of Defendant’s headquarters on South
Olive Street in downtown Los Angeles, but, Hess testified, on a particular day she
would work out of either the Nava school site or the headquarters; she did not
recall every having to go from headquarters to the school, or from the school
to headquarters. (Id., at 81:12-82:14.)
Defendant does not reimburse Hess for gasoline,
mileage, vehicle lease payments. (DSUMF, Nos. 14-15; Hess Depo., at 21:15-22:1.)
No one else employed by Defendant has access to or uses Hess’s vehicle. (DSUMF,
No. 10; Hess Depo., at 35:7-18.) Hess does not use the vehicle to transport
co-workers or students. (DSUMF, No. 11; Hess Depo., at 35:16-22.)
Defendant did not require Hess to have a
vehicle for her work. (DSUMF, Nos. 7-9; Hess Depo., at 77:16-78:4.) At the Nava
school site, some of Defendant’s employees drove to work and some used public
transportation. (Id., at 89:14-92:4.)
At the time of the accident, Hess was not “executing
any job duties or responsibilities” for her employer. (DSUMF, No. 6; Hess
Depo., at 113:19-22.)
Subsequent to the accident, beginning in June
2022, Hess became associate director of individual giving on Defendant’s
development team. (Hess Depo., at 11:22-12:1, 18:2-11.) In that new position,
Hess sometimes works out of Defendant’s headquarters, sometimes works remotely,
and sometimes conducts visits at one of the 17 schools across Los Angeles in
which Defendant operates. (Hess Depo., at 13:15-14:7, 15:8-17:3.)
On these undisputed facts, Defendant has met
its initial burden of showing that one or more elements of the cause of action
against it “cannot be established.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Defendant has shown, on
this record, that there is no merit in any attempt to hold it liable under a
theory of respondeat superior, as Hess was commuting at the time of the accident,
and none of the exceptions to the coming and going rule applies: at the time of
the accident, Hess was not performing a special errand for Defendant, Defendant
was not paid for her commuting time, Defendant was not obtaining some
incidental benefit, and Defendant neither furnished the vehicle to Plaintiff
nor required Plaintiff to have a vehicle for work-related transportation. To
the contrary, Plaintiff was engaged in an ordinary commute. 
Once a
defendant has met its initial burden on a motion for summary judgment, the
burden then shifts to plaintiff to show that there is a “triable issue of one
or more material facts.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Plaintiff has
not done so. At most, Plaintiff cites evidence about Hess’s current work
assignment, and her potential need for transportation to fulfill her current
job responsibilities as an associate director of individual giving. But Hess
did not begin to work in that assignment until June 2022, approximately six
months after the accident. At the time of accident, in contrast, the record is
clear, and the facts are undisputed, that Hess did not need to have a vehicle
to perform her work for Defendant.
Accordingly, the summary judgment motion of
Defendant is granted.

judgment filed by Defendant City Year, Inc.
