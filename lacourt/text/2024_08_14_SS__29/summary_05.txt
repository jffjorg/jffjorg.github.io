And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing on the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint filed by Joel Maldonado Torres and Nicole Maldonado against Miriam Violeta Oden, Miriam Estrada Garcia, and Does 1-50. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice on January 29, 2024, after no one appeared at an Order to Show Cause regarding Dismissal. The Plaintiffs are seeking to set aside the dismissal, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which provides for discretionary and mandatory relief from dismissal.

The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' motion is timely, but that their counsel has attached the wrong declaration to the motion. The judge orders the counsel to file a corrected declaration in support of the requested relief at least five court days prior to the hearing. The hearing is continued for approximately 21 days, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice to any parties who have appeared.
