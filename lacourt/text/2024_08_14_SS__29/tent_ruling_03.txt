 Case Number:  21STCV03097    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  29 Pettaway v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
21STCV03097
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On January
26, 2021, Ida Marie Pettaway (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Los Angeles County Sheriff Department,
Christopher Hernandez, J Wilson, Oscar Veloz and Nicole Palomino for (1) motor
vehicle negligence, (2) general negligence, (3) intentional tort, and (4) Civil
Rights violation. 
 
On
August 12, 2021, and July 25, 2022, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,
County of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as Los Angeles County Sheriff
Department), Christopher Hernandez, Jaeton Wilson, and Oscar Veloz (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed answers to the complaint.
 
The parties have
signed a written agreement to settle the case (the “Settlement Agreement”).  (Agazaryan Decl., Exh. C.)  Plaintiff’s signature is dated October 11,
2023, and Defendants’ is dated December 11, 2023.  (Ibid). 

 
On December 4,
2023, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal; the dismissal was denied as there
are waived court fees that are outstanding and need to be paid.
 
On December 12,
2023, a notice of settlement was filed with the court.
 
On February 13,
2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal; the dismissal was again denied
for outstanding court fees.
 
On March 12,
2024, Defendants’ counsel and Plaintiff appeared in person in court for a
hearing on an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal. 
Defendants’ counsel represented that he had with him the settlement
check.  After hearing from both sides, the
Court ordered Defendants to deliver the check to Plaintiff in open court (which
Defendants did) and ordered Plaintiff to pay all waived fees by March 27, 2024
(which Plaintiff did). (Minute Orders dated March 12 and April 15, 2024.)  
 
Pursuant to
Paragraph 3.1 of the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff is required to dismiss
this action, with prejudice, once the settlement amount is paid.  On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a request
to dismiss this action, but the dismissal is without prejudice.  The Court entered the dismissal, without
prejudice, on May 13, 2024.  
 
On June 5, 2024,
Defendants Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,
County of Los Angeles, Oscar Veloz, Christpher Hernandez, and Jaeton Wilson
(collectively “Defendants”) filed this motion to enforce the settlement
agreement. Plaintiff filed an opposition on June 14, 2024. On June 26, 2024,
Defendants filed a reply. 
 
The hearing on this motion was initially scheduled for July
3 and was continued to August 14.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
Because of the summary nature of a proceeding to enforce a
settlement agreement under section 664.6, and because settlement of a lawsuit
implicates a substantial right of a litigant, strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is required.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985; Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
Before the Legislature amended the statute effective as of January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the litigants
themselves, not their attorneys.  (See Levy v. Superior Court
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  In any event, however, for a settlement
agreement to be enforceable under section 664.6, all “parties” (as that term is
defined in the statute) must sign, including the party seeking to enforce the
agreement and the party against whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.) 
If the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the
settlement cannot be enforced through the section 664.6 summary
proceeding.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a
QTIP, thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the
material terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355
[holding trial court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement
to repurchase house did not create a material term and was within court’s power
because the closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing
and a new closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both
parties].) 
Nonetheless, when the “parties
intend that an agreement be binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must
be prepared and executed does not alter the validity of the agreement.” (Blix St.
Records, Inc. v. Cassidy (2010)
191 CA4th 39, 48.)  
In ruling on a motion brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, the court acts as a trier of fact.  The court may consider any admissible
evidence, including documents, declarations, and oral testimony.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533; 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial [2024]), ¶¶ 12:977-12:978.6.)  
Discussion
Defendants file this motion to enforce the Settlement
Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement
requires that this action be dismissed with prejudice, but Plaintiff submitted
(and the Court entered) a dismissal without prejudice.
All of the requirements for enforcement of
the Settlement Agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 are
satisfied.  The parties signed a written
settlement agreement.  Defendants have
paid Plaintiff the settlement amount.  This
action should therefore be dismissed with prejudice.
In her opposition, Plaintiff states that
Defendants breached the Settlement Agreement by delaying the delivery of the
check.  But the Settlement Agreement does
not have a deadline for the payment of the settlement amount, and Plaintiff
does not explain why such a delay (which was related to the non-payment of court
fees) was unreasonable or inconsistent with the Settlement Agreement.  Notably, the first request for dismissal
submitted by Plaintiff on December 4, 2023 (which were not entered because of
the outstanding court fees) was for a dismissal with prejudice.
Additionally, Plaintiff states in general and
conclusory terms that she entered the settlement agreement based on “duress … fraud,
misrepresentation, and voidable circumstances caused by the defense.”  Plaintiff provides no other detail or
supporting evidence.  
On this record, Plaintiff has not shown
breach by Defendants; duress, fraud, or misrepresentation by Defendants; or any
other defense to contract enforcement. 
Accordingly, the motion is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to enforce
the Settlement Agreement. 
The Court ORDERS that this action is hereby
DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
