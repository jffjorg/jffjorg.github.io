And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of its complaint is granted. The plaintiff's complaint was dismissed without prejudice on December 4, 2023, after no one appeared at an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal. The plaintiff's counsel has stated that the dismissal occurred as a result of their mistake, as they failed to correctly calendar the December 4, 2023 OSC hearing. The judge finds that the plaintiff has established that the dismissal occurred as a result of counsel's mistake, and therefore grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge sets aside and vacates the dismissal entered on December 4, 2023, and sets an Order to Show Cause re Why This Case Should not be Dismissed for Failure to Obtain Entry of Default Judgment in approximately 60 days.
