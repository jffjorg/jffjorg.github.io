And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was signed by both parties, and the defendants have paid the settlement amount to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, however, did not pay the waived court fees and instead submitted a request for dismissal without prejudice. The judge finds that the settlement agreement requires the action to be dismissed with prejudice, and that all requirements for enforcement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 are satisfied. The plaintiff's claims of breach, duress, fraud, or misrepresentation by the defendants are not supported by evidence, and the motion is therefore granted. The court orders the action to be dismissed with prejudice.
