And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The defendants had moved to compel further responses to certain requests for production, including requests for written responses and the production of certain photographs. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses to these requests were not code compliant and therefore granted the motion to compel further responses as to those requests. The judge also ordered the plaintiff to serve a further verified, written, code compliant response to the defendants' requests for production within 15 days of notice. The motion was denied as to certain other requests for production that were not included in the defendants' separate statement, as required.
