And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has scheduled a hearing for August 14, 2024, to consider a motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Justin Farahi, to be relieved as counsel. The judge wants to hear from Counsel regarding service of the motion and notice of the continuance on the Plaintiff, as well as from the Plaintiff herself regarding whether she agrees or disagrees with the motion. The judge also wants to hear from Counsel, the Plaintiff, and the Defendants regarding the issue of prejudice and whether a further continuance of the trial should be ordered. The judge will consider the legal standard for granting or denying a motion to withdraw as counsel, which includes whether conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the representation. The judge will also consider the requirements for filing and serving the requisite forms. After hearing from the parties, the judge will determine whether to grant or deny the motion to be relieved as counsel.
