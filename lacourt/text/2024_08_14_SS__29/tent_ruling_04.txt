Tentative

Background
On May 10, 2021, Maurice Sr. Stewart and Stephanie Stewart
filed the complaint in this matter asserting one cause of action for negligence
against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Metro”) and
Does 1 through 20, arising out of a bus accident on May 1, 2020.  Plaintiffs allege that they were passengers
on a Metro bus and were injured when the driver of the bus stopped suddenly,
causing them to “slam[] their back and shoulders into the bus wall.”  (Complaint, ¶ 10.)
Metro filed an answer to the complaint on November 30, 2021.
On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff Maurice Sr. Stewart (“Plaintiff”)
served Metro with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production (Set One), and Requests for Admission
(Set One).  (Yadegari Decls., ¶ 2 &
Exhs. A.)  Metro provided responses on
May 14 and verifications on June 10.  (Id.,
¶ 3 & Exhs. B.)
Plaintiff filed four motions to compel further responses
on July 15, 2024.  Plaintiff also seeks
sanctions.  Metro filed its oppositions
on July 29.  No reply has been filed.
Plaintiff satisfied the requirements for an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC). 
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.  (2) A representation of inability to comply
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
“On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the
party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response
if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer
to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and
the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id., subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).) 
Discussion
Requests for Admission
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Requests for
Admission (Set One), Nos. 11-13, 16-17, and 19-24.
No. 11
Metro’s response is ambiguous. 
It states that it will not respond to the request, but it also appears
to admit the request.  As Metro’s
response is not “complete and straightforward,” as required, the motion to
compel a further response is granted. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subd. (a).)
Nos. 12-13, 16, 19-23
Metro’s objections are overruled.  The motion to compel further responses is
granted.
No. 17
Metro has provided a code compliant response.  The motion to compel a further response is
denied.
No. 24
Metro’s objections are sustained in part.  The phrase “or similar incidents” is vague
and ambiguous.  The Court strikes that
phrase from the request and grants the motion to compel a further response to
the request, as modified.
Form Interrogatories
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Nos. 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 15.1,
16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 16.8, 16.9, 17.1, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3,
20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11.
No. 12.1, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 16.7, 16.8, 
Metro has provided code compliant responses.  The motion to compel further responses is
denied.
Nos. 12.2, 12.3, 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4,
16.5, 16.6, 16.9, 17.1, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9,
20.10, 20.11
Metro’s objections are overruled. As to Metro’s assertions of
privilege, work product, confidentiality, and other protections from
disclosure, Metro has the burden of establishing the foundational facts for
each of these, and Metro has failed to do so. 
Metro’s responses do not fairly respond to the interrogatories, are not
complete and straightforward, and are not code compliant.  If Metro does not have sufficient knowledge
to respond to some or all of these interrogatories, Metro must still provide a
code compliant response under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210 and
2030.220.  The motion to compel further
responses is granted.
Special Interrogatories
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories
(Set One), Nos. 4, 7-18, and 20-25.
Nos. 4, 7, 9, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25
Metro’s objections are sustained in part.  These interrogatories are impermissibly
compound.  The Court strikes the portion
of each of these interrogatories that begins with the phrase “If so” and concludes
with the end of the interrogatory.  (As
to Interrogatory No. 25, the Court also strikes the phrase “or similar
incidents” as vague and ambiguous) The Court grants the motion to compel further
responses to these interrogatories, as modified.
No. 8
Metro’s objections are sustained in part.  This interrogatory is impermissibly
compound.  The Court strikes the phrase “and
who made this decision” and grants the motion to compel a further response to this
interrogatory, as modified.
Nos. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16
Metro’s objections are overruled. The motion to compel further
responses is granted.
Nos. 11, 21, 22
Metro’s objections are sustained in part.  These interrogatories are impermissibly
compound.  The Court strikes the second
sentence of each interrogatory (and as to Interrogatory No. 21, the Court also
strikes the phrase “or similar incidents” as vague and ambiguous) and grants the
motion to compel further responses to these interrogatories, as modified.
No. 14
Metro’s objections are sustained in part.  This interrogatory is impermissibly
compound.  The Court strikes the second and
third sentences and grants the motion to compel a further response to this
interrogatory, as modified.
The requests for sanctions are denied without prejudice.  The notice of motion and motion fails to give
Metro adequate notice of the request, as it states that sanctions are sought
against “Plaintiff” and “their counsel of record,” and Metro is the defendant
in this action.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiff’s motions
to compel.
The Court ORDERS Metro to serve verified, written, code
compliant responses, without objection, to Requests for Admission Nos. 11-13,
16, and 19-23, and to Requests for Admission No. 24 (as modified by this Order)

20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11 within 21 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Metro to serve verified, written, code
compliant responses, without objection, to Special Interrogatories Nos. 10, 12,
13, 15, and 16, and to Special Interrogatories Nos. 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18,

notice.
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
