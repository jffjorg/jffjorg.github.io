And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Martinez v. Winfield. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident in Los Angeles on January 16, 2021. The plaintiff, Uriel Calzada Martinez, and the defendant, Jerome Winfield, are engaged in a dispute over a deposition subpoena issued by the defendant to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) and a notice of deposition issued to Whates Law Firm.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena issued to WCAB, finding that fact discovery had closed on April 3, 2024, and issuing the subpoena months later was improper. The judge has also granted the motion to quash the subpoena presumably issued to Whates Law Firm, finding that no subpoena to the firm was served on the plaintiff.

Additionally, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendant's conduct was oppressive and awarding $961.65 in costs, including attorney fees. The judge has ordered the defendant's counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice.
