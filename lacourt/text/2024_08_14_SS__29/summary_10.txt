The Court has granted Linda McLean's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Rochelle Linnetz for contribution, indemnity, and declaratory relief. The cross-complaint arises out of the same set of facts as the original complaint filed by Calvin Haugen, the plaintiff. The Court finds that granting the motion is in the interests of justice and that Linnetz may file a motion or ex parte application to continue the trial if she needs additional time to conduct her investigation or discovery. The motion is granted, and McLean is allowed to file the cross-complaint within 7 days of the hearing.
