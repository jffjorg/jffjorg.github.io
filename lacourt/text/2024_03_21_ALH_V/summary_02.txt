And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Ryan Block, Esq. and Maxwell R. Meyering, Esq. on behalf of the defendants. The motion has not been opposed, and the court has ordered the counsels to submit an updated proposed order in compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subdivision (e). Despite this, as of March 18, 2024, the updated proposed order has not been submitted. Therefore, the court continues the motion to be relieved as counsel to March 25, 2024, allowing the counsels another opportunity to comply with the court's order.
