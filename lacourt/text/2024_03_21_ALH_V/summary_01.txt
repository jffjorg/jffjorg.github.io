Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentatively ruling denies Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from Defendant FCA US LLC. The court concludes that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate good cause for the discovery sought and that the information requested is not relevant to the case. The court also denies Plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The ruling notes that the Plaintiffs' complaint failed to identify the specific defect in their vehicle, and therefore, it is unclear whether the requested information would tend to show a widespread defect of the "type" Plaintiff allegedly experienced.
