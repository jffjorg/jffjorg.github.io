And here is a brief summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Karina Akhtar and Levine Management Group, Inc. against plaintiffs Blooming Life Hospice and Narine Rafikovna Shakhmuradyan. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the second amended complaint, which alleges six causes of action, including defamation, libel, and trade libel. The judge overrules the demurrer as to the third cause of action (intentional interference with prospective economic advantage) and sustains the demurrer as to the fifth and sixth causes of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress and trade libel) with leave to amend. The judge also grants the motion to strike the references to punitive damages and denies the motion to strike in all other respects. The plaintiffs are ordered to file an amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
