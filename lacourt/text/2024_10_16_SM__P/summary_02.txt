And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion of plaintiff's counsel, Gabor Szabo, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to the plaintiff's lack of cooperation. The judge notes that while the motion was not filed in compliance with the California Rules of Court, the motion is granted contingent upon counsel's filing of a proposed order. The trial is currently set for February 24, 2025, and the judge does not believe the plaintiff would be prejudiced by the granting of this motion.
