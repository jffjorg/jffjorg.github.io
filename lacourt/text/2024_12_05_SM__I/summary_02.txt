And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff was injured in an auto accident and sued the car's owner and unknown defendant (DOE) defendants. However, the plaintiff only named the owner and DOE defendants in the lawsuit, despite being aware of the driver's identity. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's use of the DOE procedure is improper, and that the statute of limitations has run. The court agrees with the defendant, finding that the plaintiff's claims are not credible and that the plaintiff had access to the driver's identity, but failed to name them in the lawsuit. The court grants the motion to quash the lawsuit, ruling that the plaintiff should have named the driver in the initial complaint.
