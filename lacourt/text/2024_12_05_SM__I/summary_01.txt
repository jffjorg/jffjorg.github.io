And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's request to continue the trial. The case has been pending for three years and has already been continued once due to the parties' failure to mediate and complete discovery. The defendant's new counsel claims they need more time to prepare, but the judge finds that the lack of diligence in preparing for trial is not a valid reason for a continuance. The judge notes that the parties have still not taken depositions and that the failure to complete mediation is a tactical choice made by the parties, not a valid reason for a continuance. The judge expects full compliance with the FSC order and warns that failure to comply may result in sanctions.
