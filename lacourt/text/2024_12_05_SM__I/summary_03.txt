And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Fialko's motion to quash service of process. Fialko had argued that he was not properly served with process in California and that the court lacked jurisdiction over him. The judge found that Fialko was indeed served with process, and that the court had personal jurisdiction over him based on his ties to California, including property ownership and business activities. The judge also found that California was a convenient forum for the litigation, and that Florida was a suitable alternative forum. The judge noted that the plaintiff, Priscilla Presley, had a strong interest in litigating in California, and that the court's jurisdiction was not at odds with the interests of justice. The judge also considered the private interests of the litigants and the public interest in retaining the action in California, and found that these factors also weighed in favor of denying the motion to quash.
