SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Marc Gedeon, A Professional Corporation, alleges

filed a complaint for 1. Breach of Written Contract 2. Fraud and Deceit 3.
Quantum Meruit, and 4. Common Counts. On August 6, 2020, the clerk entered
defaults against Orion West Group, LLC, Gladys Happer, and silicon Beach
Medical Center, Inc. On November 16, 2020, the court entered the parties’
stipulation to set aside the defaults. Defendants Gladys Anne Happer, an individual,
Playa Advance Urgent CarE, INC., a California Corporation, Playa Advance
Surgical Institute, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, Silicon Beach
Medical Center, INC., a Delaware Corporation, and Orion West Group LLC, a
Delaware Limited Liability Company, answered the complaint on December 3, 2020.
 
RULING: Denied/Off-Calendar.
Counsel for Defendants Gladys Anne Happer, an individual, Playa
Advance Urgent CarE, INC., a California Corporation, Playa Advance Surgical
Institute, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, Silicon Beach Medical
Center, INC., a Delaware Corporation, and Orion West Group LLC, a Delaware
Limited Liability Company moves to be relieved as counsel of record on grounds
“that Defendants have rendered it
unreasonably difficult for me to carry out my representation effectively.”
 
The motion,
declaration and order lack any proof of service on any party or the clients.
Service of all documents is mandatory. (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 3.1362, subd.
(d).) The court therefore denies the motion and takes the motion off-calendar.
 
Trial remains set
for July 29, 2024.
 
Counsel to give
notice.
