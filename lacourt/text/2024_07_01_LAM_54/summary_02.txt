And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to answer filed by the plaintiffs, Agustin Arias and Sandra Gomez, against the defendant, Estela Villasenor. The demurrer was based on the argument that the defendant's answer failed to state sufficient facts to support the affirmative defenses raised. The judge disagreed with this argument and found that the defendant's answer provided a clear list of affirmative defenses and alleged ultimate facts. As a result, the judge overruled the demurrer to answer. The hearing on July 1, 2024, is scheduled to take place in Department 54 of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles.
