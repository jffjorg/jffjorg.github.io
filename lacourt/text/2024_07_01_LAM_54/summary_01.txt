And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to continue the trial. The defendants, A&Y International Global Inc. and Adrian Nasimi, are seeking to delay the trial due to the recent open heart surgery of one of their team members, Fred Kim, which will render him unavailable for discovery for at least two months. They also intend to file a cross-complaint, which was only recently discovered after translating Korean-language documents provided in discovery. The court finds good cause to continue the trial, citing California Rule of Court 3.1332(c), which states that a continuance may be granted if a party is unable to obtain essential evidence despite diligent efforts. The court will set a new trial date at the hearing.
