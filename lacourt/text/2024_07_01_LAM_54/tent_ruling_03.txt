PLAINTIFFS TO
NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
CCP § 473(d) provides that “[t]he court may,
upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes
in its judgment or orders as entered.” “A court can always correct a clerical, as distinguished from a
judicial error which appears on the face of a decree by a nunc pro tunc
order.” (In re Eckstrom’s Estate (1960) 54 Cal.2d 540, 544.) “The
function of a nunc pro tunc order is merely to correct the record of the
judgment.” (Id. (internal quotations omitted).)
Plaintiffs move for an order amending the sister state judgment
entered in this case to include all seven Defendants against whom the Texas
judgment was entered. Plaintiffs assert that only one Defendant was listed on
the sister state judgment form due to mistake. The Court finds good cause to
amend the judgment.
Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED.
