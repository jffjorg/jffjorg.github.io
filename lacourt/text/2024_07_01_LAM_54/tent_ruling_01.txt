DEFENDANTS TO
NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
While trial continuances are generally
disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good
cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,
“[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and
“[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Defendants move to continue trial and
the related deadlines on the grounds that Defendant Fred Kim has recently had
open heart surgery and will be unavailable for discovery for at least two
months, Defendants intend to file a cross-complaint; Defendants assert the
facts giving rise to the cross-complaint were only recently discovered when
certain Korean-language documents provided in discovery were translated. 
 
The Court finds good cause to continue
trial. Plaintiff does not oppose this motion. Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.
The Court will set a new trial date at the hearing.
