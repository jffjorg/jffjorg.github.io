SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Brayn Steven Lopez’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2023 Audi A3 (the Vehicle) on 7/16/23.  Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.
(Defendant) warranted the Vehicle.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that the Vehicle was delivered to him with
defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to, engine and electrical
system defects.  Plaintiff contends that
he presented the Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair facility(ies) for
warranty repairs on multiple occasions. 
Plaintiff claims that none of the repairs performed by Defendant’s
authorized repair facility(ies) permanently repaired the defects.  
 
Plaintiff contends that the issuance of Technical Service
Bulletins (TSBs) evidences the fact that Defendant had knowledge of the defects
with the Vehicle.  Plaintiff contends
that Defendant has not adequately compensated him for the Vehicle which was
never fully repaired within a reasonable number of attempts.  
 
On 4/5/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2. 
The complaint also includes a cause of action for Negligent Repair
against Defendant Sherman Oaks-A, Inc. dba Audi Van Nuys.  On 5/9/24, Defendant answered the
complaint.  
 
On 5/10/24, Plaintiff served Defendant with Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, by electronic mail.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.3).  On 6/11/24, Defendant served responses to the
document requests by email which asserted objections.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.4).  Defendant failed to produce any documents at
that time.  Id.  6/18/24, Plaintiff’s counsel began meet and
confer efforts regarding what Plaintiff perceived to be deficiencies in the
responses.  (See Sogoyan Decl.,
Ex.5-7).  On 7/10/24, Plaintiffs’ counsel
sent the last meet and confer letter to which no response was received.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.8).   
 
On 7/30/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order striking Defendant’s   objections and compelling further responses
and production of responsive documents to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set 1, Nos. 1-31.  Defendant
has opposed the motion.  Plaintiff has not
filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action or to
the determination of any motion made in the action, if the matter itself is
admissible or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.  See CCP 2017.010.
 Doubts as to relevance are generally
resolved in favor of allowing discovery.  Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co.
(1982) 31 C3d 785, 790. 
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff adequately met and
conferred before filing the instant motion. 
(See Sogoyan Decl., Ex.5-8). 
Defendant fails to explain why it did not respond to Plaintiff’s 7/10/24
meet and confer letter and/or why it did not produce documents until 8/29/24
and 10/7/24 when Plaintiff had executed the protective order requested by
Defendant on 7/9/24, especially considering the time constraint for filing a
motion to compel further responses.  (See
Smith Decl. ¶¶5-6, 8-10, Ex.C-D; Opposition, p.2:19-27).; CCP 2031.310(c).
 
To prevail on a claim brought under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (the Act), a plaintiff has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, several elements, including nonconformity of a
vehicle that substantially impaired its use, value or safety; presentation of
the vehicle to the manufacturer or authorized representative for repair; and
failure to repair the defect after a reasonable number of attempts.  Ibrahim (1989) 214 CA3d 878, 886-887; Oregel
(2001) 90 CA4th 1094, 1101; Lundy (2001) 87 CA4th 472, 478.
 
Additionally, under the Act, a buyer may recover damages
and other relief when there has been a breach of the implied warranty of
merchantability if the vehicle was sold with a known defect.  Civil Code 1794(a); Mexia (2009) 174
CA4th 1297, 1304-1305.  Further, a buyer
may be entitled to a civil penalty upon a showing that the manufacturer
willfully failed to abide by any of its obligations under the Act.  Civil Code 1794(c).
 
The subject requests seek documents relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant under the Act including issues related to
Defendant’s good faith compliance with the Act. 
As such, Plaintiff has provided sufficient facts to establish the
requisite good cause for production of the subject documents.  See CCP 2031.310(b)(1).
 
Requests 1-14 seek documents relating to Plaintiff’s own
vehicle.  To prevail on a claim under the
Act, Plaintiff must prove a nonconformity with the Vehicle that substantially
impaired its use, value, or safety that Defendant and/or its authorized
representatives, failed to repair after a reasonable number of attempts.  (Sogoyan Decl. ¶23, Ex.8).  
 
The documents sought in Requests 15-29 relate to
Defendant’s written warranties and vehicle repurchase policies, procedures, and
practices.  (Sogoyan Decl. ¶24,
Ex.8).  Such documents, or lack thereof,
may provide information as to whether Defendant has a policy which violates the
Act.  See Oregel (2001) 90
CA4th 1094, 1104; Johnson (2005) 35 C4th 1191, 1200; Kwan (1994)
23 CA4th 174, 186.  
 
Requests 30 and 31 seek documents related to Defendant’s
knowledge of the same or similar defects in other vehicles of the same year,
make and model of the Vehicle.  Information
regarding vehicles other than Plaintiff’s vehicle is relevant to the subject
matter of this action as it could assist Plaintiff in proving Defendant’s
willful violation of the Act.  Documents
responsive to such requests may reasonably lead to the discovery of information
as to the nature and duration of the defects, Defendant’s knowledge of the
defects, and Defendant’s inability to repair the defects.  While cases relied on by Plaintiff (i.e., Donlen
(2013) 217 CA4th 138 and Doppes (2009) 174 CA4th 967) may not involve
the exact circumstance before this Court, they are sufficient to show that the
requested information could itself be admissible or lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence in this case.  Similarly,
evidence regarding Defendant’s practices in handling consumer complaints is
relevant to determining whether Defendant willfully violated the Act when it refused
to repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle.  Johnson,
supra at 1198-1199; Oregel, supra at 1094; Kwan, supra at
186.
 
Defendant’s objections lack merit and/or have not been
properly supported.  As set forth above,
the documents sought are relevant and/or could lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Therefore, the requests are not irrelevant or overbroad.  The requests are also not vague and/or
ambiguous.  Defendant has also failed to
establish that responding to any of the subject requests would be overly
burdensome or oppressive.  To the extent
that documents are being withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege
and/or work product doctrine, Defendant is required to
provide a privilege log.  See CCP 2031.240(c).  Defendant has failed to establish that the
documents sought contain confidential and/or propriety information and that
dissemination of the information would result in injury.  See Nativi (2014) 223 CA4th 261,
318.  To the extent that any of the
requests actually seek confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret
information, the Court finds that the protective order entered between the
parties should adequately protect Defendant’s interests.  (See Smith Decl. ¶¶6, 9-10)  
While Defendant may have produced documents in response
to certain of the requests at issue since the filing of this motion, Defendant
has not served further written responses. 
As such, it is not clear whether any documents are being withheld on the
bases of the unmeritorious objections included in the written responses.  Additionally, Defendant has admittedly failed
to produce documents in response to Requests 30 and 31.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Defendant is ordered to produce further written responses and to produce
documents in accordance therewith within the next 30 days. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel has failed to electronically bookmark
the exhibits attached to the declaration submitted in support of the motion as
required by CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel
for the parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future
may result in matters being continued so that papers can be resubmitted in
compliance with the rule, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
