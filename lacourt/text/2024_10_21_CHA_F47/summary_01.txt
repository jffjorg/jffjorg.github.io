Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion for confirmation of the sale of real property and has granted the motion. The property in question is a multi-family residence located at 17622-17624 Los 7 Alimos Street in the Granada Hills area of Los Angeles. The property was advertised for sale using commercially appropriate marketing methods, and multiple offers were received. Karamel, LLC had the highest bid of $1,500,000, and the Partition Referee accepted their offer subject to court confirmation.

The Court finds that the sale should be confirmed as it meets the requirements of CCP 873.720, including being the highest pending offer, being sold in "as is" condition, having a full contingency removal already in place, and being an arms-length transaction. The parties have not opposed the motion, and the Court does not find any basis to vacate the sale or direct that a new sale be made.

The Court will sign the proposed order confirming the sale and will lodge it with the motion.
