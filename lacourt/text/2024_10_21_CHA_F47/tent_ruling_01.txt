MOTION FOR
CONFIRMATION OF SALE OF REAL PROPERTY
 
Motion filed on 9/10/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Partition Referee Matthew L. Taylor
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Janet
Louise Wilkes, Trustee of The Janet Louise Wilkes Living Trust; Defendant Gary William
Wilkes and Proposed Buyer Karamel, LLC
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
confirming the sale of real property in this action for partition.
 
RULING: The motion is granted.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This is an action for partition of a multi-family
residence located at 17622-17624 Los 7 Alimos Street, Los Angeles (Granada
Hills area) 91344 (the Property).  The
Property is owned by Plaintiff Janet Louise Wilkes, Trustee of The Janet Louise
Wilkes Living Trust and Defendant Gary William Wilkes.
 
On 2/21/24, the Court entered an Interlocutory Judgment
for Partition by Sale of the Property  and on 3/25/24, the Court entered an order
appointing Matthew L. Taylor as partition Referee (the Referee) to sell the
Property (the Order).  The Referee hired experienced
real estate agents John Martindale (brokerage GS Strategies Inc.) and Margaret
Roy (brokerage Platinum Realty Services Inc.) to market and sell the Property.  
 
The Property was advertised for sale using commercially
appropriate marketing methods via industry-standard methods, such as listing in
the residential Multiple Listing Service (the MLS), and inclusion on internet
websites such as Zillow.com and Redfin.com. 
The Referee also followed the public notice and posting requirements of CCP
873.640.  After receiving multiple  offers,  Proposed Buyer Karamel LLC (Karamel) had the highest
bid of $ 1,500,000.  The  Referee accepted Karamel’s offer subject to
court confirmation.  (See Taylor
Decl., Ex.1).   
 
The Referee now moves, pursuant to CCP 873.720, for an order
confirming the sale of the Property because: (1) it is the highest pending
offer; (2) the Property is being sold in “as is” condition; (3) the offer is
made with a full contingency removal already in place and (4) it is an
arms-length transaction pursuant to CCP 873.690.  After having been served with the motion and
notice of the hearing date, Plaintiff, Defendant and the Proposed Buyer have
not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
To the extent applicable, the instant motion/report of
the referee includes the information required by CCP 873.710(b): (1) a
description of the property sold to each purchaser; (2) the name of the
purchaser; (3) the sale price; (4) the terms and conditions of the sale and the
security, if any, taken; (5) any amounts payable to lienholders; (6) a
statement as to contractual or other arrangements or conditions as to agents'
commissions; (7) any determination and recommendation as to opening and closing
public and private ways, roads, streets, and easements; and (8) other material
facts relevant to the sale and the confirmation proceeding.
 
The Court does not find any basis to vacate the sale or
direct that a new sale be made.  See
CCP 873.730(c).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
The sale is confirmed and the Court will sign the proposed Order lodged
with the motion.
