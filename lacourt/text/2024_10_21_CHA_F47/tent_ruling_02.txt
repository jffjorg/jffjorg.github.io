SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Arelis Lopez and
Gene Lopez’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of a 2019 Kia Forte (the Vehicle)
manufactured and/or distributed and warranted by Defendant Kia America, Inc.
(Defendant).  Plaintiffs contend that the
Vehicle was/is defective and unsafe as it has recurring and unpredictable transmission,
electrical and other defects.  Plaintiffs
allege that despite frequent repair visits and Defendant’s inability to fix the
problems after a reasonable number of attempts, Defendant failed to replace the
Vehicle in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.
 
On 3/30/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2.  On 5/8/23, Defendant answered the complaint.
 
On 12/28/23, Plaintiffs served Defendant with Requests
for Admissions, Set 1.  (Thomas Decl.,
Ex.A).  Defendant served verified
responses on 2/13/24.  (Thomas Decl.,
Ex.B).  In response to Requests for
Admissions (RFAs) 3, 5, 11, 24, 26 and 34 (incorrectly labeled 35 in
Plaintiffs’ RFAs) and 39-41, Defendant asserted only objections.  Id. 
On 4/1/24, Plaintiffs sent a meet and confer letter regarding the
deficiencies in certain of the responses. 
(Thomas Decl., Ex.C).  Defendant
responded indicating that it would be supplementing its responses to RFAs 3, 5,
11, 24, 26, 34 and 39-41.  On 4/30/24,
Defendant agreed to extend the deadline for a motion to compel further
responses to 5/24/24.  (Thomas Decl.,
Ex.E).  On 5/13/24, Plaintiffs sent an
email regarding the overdue supplemental responses to which Defendant did not
respond.  (Thomas Decl., Ex.F).  
 
On 5/24/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Defendant 
to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions, Set
1.  Additionally, Plaintiffs request an
order imposing sanctions against Defendant and its attorneys of record,
Lehrman, Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP, in the amount of $2,310.00.  Defendant has opposed the motion and
Plaintiffs have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The  opposition contends
that by the time of the hearing on the motion, Defendant will have provided
supplemental responses to RFAs 3, 5, 11, 24, 26, 34
(incorrectly labeled as 35), and 39-41 rendering the motion moot.  (See Opposition, p.2:2-7).  From the declaration submitted in support of
the opposition, it is not clear if Defendant is contending that supplemental
responses to the subject RFAs have already been served or will be served.  (See Chang Decl. ¶¶3-4).  The opposition goes on to argue that
sanctions are not warranted because there was never any misuse/abuse of the
discovery process by Defendant.  
 
The reply to the opposition states that as of the time of
the filing of the reply on 10/14/24, Defendant has not provided proper further
responses to the subject RFAs.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
 
The opposition essentially concedes that further
responses to RFAs 3, 5, 11, 24, 26, 34 (incorrectly
labeled as 35), and 39-41 are warranted as Defendant indicates that such
have been or will be provided before the hearing.  Since Defendant has not provided any evidence
that proper, verified further responses to the subject RFAs have been served
and has failed to justify its objections, Defendant is ordered to provide
further responses to RFAs 3, 5, 11, 24, 26, 34 (incorrectly labeled as 35), and
39-41 within 30 days.
 
The Court further finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to
an award of sanctions against Defendant and its attorneys of record, Lehrman,
Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP, in the amount of $2,310.00 (2 hours to
prepare motion + 2 hours to review opposition and draft reply +1 hour to
prepare for and appear at hearing multiplied by $450/hour + $60 filing fee),
for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.  (See Thomas Decl. ¶¶11-23).  Defendant fails to provide an adequate
explanation as to why proper responses to the discovery requests have not been
provided in the more than 9 months since the discovery requests were served on
Defendant.  Sanctions are payable within
30 days.
