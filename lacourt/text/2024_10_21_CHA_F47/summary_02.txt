And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses to the requests for admissions, set 1, filed by the plaintiffs (Arelis Lopez and Gene Lopez) against the defendant (Kia America, Inc.). The defendant had objected to certain requests for admissions, but failed to provide adequate responses. The judge finds that the defendant has not provided proper, verified further responses to the subject requests for admissions, and orders the defendant to provide further responses within 30 days.

Additionally, the judge has ordered the defendant and its attorneys (Lehrman, Villegas, Chinery & Douglas, LLP) to pay sanctions in the amount of $2,310.00 for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations. The judge finds that the defendant has failed to provide an adequate explanation for its failure to provide proper responses to the discovery requests, and that sanctions are necessary to ensure compliance with the discovery rules.
