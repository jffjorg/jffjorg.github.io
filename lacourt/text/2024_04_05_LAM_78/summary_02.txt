Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to determine the Medi-Cal lien and the Medi-Cal reimbursement. The Court has granted DHCS's motion to determine Medi-Cal reimbursement in the reduced amount of $191,941.18. The Court has denied Plaintiffs' motion to reduce the Medi-Cal lien. The Judge has calculated the portion of the settlement attributable to past medical expenses paid by DHCS to be $144,090.24, which must be reduced by 25% for DHCS's contribution to attorney's fees and further reduced by $1,962.22 for DHCS's contribution to litigation costs. The total lien amount is $105,459.91. The parties dispute the allocation of the settlement proceeds, and the Court has determined that the Ahlbon formula is the proper method to determine the portion of the settlement attributable to past medical expenses.
