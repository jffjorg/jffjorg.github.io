Summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, The Nice Guy, LLC, and Hwood Group, LLC, on all causes of action, including negligence, negligent hiring, and public nuisance. The court finds that the First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to state facts sufficient to show that the alleged shooting was foreseeable, that the defendants owed a duty to protect the public from criminal acts, and that the defendants created a public nuisance. The court also finds that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action for public nuisance. The court denies the motion to strike as moot. The court grants leave to amend the complaint, but Plaintiffs must specify how the proposed amendments will cure the defects in the FAC.
