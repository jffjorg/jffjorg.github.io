And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants FCA US LLC's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiff's breach of express warranty claim is based on the purchase of a used vehicle, which does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge finds that the Vehicle was purchased used from SC Car Zone and had a remaining balance on its warranty. The judge concludes that FCA US LLC did not partner with SC Car Zone to sell used vehicles directly to the public by offering an express warranty as part of the sales package, and therefore is not liable for breach of express warranty under section 1795.5 of the California Civil Code.
