And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil action. The defendants, Brian E. Claypool and The Claypool Law Firm, argue that the case meets the conditions for reclassification because the amount in controversy is below the statutory maximum for limited civil jurisdiction. However, the judge has denied the motion because the defendants have failed to address all possible sources of damages for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. The judge finds in favor of the plaintiff, Michelle Leonard, and concludes that the amount in controversy has not been shown with legal certainty to be $35,000 or less.
