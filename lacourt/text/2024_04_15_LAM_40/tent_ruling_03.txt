I. Background
A. Pleadings,
Judgment, and Writ of Possession
On September 19, 2023,
Plaintiff Union Mutualista de San Jose (Union Mutualista) initiated this
unlawful detainer (UD) action against Union Mutualista’s commercial tenants for
1034 Cristobal Avenue, Wilmington, CA 90744 (the Premises), Defendants Rafael Davila Madrigal and Alicia Brisila
Davila (the Davila Defendants).
On December 11, 2023, Union Mutualista filed a motion for summary
adjudication of the second cause of action in the UD complaint, i.e.,
Termination of Month-to-Month Tenancy against all Defendants.
On December 20, 2023, the Davila Defendants opposed Union Mutualista’s
December 11th motion.
On January 4, 2024, the Court granted Union Mutualista’s December 11th motion.
On February 9, 2024, Union Mutualista dismissed (1) Does 1 through 30 and
(2) the UD complaint’s first cause of action (the only other claim aside from
the Complaint’s second cause of action).
On February 15, 2024, Union Mutualista filed a proposed judgment for this
UD action.
On February 20, 2024, the Court signed and entered Union Mutualista’s
proposed judgment. That same day, the Clerk gave notice of
entry of judgment.
On February 21, 2024,
Union Mutualista filed an application for writ of possession of the Premises.
On February 22, 2024,
the Clerk issued a writ of possession for the Premises.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On March 5, 2024, the
Davila Defendants filed a motion to set aside/vacate the February 20, 2024,
judgment, and to stay the February 22, 2024, writ of possession.
On March 22, 2024,
Union Mutualista filed an opposition to the Davila Defendants’ March 5th
motion.
On March 26, 2024,
Union Mutualista filed errata papers in relation to its opposition of the
Davila Defendants’ March 5th motion.
No reply appears in the
record.
The Davila Defendants’
motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Set Aside/Vacate
Judgment and to Stay Writ of Execution: DENIED.

After review, the Court determines
that the Davila Defendants’ motion lacks merit.
The Davila Defendants’ motion—filed
in pro per—seeks a Court order setting aside/vacating the February 20, 2024,
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), as based
on purported inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Mot., pp. 3-4; see Lombardi
v. Citizens Nat’l Trust & Sav. Bank (1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 206, 208-209
[Self-represented litigants are “restricted to the same rules of evidence and
procedure as is required of those qualified to practice law before our courts”];
accord Harding v. Collazo (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1056.)
A review of the motion, however,
shows that it is instead premised on prejudice and equity, not mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. As stated by the Davila
Defendants: “It is imperative to inform this Court that it will take Defendants
time to move and find a new location due to the type of business that
Defendants own, which is, an Auto Dismantling Business, therefore they request
this court to issue an appropriate amount of time in order to move out. [¶] Defendants’
equipment consists in relocation, car parts, heavy machinery, containers,
recycling equipment, multi-dismantling machinery, vehicles, trucks, car rims,
crushers, etc. [¶] The denial of this motion could result in severe
consequences for Defendants business and complicating the retrieval of their
business equipment. [¶] Therefore, based on the facts mentioned herein,
Defendants hereby request this Court to set aside the Judgment entered on
February 21, 2024, and Stay the Writ of Execution issued on February 22, 2024,
and grant Defendants additional time to vacate the premises.” (Mot., Davila
Defendants’ Decl. at 6:14-24.)
The proposed order also shows that
the objective of the motion is to obtain (1) a stay for a period of time to be
specified by the Court and (2) a vacatur of the February 22, 2024, writ of possession,
all for the purpose of giving the Davila Defendants additional time to move
their heavy equipment out of the Premises. (Mot., Proposed Order, pp. 1-2.)
Based on the above, the Court reads
the Davila Defendants’ motion as being based on equity—e.g., a temporary
restraining order arresting the status quo—rather than on the Davila
Defendants’ mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Austin
v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 930 [“‘The
nature of a motion is determined by the nature of the relief sought, not by the
label attached to it. …. The principle that a trial court may consider a motion
regardless of the label placed on it by a party is consistent with the court’s
inherent authority to manage and control its docket.’ [Citation.]”].)
However, the Davila Defendants fail
to sufficiently elaborate the grounds for an injunction arresting the status quo.
While the Davila Defendants have made their prejudice clear, the Davila
Defendants have failed to balance the harm that Union Mutualista would suffer through
Defendants’ extended stay on the Premises. For example, the Davila Defendants
do not explain how Union Mutualista would be compensated for the additional
monies it may lose in rental income for the Premises—or for damages arising
from Union Mutualista’s breach of any contract for failure to deliver the
Premises to a new tenant by a certain date, as applicable. Neither do the
Davila Defendants describe attempts to stipulate to a specific moving date with
Union Mutualista. (Mot., Davila Defendants’ Decl. at pp. 5-6 [procedural
history and prejudice to Davila Defendants alone].) Even if the Court were to
consider the prejudice to Defendants,  the motion was filed on March 5, 2024, and by
the time this motion will have been heard, they would have had 40 days to move.
They present no alternative time period, and only state that it will take time
to move and find a new location. Presumably, they have been on notice of the
need to be prepared to move for quite some time.
To the extent that the Davila
Defendants’ motion is a motion for reconsideration or motion for renewed
consideration of the Court’s January 4, 2024, summary adjudication ruling—the
ruling from which, alongside the February 9, 2024, dismissals, the February 20,
2024, judgment arose—the Davila Defendants have made an insufficient showing of
new facts or law supporting that relief. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subds.
(a)-(b).)
The Davila Defendants’ motion is
thus DENIED.
 
III. Conclusion
Defendants Rafael Davila Madrigal and Alicia Brisila Davila’s Motion to Set
Aside/Vacate Judgment and Stay Writ of Execution and Request for Court Order to
Set a New Hearing Date is DENIED.
