And here is the English-text summary:

"Pursuant to the tentative ruling, the court denied the Davila Defendants' motion to set aside/vacate the February 20, 2024, judgment and stay the February 22, 2024, writ of possession. The court ruled that the motion lacked merit and that the Davila Defendants failed to sufficiently elaborate the grounds for an injunction arresting the status quo. The court also noted that the Davila Defendants had been on notice of the need to be prepared to move for quite some time and that they had failed to provide an alternative time period for the stay. The court concluded that the motion was filed in bad faith and was an attempt to delay the eviction process."
