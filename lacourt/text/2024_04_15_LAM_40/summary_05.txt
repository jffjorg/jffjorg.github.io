Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Rack Room Shoes, Inc. (RR Shoes) to the complaint filed by Miguel A. Licea (Plaintiff). The complaint alleges that RR Shoes violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Penal Code §§ 631 and 632.7) by allowing Freshworks, a third-party spyware company, to intercept and eavesdrop on chats on RR Shoes' website.

The judge has found in favor of the Plaintiff and overruled RR Shoes' demurrer as to both causes of action. The judge concluded that the Complaint sufficiently alleges that Freshworks shared or communicated with Meta the information sourced from the Licea-RR Shoes communications, and that RR Shoes allowed and even paid Freshworks to employ electronic means to learn the contents of the Licea-RR Shoes online communications.

The judge also found that the use of RR Shoes' chat function on their website constitutes a telephony communication, and that the Plaintiff has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the communications at issue. The judge rejected RR Shoes' arguments that the Plaintiff had a diminished expectation of privacy and that the communications were not the type of communications contemplated in Penal Code section 632.7.
