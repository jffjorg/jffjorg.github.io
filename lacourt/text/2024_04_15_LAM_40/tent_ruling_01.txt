 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendants Brian E. Claypool and The
  Claypool Law Firm’s Motion to Reclassify Plaintiff’s Action as a Limited
  Civil Action.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Michelle
Leonard sues Defendants Brian E. Claypool (Brian Claypool), The Claypool Law
Firm (Claypool Law), and Does 1 to 20 pursuant to a May 3, 2023, First Amended
Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Legal Malpractice and (2) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty.
The claims arise from
allegations that, in the course of their legal representation of Michelle
Leonard in claims surrounding her injuries arising from the Route 91 Harvest
Festival concert shooting in Las Vegas Nevada, Brian Claypool and Claypool Law
(the Claypool Defendants), as well as Does 1 to 20, engaged in conduct
amounting to legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.
B. Relevant
Procedural History
On March 12, 2024, the
Court partially granted a January 11, 2024, motion by the Claypool Defendants
for, inter alia, issue and evidence sanctions against Plaintiff Michelle
Leonard. The Court ordered:
“(1) Except as to
evidence produced by Michelle Leonard by February 25, 2024, Michelle Leonard
and her witnesses are PRECLUDED from testifying or introducing writings or documents
that relate to any payments that Michelle Leonard received in or for the
Underlying Action[.]
(2) It is established
in this action that Michelle Leonard did not have any income for five years
prior to the underlying incident, other than as shown in the evidence produced
by Michelle Leonard as of February 25, 2024.
(3) It is established
in this action that Michelle Leonard received an amount of money for the
Underlying Action, but Michelle Leonard is barred from introducing any amount
that she received, other than the evidence produced by Michelle Leonard as of
February 25, 2024.
(4) It is established
in this action that Michelle Leonard received an amount of money for the
underlying incident, but Michelle Leonard is barred from introducing any amount
that she received, other than the evidence produced by Michelle Leonard as of
February 25, 2024.”
C. Motion Before the
Court
On March 19, 2024, the
Claypool Defendants filed a motion to reclassify this action from an unlimited
jurisdiction civil action to a limited jurisdiction civil action.
The Claypool Defendants
served this motion on Plaintiff Michelle Leonard’s counsel—Kevin Gerry and
Frank Hartman of The Law Offices of Kevin Gerry—via email that same day.
No opposition, reply,
or notice of non-opposition appears in the record.
The Claypool
Defendants’ motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Reclassify: DENIED,
without prejudice.
A.
Request for Judicial Notice
Per
the Claypool Defendants’ request, the Court takes judicial notice of the
settlement in the underlying class action and its corresponding Claims Protocol
and Allocation Methodology. (Mot., RJN, Exs. A, B; Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd.
(d), 453, subd. (a)-(b).)
B.
Legal Standard
To
prevail on a motion to reclassify a case as limited, the movant must show that
the case is incorrectly classified as an unlimited civil case—that is, the case
meets all the conditions for classification as a limited civil case. (See,
e.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, subds. (a)-(c), 422.30, subd. (b), 580, subds.
(b)(1)-(4).)
If
the movant seeks a reclassification because the amount in controversy is below
the statutory maximum for limited civil jurisdiction ($25,000 or less prior to
January 1, 2024, $35,000 or less thereafter), the movant must show a legal
certainty that the damages award will not exceed that maximum. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 85, subd. (a); see Hiona v. Superior Court (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 866, 872 (Hiona); Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005)
129 Cal.App.4th 266, 277 (Ytuarte); see also Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 270-271 (Walker) [courts should be cautious about
changing case from unlimited to limited because it deprives plaintiff of chance
to prove higher damages].)
C.
Parties’ Arguments

In their motion, the Claypool
Defendants argue that based on the limited universe of the documents produced
by Michelle Leonard as of February 25, 2024, and based on the Court’s March 12,
2024, ruling limiting the evidence to that limited universe, Plaintiff’s
maximum damages in this action can only be $16,446.97, which supports a limited
jurisdiction civil action. The Claypool Defendants base that calculation on the
settlement in the underlying class action case and the corresponding Claims
Protocol and Allocation Methodology.
No opposition was filed, and a notice
of non-opposition was filed by Defendants on April 3, 2024.
D. Analysis
The Court finds in favor of Michelle
Leonard.
Put simply, the Claypool Defendants
have failed to address all the avenues of potential damages alleged in the FAC’s
two causes of action, for which reason the Claypool Defendants have failed to
show with legal certainty that damages will not exceed $35,000.
The FAC alleges liability against
the Claypool Defendants based on: (1) the Claypool Defendants’ failure to
submit key medical records for Michelle Leonard’s injuries in relation the
Route 91 shooting and class action case in Nevada; (2) the Claypool Defendants’
failure to file documentation with the federal government regarding Michelle
Leonard’s total disability as a result of her injuries; (3) the Claypool
Defendants providing erroneous tax information regarding Michelle Leonard’s
personal injury claims; and (4) the Claypool Defendants’ omission of the
aforementioned misconduct through failure and refusal to communicate with
Michelle Leonard to keep her apprised of the significant developments in the
class action case or respond to Michelle Leonard’s documents requests,
including giving Michelle Leonard a copy of her retainer agreement upon
execution. (FAC, ¶¶ 9-10(c).)
The moving papers only address
point (1), i.e., damages arising from failure to submit medical records. (See
Mot., pp. 4-6.) The moving papers do not address the other sources of damages,
such as points (2) and (3), i.e., damages arising from the Claypool Defendants’
failure to file documentation with the federal government regarding Michelle
Leonard’s total disability and giving Michelle Leonard erroneous tax
information. The moving papers only mention disability once and taxes twice,
and these three references were made in the context of damages arising from
failure to submit medical records in the class action case, which is unrelated
to total disability filings and erroneous tax filings with the federal
government. (Mot., 3:19-21, 5:1-5.) Damages arising from the Claypool
Defendants’ omission of the above conduct—point (4)—is also not addressed in
the moving papers; it may not give rise to any damages over and above point 1,
but the issue has not been addressed.
And while the Claypool
Defendants challenged the FAC’s allegations in a demurrer and motion to strike
filed on February 7, 2023, the Claypool Defendants took those motions off
calendar on May 8, 2023, for which reason the entirety of the FAC must be
addressed when analyzing damages with legal certainty for reclassification
purposes.
Because the Claypool
Defendants’ motion does not address all possible sources of damages for legal
malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty, the amount in controversy has not
been shown with legal certainty to be $35,000 or less. The Claypool Defendants’
motion is thus DENIED, without prejudice. (Code Civ. Proc., §
85, subd. (a); Hiona, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 872; Ytuarte,
supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 277; Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d
at pp. 270-271.)
 
III. Conclusion
Defendants Brian E. Claypool and
The Claypool Law Firm’s Motion to Reclassify Plaintiff’s Action as a Limited
Civil Action is DENIED, without prejudice.
