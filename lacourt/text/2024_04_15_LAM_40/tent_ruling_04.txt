On December 6, 2023, Defendants
Kenneth Melrose dba Law Office of Ken J. Melrose, and Law Office of Kenneth J.
Melrose, PC (erroneously listed as Law Offices of Kenneth J. Melrose, LLC) (the
Melrose Defendants) filed a demurrer to Plaintiff Nathaniel Howard's August 18,
2023, Complaint. The demurrer was set for hearing on April 15, 2024.
On February 23, 2024, the Court
denied the Melrose Defendants’ demurrer as moot. Additionally, on March 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, which mooted the Melrose
Defendants’ demurrer, in accordance with the February 23, 2024, order.
The matter is thus not called for
hearing. No appearances are necessary.
