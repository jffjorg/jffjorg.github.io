 Case Number:  BC702531    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  56     SUPERIOR  COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR  THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT      CHRISTIN MATTHES,                             Plaintiff,             vs.   CHRISTIAN RODGERS, LYNDSY RODGERS, and    DOES 1 through 10, inclusive,                                                                                                            Defendants.                                               CASE NO.:  BC702531   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:  MOTION FOR AWARD OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES ON APPEAL    AGAINST DEFENDANTS CHRISTIAN RODGERS AND LYNDSY RODGERS IN THE AMOUNT OF $59,605.00     Date: November 26, 2024 Time: 8:30 a.m. Dept. 56          MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff  CHRISTIN MATTHES (“Plaintiff”)   RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants  CHRISTIAN RODGERS (“Mr. Rodgers”) and LYNDSY RODGERS (“Ms. Rodgers”) (jointly,  “Defendants”)               The Court has considered the moving,  opposition and reply papers.     BACKGROUND             This action arises from misconduct that occurred while Plaintiff lived  with Defendants and worked as their au pair.   The complaint (“Complaint”) alleged claims for: (1) invasion of privacy;  (2) violation of Civil Code section 1708; (3) assault; (4) negligent infliction  of emotional distress; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6)  violation of Government Code section 12940; and (6) breach of the implied  covenant of quiet use and enjoyment.   A jury trial was held starting April 11, 2022.  Before the jury deliberated, Plaintiff  dismissed the breach of the implied covenant of quiet use and enjoyment claim.  The jury returned its verdict on April 14,  2022.  The jury found in favor of  Plaintiff and awarded damages for the: (1) constructive invasion of privacy claim against Mr. Rodgers in the amount  of $100,000; (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against Ms.  Rodgers in the amount of $100,000; (3) intentional infliction of emotional  distress claim against Mr. Rodgers in the amount of $250,000; and (4) hostile  work environment claim against both Defendants in the amount of $100,000  against Mr. Rodgers and $100,000 against Ms. Rodgers.  In addition, the jury found that Defendants  acted with malice, oppression, or fraud and awarded Plaintiff punitive damages  in the amount of $2,000,000 against Mr. Rodgers and $1,000,000 against Ms. Rodgers.   The jury found in favor of Defendants  with respect to the remainder of the claims alleged in the Complaint against  them.  The judgment (“Judgment”) was  entered on June 16, 2022.  The Judgment  designates Plaintiff as the prevailing party entitled to costs.  (Judgment, ¶ 12(h).)              Defendants  filed a motion for new trial and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict  on July 1, 2022.  (Motion for New Trial,  7/1/2022; Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, 7/01/2022) The Court  found for Plaintiff, but reduced punitive damages to $1,800,000 as against Mr. Rodgers,  and to $200,000 as against Ms. Rodgers. (Min. Order, 8/11/2022.)             Defendants  filed Notices of Appeal from the Judgment on the jury trial and the Judgment on  August 15, 2022, Court of Appeal Case No. B322759.  (Notice of Appeal, 8/15/2022.) Defendants  filed a second Notice of Appeal on December 23, 2022, specifically related to  the award of attorneys’ fees, Court of Appeal Case No. B326083.  (Notice of Cross-Appeal/Cross-Appeal,  12/23/2022.)               The Court of Appeal affirmed in  B322759, and remittitur was issued on July 22, 2024.  (Remittitur, 7/22/2024.)  Defendants later dismissed their appeal in  case no. B326083.               Plaintiff now moves this Court for  an award of attorneys’ fees on appeal by filing the instant Motion for Award of  Attorneys’ Fees on Appeal Against Defendants Christian Rodgers and Lyndsy Rodgers  in the Amount of $59,605.00 (the “Motion”).   Defendants filed an opposition to the Motion on November 12, 2024 and  Plaintiff filed a reply on November 19, 2024   DISCUSSION             CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that  a prevailing party may recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those  costs may include attorney’s fees when authorized by statute or contract. Government Code § 12965(b), provides, in  part, that: “In actions brought under this section, the court, in its  discretion, may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney’s fees and  costs, including expert witness fees, except where the action is filed by a  public agency or a public official, acting in an official capacity.”  Therefore, attorney’s fees and costs may be  recovered by the prevailing party in any action brought under the FEHA.  (Bond  v. Pulsar Video Productions (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 918.)       “A  trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar  figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable  hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the  case.”  (Christian Research Institute  v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.)  “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within  the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of  such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the  experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  The court may also consider whether the amount  requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.”  (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99  Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)   The attorney claiming  fees bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).)  This burden requires competent evidence as to  the nature and value of the services rendered.  (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182  Cal.App.3d 553, 559.)  “Testimony of an attorney  as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to  support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time  records.”  (Id.)     Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees against Defendants  in the amount of $59,605.  This amount reflects 170.3 hours spent related to the appeal filed on this case at an  average hourly rate of $350 per hour.     Defendants argue that the Motion should be denied due  to their inability to pay the fees. Defendants additionally argue that  Plaintiff’s counsel has claimed fees for excessive and duplicative hours worked,  and further argue that any award should be apportioned and limited to time  spent litigating the FEHA claim.       A.  Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees Here, Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney’s  fees as the prevailing party in this case pursuant to Government Code §  12965(b) and the Judgment issued by this Court.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees is proper.¿ The  Court is unpersuaded that Defendants’ ability to pay constitutes a special  circumstance that excuses them from being required to pay Plaintiff’s  reasonable attorney’s fees.  The cases they  cite to support this proposition concern a plaintiff’s ability to pay a fee  award in circumstances where the defendant is the prevailing party, which is  not the situation in the case at bar.  Notably,  the standard for evaluating the suitability of attorney’s fees for FEHA claims  when the defendant prevails differs from the applicable standard for a  prevailing plaintiff.   B.  Reasonableness of Fees i.  Reasonableness of Hourly Rate “The  reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM  Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [“The experienced trial judge  is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in [her]  court.”].)   Plaintiff  seeks fees for work performed at an hourly rate of $350 per hour.  (Declaration of Sean D. Muntz [“Muntz Decl.”],  ¶ 9.)  This hourly rate represents an  average of the hourly rates of the attorneys and a senior paralegal who billed  time working time on this matter.  (Id.)  The Court finds that Plaintiff has  demonstrated that the $350 hourly rate is reasonable.   ii.  Reasonableness of Hours Incurred Defendants  assert that fees requested should be apportioned and apply only to the FEHA  claim.  Attorney’s fees need not be apportioned,  however, between distinct causes of action where plaintiff’s various claims  involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories.  (Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP  (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1251.)  Nor  is apportionment required when the issues in the fee and nonfee claims are so  inextricably intertwined that it would be impractical or impossible to separate  the attorney’s time into compensable and noncompensable units.  (Id.)   As this Court previously held in its October 26, 2022 Order, all of  Plaintiff’s claims arise out of the same nucleus of facts, and the claims are  intertwined to an extent that prevents the apportionment of recoverable  attorney’s fees to time spent solely litigating the FEHA claim.  Thus, no apportionment of fees is required.   Plaintiff  requests a total amount of attorneys’ fees of $59,605 for 170.3 hours  spent.  (Muntz Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Exh. 1.)  The Court is not persuaded by Defendants’  assertion that the billed entries are excessive or unreasonable.  The Court notes, however, that while Plaintiff  provides background information on Sean Muntz, Meghan Glaspy and Janette  Dockstader, no basis is provided as to the other professionals who purportedly  worked on the matter – Marie Mondia, David Greco and Matthew Baker.  Accordingly, the Court strikes the entries pertaining  to Mondia, Greco and Baker amounting to 2.1 hours.   Thus, the requested time spent is reduced to  168.2 hours.   RULING Based  on all the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED in part.  The Court awards in favor of Plaintiff $58,870  in attorney’s fees, representing 168.2 hours at a rate of $350/hour.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.               Parties  who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at  SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court  website at www.lacourt.org.  If the  department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the  hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.   Dated this 26th day of November 2024                     Hon. Holly J.    Fujie Judge of the    Superior Court
