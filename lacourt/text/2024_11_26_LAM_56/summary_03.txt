And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Christin Matthies, the plaintiff, in her motion for an award of attorneys' fees on appeal against defendants Christian Rodgers and Lyndsy Rodgers. The court has determined that plaintiff is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as the prevailing party in this case, as provided by Government Code section 12965(b) and the judgment issued by the court.

The court has awarded plaintiff $58,870 in attorney's fees, representing 168.2 hours at a rate of $350 per hour. The court has also struck 2.1 hours of time claimed by plaintiff, as no basis was provided for the work performed by certain professionals.

The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has found that plaintiff has demonstrated that the hourly rate of $350 is reasonable. The court has also found that the fees requested are reasonable and that no apportionment of fees is required, as all of plaintiff's claims arise out of the same nucleus of facts and are intertwined to an extent that prevents the apportionment of recoverable attorney's fees to time spent solely litigating the FEHA claim.
