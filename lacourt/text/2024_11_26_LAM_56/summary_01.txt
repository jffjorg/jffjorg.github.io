Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the petition to confirm the minor's compromise and has provisionally granted the petition, conditioned on the petitioners appearing at the hearing. The court finds that the settlement agreement is fair and reasonable, and the requested amount in attorney's fees is also fair and reasonable. The court sets a non-appearance case review for January 15, 2025, to review proof of the deposit of the net settlement funds in insured accounts. The court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
