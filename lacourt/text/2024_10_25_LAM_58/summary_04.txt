And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Vicken H. Hagopian, the attorney for the plaintiff, Manuel Olmos Montes. The motion was filed on September 30, 2024, and the judge's ruling is based on the information presented before the court.

The judge's decision is based on two main grounds. Firstly, the judge finds that there is no proof of service for the declaration in support of the attorney's motion to be relieved as counsel, which is required by CRC, Rule 3.1362. Secondly, the judge determines that the client's current address has not been adequately verified.

The judge notes that the client has been unresponsive to repeated attempts to contact, and that the declaration states that the client was served with the motion papers and declaration. However, the judge finds that the client's silence does not verify that his address is current. Further, the judge determines that the court's rules require that the address be confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion, and that the declaration does not meet this requirement.

As a result, the judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel.
