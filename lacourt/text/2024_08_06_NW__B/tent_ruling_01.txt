POSITIVE  INVESTMENTS, INC., ET AL.   MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT   Date of Hearing:  August  6, 2024                                Trial Date:       December  9, 2024 Department:        B                                                     Case No.:         21STCV44536   Moving Party:             Defendants  Positive Investments, Inc. and PI Properties LLC   Responding  Party:       None      BACKGROUND   On December 7, 2021, Plaintiff Jade  Carrasco (“Carrasco”), by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Jesse Ronald  Carrasco, and Jazelle Dimas (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action  against Defendants Positive Investments, Inc. (“Positive”), PI Properties LLC  (“PPL”), Becky Radgowski, and DOES 1 to 100 for injuries Plaintiffs sustained  in a dog bite attack. The complaint alleges causes of action against Defendants  for: (1) strict liability for dog bite, (2) premises liability, (3) general  negligence, and (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress.    On March 8, 2022, Defendants Positive  and PPL filed an answer to the complaint.    On May 17, 2022, Plaintiffs filed  respective amendments to the complaint which identified: (1) Ariana Arambula as  Doe 1; (2) Joseph M. Radgowksi as Doe 2; and (3) Mark A. Radgowski as Doe 3.    On April 25, 2023, Defendants Becky  Radgowski, Joseph M. Radgowski, Mark A. Radgowski, and Ariana Arambula filed a  joint answer to the complaint.    On October 25, 2023, Defendants  Positive and PPL filed a cross-complaint against Becky  Radgowski, Joseph Radgowski, Mark Radgowski, Ariana Arambula, and Jazelle Dimas  alleging causes of action for: (1) indemnity, (2) contribution and  apportionment of fault, (3) indemnity, and (4) contributory and apportionment  of fault.    On November 27, 2023, Jazelle Dimas  filed an answer to the cross-complaint.    On December 7, 2023, Defendants  Positive and PPL (collectively, “Defendants”) filed and served the instant  Motion for Summary Judgment. The motion for summary judgment was served on all  interested parties. Defendants move for an order granting summary judgment on  the entirety of Plaintiffs’ complaint.    On January 12, 2024, Becky Radgowski,  Joseph Radgowski, Mark Radgowski, and Ariana Arambula filed respective answers  to the cross-complaint.  On February 2, 2024, after being held  in chambers without argument, the Court denied Plaintiff Carrasco’s ex parte  application to continue the hearing date on the motion for summary  judgment. (02/02/24 Minute Order.)    On February 6, 2024, after being held  in chambers without argument, the Court granted Plaintiff Carasco’s ex parte  application to continue the hearing date on the motion for summary  judgment. (02/06/24 Minute Order.) The Court continued the hearing on the  motion for summary judgment from February 21, 2024 to April 19, 2024. (02/06/24  Minute Order at p. 1.)    On February 15, 2024, the Court, on its  own motion, continued the hearing on the motion for summary judgment from April  19, 2024 to August 6, 2024. (02/15/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) Plaintiff Carrasco  was ordered to give notice. (02/15/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) Based on a review  of the court file, it does not appear that Plaintiff Carrasco provided notice  to of the Court’s February 15, 2024 minute order.    On June 6, 2024, this action was  reassigned from the Honorable Michelle C. Kim to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz  sitting in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East effective June 24, 2024.    Any opposition to the motion for  summary judgment was required to have been filed and served at least nine court  days before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) As of August 1,  2024, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is unopposed.    [Tentative] Ruling   The Court GRANTS  Defendants Positive Investments, Inc. and PI Properties LLC’s Motion for  Summary Judgment.     DISCUSSION The function of a motion  for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether  an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and  to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)  25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to  grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences  reasonably deducible from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences  or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and  that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler  v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in a motion  for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the  affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of  fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge  v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.) A defendant moving  for summary judgment “may rely on factually devoid discovery responses to shift  the burden of proof . . . .” (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31  Cal.App.4th 573, 590.)  “As to each claim as  framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy  the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element,  or to establish a defense.” (Scalf v. D.  B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally  construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and  resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore  v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once the defendant  has met its burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable  issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a  defense thereto. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25  Cal.4th 826, 849.)   “The summary judgment  statute [is] not intended nor can it be used as a substitute for existing  methods in the trial of issues of fact.” (Travelers Indemn. Co. v. McIntosh (1952)  112 Cal.App.2d 177, 182.) The summary judgment “procedure is drastic and should  be used with caution.” (House v. Lala (1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 412, 415.)  “Any doubt in granting summary judgment should be exercised against the moving  party.” (Ibid.)  Issue No.1: First Cause  of Action for Strict Liability   Defendants argue that  Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their first cause of action for strict liability  because Defendants were not the owners of the dog.  “The owner of any dog is  liable for the damages suffered by any person who is bitten by the dog while in  a public place or lawfully in a private place, including the property of the  owner of the dog, regardless of the former viciousness of the dog or the  owner’s knowledge of such viciousness.” (Civ. Code, § 3342, subd. (a).)  The Undisputed Material  Facts  Defendants present the  following undisputed material facts: on August 30, 2018, Defendants, as  landlords, entered into a lease agreement with Mark Radgowski, Ariana Arambula,  Becky Radgowski, and Joseph Radgowski, as tenants for the single family home  located at 128 S. Lark Ellen Ave., Covina, CA 91722 (the “Property”) at the  rate of $2,550.00 per month (the “Lease”). (Defendants’ Separate Statement of  Undisputed Material Facts (DSUMF) at No. 1.) The Lease limited the occupancy of  the Property to four people and prohibited the tenants from having any pet.  (DSUMF at Nos. 2-3.) Defendants were not Plaintiffs’ landlords and Plaintiffs  were not Defendants’ tenants in 2019. (DSUMF at No. 4.) On November 29, 2019,  Plaintiffs first visited the Property and became aware of the dog living on the  Property. (DSUMF at No. 5.) On or about December 1, 2019, Plaintiffs moved into  the home on the Property. (DSUMF at No. 6.)  Each time Plaintiffs  encountered the dog at issue in this case, the dog smelled Plaintiffs and  walked away. (DSUMF at No. 7.) Plaintiffs considered Becky Radgowski their  friend and landlord in 2019. (DSUMF at No. 8.) The dog lived on the Property  during the time Plaintiffs lived on the Property. (DSUMF at No. 9.) Defendants  were not aware that Plaintiffs moved into the home on the Property, and neither  were Defendants aware of a minor child, Plaintiff Carrasco, living on the  Property. (DSUMF No. 10.) The dog which attacked Plaintiff Carrasco was not  owned by Defendants and the tenants were the owners or keepers of the dog at  issue. (DSUMF at No. 11.)  On December 17, 2019,  Plaintiff Carrasco was attacked by the dog on the Property. (DSUMF at No. 12.)  Defendants were not aware that the tenants owned, or were alleged to have  owned, a dog until after the incident. (DSUMF at No. 13.) Defendants were  unaware of the dog’s propensity for viciousness. (DSUMF at No. 14.) Plaintiffs  did not know the dog at issue was dangerous. (DSUMF at No. 15.) On December 17,  2019, Defendants were not present on the Property and did not witness the  alleged incident. (DSUMF at No. 16.)  Analysis  Here, it is undisputed  that Defendants did not own the dog at issue that caused Plaintiffs’ alleged  injuries. Given that the instant motion is unopposed, Plaintiffs have not  presented any evidence to create a triable issue of material fact as to  Defendants being strictly liable. Therefore, the Court  finds that summary judgment is appropriate as to the first cause of action for  strict liability. Issue No. 2: Second  Cause of Action for Premises Liability and Third Cause of Action for General  Negligence  “To succeed in a  negligence action, a plaintiff must show the following: (1) the defendant owed  the plaintiff a legal duty; (2) the defendant breached the duty; and (3) the  breach proximately or legally caused the plaintiff’s damages or injuries.” (Thomas  v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662.) “The elements of a cause of  action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence.” (Jones  v. Awad (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207.) “Whether an individual owes a  duty of care is a question of law.” (Ibid.)   “[T]he public policy of  this state generally has precluded a landlord’s liability for injuries to his  tenant or his tenant’s invitees from a dangerous condition on the premises  which comes into existence after the tenant has taken possession. This is true  even though by the exercise of reasonable diligence the landlord might have  discovered the condition.” (Uccello v. Laudenslayer (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d  504, 510.) “A duty of care may not be imposed on a landlord without proof that  he knew of the dog and its dangerous propensities.” (Lundy v. California  Realty (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 813, 821.)  Analysis The Court references its  recitation of the undisputed material facts from above and incorporates such  facts herein. Defendants have presented evidence that they lacked knowledge  about the presence of the dog and its dangerous propensities. Moreover,  Defendants have presented evidence that they were not the owners of the dog. Thus,  Defendants have presented evidence to show that they did not have a duty of  care. Plaintiffs have failed  to oppose the motion and have therefore not shown a triable issue of material  fact. As a matter of law, the Court finds that Defendants did not owe  Plaintiffs a duty of care.  As such, the Court finds  that summary judgment is appropriate as to the second and third causes of  action in the complaint.  Issue No. 3: Fourth  Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress “[T]he negligent causing  of emotional distress is not an independent tort, but the tort of negligence.”  (Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072, citation  omitted, emphasis in original.) “The traditional elements of duty, breach of  duty, causation, and damages apply.” (Ibid.) “Its existence depends upon  the foreseeability of the risk and a weighing of policy considerations for and  against imposition of liability.” (Ibid., citation omitted.)  The Court references its  recitation of the undisputed material facts pursuant to the first cause of  action and incorporates it herein. The Court references its analysis as to the  second and third causes of action and incorporates it herein. As a matter of  law, the Court finds that Defendants did not owe a duty to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have not opposed the instant motion and therefore have failed to  create a triable issue of material fact.  Therefore, the Court  finds that summary judgment is appropriate as to the fourth cause of action in  the complaint.  Additionally, because  Plaintiffs failed to oppose Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the Court  finds that they have conceded to all the arguments raised therein as  “[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned  argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo  (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)      CONCLUSION   Based on the foregoing, the Motion  for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.     Moving party is ordered to give  notice and submit a proposed judgment consistent with this ruling.  JADE CARRASCO, ET AL.

BACKGROUND

 

On December 7, 2021, Plaintiff Jade
Carrasco (“Carrasco”), by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Jesse Ronald
Carrasco, and Jazelle Dimas (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action
against Defendants Positive Investments, Inc. (“Positive”), PI Properties LLC
(“PPL”), Becky Radgowski, and DOES 1 to 100 for injuries Plaintiffs sustained
in a dog bite attack. The complaint alleges causes of action against Defendants
for: (1) strict liability for dog bite, (2) premises liability, (3) general
negligence, and (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress. 

 

On March 8, 2022, Defendants Positive
and PPL filed an answer to the complaint. 

 

On May 17, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
respective amendments to the complaint which identified: (1) Ariana Arambula as
Doe 1; (2) Joseph M. Radgowksi as Doe 2; and (3) Mark A. Radgowski as Doe 3. 

 

On April 25, 2023, Defendants Becky
Radgowski, Joseph M. Radgowski, Mark A. Radgowski, and Ariana Arambula filed a
joint answer to the complaint. 

 

On October 25, 2023, Defendants
Positive and PPL filed a cross-complaint against Becky
Radgowski, Joseph Radgowski, Mark Radgowski, Ariana Arambula, and Jazelle Dimas
alleging causes of action for: (1) indemnity, (2) contribution and
apportionment of fault, (3) indemnity, and (4) contributory and apportionment
of fault. 

 

On November 27, 2023, Jazelle Dimas
filed an answer to the cross-complaint. 

 

On January 12, 2024, Becky Radgowski,
Joseph Radgowski, Mark Radgowski, and Ariana Arambula filed respective answers
to the cross-complaint. 

 

On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff Carrasco filed
and served the following unopposed two discovery motions: (1) a motion to compel Defendant Joseph Radgowski to provide
verified responses to set one of Plaintiff’s demands for production of
documents, set one, and for monetary sanctions against Defendant Joseph
Radgowski in the amount of $610.00; and (2) a motion to compel Defendant Mark
Radgowski to provide verified responses to set one of Plaintiff’s demands for
production of documents, set one, and for monetary sanctions against Defendant Mark
Radgowski in the amount of $610.00 (collectively, the “Motions”). 

 

On June 6, 2024, this action was
reassigned from the Honorable Michelle C. Kim to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz
sitting in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East effective June 24, 2024. 

 

On July 24, 2024, the Court, on its own
motion, continued the hearing on the Motions from July 24, 2024 to August 6,
2024. (07/24/24 Minute Order.) 

 

Any opposition to the Motions was
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) As of August 1, 2024, the
Motions are unopposed. The Court will address the respective Motions in this
one ruling.  

 

[Tentative] Ruling

 

The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff Jade Carrasco’s respective Motions to Compel Verified Responses to
Demands for Production of Documents, Set One, Against Defendants Joseph
Radgowski and Mark Radgowski, and Request for Monetary Sanctions (the
“Motions”).   

 

DISCUSSION

Any party may obtain discovery . . . by inspecting, copying, testing, or
sampling documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically
stored information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a).) Where a party fails to
timely respond to demand for inspection, copying, testing or sampling “[t]he
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).) Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b) provides that “[t]he party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”

Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of the discovery process is “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a
misuse of the discovery process includes “[m]aking or opposing, unsuccessfully
and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit
discovery.”   “The court may impose a
monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.030(a).  A court has discretion to
fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty
Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771,
791.)

Appropriateness of
Compelling Responses 

Given that the Motions
are essentially identical, the Court will address the Motions collectively.
Plaintiff served Defendants Joseph and Mark Radgowski with set one of
Plaintiff’s demands for production of documents, set one, on December 27, 2023.
(Tan Decls., ¶ 7; Ex. 1.) Defendants Joseph and Mark Radgowski have both failed
to respond to such discovery. (Tan Decls., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff’s counsel declares
that a $60.00 filing fee was incurred as to each respective motion, her hourly
rate is $550.00, and one (1) hour of time is anticipated to be spent pursuant
to each of the Motions, which consists of 0.5 hours preparing the motion,
reviewing the opposition, and preparing the reply. (Tan Decls., ¶¶ 18-20.) 0.5
hours is expected to be spent at the hearing on the Motions. (Tan Decls., ¶
20.) Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions against Defendants Joseph and Mark
Radgowski in the amount of $610.00 each. (Tan Decls., ¶ 21.) 

The Court finds that
Defendants Joseph Radgowski and Mark Radgowski have each failed to respond to
discovery. As such, the Court finds it appropriate to compel the responses of
Defendants Joseph Radgoswki and Mark Radgowski to set one of Plaintiff
Carrasco’s demands for production of documents. 

The Court ORDERS that
Defendants Joseph Radgowski and Mark Radgowski provide verified, complete and
code-compliant responses, without objections, to set one of Plaintiff
Carrasco’s demands for production of documents within 30 days of the date of
notice of this order. 

The
Court, however, reduces Plaintiff Carrasco’s request for sanctions as to each
of the motions given that the Motions are unopposed and are relatively brief
and are substantively identical. The Court AWARDS Plaintiff Carrasco reasonable
monetary sanctions in the amount of $335.00 per motion (which represents 0.5
hours of work on each motion at the rate of $550.00 per hour plus the $60.00
filing fee for each motion). 

 

Thus,
the Court ORDERS Defendants Joseph Radgowski and Mark Radgowski to each pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff Carrasco in the amount of $335.00 within 30
days of the date of notice of this order. 

 

CONCLUSION

 

Based on the foregoing, the Motions
are GRANTED. 

 

The Court ORDERS that Defendants
Joseph Radgowski and Mark Radgowski provide verified, complete and code-compliant
responses, without objections, to set one of Plaintiff Carrasco’s demands for
production of documents within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. 

 

Further, the Court ORDERS
Defendants Joseph Radgowski and Mark Radgowski to each pay monetary sanctions
to Plaintiff Carrasco in the amount of $335.00 within 30 days of the date of
notice of this order.

 

Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
