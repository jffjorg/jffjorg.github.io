Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all causes of action in the complaint, including strict liability, premises liability, general negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The judge found that the defendants did not own the dog that caused the plaintiff's injuries and were not aware of the dog's presence or dangerous propensities. The plaintiff failed to present evidence to create a triable issue of material fact, and the judge found that the defendants did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff.

The judge also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery, ordering the defendants to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's demands for production of documents. The judge awarded the plaintiff $335.00 in monetary sanctions against the defendants for their failure to respond to discovery.
