 Case Number:  21STCV46299    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  30 HEIDI K. DIAZ vs JOSEPH JAMES MARTINTENTATIVEDefendant Joseph James Martin’s motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, supplemental interrogatories, and supplemental production of documents are GRANTED.The court orders Plaintiff Heidi K. Diaz to serve verified responses, without objections, to the discovery at issue within 20 days of this order.Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionOn February 10, 2023, Defendant served Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on Plaintiff. (Chowdhury Decl., Exh. A.) On March 16, 2023, Defendant served Supplemental Interrogatories, and Supplemental Request for Production of Documents on Plaintiff. (Id., Exhs. A.) To date, Plaintiff has failed to provide responses. (Id., ¶ 6.)As Defendant properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery at issue served on Plaintiff. Therefore, the motions are granted.Defendants also request sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c) mandate that the Court impose sanctions when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motions were not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Defendant’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
