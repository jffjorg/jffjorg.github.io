And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff's counsel to be relieved from representing Debra J. Chavez without prejudice. The motion was denied because Plaintiff's counsel has submitted all mandatory judicial council forms, and granting the motion would severely prejudice Plaintiff, who will not have sufficient time to obtain new representation prior to the trial date, which is set to take place in about two weeks. The judge has ordered that the trial date be continued prior to the counsel's withdrawal from the case, and the moving party must give notice.
