And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Guo Tao Ruan, has moved to compel a mental independent medical examination (IME) of the plaintiff, David Long, without opposition. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice due to the lack of details on the examination time and location. The motion does not comply with the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires the motion to specify the time, place, identity and specialty of the examiner, and the "manner, conditions, scope and nature of the examination." The judge has ordered the defendant to correct these deficiencies before the motion can be reconsidered.
