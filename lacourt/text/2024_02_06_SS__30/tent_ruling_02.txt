 Case Number:  21STCV12318    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  30 MIGUEL MENDOZA vs CITY OF LOS ANGELESTENTATIVECross-Defendant Yonina Kligman and Jessica Kligman’s unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement is GRANTED.  The settlement between Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Yonina Kligman and Jessica Kligman is a good faith settlement pursuant to CCP section 877.6. All claims against Yonina Kligman and Jessica Kligman for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault, are barred pursuant to CCP section 877.6(c)Moving party to give notice.DiscussionAn unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement need not contain a full and complete discussion of the Tech-Bilt factors by declaration or affidavit; rather, a bare bones motion setting forth the grounds of good faith and a declaration containing a brief background of the case is sufficient. (City of Grant Terrance v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.) The Court finds Cross-Defendant Yonina Kligman and Jessica Kligman have presented sufficient information demonstrating the settlement was made in good faith. Defendant is thus entitled to a court order finding the settlement was made in good faith.
