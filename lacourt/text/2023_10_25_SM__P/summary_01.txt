(Oroville v. Superior Court, 2019)
  - "When a property owner failed to install a required backwater valve, sewage overflow into the property was not 'predominately' caused by the city's design and installation of the sewer system; there was no inverse condemnation liability." (Oroville v. Superior Court, 2019)

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to the City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the case of Pourmola v. City of Los Angeles. The case involves a sewer line overflow that caused property damage to Pourmola's property. The City argues that the overflow was caused by Pourmola's failure to install a backwater valve, which is required by the California Plumbing Code. Pourmola argues that the City's inadequate maintenance of the sewer line caused the damage.

The Judge has ruled that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Pourmola was required to install a backwater valve, so summary judgment is denied. The Judge has also ruled that the City's motion for summary judgment on the inverse condemnation claim is denied, as there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the City's design and construction of the sewer line caused the damage.

The Judge has granted summary judgment on the nuisance claim, as Pourmola's evidence fails to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the City's conduct caused the water intrusion. The Judge has also denied summary judgment on the negligence/trespass claim, as Pourmola's evidence fails to show that the City had a mandatory duty to prevent the damage.
