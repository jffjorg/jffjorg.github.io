the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)

Yu
Li seeks default judgment against Ji Li in the total amount of $51,115.14,
including $44,000 in damages, $6,437.26 in interest, and $677.88 in costs. Because
the Court finds Yu Li has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Yu
Li’s application for default judgment.

Based on the foregoing, Yu Li’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
