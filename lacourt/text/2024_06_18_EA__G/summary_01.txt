Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint is deemed MOOT, as it was filed after the deadline for amending the complaint. The court also grants the defendant's motion to strike the second amended complaint as untimely and not in compliance with the court's prior ruling. The court further strikes the fifth cause of action (fraudulent inducement-concealment) of the first amended complaint and the plaintiff's request for punitive damages tied to that cause of action. The defendant is ordered to file an answer to the first amended complaint within 10 days.
