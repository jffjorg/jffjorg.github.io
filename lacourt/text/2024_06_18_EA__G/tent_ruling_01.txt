TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant
General Motors, LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is deemed
MOOT.
 
Defendant General Motors, LLC’s Motion to Strike
Punitive Damages from Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is deemed MOOT.
 
On the court’s
own motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436, the Court GRANTS a
motion to strike Plaintiff Elizabeth Turriaga’s Second Amended Complaint filed June
11, 2024, as untimely and not in compliance with the court’s prior ruling on March
28, 2024.
 
BACKGROUND

This is a lemon law action. On March 9, 2018, Plaintiff
Elizabeth Turriaga entered into a warranty contract with Defendant General
Motors, LLC (General Motors) by purchasing a 2017 Cadillac CTS. Subsequently, Turriaga
alleges the vehicle exhibited transmission defects.
 
On February 2, 2023, Turriaga filed a complaint against General
Motors and Does 1-10, alleging (1) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2,
subdivision (d); (2) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b);
(3) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3); (4) breached of
the implied warranty of merchantability; (5) concealment; (6) violation of the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA); and (7) violation of the Magnuson-Moss
Warranty Act.
 
On April 7, 2023, General Motors filed a
demurrer and motion to strike. In response on May 23, 2023, Turriaga filed a
First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same defendants alleging the same
causes of action minus the sixth and seventh causes of action. On March 28,
2024, the Court sustained General Motors’s demurrer to the FAC in part with
leave to amend.
 
On May 9, 2024, General Motors filed the
present demurrer and motion to strike.
 
On June 11, 2024, Turriaga filed a Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of
action.
 
A hearing on the demurrer and a case
management conference are set for June 18, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS

General Motors demurs to Turriaga’s entire
SAC and moves to strike punitive damages from the SAC. But at the time General
Motors filed the present motions, there was no operative SAC filed.
Accordingly, General Motors’s demurrer and motion to strike are deemed MOOT.
 
Furthermore, on the Court’s own motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 436, the Court GRANTS a motion to strike the SAC filed
June 11, 2024, as untimely. When the Court previously sustained General
Motors’s demurrer to Turriaga’s FAC on March 28, 2024, the Court gave Turriaga
ten (10) days to file a SAC which expired on April 8, 2024. Because Turriaga
failed to file the SAC with the court by this deadline, Turriaga cannot now
file the SAC without first obtaining leave to amend. (See Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613 [“We have expressly recognized a trial court’s
authority to strike pleadings ‘not filed in conformity with its prior
ruling.’”], quoting Ricard v. Grobstein, Goldman, Stevenson, Siegel, LeVine
& Mangel (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 157, 162.)
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, General Motors’s demurrer to Turriaga’s SAC is OVERRULED as MOOT and
General Motors’s motion to strike is DENIED as MOOT.
 
Furthermore, the court
strikes Turriaga’s SAC as untimely and not in conformance with this court’s
prior ruling.
 
As a result,
Defendant is ordered to file an answer to the FAC within ten (10) days.  Since Plaintiff failed to amend the FAC
within the time set by the court, the fifth cause of action (Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment) of the FAC is stricken, as are Plaintiff’s request
for punitive damages tied to that cause of action.
