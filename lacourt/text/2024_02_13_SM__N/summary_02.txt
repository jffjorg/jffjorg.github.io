And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Andre Sion Khalili's motion to set aside the default entered against him on December 27, 2023. The Defendant argues that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint, and that he did not receive mail at the premises. The judge finds that the Defendant was served by a registered process server, and that the proof of service filed on December 26, 2023, states that the summons and complaint were posted and mailed to the Defendant's residence at 1155 North La Cienega Boulevard, #PH 10, in West Hollywood. The judge also finds that the non-service report attached to the application to serve by posting gives reason to believe that the Defendant could not be served with reasonable diligence in any manner specified by code other than publication. The judge concludes that the Defendant has failed to provide grounds to set aside the default and denies the motion.
