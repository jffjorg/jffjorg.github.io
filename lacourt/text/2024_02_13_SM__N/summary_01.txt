And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The motion was filed on August 14, 2023, and the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on November 27, 2023. The defendant then filed an answer to the first amended complaint on December 28, 2023. Since the original pleading at issue is no longer the operative pleading in the case, the judge has determined that the motion is moot and denied it.
