And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a case involving a default judgment entered against the Defendant, Pazi Performance Auto Center, Inc. The Defendant filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, alleging that its failure to timely answer the complaint was due to excusable neglect. The Judge found that the motion was timely, but that the Defendant did not qualify for mandatory relief under CCP section 473(b) because it did not provide an attorney affidavit of fault. The Judge also found that the Defendant's declaration from its counsel was insufficient to show excusable neglect. As a result, the Judge denied the motion to set aside the default judgment and denied the Defendant's request for leave to properly file its answer.
