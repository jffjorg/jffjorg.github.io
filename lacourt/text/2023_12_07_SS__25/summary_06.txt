And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting State Farm's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. State Farm seeks to amend its complaint to include additional damages paid to its insured, minus a $1,000.00 settlement payment made by Defendant Linda. The Court finds that State Farm has sufficiently met the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The Court grants the motion and orders State Farm to file the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the ruling.
