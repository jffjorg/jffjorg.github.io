BACKGROUND
 
On March 29, 2022, Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (“State Farm”) filed its complaint against
Defendant Linda Rodriguez AKA Linda Berta Diaz (“Linda”) and DOES 1 through 5
(“DOES”) for damages in the sum for $2,382.72 and other cost based on a motor vehicle
accident which took place on October 12, 2021. 
 
On October 18, 2022, State Farm
amended its complaint to correct the fictitious name of Defendant Doe I to Moneah S.
McDaniel (“McDaniel”). 
 
On December 19, 2022, the Clerk
entered a default against Defendant McDaniel.
 
On December 22, 2022, Defendant Linda
filed her answer. 
 
On September 15, 2023, State Farm
filed the instant motion for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint.   
 
On November 07, 2023, State Farm
moved to dismiss Defendant Linda. The Court granted that dismissal with
prejudice.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Leave to amend is permitted under
the Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a) and section 576. The
policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is “so
strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified. . ..” “Although courts are bound to apply a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any stage of the
proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this policy should be
applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party . . ..
[citation].  A different result is indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and
probable prejudice to the opposing party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)  
 
A motion for leave to amend a
pleading must also comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration to set forth
explicitly what allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating
what new evidence was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment
was not made earlier. The motion must also include (1) a copy of the proposed
and numbered amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and lines the
allegations that would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying
the effect, necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and
reasons for delay. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).)
 
II.        Discussion 
 
State Farm seeks leave to file an amended complaint including $5,086.24
that State Farm paid to its insured subsequently after filing its complaint
minus a $1,000.00 settlement payment previously paid by Defendant Linda. State
Farm additionally seeks to omit Defendant Linda from the complaint and include
Moneah S. McDaniel as a Defendant. (Joseph Pleasant Decl. ¶¶
2-3.)
 
 Here, State Farm provides a copy of the
proposed First Amended Complaint with a supporting declaration stating the
reason why State Farm seeks leave to amend. (Pleasant Decl., Ex. A.) State Farm
additionally provides the Court with a table specifying, by reference to the
pages and lines, the parts of the complaint it seeks to add and remove. (Pleasant
Decl. ¶ 6.) Counsel for State Farm states that the motion to amend is because
of changing circumstances specifically that since filing the action, “[State
Farm] paid an additional $5,086.24 to [its] insured pursuant to the insured’s
Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury (UMBI) coverage, for injuries [the] insured
sustained in the [collision.] Plaintiff also settled with Defendant Linda … for
the sum of $1,000.00.” (Id. ¶ 3.) As a result of these developments, State
Farm seeks to amend its complaint to include those changes as well as others
provided in its amended complaint. (Id. ¶ 4.)
 
Thus, because State Farm has sufficiently
met the requirements of Rule 3.1324, the motion for leave to amend is GRANTED. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
             Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to file
the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of this Court’s ruling. 
 
Moving Party is ordered to give
notice.
