 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 1, 2022, Plaintiff All Los Angeles Painting Company Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Defendants Garnero Inc. (“Garnero”) and Nate Garnero
(“Nate”) (collectively “Defendants”) for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and
common counts.
 
On May 11, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered
default against Defendants. (5-11-22 Request for Entry of Default.) On October
27, 2022, pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, default was vacated, and
Defendants were ordered to file responsive pleadings. (10-27-22 Stipulation and
Order.) On November 28, 2022, Defendants filed a joint
Answer
to the Complaint.
 
On May 8, 2023, Defendants Nate and Garnero filed a Substitution
of Attorney indicating that each Defendant was self-represented. In response,
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate and Strike Answer and Enter Default of
Defendant Garnero. The Court granted the Motion on July 11, 2023, and struck
the Answer as to Defendant Garnero. (7-11-23 Minute Order.) On July 18, 2023,
pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered default against Defendant
Garnero. (7-18-23 Request for Entry of Default.)
 
On June 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed Motions to Compel
Defendant Nate’s responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One). Plaintiff also filed a motion to deem
Requests for Admissions (Set One) admitted by Defendant Nate. Plaintiff also
requested monetary sanctions. On August 17, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
discovery motions and request for monetary sanctions.
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Strike Answer and Request for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions
against Defendant Nate Garnero. The motion is unopposed.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
contends that Defendant Nate has failed to comply with the Court’s August 17,
2023 order by failing to provide verified responses, without objections, to
Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production of Documents (Set
One) within 10 days of the order, and by failing to pay the corresponding monetary
sanctions award within 30 days of the order. Plaintiff contends that it is
unable to prepare for trial because of Nate’s repeated failures to comply with
his discovery obligations. Plaintiff seeks an order from the Court striking
Defendant Nate’s Answer to the Complaint, an entry of default, and monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,415.00 against Nate.
 
OPPOSITION
 
            None. 
 
REPLY
 
            None.
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Terminating
Sanctions
A.        Legal Standard 
The court
is authorized, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to impose the
following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating sanctions, and
contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030, subd. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be
imposed by an order striking out a pleading of any party engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process. (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)  
 
“The
discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967,
992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018)
29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a
greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Discovery sanctions should be
appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed what is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery. (Id.)
“But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Id. [quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279–280); Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702 [quoting
same].)  
 
Code of
Civil Procedure, section 2023.010, subdivisions (d) and (f) provide that a
misuse of the discovery process includes, but is not limited to, “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” and “[m]aking an evasive response
to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (f).)
 
1.         Analysis 
 
            Here,
the Court finds that striking the Answer of Defendant Nate and entering default
against him is appropriate in light of his repeated failures to comply with his
discovery obligations and with the Court’s August 17, 2023 order. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390-392 [upholding
trial court’s entry of default as terminating sanctions where party willfully
failed to comply with discovery order].) Plaintiff gave notice of the Court’s
August 17, 2023 order. (8-22-23 Notice of Ruling.) Plaintiff even served
another copy of that order on August 31, 2023. (8-31-23 Notice of Entry of
Judgment or Order.) Nevertheless, Nate has failed to comply with his discovery
obligations. (Stevenson Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Moreover, the Court infers from
the record that the Defendants are no longer participating in this action. Defendants’
former counsel withdrew from representation on May 8, 2023, leaving Defendant
Garnero, a corporation, without legal representation. (5-8-2023 Substitutions
of Attorney.) Garnero failed to retain new legal representation, which led to
the Court striking Garnero’s Answer to the Complaint on July 11, 2023. (7-11-2023
Minute Order.) Defendants have not opposed Plaintiff’s recent motions and have
not appeared at the hearings on those motions either. The Court further construes
Defendant Nate’s lack of opposition as additional evidence of lack of
participation in this action, and as a tacit admission that Plaintiff’s motion
is meritorious. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C.
Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.
Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion by striking the Answer of Defendant Nate and entering
default against him.
 
With respect to monetary sanctions
in the amount of $2,415.00, the Court exercises its discretion and declines to
award them. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) While the Court agrees
the evidence clearly shows Defendant Nate has engaged in misuse of the
discovery process, the Court finds striking Nate’s Answer to the Complaint and
entering default against him to be sufficient here.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to strike the Answer of Defendant Nate and for
terminating sanctions by entering default against Defendant Nate. The Court
DENIES Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
