And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication, which was aimed at dismissing the plaintiffs' wrongful death claim. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs, the adult children of Richard Boetsch, do not have standing to bring the claim because Boetsch's parental rights were terminated when the children were adopted. The judge found that the adoption did not sever the relationship between Boetsch and the plaintiffs, citing California Probate Code section 6451. The judge also noted that the defendant did not shift the burden of proof to the plaintiffs and therefore did not conclusively negate a necessary element of the plaintiffs' case.
