Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the Motion for Summary Adjudication filed by the Plaintiffs on the issues of duty not to retaliate and duty to process the application of Plaintiff Corey Fields to live with his children. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of establishing that the Defendant breached these duties. The Court concludes that the Defendant did not have a duty to process the application of Plaintiff Corey Fields as he was not a lessee, and that the Defendant did not have a duty to the Plaintiff's children to process their father's application. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' arguments rely on Civil Code § 1924.5, which applies to lessees, and that there is no duty implicated in this action.
