Mikhael v. Carwell, LLC, et al.
Case
No. 23STCV09474
Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees
 
            Plaintiff
Georges Mikhael (“Plaintiff”) filed this action under the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act (the “CLRA”) and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (the
“Song-Beverly Act”) against Defendants Carwell, LLC (“Carwell”) and
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (“Mercedes-Benz”) on April 23, 2023.  On November 1, 2023, the Court ordered
arbitration as to Plaintiff’s claims against Carwell and denied the motion as
it related to Mercedes-Benz.  
 
On February 5,
2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement and motion for attorneys’ fees, as
well as a copy of Defendant’s settlement offer under Code of Civil Procedure
section 998.  Defendant offered $5,000 in
attorneys’ fees but gave Plaintiff’s counsel the option of “allow[ing] the
Court to determine, in a noticed motion and/or by Plaintiff’s filing of a
memorandum of costs, the attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses recoverable.  There is no admission of liability by this
Offer.”  
 
As an initial
matter, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys’ fees
under the CLRA because he refused an appropriate offer of correction.  In Benson v. Southern Calif. Auto Sales
(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1198, the District Court of Appeal ruled that the
purchaser of a used car could not recover attorneys’ fees under the CLRA after
settling a claim against the seller because the seller offered an appropriate
correction, which the buyer did not accept. 
(Benson v. Southern Calif. Auto Sales (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th
1198, 1206.)  Plaintiff disputes that
Defendant offered a CLRA correction. 
Regardless, Plaintiff also seeks attorneys’ fees under the Song-Beverly
Act.  (See Complaint, p. 12.)  Defendant cites no authority stating that the
Court may deny attorneys’ fees under the Song-Beverly Act under these
circumstances.  To the contrary,
Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys’ fees under the Song-Beverly Act for a
settled case.  A prevailing party in an
action under the Song-Beverly Act is entitled to reasonable attorneys’
fees.  (See, e.g., Goglin v. BMW of North
America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 470.) 
Plaintiff was the prevailing party in this litigation, so he is entitled
to reasonable attorneys’ fees.    
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks $39,192 in attorneys’ fees based upon 85.2 hours at a billing
rate of $460 per hour.  Defendants oppose
the motion, arguing that Plaintiff’s counsel is entitled to only $7,945 in
attorneys’ fees.  The determination of
reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial
courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  The Court has broad discretion in
determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be
overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,
or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not explain its
calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the
factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
            The
Court approves Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate of $460 per hour based upon his background
and experience.  However, the Court finds
that 85.2 hours is unreasonable.  For
example, Plaintiff’s counsel spent 39.5 hours communicating with his client.  While, as Counsel points out, Counsel had a
duty to communicate with Plaintiff, Counsel’s duty was to reasonably communicate
with Plaintiff.  (Cal. Rules Prof.
Conduct, rule 1.4, subds. (a)(2)-(3), (b).) 
Similarly, the time spent on some tasks—like drafting an opposition to a
straightforward motion to compel or the estimate to draft a reply to this
motion—seem high.  Therefore, the Court
finds that 55 hours is reasonable for a case of this nature, especially given
Defendants’ litigation conduct and delays in this case, which was filed over
one year ago, on March 23, 2023. 
Accordingly, the Court awards $25,300 in attorneys’ fees.  Defendant’s suggestion that the Court award
only $7,945 in attorneys’ fees is unreasonable. 
However, the Court agrees that Plaintiff’s counsel is not entitled to a
multiplier in this case.  The Court finds
that Plaintiff’s counsel is entitled to $664.21 in costs.   
 
            Defendant’s
counsel argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to the requested attorneys’ fees
because Defendant offered “full restitution within 30 days of receiving
Plaintiff’s CLRA demand, [so] Plaintiff’s counsel’s fees beyond that point are
unreasonable as [Defendant’s] offer should have settled this matter.”  (Defendant’s Opposition, p. 11:3-5.)  This case was filed on April 28, 2023.  On May 31, 2023, Defendant’s counsel offered
“full restitution to [Plaintiff] for return of the subject vehicle” or “to pay
for the installation of the illuminated star . . . and he keeps the
vehicle.”  (Declaration of Donna Hooper,
Exh. D.)  Defendant offered $5,000 in
attorneys’ fees.  (Ibid.)  The email did not specify the amount of
restitution.  (See ibid.)  Plaintiff appears to have made a
counter-offer, which Defendant’s counsel appears to have ignored for at least
30 days.  (See id., Exh. E.)  On July 17, 2023, Defendant’s counsel
responded and offered “$10K + Lease payoff + Fees for the return of the car” or
a “cash/keep type deal $10K + Fees + installation of the star.”  (See ibid.) 
The final offer was $17,000 plus all lease payments made by Plaintiff that
were due on or after November 30, 2023, plus Defendant would pay the finance
company “the remaining amounts necessary to buyout the Subject Vehicle,” and
Plaintiff would surrender the vehicle. 
(See Defendant’s Offer to Compromise, ¶¶ 1-2 & p. 4.)  This record does not support Defendant’s
counsel’s argument.  Rather, the record
suggests that Plaintiff’s counsel negotiated a more favorable settlement.  A plaintiff is not required to accept the first
offer simply because Defendant’s counsel thinks it is a reasonable offer.    
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees
and costs is granted.
 
            2.         Defendants shall pay Plaintiff’s
counsel a total of $25,964.21 within thirty (30) days. 
 
            3.         The Court advances and continues the
Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal (Settlement) from April 29, 2024, to May 21,
2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
