Here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the Defendant's motion for a protective order to exclude Leslie Lindeman from the Plaintiff's deposition. The Judge finds that Leslie Lindeman is an officer of Full Count, Inc. and is entitled to attend the deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420(b)(12). The Judge also finds that the Defendant's counsel handled the matter inefficiently and that the Plaintiff's counsel is not entitled to sanctions. The Judge orders the parties to meet-and-confer and reschedule the deposition, and requires the Plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of the new deposition schedule with the Court.
