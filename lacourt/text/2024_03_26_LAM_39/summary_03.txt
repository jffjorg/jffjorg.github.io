The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, and orders the Plaintiffs to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days. The Judge also grants the Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $5,156.15, to be paid by the Plaintiffs and/or their counsel within 30 days. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' conduct in failing to comply with their discovery obligations and providing deficient responses was abusive and entitles the Defendant to sanctions. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs' counsel has behaved professionally and courteously, but the Plaintiffs themselves have not cooperated with the discovery process.
