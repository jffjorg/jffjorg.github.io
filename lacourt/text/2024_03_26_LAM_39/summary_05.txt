And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the case will remain stayed pending arbitration, and that the Plaintiff's counsel is not allowed to add new defendants or propound discovery without an express order from the Court. The Judge also grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the new entity defendants and to strike and dismiss Abrohom ("Abe") Tress and Aaron Rubin. The Judge denies the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions, but will reconsider this order if the Defendant's counsel files a motion for reconsideration within ten days of any contrary opinion by the California Supreme Court.
