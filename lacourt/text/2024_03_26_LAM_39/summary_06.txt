And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion for attorneys' fees filed by Plaintiff Georges Mikhael against Defendants Carwell, LLC, and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The case was filed under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge finds that Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys' fees under the Song-Beverly Act, but not under the CLRA as the Defendants' settlement offer did not constitute a "correction" under the CLRA.

The judge awards Plaintiff's counsel $25,300 in attorneys' fees, finding that 55 hours of work at a rate of $460 per hour is reasonable. The judge also awards Plaintiff's counsel $664.21 in costs. The judge rejects Defendant's argument that Plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys' fees because the Defendants offered a settlement, finding that the record does not support this argument.

The judge orders that Defendants shall pay Plaintiff's counsel a total of $25,964.21 within thirty (30) days. The judge also continues the Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal (Settlement) from April 29, 2024, to May 21, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
