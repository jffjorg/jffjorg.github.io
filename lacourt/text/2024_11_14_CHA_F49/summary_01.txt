And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The City of Los Angeles's demurrer to the third cause of action in the complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The court finds that the inoperative traffic lights at the intersection where the accident occurred do not constitute a dangerous condition within the meaning of Government Code section 830. The plaintiff has failed to allege a statutory liability against the City of Los Angeles under Government Code sections 815.2 and 840.2. The court concludes that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the immunity provided under Government Code section 830.4, which shields the City of Los Angeles from liability for inoperative traffic lights. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to allege a reasonable possibility of curing the defects in the complaint through amendment.
