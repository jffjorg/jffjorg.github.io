MOVING PARTY:                Ben Perlmutter 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Ben Perlmutter (“Plaintiff’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel
of record for plaintiff Nestor Martinez, individually and as successor in
interest to Juan Carlos Martinez Almazan (“Plaintiff”).
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿ 
The court
finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has served the moving papers on Plaintiff by
mail at Plaintiff’s last known address, which Plaintiff’s Counsel has confirmed
within the past 30 days is current. 
(MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(a).)  However, Plaintiff’s Counsel has not shown
that he served the moving papers “on all other parties who have appeared in the
case[,]” as required by the California Rules of Court.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1362, subd.
(d).)  Instead, the proofs of service
state only that Plaintiff was served with the notice of motion and motion, the
supporting declaration, and the proposed order. 
The
court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s
Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel in order to give Plaintiff’s Counsel
an opportunity to serve the moving papers on all other parties who have
appeared in this action. 
The
court orders that the hearing on Ben Perlmutter’s motion to be
relieved as counsel is continued from November 16, 2023, to December 21, 2023,
at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders Ben Perlmutter (1) to serve a notice of this ruling
on Plaintiff and all of the parties who have appeared in this action, and to
file a proof of service of the notice of ruling with the court by no later than
November 20, 2023, and (2) to serve the papers filed in support of the pending
motion to be relieved as counsel on all of the parties who have appeared in
this action, and to file a proof of service with the court by no later than
November 20, 2023. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  November 16, 2023
