[Tentative]
  Order RE:

MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants Jacob Emrani and Law

RESPONDING PARTIES:     Plaintiffs Karol Vladovich and Law Offices

Motion for Summary Judgment or,
Alternatively, Summary Adjudication 
Defendants Jacob Emrani and
Law Offices of Jacob Emrani (“Defendants”) filed the pending notice of motion
for summary judgment against plaintiffs Karol Vladovich and Law Offices of Mark
B. Plummer, P.C. (“Plaintiffs”) on January 11, 2023.  
Thereafter, on January 30,
2023, Defendants filed a “Notice of Lodgment in Support of Motion for Summary
Judgment; or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication,” stating that Defendants
lodged, in support of its motion, exhibits 1 through 15 with the court.  However, Defendants have not filed those
exhibits with the court and, therefore, that evidence is not part of the court
record.
The court therefore exercises
its discretion to continue the hearing on Defendants’ motion in order to give
Defendants an opportunity to file their supporting evidence with the court.
The court orders that the
hearing on defendants Jacob Emrani and Law Offices of Jacob Emrani’s motion for
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication is continued from
November 16, 2023 to January 18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders defendants Jacob
Emrani and Law Offices of Jacob Emrani to electronically file a complete copy
of the “Notice of Lodgment in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment; or in the
Alternative Summary Adjudication,” with exhibits 1 through 15 attached, unless any party intends to file a motion to
seal any exhibits, in which case the parties shall comply with the requirements
of California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551, no later than December 4,
2023. 
The court orders defendants Jacob
Emrani and Law Offices of Jacob Emrani to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  November 16, 2023
