The motion was filed on January 11, 2023, and the defendants failed to file the supporting exhibits with the court. As a result, the court has exercised its discretion to continue the hearing to give the defendants an opportunity to file the supporting evidence with the court. The hearing is now set for January 18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 53. The defendants are also ordered to electronically file a complete copy of the notice of lodgment in support of the motion, along with the supporting exhibits, unless a party intends to file a motion to seal any exhibits, in which case they must comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551, by December 4, 2023.
