And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside default filed by Varditer Ghukasyan, the defendant in the case. The defendant argues that she did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and that the default should be set aside. The judge finds that the defendant has sufficiently demonstrated that she did not receive actual notice, as the process server mistook the person served for the defendant and the description in the proof of service does not match the defendant. The judge grants the motion to set aside default and deems the defendant's Answer, which was filed on May 24, 2024, as the operative responsive pleading. The case is advanced to a Case Management Conference on February 24, 2025.
