ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Creditor’s Adjustment
Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff) brought this action against Capital Ready Mix, Inc.
(Defendant). Plaintiff alleged that Defendant was indebted to them in the
amount of $ 98,973.52 as
the result of an assignment of an account from the State Compensation Insurance
Fund. 
 
On January 25,
2022, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation and Order for Entry of Dismissal. The Court read and considered the settlement and thereafter
dismissed Plaintiff’s Complaint. Jurisidction was retained pursuant to C.C.P. §
664.6.
 
On July 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this Motion to Vacate the Dismissal and Enter Judgment.
Plaintiff asks that judgment be entered against Defendant pursuant to the terms
of the agreement. 
 
Defendant has
rendered no opposition to this motion. The Court
notes that, pursuant to C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c), a failure to oppose a motion may
be deemed consent to its being granted.  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
C.C.P. §
664.6(a) provides, “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Plaintiff
has sufficiently demonstrated that the parties stipulated to the entry of
judgment against Defendant in this matter in the event Defendant ceased making
settlement payments. Plaintiff submits the declaration of its counsel, Eric Jun,
to which a copy of the fully executed settlement agreement is attached. (See Jun
Decl. Exh. 1.) The agreement contains a clear provision that, in the event of
default, Plaintiff could seek the entry of judgment in this matter totaling the
unpaid balance ($98,973.52) minus any pre-default payments. (Id. at ¶
6.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
declaration states that Defendant made $89,545.97 in settlement payments but
thereafter stopped making payments. (Jun Decl. ¶ 6.) Despite notice to
Defendant of their default, Defendant remains in arrears. (Jun Decl. ¶ 4,
Exh. 3.) Plaintiff states that the remaining balance for the stipulated
settlement is $9,427.55. (Jun Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
No
opposition was filed; therefore, pursuant to the stipulation, judgment is to be
entered in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $9,427.55.
