And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add allegations that the plaintiff fell from the roof of the defendant's home, rather than a ladder as initially alleged. The plaintiff's initial complaint contained factual inaccuracies due to a language barrier between the plaintiff and his counsel. The defendant has not opposed the motion, and the judge finds that the amendment will not prejudice the defendant. The plaintiff is ordered to file the amended complaint within 10 days.
