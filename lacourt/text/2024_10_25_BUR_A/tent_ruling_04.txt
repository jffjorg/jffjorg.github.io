ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Amburr Jasper
(Plaintiff) brings this action against Varditer Ghukasyan (Defendant).
Plaintiff alleges that she was injured when her vehicle was struck by a
Defendant’s vehicle at Chandler Blvd. in Burbank, CA. Plaintiff further alleges
that the collision was the result of Defendant’s negligent operating of her
motor vehicle. 
 
On March 12, 2024,
The Court granted Plaintiff’s application to enter Defendant’s default. On May
24, 2024, unaware of the default, Defendant filed her Answer and Demand for
Jury Trial. On June 26, 2024, the Court held an OSC re: Default. At that
hearing counsel for Defendant informed that they would seek to have the default
set aside. The Court encouraged the parties to stipulate to set aside the default,
lest Defendant be forced to proceed via noticed motion. 
 
Before the Court is
Defendant’s motion to set aside the default. Counsel for Defendant represents
that counsel for Plaintiff refused to stipulate to set aside the default, thus
necessitating this motion. (Herman Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant argues that the
default should be set aside because Plaintiff’s service was insufficient to
provide her with actual notice. 
 
Plaintiff has
rendered no opposition. The Court notes that,
pursuant to C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c), a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed
consent to its being granted.  
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
CCP § 473.5(a)
provides: “When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a
party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been
entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice
of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend
the action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable
time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a
default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.”
 
“[A]ctual notice in
section 473.5 means genuine knowledge of the party litigant…[A]ctual knowledge
has been strictly construed, with the aim of implementing the policy of
liberally granting relief so that cases may be resolved on their merits.’” (Ellard
v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 547 [Citations Omitted].) 
 
“[A] party can make a
motion showing a lack of actual notice not caused by avoidance of service or
inexcusable neglect . . .” (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal. App. 4th
175, 180.) “‘[I]t does not require a showing that plaintiff did anything
improper…[T]he defaulting defendant simply asserts that he or she did not have
actual notice’.” (Id.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Defendant moves to set aside the default
against her on grounds that she did not receive actual notice of this action.
In making this argument, Defendant bears the burden of proof in establishing a
right to relief. (See Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193,
1205.) This necessarily requires Defendant to rebut the presumption of proper
service created by the affidavit of Plaintiff’s process server. (See American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199¿Cal.App.4th 383, 390 [internal
citation omitted]; Evid. Code § 647.) The Court notes that because it is the
policy of the law to favor a hearing on the merits, very slight evidence is
required to justify a trial court’s order setting aside a default. (Ramos v.
Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1444.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
proof of service reflects that service was rendered by “personal service”. The
affidavit from the process server states that Defendant was served at 829 E.
Maple St. Apt. 9 Glendale, CA 91205-4299 on September 2, 2023. The description
for the person served was a 5’7 - 6’0 male, approximately 46-50 years old and
bald. The process server identified the individual served as Defendant. 
 
Defendant
disputes the validity of the process server’s affidavit. To begin, Defendant
states that she is a not a 50 year old, 6’0 man, but a 69 year old female.
(Ghukasyan Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendant states that this description instead
matches her son, Vahe Aghajanyan. (Ghukasyan Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendant further
states that at the time of service she resided at 13127 Beaver Street, Sylmar,
CA 91342. (Ghukasyan Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant explains that the E. Maple St.
address is where her son resided at the time of service. (Ghukasyan Decl.
¶ 4.) Defendant also states that she did not receive any notice of this
lawsuit until after the default was entered in March 2024. (Ghukasyan Decl.
¶¶ 7-8.) 
 
Here,
the Court finds that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated that she did not
receive actual notice of the lawsuit prior to the entry of default. Defendant
has detailed a number of factual inaccuracies in Plaintiff’s proof of service
and stated that she never received any paperwork related to this suit. It is
clear that Plaintiff’s process server mistook the person served for Defendant.
Nor did the process server comply with the procedure for substitute service.
Plaintiff, by virtue of his failure to oppose this motion, has offered no
showing that Defendant did in fact receive actual notice. The Court finds that
Defendant’s motion is with merit and should be granted. 
 
As a
last matter, C.C.P. § 473.5(b) requires the moving party to submit a proposed
responsive pleading with their motion. Defendant has attached her proposed
Answer as Exhibit A. The Court notes that, because Defendant’s counsel was
unaware of the default, Defendant’s Answer was already filed with the Court on
May 24 2024. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to set aside default is GRANTED. Defendant’s May 24, 2024 Answer is
deemed the operative responsive pleading. The October 29, 2024 Status
Conference re: Vacating the Default is hereby advanced to this date and
vacated. The Court sets a Case Management Conference for February 24, 2025 at
9:00 a.m.
