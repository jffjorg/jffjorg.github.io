And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions for sanctions filed by the parties. The plaintiffs, Adam DeVone, Mario Frank Voce, and Julia Voce, as co-trustees of the Voce Family Trust, Voce Residuary Trust, and Restated Voce Marital Trust, alleged abuse by a financial advisor in a trading strategy. The defendants, Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC and John R. Privitelli, contended that the plaintiffs' case was frivolous and sought sanctions and attorneys' fees. The judge denied both motions, finding that neither the lawsuit nor the motions reached the level of frivolity or represented bad faith actions. The judge did, however, grant the defendants' request for expert fees incurred after May 26, 2023, and awarded the defendants costs, except for a deduction of $41,161.35. The judge also reduced the request for costs by $20,501.25 due to improper transcript costs and deducted $3,065.87 for duplicative deposition costs.
