This is an action in which Plaintiffs Adam DeVone, Mario Frank Voce, and Julia Voce, as co-trustees of the Voce Family Trust dated 8/17/1970, the Voce Residuary Trust dated 8/17/1970 and the Restated Voce Marital Trust dated 8/17/1970, alleged abuse by a financial advisor relating to a "trading strategy consist[ing] of high-volume, high-risk options transactions which were saddled with massive transactional commissions, costs, and fees." At trial, the Court granted a nonsuit in favor of Defendants Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC and John R. Privitelli.On April 12, 2024, the Court entered a judgment in favor of Defendants.Sanctions The parties now bring dueling Motions for Sanctions per Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7.  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ entire case was frivolous.  Plaintiffs contend Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions was brough for an improper purpose and is, therefore, itself sanctionable per CCP § 128.7(h).   Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees (see infra), is frivolous.Under Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7, a court may impose sanctions for filing a pleading if the court concludes the pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without factual or legal merit.  (Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 156, 168.)  A claim is factually frivolous if it is “not well grounded in fact” and it is legally frivolous if it is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.”  (Id. at p. 167.)  In either case, to obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.  (Ibid.)  A claim is objectively unreasonable if “any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.” (In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650; Guillemin, supra, at p. 168.) While ultimately not successful, the Court cannot find that either this lawsuit or Defendants’ motions reach the level of frivolity or represent bad faith actions.  Thus, the Motions are denied. Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, Tax Costs Defendants seek “attorneys’ fees in the amount of $2,169,258, costs in the amount of $182,489.82 and expert fees of $177,420.50 or $249,490.37, for a total of $2,529,168.32 or $2,601,238.19. Defendants are entitled to all their expert fees under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 128.7, or, in the alternative, their expert fees after May 26, 2023, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 998, because Plaintiffs rejected Defendants’ offer of $24,999, and Plaintiffs failed to obtain a more favorable award at trial.” The request for attorneys’ fees is premised on CCP § 128.7, which has been rejected.   Next, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.  Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.”  (Ladas v. Cal. State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) The request for expert fees based on CCP § 128.7 is rejected as explained above. Defendants also seek expert fees after May 26, 2023, per CCP § 998.  Plaintiffs argue that such fees should not be awarded because (a) there is no evidence of the 998 offer provided with the memorandum of costs and (b) the expert fees claimed for Scales and Nelson are unexplained and excessive.  The former argument is rejected because evidence of the 998 offer was provided with the Opposition to the Motion to Tax Costs.  There is nothing in Behr v. Redmond (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 517 that states this is insufficient.  With respect to the latter argument, the Court finds the request for $177,420.50 to be reasonable given the scope and duration of the services provided.  Plaintiffs also object to cost items 1, 5, 14 (filing, motion, and service costs), 4 (deposition costs), 11 (court reporter fees), 12 (models and copies of exhibits), 15 (fee for hosting electronic documents), and 16 (other—specifically, rental equipment and trial technician).   The Court reduces the request for costs by $20,501.25 due to improper transcript costs that were not ordered by the Court.  This is conceded.There will be a $5,570.13 reduction for duplicative deposition costs.  This is conceded.There will be a $3,065.87 reduction for other duplicative costs.  This too is conceded.The Court will also make a deduction of $12,024.10 for electronic document hosting, which the Court sees as an overhead cost.  In sum, the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is granted in part.  The Motion to Tax Costs is granted in part.  Specifically, the Court will not award any attorneys’ fees.  Further, all costs will be awarded, except (a) there will only be expert fees from after May 26, 2023 ($177,420.50) and (b) there will be a deduction of $41,161.35.  A proposed order is to be provided within 5 days by Defendants.Defendants to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
