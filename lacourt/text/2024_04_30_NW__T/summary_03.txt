And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer brought by the defendants, Woodpark LLC and Micro Property Management Inc. The demurrer was sustained as to the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action (COAs), which alleged breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence. The court found that the pleading defects in these COAs were insufficient to support the allegations. The judge also sustained the demurrer as to the first COA, which alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, finding that the allegations were insufficient to plead any discriminatory conduct. The demurrer was also sustained as to the sixth COA, which alleged retaliation, finding that the alleged retaliatory conduct did not occur within the 180-day period required by law.

The court granted the plaintiff, Cyman Lehman, leave to amend the pleading defects, but noted that the plaintiff's request was conclusory and did not present any facts to show how the pleading defects could be cured. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change pending further review.
