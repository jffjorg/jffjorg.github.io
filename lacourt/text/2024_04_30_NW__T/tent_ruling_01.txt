  Case Number:  23VECV01074    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  T Posted 4/24/2024 as the court will be dark on 4/25 and 4/2623VECV01074
Babuscio v Sherman Sepulveda
Multiple
motions to compel plaintiff to respond to discovery
The court
does not issue a tentative ruling at this time. 
Plaintiff’s counsel Devre Ross has been ordered to attend the hearing to
explain why her client did not respond to discovery and why she did not respond
to the discovery motions.  She indicated
that her client was in an assisted living residence and the court wants to know
what his status is, whether he needs a GAL, whether the trial should be
continued.  Alternatively, Ms. Ross shall
explain why it appears that she has abandoned the case by her failure to file
anything with the court explaining the circumstances.
