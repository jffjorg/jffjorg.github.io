And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the court will not issue a tentative ruling at this time. Instead, plaintiff's counsel, Devre Ross, has been ordered to attend the hearing to explain why the plaintiff did not respond to discovery and why she did not respond to the discovery motions. The court is seeking to understand the circumstances surrounding the plaintiff's non-response, including the fact that the plaintiff is in an assisted living residence and may require a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) to represent their interests. The court is also considering whether the trial should be continued or abandoned due to the plaintiff's failure to participate in the case.
