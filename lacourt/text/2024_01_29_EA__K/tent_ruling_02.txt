[1]              The motion was filed (and
mail-served) on July 19, 2023 and originally set for hearing on August 14,
2023. On August 2, 2023, the court rescheduled the hearing to January 29, 2024.
The court clerk gave notice of the new hearing date to Plaintiff’s counsel and
Defendant’s counsel Alberto Munoz. Munoz had a motion to be relieved as counsel
set for hearing on August 1, 2023, but this was vacated by the court on July
11, 2023. The motion was never heard. 


[2]              Defendant, a corporation, has
purported to file the instant motion in pro se. “[A] corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) The court would decline to
consider the motion on this basis, even if it had jurisdiction.
