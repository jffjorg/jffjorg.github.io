And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by the defendant, a corporation, on July 19, 2023. The motion was originally set for hearing on August 14, 2023, but was rescheduled to January 29, 2024 due to a court order dated August 2, 2023. The defendant's counsel, Alberto Munoz, had a separate motion to be relieved as counsel set for hearing on August 1, 2023, but this was vacated by the court on July 11, 2023 and was never heard. The judge has determined that the defendant, as a corporation, cannot represent itself in court and therefore declines to consider the motion. The judge cites a previous California court ruling, CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004), which states that corporations must be represented by licensed counsel in court proceedings.
