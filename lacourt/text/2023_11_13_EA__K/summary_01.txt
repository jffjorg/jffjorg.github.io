And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the defendants' unopposed motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The proposed cross-complaint is compulsory and arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's complaint, which pertains to the commercial lease agreement for the subject property. There is no evidence that the defendants have acted in bad faith, and the motion is not opposed. The court finds that the defendants have acted in good faith and grants the motion.
