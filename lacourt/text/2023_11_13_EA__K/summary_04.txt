And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Joseph Aguilar's motion to amend the judgment to reflect an award of pre-judgment interest. The court finds that Joseph is entitled to recover pre-judgment interest from November 1, 2012, the date the subject property was sold, at a rate of 10% per annum. The court disagrees with Martha Gonzalez's arguments that the motion is untimely and that the claim was unliquidated. The court finds that Martha knew the amount owed or could have calculated the amount of damages based on the sales documents for the subject property. The court concludes that the motion is granted and pre-judgment interest should be calculated from November 1, 2012, at the rate of 10% per annum.
