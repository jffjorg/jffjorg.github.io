Legal Standard
“The judgment debtor . . . may serve on the judgment creditor
a demand in writing that the judgment creditor execute, acknowledge, and
deliver an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction of judgment to the person who
made the demand. Service shall be made personally or by mail. If the judgment
has been partially satisfied, the judgment creditor shall comply with the
demand not later than 15 days after actual receipt of the demand.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 724.100, subd. (a).)
“If the judgment creditor does not comply with the demand
within the time allowed, the judgment debtor or the owner of the real or
personal property subject to a judgment lien created under the judgment may
apply to the court on noticed motion for an order requiring the judgment
creditor to comply with the demand. The notice of motion shall be served on the
judgment creditor. Service shall be made personally or by mail. If the court
determines that the judgment has been partially satisfied and that the judgment
creditor has not complied with the demand, the court shall make an order
determining the amount of the partial satisfaction and may make an order
requiring the judgment creditor to comply with the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
724.100, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Colorado moves the court for an order compelling Plaintiff
to comply with Colorado’s written demand to file and deliver acknowledgment of
partial satisfaction of judgment.
Colorado’s counsel Tracy D. Forbath (“Forbath”) represents
as follows:
Judgment was entered on January 6,
2022. (Forbath Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B). Colorado subsequently appealed. (Id.,
¶ 5, Exh. C.) On April 3, 2023, during the pendency of the appeal, Colorado
tendered Check No. 1635792584 to Plaintiff in the amount of $15,000.00. (Id., ¶ 6). On August 14, 2023, Forbath sent a
letter to Plaintiff’s counsel Mauro Fiore Jr., memorializing therein that
Colorado had tendered a $15,000.00 check to Plaintiff on April 3, 2023 and
requesting that Plaintiff file and deliver a partial acknowledgment of
satisfaction of judgment on or before August 29, 2023. (Id., ¶ 8, Exh.
E). Plaintiff has not responded to the aforesaid August 14, 2023 letter by
filing a partial acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment as of the October
16, 2023 motion filing date. (Id., ¶ 9).

The motion is granted. Plaintiff is to deliver an
acknowledgment of partial satisfaction of judgment in the amount of $15,000.00
to Colorado within 10 days from the date of the hearing.
