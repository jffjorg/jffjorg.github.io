 Case Number:  KC070412    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff Joseph
Aguilar’s Motion to Amend Judgment to Reflect Pre-Judgment Interest Award is GRANTED.

Background[1]  
Plaintiff Joseph Aguilar (“Joseph”) alleges as follows:
Joseph is Martha Gonzalez’s (erroneously sued as Martha
Aguilar) (“Martha”) nephew. In 1994, Joseph’s grandparents owned the property
located at 5403 North Heathdale Avenue, Azusa, CA 91802 (“subject property”).
Joseph was only three years old at that time. It was Joseph’s grandparents’
stated intention that the subject property would be Joseph’s inheritance. Joseph’s
grandmother transferred the subject property to Martha in trust until Joseph
became an adult. On or about February 7, 2011, Martha executed and delivered a
grant deed to Joseph; at or about that same time, Joseph and Martha filled out
a “Preliminary Change in Ownership Report.” Martha requested that Joseph hold
on to the deed and not record it. Following delivery of the grant deed, Joseph
and Martha orally agreed that Martha would continue to manage the subject
property. In late 2017, Joseph became aware that Martha had sold the subject
property and used the sales proceeds for her sole benefit.
On July 13,
2021, Joseph filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action
against Martha and Does 1-25 for:
1.

Contract
2.

4.

The case
proceeded to jury trial on March 23, 2022. On March 28, 2022, the verdict form
was filed. On April 12, 2022, “Judgment After Jury Trial” was filed.
On June 9,
2022, Martha filed (and mail-served) a “Notice of Entry of Judgment.” On July
20, 2022, an abstract of judgment was issued. On August 8, 2022, a writ of
execution was issued.
Legal Standard
“When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or this Code, or by
any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all the means
necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this
jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by
this Code or the statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be
adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this Code.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 187).
Discussion
Joseph moves the court, per Code of
Civil Procedure § 187, for an order to amend the judgment entered on April 12,
2022 by adding in $188,577 in pre-judgment interest.
Request for
Judicial Notice
Joseph’s Request for Judicial Notice
(“RJN”) is granted.
Merits
“A person who is entitled to recover
damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right
to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled
also to recover interest thereon from that day. . .” (Civ. Code § 3287, subd.
(a).) “The
purpose of prejudgment interest is to compensate plaintiff for loss of use of
his or her property.” (Segura v. McBride (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1028,
1041). 
The jury verdict form, filed on
March 28, 2022, reflects a finding that Joseph was entitled to prejudgment
interest. (LeBlanc Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A). The judgment entered on April 12, 2022
acknowledges that the jury awarded pre-judgment interest; however, the amount
is not stated therein. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. B.) Joseph asserts that
pre-judgment interest runs from November 1, 2012, the date the subject property
was sold, and should be calculated at 10% per annum pursuant to Civil Code §
3287. (See RJN).
Martha, in turn, first asserts that the
motion is untimely and should have been brought before entry of judgment. Not
so. Martha’s citation to North Oakland Medical Clinic v. Rogers (1998)
65 Cal.App.4th 824 is distinguishable because the question addressed there was
“whether plaintiffs timely requested the court to exercise its power to
determine whether plaintiffs were entitled to interest under section 3287 in
circumstances where damages had been awarded but no interest was included in
the verdict and where neither court nor jury had determined whether the damages
were liquidated or unliquidated.” (Id. at 829) Here, Joseph’s entitlement
to recoup prejudgment interest has already been established by the jury
verdict form and judgment. The motion here only seeks a determination of the amount
of that interest.
Martha next asserts that the
Joseph’s claim was unliquidated, such that Civil Code § 3287, subdivision (b)
[i.e., “[e]very person who is entitled under any judgment to receive damages
based upon a cause of action in contract where the claim was unliquidated, may
also recover interest thereon from a date prior to the entry of judgment as the
court may, in its discretion, fix, but in no event earlier than the date the
action was filed”] applies. The court disagrees.
“[P]rejudgment interest is allowable
where the amount due plaintiff is fixed by the terms of a contract, or is
readily ascertainable by reference to well-established market values. . .
interest is not allowable where the amount of the damages depends upon a
judicial determination based upon conflicting evidence and is not ascertainable
from established market prices or values.” (Leaf v. Phil Rauch, Inc.
(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 371, 375.) “The test for recovery of prejudgment interest
under section 3287, subdivision (a) is whether defendant actually
know[s] the amount owed or from reasonably available information could the
defendant have computed that amount.” (Cassinos v. Union Oil Co. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 1770, 1789 [internal quotations and citation omitted;
emphasis in original].) Here, there is no conflicting evidence; the amount of
damages was the profit that Martha secured from the sale of the subject
property. Martha actually knew the amount owed or could ascertain her potential
exposure to Plaintiff via “reasonably available information,” such as the sales
documents for the subject property.
The motion is granted. Prejudgment
interest, then, is properly calculated from November 1, 2012, the date the
grant deed was signed, at the rate of 10% per annum. (RJN; Civ. Code § 3289,
subd. (b)).
