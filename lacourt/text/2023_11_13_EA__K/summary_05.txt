And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed on August 2, 2023, which was served on Martha via mail and email. Martha claims that the motion was improperly served because it was not served on her counsel. However, the Judge finds that Martha's appearance at the hearing and her substantive opposition to the motion waive any defects or irregularities in the notice of the motion. Additionally, Martha fails to provide any authority supporting her position that the plaintiff has failed to confer personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The Judge is seeking further information on whether Martha was prejudiced by the alleged improper service.
