And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion by Emilio Colorado to compel John Rodriguez, the plaintiff, to acknowledge partial satisfaction of a judgment. Colorado had tendered a $15,000.00 check to Rodriguez on April 3, 2023, and had demanded that Rodriguez file and deliver an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction of judgment by August 29, 2023. Rodriguez failed to respond to the demand, and Colorado filed a motion to compel Rodriguez to comply with the demand. The judge granted the motion, ordering Rodriguez to deliver an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction of judgment in the amount of $15,000.00 to Colorado within 10 days from the date of the hearing.
