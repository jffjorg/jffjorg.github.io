[1]              The motion was filed on August 2,
2023 and served via mail and email that same day on Martha only. Martha claims,
in part, that the motion was improperly served since it was not served on her
counsel. (Opp., 10:5-13). First, “[i]t is well settled that the appearance of a
party at the hearing of a motion and his or her opposition to the motion on its
merits is a waiver of any defects or irregularities in the notice of the
motion.” (Tate v. Superior Court (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 925, 930). Martha
filed a substantive opposition and has failed to articulate any prejudice.
Martha fails to provide the court with any authority supporting her position
that “Plaintiff has failed to confer personal jurisdiction to the Court over
Defendant.” (Opp., 10:!3).
