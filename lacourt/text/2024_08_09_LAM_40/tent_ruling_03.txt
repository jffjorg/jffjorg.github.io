The Court’s recitation of the Background including the Procedural History is
taken almost verbatim from the Court’s ruling on Application for Writ of
Attachment Against Defendant Sawyer.

Given the overlapping names of the parties, for ease of reference the Court
will hereafter refer to Gaelen Patrick Whittemore aka Ben Whittemore as
“Gaelen” and Sonja Domino Powell aka Domino Whittemore and aka Sonja Domino
Whittemore as “Domino.” The Court intends no disrespect by doing so. Collectively,
Gaelan and Domino are referred to as the “Whittemores.”)

first cause of action is for breach of contract, and the second cause of action
is for open book account. While the second cause of action is for open book
account, Plaintiff requests summary adjudication for an open book account and
account stated in the amount of $3,149,689.67. The Complaint alleges, “[w]ithin
the last four years, Defendant Mark Sawyer became indebted to Plaintiff Sonia
Feldman for $3,149,689.67 for an open book account for money due, and because
an account was stated in writing by and between Plaintiff and Defendant Mark
Sawyer in which it was agreed that Defendant Sawyer was indebted to Plaintiff
for $3,149,689.67.”
