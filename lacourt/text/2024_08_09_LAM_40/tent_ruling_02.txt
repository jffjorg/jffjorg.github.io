 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Sonia Feldman’s
  Motion for Summary Adjudication Against Defendant Mark Anthony Sawyer 



 
Background[1]
Plaintiff
Sonia Feldman (“Plaintiff”) commenced this action by filing her Complaint on
October 24, 2023, against Mark Sawyer dba MAS Financing (“Sawyer”), Gaelen
Patrick Whittemore aka Ben Whittemore (“Gaelen”), Sonja Domino Powell aka
Domino Whittemore and aka Sonja Domino Whittemore (“Domino”), and the DND
Family Trust (“DND”).[2] The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1)
breach of contract – both written and oral; (2) open book account and account
stated; (3) fraud; (4) conversion; (5) unjust enrichment; and (6) unfair
competition. The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows:
Gaelen,
Plaintiff’s mentor and teacher in the music industry, introduced her to Sawyer.
Gaelen and his wife Domino explained to Plaintiff that their friend Sawyer was
a “financial genius” who could help Plaintiff recover the financial losses she
had incurred from prior, dishonest individuals in the music business. Plaintiff
admits that she was naïve in trusting these individuals. She was only 23 years
old when both of her parents had passed away, leaving her with over two million
dollars in inheritance. 
The
Whittemores told Plaintiff that Sawyer could help Plaintiff regain the millions
of dollars she had lost. They asserted that Sawyer was making a fortune with
bridge loans earning interest of up to 19% over a 90-day period. Sawyer would
use Plaintiff’s money to make bridge loans that would earn high interest.
When
Plaintiff and Sawyer talked over the phone, Sawyer made the same promise as the
Whittemores. Sawyer asserted that he would take the money people like Plaintiff
invested with him, use it to make bridge loans to those in dire need of money,
and use the profits from those loans to repay the investors with interest,
ranging from 11.6% to 16% over a 90-days period, or 76% annually. Sawyer backed
the promise to repay with signed promissory notes. 
On
January 29, 2021, Plaintiff initiated a $10,000 loan to Sawyer for the purpose
of making an investment through Sawyer’s “bridge loan program.” Sawyer signed
and executed a promissory note, drafted by Domino, whereby Sawyer promised to
pay Plaintiff back within 95 days. In exchange for value received, the
promissory note provided that “on or before May 4, 2021 and without further
notice, demand, or invoice from [Plaintiff], sawyer shall pay [Plaintiff] the
fixed sum of $11,600.”
The
Whittemores has explained to Plaintiff that by “rolling the notes over and
over,” Plaintiff would be able to make back the millions she had lost. After
the January promissory note was executed, Plaintiff did not exercise her option
to have Sawyer pay her $11,600. Instead, on May 21, 2021, Plaintiff chose to
“roll it over” into a new promissory note under which Plaintiff would be repaid
$12,992 by August 26, 2021. Defendants had emphasized to Plaintiff that was how
she would make more money. 
Plaintiff
was so enraptured by Defendants that she opted to sell her home so she could
invest the $1,166,337.13 proceeds in the program. On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff
invested these proceeds with Sawyer, who signed a promissory note with the same
terms and 95-day turnaround as the January promissory note. Plaintiff chose to
roll over the $1,387,941.18 promised under this April promissory note into a
new promissory note on August 20, 2021. Under this promissory note, Sawyer
promised to pay Plaintiff $1,554,235.30 on November 20, 2021. 
Defendants
knew that Plaintiff would never see the $1,176,337.13 she had transferred to
Sawyer because they would keep convincing her to roll over the proceeds.
Plaintiff continued to invest for approximately two years. 
In
a promissory note dated February 17, 2023, Sawyer promised to repay Plaintiff
$24,740.24 on May 22, 2023. This was the last promissory note in the series of
rollovers from the $10,000 invested in January 2021. On March 10, 2023,
Plaintiff and Sawyer signed one last promissory note in which Sawyer promised
to repay $2,812,595 on June 10, 2023. 
In
the summer of 2023, Plaintiff requested repayment of $200,000. She was told
that such a sum could not be withdrawn from Sawyer’s bank account at any one
time because Sawyer had mistakenly made a deal with money-launderers. 
            After more time lapsed, and
Plaintiff had made more inquiries without avail, Plaintiff demanded to pull all
her money out of the program. Defendants did not return Plaintiff’s investment.
A demand letter was sent to Sawyer to no effect.
            Defendants have not used Plaintiff’s
money to make bridge loans. They used it for personal matters and planned to
indefinitely lie to Plaintiff about her investment funds.

Motion
Before the Court

on the first and second causes of action in her Complaint and as to each of
Sawyer’s affirmative defenses on the following grounds.
ISSUE
1: There are no triable issues as to any material fact that Defendant Sawyer
has breached the Written Agreements dated February 17, 2023 and March 10, 2023,
and as a result Plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication on the issue of breach
of written contract in her favor, as a matter of law.

Motion for Summary Adjudication 
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) In analyzing motions for summary judgment,
courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) Thus, summary judgment is granted when, after
the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all
reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741.)
Plaintiff contends she is entitled to summary adjudication on the first
two causes of action in her Complaint against Sawyer and as to each of his
affirmative defenses.[3]  
Breach of Contract
“[T]he elements of
a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of the contract,
(2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's
breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty,
LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)
Here, the
promissory note dated February 17, 2023 provides for a payment due date of May
22, 2023. (Feldman Decl., Ex. F.) The promissory noted identifies the Borrower
as “Mark A. Sawyer” and the Lender as “Sonia Feldman.” (Feldman Decl., Ex. F.)
The “Total Amount Due of Payment Due Date is $24,740.24.” (Id.) Any
portion of the $24,740.24 not paid in full shall accrue late charges at the
rate of 10% per annum until paid. (Id.) The promissory note dated March
10, 2023, provides for a payment due date on June 10, 2023. (Feldman Decl., Ex.
E.) The contract identifies the Borrower as “Mark A. Sawyer” and the Lender as
“Sonia Feldman.” (Id.) The “Total Amount Due on Payment Due Date is
$2,812,595.14.” (Id.) Any portion of the $2,812,595.14 not paid in full shall
accrue late charges at the rate of 10% per annum until paid. (Id.) As
both dates have passed and Plaintiff has not yet received payment, both
promissory notes are in breach. (Feldman Decl., ¶23.) Further, defendants
encouraged Plaintiff to keep rolling over the promissory notes, one term after
another. (Feldman Decl. ¶¶ 4, 9, 12-14, Exs. H-I.) The parties agreed that
Plaintiff is owed $3,149,689.67. (Feldman Decl. ¶¶16 – 21, 24-26, Exs. J-K;
Machat Decl. ¶¶ 14 – 23, Exs. O-U.) Sawyer has not paid Plaintiff the
$3,149,689.67. (Feldman Decl. ¶23.)
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has
satisfied her initial burden of showing there is no defense to the first cause
of action for breach of contract by proving each element of the claim. The
burden shifts to defendant to present a triable issue of material fact. Sawyer
offers no opposition to the motion and, as such, has not presented evidence to raise
a triable issue of material fact. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to entitled
to summary adjudication against Sawyer on issue #1 for breach of written
contract in the amount of $2,837,335.38 and issue #2 for breach of oral
contract in the amount of $3,149,689.67. 
Open Book Account and Account Stated
To establish an open book account claim, a
plaintiff must establish (1) that the parties had financial transactions, (2)
that plaintiff kept an account of the debits and credits involved in the
transactions, (3) that defendant owes plaintiff money on the account, and (4)
the amount of money that defendant owes plaintiff. (CACI 372.)  
 
“An account stated is ‘an agreement, based on
prior transactions between the parties, that the items of an account are true
and that the balance struck is due and owing.’” (Professional Collection Consultants
v. Lauron (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 958, 968 (quoting Maggio, Inc. v. Neal
(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 745, 752).) 
Here,
the parties had financial transactions as provided
above. Defendants kept 
book accounts of the amounts owing to each
investor of Sawyer’s bridge loan program, including the amount of money owed to
Plaintiff. (Machat Decl. ¶ 22; Ex. R.) The parties agreed that $3,149,689.67 is
owed by Sawyer to Plaintiff. (Machat Decl. ¶¶ 14 – 23, Exs. O-U; Feldman Decl.
¶¶ 16 – 21, and 24- 26, Exs. J-K.) Sawyer has not paid Plaintiff the
$3,149,689.67 due and owing. (Feldman Decl. ¶23.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has satisfied her
initial burden of showing there is no defense to the claims for open book
account and account stated. The burden
is shifted to Sawyer to provide evidence that demonstrates that a question of
fact exists with regards to any of the elements. As Sawyer presented no
opposition and no evidence, Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication against Sawyer on issue #3 on account stated and issue #4 on open
book account. 
            Affirmative
Defenses
The Court finds
that no triable issues of material fact exists as to each affirmative defense
put forth by Sawyer. Sawyer provides no evidence disputing that he owes
Plaintiff $3,149,689.67 and that he has not paid Plaintiff this amount. Sawyer’s
defenses are boilerplate or irrelevant. Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication on issue #5. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Sonia Feldman’s Motion for Summary Adjudication against
Defendant Anthony Sawyer is GRANTED.
