  Los Angeles County Office of the Assessor’s
  Demurrer with Motion to Strike

Background
Allegations
 
Plaintiff Alex
Lloyd Yufa (“Plaintiff”)— suing on behalf of rights held by Yelena V. Yufa,
owner of parcels 4465-007-032 and 4465-007-033 in Los Angeles County,
California—sues Defendants Los Angeles County Office of the Assessor (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a March 10, 2023 Complaint.
 
The initial Complaint
alleged causes of action involving (1) Violations of Revenue and Taxation Code,
(2) Improper Evaluation of Owner’s Rights, and (3) Emotional Distress. The
Complaint prayed for findings in Plaintiff’s favor as well as treble damages on
the stated claims.
 
On November 1, 2023,
Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike Plaintiff’s demand for a jury
trial from the Complaint.  On January 22,
2024, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend on the basis that
Plaintiff is not authorized to practice law and does not have standing to bring
this action on behalf of another individual. 
The Court also granted Defendant’s motion to strike on the basis that a
jury trial is not available in an action involving the collection of taxes by
the Assessor’s office.
 
On January 24,
2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
On April 16, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant Demurrer with Motion to Strike.  Plaintiff filed an Opposition on May 1, 2024,
and Defendant filed a Reply on July 29, 2024.
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Per the Assessor’s Office’s request, the Court takes
judicial of (1) a printout of a search of the State Bar records for “Alex Lloyd
Yufa,” (2) a printout of Los Angeles County Code section 4.04.010, (3) the
November 2, 2022 ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by Alex Lloyd Yufa
in LASC Action No. 22STCV27483 (the Underlying Action), and (4) the January 1,
2023 order dismissing complaint in the Underlying Action.  (Demurrer, RJN, Exs. 1-4; see Evid.
Code, §§ 452, subds. (c), (d), (h), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
Motion
A.    
Demurrer
a.     
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is a pleading that may
be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the
complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §
430.10.)  There are two types of demurrers – general demurrers and special
demurrers.  (See McKenney
v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
 
General demurrers can be used to
attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); McKenney,
167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such
demurrers can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not
considered.  (Code of Civ., Proc. §§ 430.30,
430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  The
face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence."  (Holland v.
Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
 
Special demurrers can be used to
attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract
is oral or written.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).)
 
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file
and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
When a demurrer
is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility
that the defect can be cured by amendment. 
(Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set
of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.” 
(Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the court will allow leave to
amend on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of
overcoming the issue.  (See Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of
leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on
its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in
permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect
has not been given.").)
 
b.     Meet
and Confer: Satisfied
 
Defendant’s
counsel has submitted his declaration indicating that he met and conferred by
telephone with Plaintiff to address defects in the FAC.  (Kim Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
c.      Motion
 
Defendant demurs
to the FAC on the following nine grounds:
(1)   Failure
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant;
(2)   Plaintiff’s
representation of a landowner is unauthorized practice of law in violation of
Business and Professions Code section 6125;
(3)   Plaintiff
lacks standing to sue;
(4)   Under
Government Code section 815, liability cannot attach without a statutory duty;
(5)   Plaintiff
fails to allege any statutory basis for government damages liability.;
(6)   Under
Government Code section 860.2(a), a public entity or a public employee is
immune from liability for an injury caused by instituting any administrative
proceeding or action for or incidental to the assessment or collection of a
tax;
(7)   The
cause of action seeking damages is uncertain;
(8)   The
cause of action seeking damages is ambiguous and unintelligible;
(9)   The
cause of action seeking damages cannot be maintained because a tax refund cause
of action pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code section 5140 is the
sole legal remedy for illegally assessed local taxes.
 
(Mot. pp. 3-4.)
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff has not cured any of the defects in the complaint since the
Court’s January 22, 2024, ruling sustaining Defendant’s prior demurrer.  Thus, Defendant presents the same arguments
in the instant Demurrer as those presented in the demurrer filed on November 1,
2023.
 
Plaintiff has
filed an opposition merely stating that he opposes the Demurrer and Motion to
Strike “because Plaintiff called to the Defendant.”  (Opp. p. 2.)
 
On January 22,
2024, the Court made the following ruling:
The Court has
taken notice of a printout of a State Bar of California attorney search result
for the name “Alex Lloyd Yufa,” which failed to yield an attorney licensed in
the State of California by that name. (Demurrer, RJN, Ex. 1.) There is no
opposition to dispute whether Plaintiff Yufa is licensed to practice law in the
State of California. The conclusion that Plaintiff Yufa is not licensed to
practice law in the State of California is bolstered by the Complaint’s
language, which identifies Plaintiff as a mere “representative” of Yelena V.
Yufa. (Complaint, ¶¶ 3, 6(4).) The Court thus determines that Plaintiff may not
file the Complaint as Yelena V. Yufa’s legal representative. (Bus. & Prof.
Code, § 6125.) Moreover, the face of the Complaint shows that Plaintiff Yufa
sues based on rights held by another, i.e., Yelena V. Yufa. (Complaint, ¶¶ 3,
6(4).) Plaintiff therefore lacks standing to bring this action. (PacLink,
supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 964; Campbell, supra, 237 Cal.App.4th
at p. 504.) The Assessor’s Office’s demurrer is thus SUSTAINED, with leave to
amend.
(1-22-24 Minute
Order.)
 
Having reviewed
the FAC, the Court notes that Plaintiff has not cured any of the deficiencies
that formed the basis of the Court’s prior ruling.  Plaintiff has once again filed a complaint as
a representative of another individual. Nor has Plaintiff set forth any way in
which the complaint either has been, or could be, further amended to cure the
deficiencies set forth in the demurrer. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349.)
 
Given that
Plaintiff has had a prior opportunity to amend the Complaint and has filed an
FAC with the same deficiencies, and that he has not made any showing on what
manner he could amend his complaint, the Court SUSTAINS the Demurrer without
leave to amend.
 
B.     Motion
to Strike
 
Given
the ruling on the demurrer, the Motion to Strike, although facially meritorious,
is moot. Thus, the motion is denied as moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Los
Angeles County Office of the Assessor’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike is DENIED as moot.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is dismissed.
