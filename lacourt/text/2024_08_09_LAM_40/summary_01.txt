```
"Plaintiff is not licensed to practice law in the State of California."
"The Court has taken notice of a printout of a State Bar of California attorney search result for the name 'Alex Lloyd Yufa,' which failed to yield an attorney licensed in the State of California by that name."
"The face of the Complaint shows that Plaintiff Yufa sues based on rights held by another, i.e., Yelena V. Yufa."
"Plaintiff therefore lacks standing to bring this action."
```
And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the First Amended Complaint ("FAC") and sustained the Defendant's demurrer without leave to amend. The Court also granted the Defendant's motion to strike without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Alex Lloyd Yufa, is not authorized to practice law and does not have standing to bring the action on behalf of Yelena V. Yufa. The Court finds that the FAC has the same deficiencies as the original Complaint and that the Plaintiff has not cured any of the defects. Therefore, the Demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the Motion to Strike is denied as moot. The Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is dismissed.
