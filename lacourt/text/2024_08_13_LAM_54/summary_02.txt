And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, has filed a motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued by the plaintiff, Danny J. Torrez II, seeking production of business records from IPM Tech, a pest control operator service. The records are related to the property where the plaintiff lived and allegedly suffered from bed bug infestation. The defendant argues that the subpoena is overbroad and seeks records that are not relevant to the case. The plaintiff argues that the records may show the presence of bed bugs at the property before and after he moved in, which could be relevant to his claims.

The court finds that the subpoena is sufficiently tailored to the production of relevant records and that the defendant's concerns about privacy are insufficient to justify granting the motion. The court orders that the defendant's motion to quash the deposition subpoena is denied. The parties are directed to meet and confer on a protective order to address any privacy concerns the defendant may have.
