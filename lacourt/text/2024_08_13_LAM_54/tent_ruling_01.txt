DEFENDANT
TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative,
please email the courtroom at¿SMCdept54@lacourt.org¿with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the
hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers. No opposition has been
received.  
 
            CCP
§ 473(b) provides, “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”
 
            Defendant
Perez moves to set aside and/or vacate the defaults entered on March 14, 2023,
and April 24, 2024 against Defendant and restore the case to the active
calendar. Defense Counsel, Reyes Valenzuela, declares that he failed to
calendar the deadline to file a responsive pleading before the due date of
November 27, 2024, due to his mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect. Counsel
had several trials scheduled in December 2023 and January 2024. Counsel forgot
to enter the due date in his calendar and file the answer. He also had three
trials set for May 2024, and did not review this matter until late April 2024. 
 
Defendant
Perez played no part in Counsel’s failure to calendar the deadline and file the
answer. Defendant Perez is 82 years old. He promptly provided the summons and
complaint to his attorney and communicated he had been served on October 23,
2023. 
 
The default
must be reversed under section 473. Defendant has properly attached the
responsive pleading. 
 
            The
motion is GRANTED.
