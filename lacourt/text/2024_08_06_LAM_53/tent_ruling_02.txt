  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  supplemental responses to requests for production of documents, set one
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Angela Brown          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Further Supplemental Responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One
Plaintiff Angela Brown (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion on
November 20, 2023, moving the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Smart
Resources Nursing Registry (“Defendant”) to serve further supplemental
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, numbers
9, 14, 16, 18, and 30, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,160.
On July 23, 2024, the court
issued a minute order (1) continuing the hearing on this motion to August 6,
2024, and (2) directing counsel on the attached Certificate of Mailing to give
notice of the court’s order.  (July 23,
2024 Order, p. 1.)  The Certificate of
Mailing states that the court’s July 23, 2024 order was served on counsel for
Plaintiff on that date.  (July 23, 2024
Cert. of Mailing, p. 1.)  Thus, counsel
for Plaintiff was required to serve a notice of the court’s July 23, 2024 order
on Defendant.  
Plaintiff did not file a
notice of ruling and proof of service with the court establishing that her
counsel served notice of the court’s order on Defendant.  Thus, it appears that Defendant has not been
given notice of the August 6, 2024 hearing date on Plaintiff’s motion.
The court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to ensure that
Defendant receives notice of the hearing date on Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents.   
The court notes, as addressed in its July 30, 2024 order, that on December 5,
2023, the court issued an order granting the motion to be relieved as
Defendant’s counsel filed by attorney W. Dan Lee.  The court ordered that
W. Dan Lee will be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant effective upon
the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on Defendant.  (Dec. 5, 2023
Order, MC-053, ¶ 5, subd. (a).)  On December 13, 2023, Defendant’s counsel
filed a proof of service purporting to establish service of the signed order on
Defendant.  However, the proof of service does not state that the signed
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” was served
on Defendant; instead, it describes the document that was served to be the “Proof
of Service re Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel of
Defendant Smart Resources Nursing Registry.”  (Dec. 13, 2023 Proof of
Service, p. 2:5-7 [emphasis added].)  Thus, the proof of service establishes
only that the proof of service itself was served on Defendant, and not the
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil.” 
Moreover, the “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel –
Civil” was not attached to the proof of service, such that service of the proof
of service would establish service of the court’s order on Defendant. 
(Dec. 13, 2023 Proof of Service.)  W. Dan Lee therefore has not been
relieved as counsel for Defendant. 
The court will therefore require Plaintiff to serve notice of the
court’s order continuing the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion on both (1) Defendant,
at its address of record, and (2) its attorney, W. Dan Lee.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Angela Brown’s motion to compel defendant Smart Resources Nursing
Registry’s further supplemental responses to requests for production of
documents is continued to August 20, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff Angela Brown (1) to give notice of this
ruling (i) to defendant Smart Resources Nursing Registry at its address of record, as
set forth in section 6 of the “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel – Civil” filed on December 5, 2023, and (ii) to attorney W. Dan Lee,
and (2) to file with the court a proof of service of the notice of ruling no
later than August 14, 2024.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  August 6, 2024
