And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants, Rodney Diggs, Ivie McNeill, and Wyatt Purcell & Diggs, to deem admitted the truth of certain matters specified in requests for admission served on the plaintiff, Guillermo Acosta, Jr. The defendants are also seeking monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,300. The motion was filed on June 27, 2024, and the hearing was originally set for July 23, 2024, but was continued to August 6, 2024. However, the judge notes that the defendants did not file a notice of the court's order with the court, and it appears that the plaintiff was not given notice of the hearing date. Therefore, the judge is continuing the hearing to August 27, 2024, and ordering the defendants to give notice of the hearing to the plaintiff and to file proof of service with the court.
