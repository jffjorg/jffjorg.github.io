And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further supplemental responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Angela Brown, filed the motion on November 20, 2023, and the court issued a minute order continuing the hearing to August 6, 2024. However, the court notes that the plaintiff's counsel did not file a notice of the court's order, and therefore, the defendant has not been given notice of the hearing date. As a result, the court orders the hearing to be continued to August 20, 2024, and requires the plaintiff to serve notice of the ruling on both the defendant and its counsel, W. Dan Lee. The court also notes that W. Dan Lee has not been relieved as counsel for the defendant and orders the plaintiff to file a proof of service of the notice of ruling by August 14, 2024.
