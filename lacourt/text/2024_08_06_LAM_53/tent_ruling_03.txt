  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for order deeming
  admitted truth of facts and genuineness of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Art Jr Cervera           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant 24 Hour Fitness
Motion for Order Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts and Genuineness of
Documents
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Art Jr Cervera (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) deeming admitted the truth of the matters and genuineness of the documents
specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, directed to defendant
24 Hour Fitness (“Defendant”), and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $1,000.
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order that the
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted unless the court finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served
substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that he served Defendant
with the Requests for Admission that are the subject of this motion. 
Plaintiff has asserted, in his declaration, that he served this
discovery on Defendant on December 4, 2023 “by personal service  by mail.” 
(Cervera Decl., ¶ 2.)  However, despite
stating that attached to the motion as Exhibit 2 is the proof of service, Plaintiff
has not filed a proof of service in support of that assertion.  (Mot., p. 7.) 
Instead, Plaintiff has merely filed copies of Requests for Admission,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production directed to (but not
served on) Defendant.  (Mot., pp. 10-23.)  Similarly, although Plaintiff represents in
his reply papers that a “[p]roof of service for these discovery requests is
attached hereto as Exhibit B[,]” Plaintiff did not attach a proof of service
establishing that he served Defendant with the subject Requests for Admission.  (Reply, p. 3:1-4.)  Further, Defendant has presented evidence
establishing that it was never served with the Requests for Admission.  (Malloy Decl., ¶ 4 [“after a reasonable and
diligent search of its records, Defendant’s counsel has concluded it never
received the allegedly propounded discovery”].) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show
that he properly served Defendant with his Requests for Admission, Set One, and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Art Jr
Cervera’s motion for order deeming admitted truth of facts and genuineness of
documents. 
            The court orders defendant 24 Hour Fitness
to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
