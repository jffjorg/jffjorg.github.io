And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment motion granted in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff had argued that the court failed to consider her responses to the defendants' requests for admission, which were served on January 31, 2023. However, the court found that the plaintiff's motion was untimely and that the responses to the requests for admission were irrelevant to the summary judgment motion. The court also rejected the plaintiff's claims that she never received the defendants' requests for admission and that she eventually provided responses before leaving the country. The court concluded that the motion for reconsideration was denied.
