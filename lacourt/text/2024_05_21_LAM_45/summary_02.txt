And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a "lemon law" case between Jeff Steven Eustice (the Plaintiff) and American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (the Defendant). The Plaintiff initiated the lawsuit on June 7, 2023, alleging various defects in his 2022 Honda Accord 4D. The Defendant failed to respond to the Plaintiff's correspondence regarding the deposition of its Person Most Qualified (PMQ). The court granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the Defendant's PMQ, which shall take place at a date and time to be set by the court. The court also found that the Plaintiff satisfied the requirements for the motion and that the Defendant's objections were improper.
