Demurrer to Complaint
 
The court CONTINUES the hearing for Defendants’ demurrer to ­­­­­­­­__________,
at 8:30 a.m., in Department 45 to provide Defendants an opportunity to comply
with the meet-and-confer requirements of CCP § 430.41. The court orders
Defendants to file a meet-and-confer declaration that complies with the
requirements of CCP § 430.41 no later than seven court days prior to the
continued hearing date.
Discussion
On July
14, 2023, defendants State Farm General Insurance Company and Aaron Vuong
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed a demurrer to the Complaint, filed by
plaintiffs Hew Quon, M.D., Wanda Quon, D.O., David Quon, M.D., Mathew
Quon-Chow, and Victoria Quon-Chow (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). 
CCP §
430.41(a) states, in relevant part: “Before filing a demurrer . . . the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” 
CCP §
430.41(a)(2) states, in relevant part: “The parties shall meet and confer at
least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties
are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the
responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic
30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing
and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a
declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet
and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet
and confer.” 
CCP §
430.41(a)(3) provides: “The demurring party shall file and serve with the
demurrer a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which
the demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading
subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving
the objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party who filed the
pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request
of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.”
The court finds Defendants fail to establish that they complied
with the meet-and-confer requirements under CCP § 430.41. Defendants’ counsel’s declaration does not establish that
the parties met and conferred in person or by telephone as required under CCP §
430.41(a).
The
court therefore CONTINUES the hearing for Defendants’ demurrer to the date and
time set forth above in Department 45 to provide Defendants an opportunity to
comply with the meet-and-confer requirements of CCP § 430.41. The court orders
Defendants to file meet-and-confer declarations that comply with the
requirements of CCP § 430.41 no later than seven court days prior to the
continued hearing date. 
It is so ordered.
