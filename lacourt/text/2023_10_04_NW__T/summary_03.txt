And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions and arguments presented by the parties and has made a tentative ruling. The court finds that the parties are in violation of the Final Status Conference order and orders compliance with that order. The court also grants certain motions to exclude evidence and arguments, including those related to how the jurors might feel if they owned the vehicle at issue, references to other owners, and discussions of damages that are not recoverable under the plaintiff's complaint. The court also excludes evidence of design defects and the absence of the corporate representative at trial. The court will hear argument on certain issues, including the definition of "lemon law" and the calculation of attorney fees. The court orders the parties to follow the law and will not allow the use of the phrase "lemon law" or "lemon" without proper definition. The court will discuss these issues further at the next hearing.
