And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a Final Status Conference (FSC) on October 4, 2023, due to the parties' failure to comply with the court's FSC order on March 24, 2023. The parties are in violation of the order, and no trial documents have been filed. The Judge is inclined to continue the FSC to October 11, 2023, the date of trial, rather than start trial that day. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff filed a motion to compel on October 24, 2023, two weeks after the trial date, and has not attempted to advance the hearing on the motion.

The Judge grants the defendant's motion to the extent that the plaintiff may not refer to, argue, or discuss how the jurors would feel if the vehicle at issue belonged to them, including in voir dire, opening statement, and closing argument. The Judge also grants the motion to the extent that the plaintiff may not introduce, refer, or mention evidence of issues they did not experience.

The Judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel and orders the parties to follow the law. The Judge notes that it is unclear what the motion requests and that the parties are entitled to present their theory of the case. The Judge will hear argument on this issue.

The Judge also addresses several other issues, including the exclusion of non-party witnesses, the definition of "lemon law" for the jury, and the use of slang terms in jury instructions. The Judge is concerned that the jury may misinterpret the meaning of "lemon law" without a proper definition and will not allow the use of the phrase "lemon law" or "lemon" in the trial. The Judge will discuss this issue with counsel and consider an instruction on how attorneys' fees are calculated by the court.
