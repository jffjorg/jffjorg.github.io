 Case Number:  23VECP00410    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECP00410 Swift v Recovery
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC as Servicing Agent of WebBank’s Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED. 

Introduction 
Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC as Servicing Agent of
WebBank (Petitioner) moved to confirm the March 7, 2023 arbitration award of
$90,641.50 against Respondents Recovery Advocates, LLC, and Stuart Birnbaum
(collectively, Respondents).             
Discussion  
Petitioner submitted a copy of the arbitration award levied
against Respondents that was entered on March 7, 2023.  Unless a petition or response seeking to
correct or vacate an arbitration award was filed properly based upon valid
grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts are required to enter judgment
in conformity with the award.  (Code of
Civ. Proc. sec. 1286; Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)  Because
Respondents did not file a separate petition to correct or vacate and did not
file a response/opposition to the instant Petition despite sufficient notice
and opportunity to be heard, the Petition is persuasive.  
The Petition to Confirm the Award is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
