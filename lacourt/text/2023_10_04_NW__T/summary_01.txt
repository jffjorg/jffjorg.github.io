Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Cross-Defendant Karen Dr LLC's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third, fifth through eighth, and tenth causes of action, and denies it as to the sixteenth and seventeenth causes of action. The judge also grants Cross-Defendant Karen Dr LLC's request for judicial notice as to all exhibits, but only as to the existence of the documents and not as to any hearsay or facts in dispute. The judge denies Cross-Complainant Richard Khatibi's request for judicial notice as to exhibits 2-6.

The judge also grants Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ebrahim Khatibi's request for judicial notice as to the existence of the documents, but only as to the existence of the documents and not as to any hearsay or facts in dispute.

The judge denies Cross-Complainants Faezeh Afchehe and Melica Khatibi's request for leave to file a fourth amended cross-complaint made in their opposition.

The judge consolidates the instant action with Richard Khatibi, Faezeh Afchehe, Melica Khatibi v. Ebrahim Khatibi, Shabnam Akhoundzadeh, pending case No. 23STCV13564 (New Action).

The judge's ruling is based on the pleadings and the parties' arguments, and is subject to change based on further evidence and argument.
