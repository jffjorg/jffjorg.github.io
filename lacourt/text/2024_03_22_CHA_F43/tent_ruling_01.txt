SUMMARY OF ACTION 
In February 2022, Plaintiff Wvistano Daniel Perez
(Plaintiff) took out a mortgage for the subject property in the amount of
$2,000,000.00. In late 2022, Plaintiff defaulted on the loan and contacted Defendant
FCI to explore his loss mitigation options. Plaintiff alleges that FCI informed
him that the loan was due, and he could either pay the defaulted amount or sell
the property. On January 20, 2023, Defendants recorded a notice of Default
against the property. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to assess
Plaintiff’s finances prior to recording the Notice of Default on the property. Plaintiff
also alleges that Defendants did not call him or otherwise attempt to contact
him regarding non-foreclosure options. Therefore, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants are in violation of Civ. Code §§ 2923.5 and 2923.7.
 
Though not mentioned in Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint, Plaintiff himself sold the property on June 22, 2023.
 
ANALYSIS
Request for Judicial Notice: Defendants have requested that
the Court take judicial notice of several recorded deeds showing the chain of
title of the subject property. The Court grants this request.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Entire Complaint; First and Second Causes of Action
One of the deeds that Defendants requested the Court take
judicial notice of is a grant deed conveying the subject property from
Plaintiff to Ying Gu on June 22, 2023. (RJN, Ex. 6.) Defendants argue in their
demurrer that this conveyance of the property from Plaintiff to Ying Gu moots
Plaintiff’s complaint. 
 
Section 2923.5 of the Civil Code requires the lender to
contact the borrower, before a notice of default is filed, in person or by
phone to “assess” the borrower’s financial situation and to “explore” options
to prevent foreclosure. (Civ. Code § 2923.5, subd. (a)(1) & (2).) Section
2923.7 involves establishing a single point of contact with the mortgage
servicer when a borrower requests a foreclosure prevention alternative. The
remedies for violations of these sections involve postponement of foreclosure
or enjoinment of the foreclosure. 
 
Civ. Code § 2924.12 sets forth the remedies available to a
party under Civ. Code §§ 2923 et seq. and distinguishes between pre-foreclosure
(injunction only) and post-foreclosure (economic damages). “For “material
violation” of any one of a list of nine statutory provisions within its scheme,
[Civ. Code § 2924.12] authorizes preforeclosure injunctive relief (§ 2924.12,
subd. (a)(1); § 2924.19, subd. (a)(1)); postforeclosure claims for “actual
economic damages pursuant to Section 3281” (§ 2924.12, subd. (b); § 2924.19,
subd. (b))6; the greater of trebled damages or $50,000 where the violation was
“intentional or reckless” or “resulted from willful misconduct” (§ 2924.12,
subd. (b); § 2924.19, subd. (b)); and attorney fees and costs as a reward to
prevailing claimants (§ 2924.12, subd. (h); § 2924.19, subd. (h)).” (Morris
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279, 295; see also Cardenas
v. Caliber Home Loans, Inc. (N.D.Cal.2017) 281 F.Supp.3d 862; Shupe v.
Nationstar Mortgage LLC (E.D.Cal.2017) 231 F.Supp.3d 597.)
 
In this case, there is no foreclosure to postpone or enjoin.
Plaintiff sold the property, so the mortgage no longer exists. Therefore, no
remedies are available to him through Civ. Code §§ 2923.5 or 2923.7. The
demurrer is sustained for the First and Second Causes of Action without leave
to amend because there is no longer a mortgage.
 
Plaintiff also mentions dual tracking in both his opposition
and supplemental opposition. This practice is forbidden by Civ. Code § 2923.6. Dual
tracking is “a practice that, described broadly, occurs when a lender or
servicer pursues foreclosure while simultaneously going through the motions of
reviewing a borrower’s application for foreclosure mitigation, without a good
faith intent to entertain the application.” (Morris, 78 Cal.App.5th at 296.)
However, nowhere in Plaintiff’s complaint does he mention dual tracking or the
fact that he sold the property. Bringing it up in his opposition does not affect
the sufficiency of his pleadings. The dual tracking argument also contradicts
Plaintiff’s pleadings, which allege that Defendants did not comply with the
law, contact Plaintiff, or discuss his options. (FAC, ¶ 33.) These allegations
clearly do not follow dual tracking, which involves a servicer reviewing a
borrower’s application for foreclosure mitigation. According to Plaintiff’s
complaint, that review and mitigation never happened. Therefore, the Court
finds Plaintiff’s arguments regarding dual tracking to be without merit.
 
Furthermore, there would be no declaratory relief available
for the Third Cause of Action because the property was sold. However, as
discussed below, the Third Cause of Action fails for other reasons as well, as
does the Fourth Cause of Action.
 
Third and Fourth Causes of Action
For the Third Cause of Action, declaratory relief is not
considered to be a viable cause of action in California. (Batt v. City and
County of San Francisco (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 65, 82 (declaratory relief
is not an independent cause of action, but a form of equitable relief); Ball
v. FleetBoston Financial Corp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800 (A dismissal
of a claim for declaratory relief is proper where that claim is wholly
derivative of other non-viable causes of action).)
 
In this case, Plaintiff’s cause of action for declaratory
relief is derivative of his First and Second Causes of Action, which fail
because there is no mortgage to postpone or enjoin, so it could not be a
standalone cause of action. Plaintiff also cannot receive declaratory relief
for a mortgage that no longer exists. For these reasons, Defendants’ demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
For the Fourth Cause of Action, Business and Professions
Code § 17200 prohibits any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts or
practices and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. (Puentes
v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 638, 643-644.) “A
plaintiff alleging unfair business practices under these statutes must state
with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of
the violation.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)
 
Plaintiff has not alleged with particularity facts
demonstrating that Defendant violated Section 17200. Furthermore, because
Plaintiff sold the property, Plaintiff has not alleged facts demonstrating any
ongoing injury. He sold the property, so he is no longer “subject to subsequent
foreclosure and eviction.” (FAC, ¶ 69.) Therefore, Defendants’ demurrer to this
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend to give Plaintiff the
opportunity to plead this cause of action with particularity.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s First through Third
Causes of Action is sustained without leave to amend. Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Fourth Cause of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff is given 20 days to file an amended complaint.
