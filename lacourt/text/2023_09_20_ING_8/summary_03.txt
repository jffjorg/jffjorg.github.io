## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by the Defendants. The Court found that the Defendants' 25-page memorandum exceeded the 15-page limit set by California Rule of Court 3.1113(d).  

The Court also noted that combining a Demurrer and Motion to Strike into a single motion did not justify exceeding the page limit.  The Judge will allow the Defendants to argue for continuing the motion to allow them to file compliant documents. The hearing will allow oral argument on whether to continue the motion, but the Court will not consider the motion's merits due to the procedural violation.
