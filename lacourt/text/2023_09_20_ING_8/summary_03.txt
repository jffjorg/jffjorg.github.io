And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by the Defendants, Orlando Scandrick, Wanda Scandrick, and Trena Scandrick (also known as Trena S. Norwood). The motion is a combination of a demurrer and a motion to strike, which exceeds the 15-page limit set by the California Rule of Court 3.1113(d). The Judge has decided to continue the motion to allow the Defendants to file revised moving papers that comply with the rule. The Judge has not considered the merits of the motion and will not take oral argument on the motion's merits at the scheduled hearing on September 20, 2023. The Judge has also allowed oral argument from the Defendants on the prospect of continuing the motion as it is procedurally defective.
