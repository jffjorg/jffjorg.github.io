## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by the Defendants. The Court found that the Defendants' 25-page memorandum exceeded the 15-page limit set by California Rule of Court 3.1113(d).  

The Court also noted that combining a Demurrer and Motion to Strike into a single motion did not justify exceeding the page limit.  The Judge will allow the Defendants to argue for continuing the motion to allow them to file compliant documents. The hearing will allow oral argument on whether to continue the motion, but the Court will not consider the motion's merits due to the procedural violation.

**Case Number:** 23TRCV01129

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Parties:**

- Plaintiffs: Latanya Scandrick, as Executor of Estate of Henry Lee Scandrick, Latanya Scandrick, Christopher Scandrick, Paul Scandrick, and Sherman Scandrick
- Defendants: Orlando Scandrick, Wanda Scandrick, Trena Scandrick aka Trena S. Norwood

**Motion:** Demurrer and Motion to Strike

**Tentative Rulings:**

- Defendant’s Demurrer is continued
- Defendant’s Motion to Strike is continued

**Summary:**

The tentative ruling addresses a hearing for case 23TRCV01129, Latanya Scandrick, et al. v. Orlando Scandrick, et al. The hearing, scheduled for September 20, 2023, involves the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike, which have both been continued.

The court raises an issue with the defendants' moving papers, which exceed the 15-page limit imposed by California Rule of Court 3.1113(d). The court has not considered the merits of the motion due to this violation and will only allow oral argument regarding the possibility of continuing the motion to allow for compliant moving papers.

No authority was found to support combining a demurrer and motion to strike into a single motion, which led to the excess pages. The court will allow oral argument from the defendants regarding the continuance of the procedurally defective motion.
