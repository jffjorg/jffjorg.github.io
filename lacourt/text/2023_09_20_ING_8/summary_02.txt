Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is subject to change based on oral argument and further consideration. The City of Gardena has filed a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC), arguing that the first and second causes of action fail to state a cause of action for general negligence and negligent supervision, respectively. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that the SAC adequately alleges a cause of action for general negligence against the City. However, the Court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, finding that the SAC fails to adequately plead the necessary elements of negligent supervision. The Court will allow oral argument to discuss whether the Plaintiff believes they can further amend their pleading to allege sufficient facts to support the second cause of action.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case where a woman, Ingrid Majorie Lockwood, claims she was injured by a City of Gardena transit bus driver who failed to lower the ramp for her. 

The City argued that the lawsuit didn't adequately state a cause of action for either general negligence or negligent supervision.

The Judge agreed with the City on the negligent supervision claim, stating that the lawsuit doesn't provide enough details about the driver's alleged training, his supposed unfitness, and the City's knowledge of any issues. 

However, the Judge ruled against the City on the general negligence claim, finding the lawsuit sufficient at this early stage. 

The Plaintiff will have an opportunity to argue why they should be allowed to amend their lawsuit to address the deficiencies in the negligent supervision claim.

Here is the YAML summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 22TRCV01555
* Hearing Date: September 20, 2023
* Department: 8
* Case Name: Ingrid Majorie Lockwood v. City of Gardena, et al.

**Parties**

* Moving Party: Defendant, City of Gardena
* Responding Party: Plaintiff, Ingrid Majorie Lockwood

**Motions**

* (1) Demurrer (sustained as to the second cause of action, overruled as to the first cause of action)

**Background**

* On December 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants, City of Gardena, GTrans, LLC, and DOES 1 through 50.
* After the Court sustained the City's Demurrer to the original Complaint, on July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging causes of action for: (1) General Negligence; and (2) Negligent Supervision, Hiring, or Retention.

**Analysis**

* The City demurs to the SAC on the grounds that:
	+ Plaintiff's First Cause of Action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for "general negligence" against Defendant and/or is uncertain because it fails to plead specific factual allegations to establish any breach of duty on the part of City.
	+ Plaintiff's Second cause of action for negligent supervision, hiring, and retention fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against City, is duplicative of the first cause of action, and/or is uncertain as it fails to plead specific factual allegations to establish any breach of duty on the part of City.

**Ruling**

* The Court overrules the demurrer as to the first cause of action, but sustains it as to the second cause of action.
* Leave to amend to be discussed orally.

**Significant Statements**

* "To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged." (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
* "Public entities cannot be liable for common law theories of general negligence." (Miklosy v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899.)
* "Ordinarily, negligence may be pleaded in general terms and the plaintiff need not specify the precise act or omission alleged to constitute the breach of duty. [Citation]. However, because under the Tort Claims Act all governmental tort liability is based on statute, the general rule that statutory causes of action must be pleaded with particularity is applicable." (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.)

## Case Summary:  Ingrid Majorie Lockwood v. City of Gardena

**Case Number:** 22TRCV01555

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Ingrid Majorie Lockwood
* **Defendant:** City of Gardena, GTrans, LLC, and DOES 1 through 50

**Subject:** Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint (SAC)

**Background:**

* Plaintiff alleges she was injured when a bus driver, Defendant Doe 1, failed to lower the ramp for her as she boarded the bus.
* Plaintiff filed a SAC alleging two causes of action: (1) General Negligence and (2) Negligent Supervision, Hiring, or Retention.
* Defendant City filed a demurrer challenging both causes of action.

**Arguments:**

* **City:**
    * Plaintiff's first cause of action lacks specific factual allegations to establish a breach of duty by the City.  
    * Plaintiff's second cause of action is duplicative of the first and fails to allege sufficient facts to establish negligent supervision.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **First Cause of Action (General Negligence):**  OVERRULED. The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim against the City at this stage, even though the City argues that common law negligence does not apply to public entities. The Court notes that Plaintiff has also alleged statutory liability based on California Government Code § 820(a).
* **Second Cause of Action (Negligent Supervision):** SUSTAINED. The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to establish a claim for negligent supervision. The Court requires Plaintiff to provide more specific details about the alleged protocol for lowering the ramp, the City's training of Doe 1, and how Doe 1 was unfit or posed a risk to Plaintiff.

**Next Steps:**

* The Court will allow oral argument on whether Plaintiff can amend their pleading to adequately address the deficiencies in the second cause of action.



**Significant Statements:**

*  "Public entities cannot be liable for common law theories of general negligence."
* "To state a cause of action against a public entity, every fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity."
*  Plaintiff's allegations regarding the City's breach of duty are currently sufficient to overcome a demurrer.
* Plaintiff needs to provide more specific factual allegations to support their claim for negligent supervision.
