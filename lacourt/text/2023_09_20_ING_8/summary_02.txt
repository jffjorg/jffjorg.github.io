Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is subject to change based on oral argument and further consideration. The City of Gardena has filed a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC), arguing that the first and second causes of action fail to state a cause of action for general negligence and negligent supervision, respectively. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that the SAC adequately alleges a cause of action for general negligence against the City. However, the Court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, finding that the SAC fails to adequately plead the necessary elements of negligent supervision. The Court will allow oral argument to discuss whether the Plaintiff believes they can further amend their pleading to allege sufficient facts to support the second cause of action.
