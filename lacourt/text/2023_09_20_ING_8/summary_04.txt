The Court has ruled on Defendant Visser's Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and his Request for Sanctions. The motion is GRANTED, and the Court orders Plaintiff to provide a Code-compliant and verified written response within 15 days. The Court also orders monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000 payable within 30 days. The ruling is based on the Court's review of the requests, responses, Separate Statements of the parties, and the reasoning for further responses or why they should be denied. The Court finds that Plaintiff's responses to Requests Nos. 6, 7, and 11 are insufficient and that Defendant Visser has shown good cause for the requests. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has not provided a Code-compliant response and has failed to provide a privilege log.
