The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of their thoughts based on the information presented to them before the hearing. The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents and request for sanctions in the lowered amount of $1,000. The Judge has reviewed the background of the case, including the filing of a Complaint for unlawful detainer, the propounding of discovery by the Defendant, and the responses provided by the Plaintiff. The Judge has also considered the meet and confer efforts made by the Defendant and the Plaintiff's arguments regarding the good faith of those efforts. The Judge has applied the legal standard for discovery purposes and has determined that the Defendant has shown good cause for the requests for production. The burden is now on the Plaintiff to justify their objections. The Judge has limited the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Judge has granted the motion to compel and has ordered the Plaintiff to provide a Code-compliant and verified written response within 15 days. Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but the Court has found that a reasonable attorney's fee and thus monetary sanctions is $1,000, given their experience in judging hundreds of unlawful detainer cases. The ordered monetary sanctions are payable within 30 days by plaintiff’s counsel to defense counsel.

**Plaintiff:** Evelyn J. Ko

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Trial Date:** October 16, 2023

**Motion:** (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One; (2) Request for Sanctions

---

On August 2, 2023, Evelyn J. Ko filed a Complaint for unlawful detainer against Luke Koster Visser and others. Visser propounded discovery to Ko on August 14, 2023, with responses provided on August 23, 2023. Despite several meet and confer attempts by Visser's counsel, Ko's counsel did not address all deficiencies and claimed that the Code requires a meet and confer to be done through letter or in person.

Visser then filed a Motion to Compel on September 5, 2023, which was granted in part by the Court. The Court ordered Ko to provide a Code-compliant and verified written response within 15 days regarding Requests Nos. 6, 7, and 11, overruling most objections except for the privacy objection. Ko must include a statement of compliance and a privilege log for any withheld documents based on privilege.

Sanctions of $1,000 are mandatory against Ko and her counsel, payable within 30 days to defense counsel, for unsuccessfully opposing the motion to compel.
