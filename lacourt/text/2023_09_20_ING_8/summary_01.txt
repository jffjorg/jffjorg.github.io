And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Robert Bass, et al v. Tim Roth, case number 21TRCV00594. The defendant, Tim Roth, has filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint (TAC) and a motion to strike. The judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike.

The judge found that the new allegations added to the TAC do not create pleading defects subject to demurrer or motion to strike. The TAC alleges a breach of contract, specifically an oral contract allegedly agreed upon on November 21, 2018, requiring Roth to pay $87,500 plus interest within one year. The judge accepted this allegation as true and found that the statute of limitations applies. The action for breach of contract was filed within two years of the breach date, making it timely.

The judge granted the defense's request for judicial notice of the prior pleadings, but found that the TAC is sufficient to survive demurrer. The judge also invited oral argument on the "sham pleading" rule, which was not briefed by the parties.

The judge ordered the defendant to answer the TAC within 30 days.
