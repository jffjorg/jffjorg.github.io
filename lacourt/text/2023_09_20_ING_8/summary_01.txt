And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Robert Bass, et al v. Tim Roth, case number 21TRCV00594. The defendant, Tim Roth, has filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint (TAC) and a motion to strike. The judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike.

The judge found that the new allegations added to the TAC do not create pleading defects subject to demurrer or motion to strike. The TAC alleges a breach of contract, specifically an oral contract allegedly agreed upon on November 21, 2018, requiring Roth to pay $87,500 plus interest within one year. The judge accepted this allegation as true and found that the statute of limitations applies. The action for breach of contract was filed within two years of the breach date, making it timely.

The judge granted the defense's request for judicial notice of the prior pleadings, but found that the TAC is sufficient to survive demurrer. The judge also invited oral argument on the "sham pleading" rule, which was not briefed by the parties.

The judge ordered the defendant to answer the TAC within 30 days.

English text:
The tentative ruling for the hearing on September 20, 2023 in Dept 8 for the case 21TRCV00594, Robert Bass, et al v. Tim Roth, concerns the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Timothy R. Roth, against the plaintiffs, Robert Bass and Jeanette Bass. The court overrules the demurrer and denies the motion to strike. The court had previously overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike as to the Second Cause of Action from the second amended complaint. The new allegations added to the second cause of action in the third amended complaint do not create pleading defects subject to demurrer or motion to strike. As to the first cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff alleges a new oral contract was agreed upon on November 21, 2018 requiring Roth to pay $87,500 plus interest within one year. Accepting that allegation as true, the contract would be fully performed or would be breached on or before November 20, 2019, i.e., “within one year.” An action for breach of that oral contract must have been filed within two years of that date to satisfy the statute of limitations. Because this suit was so filed before November of 2021, it was timely filed within the two-year statute of limitations. The court grants the defense Request for Judicial Notice as to the prior pleadings. The court will invite oral argument on the “sham pleading” rule which is not briefed but is inferred by Defendant’s argument. Defendant is to answer the TAC within 30 days.

The court has previously denied similar motions, and the new allegations in the third amended complaint do not create pleading defects subject to demurrer or motion to strike. Specifically, the court finds that the third amended complaint adequately alleges a breach of contract claim, including an oral contract allegedly agreed upon on November 21, 2018, requiring the defendant to pay $87,500 plus interest within one year.

**Case Summary**

*Case Number*: 21TRCV00594

*Hearing Date*: September 20, 2023

*Case Name*: Robert Bass, et al v. Tim Roth

*Parties*:
- Plaintiffs: Robert Bass and Jeanette Bass
- Defendant: Timothy R. Roth

*Motion*: (1) Demurrer to Third Amended Complaint, (2) Motion to Strike

*Tentative Rulings*:
- Defendant’s Demurrer is overruled
- Defendant’s Motion to Strike is denied

In this tentative ruling, the Court addresses the Defendant's Demurrer and Motion to Strike regarding the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint (TAC) in the case between Robert Bass and Jeanette Bass against Timothy R. Roth.

The Court has previously overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike as to the Second Cause of Action from the second amended complaint. The new allegations added to the second cause of action in the TAC do not create pleading defects subject to demurrer or motion to strike.

As for the first cause of action for breach of contract, the TAC alleges a new oral contract was agreed upon on November 21, 2018, requiring Roth to pay $87,500 plus interest within one year. Considering this allegation as true, the contract would either be fully performed or breached by November 20, 2019. An action for breach of that oral contract must be filed within two years of that date to satisfy the statute of limitations. Since the suit was filed before November 2021, it was timely filed within the two-year statute of limitations.

The Court grants the defense Request for Judicial Notice as to the prior pleadings but emphasizes that the third amendment is before the Court and survives the attack of a statute of limitations defense at the pleading stage. The TAC is not vague, ambiguous, or unintelligible, providing fair notice to Roth about the breach of an oral contract allegation. Whether Plaintiff can prove there was any such promise remains for discovery and trial.

The Court will invite oral argument on the “sham pleading” rule, which is inferred by Defendant’s argument but not explicitly briefed.

Defendant is to answer the TAC within 30 days.
