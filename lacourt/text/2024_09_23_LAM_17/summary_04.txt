And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The California Department of Education (CDE) has filed a motion for attorney fees and costs related to its suit against Golden Day Schools, Inc. and Clark Parker. The motion is unopposed, and the court grants the motion. CDE is awarded $1,517,311.25 in attorney fees and $34,781.94 in costs. The fees and costs are related to the OAH proceedings, Superior Court actions, and bankruptcies. The court uses the lodestar method to determine the reasonable attorney fees, which are based on an objective standard of reasonableness. The implied rate for the services is less than $200 per hour, which is far below the market rate. The court finds that CDE is entitled to recover its attorney fees and costs under Civil Code section 1717 and California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 18038.
