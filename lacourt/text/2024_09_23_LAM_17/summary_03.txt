And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, Aladdin Dinaali, filed a lawsuit against Interlaced Social LLC, Augustin Pulido, and Kenneth Barlow, alleging various claims including breach of contract, unfair business practices, and fraud. The plaintiff argued that the defendants are conducting business in California without proper registration and that Doublelist, a dating site owned by Interlaced Social, is running a prostitution operation. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support these claims and failed to cite legal authority to support the motion. As a result, the judge has no legal authority to grant an injunction and has denied the motion. The judge urges the plaintiff to consult with an attorney to pursue their claims.
