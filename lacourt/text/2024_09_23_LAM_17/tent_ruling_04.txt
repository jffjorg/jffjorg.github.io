 Hearing
  Date:  September 23, 2024



 
 
            Plaintiff
CDE’s motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED. Plaintiff is awarded
$1,517,311.25 in attorney fees, and $34,781.94 in costs. 
 
On 5/4/2018, Plaintiff California Department of Education
(Plaintiff) filed suit against Golden Day Schools, Inc. and Clark Parker,
alleging breach of contract and declaratory judgment. 
 
            Now,
CDE seeks $1,517,311.25 in attorney fees, and $34,781.94 in costs, pursuant to
Civil Code section 1717. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The party
claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the
reasonableness of the fees claimed.  (Civic Western Corporation v. Zila
Industries, Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) “Except as attorney’s fees
are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation
of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or
implied, of the parties[.]” (CCP § 1021.)
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”  (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) 
In exercising its discretion, the court should
consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the
attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (Id.)

 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their learning,
their age, and their experience in the particular type of work demanded the intricacies
and importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for skilled legal
training and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed. (Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d
647, 657.) 
 
In
determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar
method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing parties
are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues.  A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the
award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
635 (Serrano IV); see also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable
attorney fees should be based on an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e.,
the market value of services rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise.  (Id. at 1096.)  The trial
court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to,
or without the necessity for, expert testimony. 
(Id.)  The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Id.)
 
Discussion 
 
            CDE
seeks $1,517,311.25 in attorney fees, and $34,781.94 in costs, pursuant to
Civil Code section 1717. 
 
            Here,
the relevant contracts on which the Department has sued Golden Day and the
Parkers all incorporate “Standard Terms and Conditions.” (Heyn Decl. ¶ 12.) The
Standard Terms and Conditions provide, “The CDE shall recoup any payments made
for costs which were not reasonable and necessary. The amount that is recouped
shall be the excess payment over the reasonable or fair market value, or one
hundred percent (100%) of the cost, if the cost was not necessary. The CDE may
elect to recover any costs of recoupment, including collection services or
attorney fees.” (App., Ex. 1, at p. 31, § V.I.)
 
            California
Code of Regulations, title 5, section 18038, provides:
 
(a)  
The State Department of Education shall
recoup any payments made for costs which were not reasonable and necessary. The
amount that is recouped shall be the excess payment over the reasonable or fair
market value, or one hundred percent (100%) of the cost, if the cost was not
necessary.
 
(b)  The
State Department of Education may elect to recover any costs of recoupment,
including collection services or attorney fees.
 
As prevailing
party under the childcare contracts and under section 18038, the Department is
entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees. Notably, CDE is not seeking attorney
fees related to the audit. Rather all fees and costs cost relate to the OAH
proceedings to contest the audit, these consolidated actions, and the three
bankruptcies that Golden Day and Parker filed:

            The
implied rate for these services is less than $200 per hour. This is far below
the market rate of the services of the attorneys who worked on these matters.
(Heyn Decl. ¶ 25.)
 
            Defendants
did not oppose this motion, and thus are considered to have conceded to the
merits of the motion.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff CDE’s motion for attorney fees and costs is
granted. Plaintiff is awarded $1,517,311.25 in attorney fees, and $34,781.94 in
costs. 
It is so ordered.
