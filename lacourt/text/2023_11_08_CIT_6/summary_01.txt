Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of summons as to Defendant Jinghan Zhang is granted. This means that the service of the Summons and Complaint on Defendant Jinghan Zhang is hereby quashed. The plaintiff must serve the First Amended Complaint on Defendant Jinghan Zhang in the same lawful manner authorized for service of the original Complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the address where substitute service was attempted was Defendant Jinghan Zhang's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address. The court also notes that Plaintiff has been provided with Defendant Jinghan Zhang's physical address in China in response to Plaintiff's discovery request. The court concludes that policy favors personal service where available, and therefore Plaintiff should serve Jinghan at the address that has been provided.
