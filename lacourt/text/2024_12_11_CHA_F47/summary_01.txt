And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion filed by attorney David K. Dorenfeld to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte. The motion was filed on November 12, 2024, and was originally set for hearing on April 21, 2025. However, the court granted an ex parte application to advance the hearing date to December 11, 2024. The judge notes that the declaration filed in support of the motion lacks confirmation of how the mailing and email addresses for the plaintiff were confirmed, which is a requirement under California court rules. Despite this, the plaintiff has not opposed or responded to the motion. As a result, the judge has placed the motion off calendar.
