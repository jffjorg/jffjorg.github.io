Case #21CHCV00940
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 11/12/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: David K. Dorenfeld, DorenfeldLaw, Inc.
CLIENT: Plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving David K. Dorenfeld,
DorenfeldLaw, Inc. as counsel for Plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte in this case.
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 11/12/24, attorney David K. Dorenfeld of DorenfeldLaw,
Inc. (Counsel) filed and served the instant motion to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte in this action.  The original hearing date listed on the papers
is 4/21/25.  On 11/14/24, the Court
granted Counsel’s ex parte application to advance the hearing date on the
motion and the motion set for hearing on 12/11/24.  (See 11/14/24 Minute Order).  On 11/14/24, Counsel filed and served a
Notice of Ruling regarding the ex parte application.   
 
The proofs of service for the motion papers and notice of
ruling indicate that the documents were served on Plaintiff by mail and
electronic service.  However, the
declaration filed in support of the motion fails to explain how the mailing and
email addresses for Plaintiff were confirmed. 
The declaration indicates that the attorney confirmed that the address
was current within the past 30 days “by other means,” but fails to specify
those other means as required in number 3.b.(1)(d) of Judicial Council Form
MC-052.  Such confirmation is especially
important considering counsel indicates that despite numerous attempts to
contact Plaintiff via phone and email, no response has been received.  (See Declaration, No.2).
 
Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise responded to the
motion to cure this defect in notice.
