The Defendant demurred to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, arguing that certain causes of action were insufficiently pleaded. The judge sustained the demurrer as to the first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, but overruled it as to the second and ninth causes of action. The judge gave the Plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the First Amended Complaint where indicated.
