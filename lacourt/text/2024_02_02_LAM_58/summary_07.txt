Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrers filed by the defendants Webcor and Next Century Partners Mezzanine Borrower, LLC (NCPMB). The plaintiff, Control Air Enterprises, LLC, has filed multiple amended complaints alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, fraud, and promissory fraud.

The judge has sustained Defendant Webcor's demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraud in the inducement, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to plead a fraud cause of action. The judge has also sustained Defendant Webcor's demurrer to the ninth and tenth causes of action.

The judge has overruled Defendant NCPMB's demurrer to the first, second, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to plead alter ego liability against NCPMB.

The judge has ordered that the parties file a joint statement on how to proceed with the case, and has scheduled a hearing to consider the matter further.
