And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to seal the documents filed by the defendants, Robbins Brothers Jewelry, Inc. and Mark Pimental. The defendants had argued that the documents contained sensitive information that should be sealed, including confidential materials pertaining to third-party employee personnel matters and non-public corporate information. However, the judge found that the defendants' evidence was inadequate to justify the sealing of the documents. The judge also noted that the defendants' arguments were too vague and lacked specific examples or articulated reasoning. Finally, the judge found that the request to seal was not narrowly tailored and that the sealing of entire exhibits of evidence was overbroad. The judge ordered the defendants to file the unredacted versions of the papers and any supporting documentation electronically by February 9, 2024.
