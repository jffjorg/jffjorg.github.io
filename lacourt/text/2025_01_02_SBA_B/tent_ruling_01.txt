Although there are three motions, they are all essentially
the same.  Plaintiff states:
“On October 22, 2024, Pace
propounded his first sets of Requests for Admission (“RFAs”), Form
Interrogatories – General (“FROGs”) and Special Interrogatories (“SROGs”) on
BES. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. 8).  The
RFAs, FROGs and SROGs were served via email on BES’ counsel, Jonathan Nguyen.  (Id.)  BES’
responses to the RFAs, FROGs and SROGs were due on or before November 25, 2024.
 C. Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a),
2031.260(a), 2033.250(a) and 1013(a).  To
date, however, no responses have been received from BES. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 10).”
Moving party states that on November 26, 2024 he emailed
counsel for BES informing him of the need to provide responses, but he received
no response to that email.  Another similar
email notification was provided to BES’s counsel on December 4, 2024, but it
also received no response.
Orders compelling responses and deeming facts admitted are
sought, along with sanction in the amount of $1,1660 on each motion.
Pace filed its Amended Consolidated Reply on December 26,
2024 noting that no Oppositions were filed to the three motions and no
responses to the discovery have been served.
BES filed a late Opposition on December 26, 2024, claiming
that the Motions are moot as verified responses, without objection, have been
served.  Copies of the discovery
responses dated December 26, 2024 are attached to the Opposition.  It also notes that sanctions should not be awarded
as, unfortunately, counsel has an excellent excuse for his failure to respond.  His son suffered a devastating medical
emergency which required counsel’s around-the-clock attention.  (The Court shall not describe the matter in
more detail for privacy reasons.)  Counsel
did not check his email due to the very critical nature of the emergency.
In light of the very significant medical emergency the
failure of BES to timely respond to the discovery is excusable.  Response have now been provided.  So too, the Court concludes that the very
unique circumstances justify not awarding sanctions to moving party.
It is most regrettable that circumstances interfered with
the obligations of the parties in this litigation to timely respond to
discovery, but unfortunately other more urgent matters may justify the delay.
ORDER:
1.  Motions to Compel
DENIED as moot.
2.  Motion to Deem
Facts Admitted DENIED as moot.
3.  Motion for Sanctions
DENIED as the failure to respond to the discovery and emails was justified.
