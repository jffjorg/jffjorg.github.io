And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. regarding the complaint filed by SUYAPA LIZZETH GALEAS AGUILERA, et al. The complaint alleges that the decedents, Cristhian Balbino Galeas Aguilera and Luis Fernando Reyes Aguilar, died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a Honda EU2200i portable gas generator. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend on all grounds stated in the demurrer and memorandum of points and authorities.

The grounds for sustaining the demurrer include that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring the claims, that the plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraud, and that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that they are successors-in-interest to the decedents. The judge has noted that the only factual allegations relating to the plaintiffs are that they are residents of Honduras, which is insufficient to establish that they are successors-in-interest to the decedents.

The judge has ordered that the demurrer is sustained, and that the plaintiffs have 20 days to amend their complaint to address the grounds for the demurrer.
