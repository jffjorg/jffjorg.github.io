And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The plaintiff, Milad Nowrozani, has filed a motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant, Anthony Chiang. The defendant has failed to participate in the litigation, failing to respond to discovery requests, disobeying court orders, and failing to pay sanctions. The court finds that the defendant has no intention of further participating in the litigation. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant's answer is ordered stricken, and the court enters default against the defendant."
