III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
(emphasis added).) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          Ford’s
counsel declares they met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel on October 15,
2024, but the parties were unable to reach an informal agreement. (See Declaration
of Chen Fei Liu filed November 4, 2024, ¶
2.) Ford has fulfilled its meet and confer requirements.
V.       ANALYSIS
A.       Plaintiff’s
Fourth Cause of Action is Time Barred
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is barred by the Song-Beverly Act’s
four-year statute of limitations for implied warranty. (See Demurrer, pp.
4-5.)  
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues “it was not possible for Plaintiff to discover, or
even form a suspicion of, the latent defect until it manifested and required
repairs, on June 1, 2020. At that point, Plaintiff discovered (or should have
discovered) the breach of implied warranty, and the statute of limitations runs.”
(Opposition, pg. 3.) 
 
The
four-year statute of limitations of Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) § 2725
applies to claims brought under the Song-Beverly Act whether for express or
implied warranty. (See Krieger v. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc. (1991)
234 Cal.App.3rd 205, 213-14 (1991); see Mexia v. Rinker Boat Co., Inc.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, 1306.)
It is
the general rule that implied warranties do not cover future performance. (See
Cardinal Health 301, Inc. v. Tyco Electronics Corp. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th
116, 134.) “Because an implied warranty is one that arises by operation of law
rather than by an express agreement of the parties, courts have consistently
held it is not a warranty that ‘explicitly extends to future performance of the
goods ....’.” (Id. (citations omitted); see also Carrau v. Marvin
Lumber & Cedar Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 281, 291 (concluding the future
performance exception applies only when “a seller expressly warrants a product
for a specified number of years.”).) Thus, per UCC § 2725(2), Plaintiff’s
fourth cause of action accrued “when tender of delivery [was] made.” Here, Plaintiff
alleges she entered into a warranty contract with Ford “[o]n or about January
27, 2018,” over six years before she filed the instant action. (FAC, ¶ 7.) Therefore,
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. 
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ Demurrer WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to Plaintiff’s
fourth cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability pursuant
to Civ. Code §§ 1791.1, 1794, and 1795.5.  
B.      Plaintiff
Sufficiently Pleads her Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent Repair  
Defendants
argue Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for negligent repair is barred by the economic
loss rule as the claim arises from (and is not independent of) the warranty
contract and Plaintiff is only seeking damages for the cost of the repair to
the Subject Vehicle. (See Demurrer, pp. 5-8.) Defendants also argue
Plaintiff fails to plead the essential element of damages. (See id. at pg.
8.) 
The
necessary elements for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty of
care that the defendant owed to the plaintiff; (2) breach; (3) causation; and
(4) damages. (See County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318; see also CACI No. 1220.)
Under
the economic loss rule, a plaintiff is precluded from recovery in tort where
her damages consist solely of an economic loss. (See Seely v. White
Motor Co. (1965) 63 Cal.2d 9, 17-18.) “California Courts define economic
loss as ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the
defective product or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal
injury or damages to other property.’” (Department of Water & Power of
City of Los Angeles v. ABB Power T & D Co. (C.D. Cal. 1995) 902 F.Supp.
1178, 1186, fn. 4.) The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in
contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations unless she
can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise. (See
Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988, 993.)
There
exist four (4) exceptions to the economic loss rule barring recovery in tort in
a breach of contract action: (1) where the breach of duty directly caused
physical injury; (2) where there was a breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing in insurance contracts; (3) for wrongful discharge in violation of
fundamental public policy; or (4) where the contract was fraudulently
induced. (See Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543,
551-552; see Robinson, 34 Cal.4th at 989-990.)
          Here,
Plaintiff’s negligent repair cause of action is alleged only against Galpin and
is sparse in its factual support. Plaintiff alleges she presented the Subject Vehicle
to Galpin for repair, that Galpin owed and breached their duty to repair the
Subject Vehicle, and Galpin’s negligence “was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's
damages.” (FAC, ¶¶ 61-64.) 
As
sparse as these allegations are, they appear to have arisen independently of
Plaintiff’s warranty with Ford and therefore circumvent the economic loss rule.
Plaintiff has not alleged a warranty or other contractual relationship with Galpin;
rather, Plaintiff’s allegations against Galpin concern Galpin’s duty to Plaintiff
to use ordinary care and skill to repair the Subject Vehicle. If Galpin was
obligated to make the repair, it was because of its relationship with Ford, not
with Plaintiff. Presumably, Ford reimburses or contracts with Galpin to pay for
each warranted repair that Galpin performs. There is no promise in the warranty
that Galpin will successfully make those repairs. Instead, Galpin’s duty to
Plaintiff—to reasonably perform the repair—arises from tort, and the general
duty of reasonable care that each person owes each other. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action is distinct from a failure to perform under
the warranty. The warranty was between Ford and Plaintiff, and, even though Galpin
was not successful at repairing the Vehicle, the failure to perform the
warranty was Ford’s.
The
Court also finds Plaintiff’s damages allegations sufficient at the pleading
stage. Though general, Plaintiff does plead that she was damaged by Galpin’s
breach. (See FAC, ¶ 64.) Because of this, it is not yet clear that the
only potential damages were the cost of the repairs, and Plaintiff never
actually states that these were her only damages. There is case law holding
that “the general measure of damages where injury to property is capable of
being repaired is the reasonable cost of repair together with the value of lost
use during the period of injury." (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21
Cal.4th 543, 555.) Therefore, even if Plaintiff did not pay for the repairs, she
could still have been damaged in time lost.
Accordingly,
the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action
for negligent repair. 
VI.    
CONCLUSION
         
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ Demurrer WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action.
          The
Court also OVERRULES Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action
for negligent repair.
          Defendants
have until December 31, 2024, to file an Answer only to the FAC. The Case
Management Conference is continued to April 29, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
