And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Ford Motor Company, Galpin Motors Inc., and DOES 1 through 10, to the plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action. The plaintiff, LaRren E. Jones, is seeking damages for alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act.

The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the plaintiff's fourth cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, finding that the four-year statute of limitations for implied warranties has expired.

The judge overrules the demurrer to the plaintiff's fifth cause of action for negligent repair, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded her claims and that the economic loss rule does not apply. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded her damages allegations.

The case management conference is continued to April 29, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and the defendants have until December 31, 2024, to file an answer to the first amended complaint.
