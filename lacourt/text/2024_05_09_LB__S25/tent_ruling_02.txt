 Case Number:  23LBCV00563    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn March 28, 2023, Plaintiffs Keishawn Spells and Reathell (“Plaintiffs”) filed personal injury action against Defendant Fatemeh Sabetsarvestanian (“Defendant”) for motor vehicle and general negligence. On November 29, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff Spells and Plaintiff Veal with a Request for Documents (Set One). On January 17, 2024, Plaintiffs returned unverified responses consistently of objections and no substantive or responsive documents. Plaintiffs requested and received a 30-day extension to complete these responses. No further responses were received. On February 23, 2024, Defendant provided another 7-day extension to respond. No further responses were provided. On April 15, 2024, Defendant filed these Motions to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) from Plaintiffs. While Plaintiffs expressly do not oppose themotions, both request more time to respond due to health and family issues. Defendant requests Plaintiffs be ordered to further respond, without objection, and seeks $1,185 in sanctions be awarded against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel.The Court notes that an IDC was held on May 7, 2024, however, as Plaintiffs failed to appear or provide an excuse as to the non-appearance, the matter was taken off-calendar.Analysis“Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) Where the court grants a motion to compel further responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.)Over the last three to four months, Plaintiffs have had opportunities to provide substantive responses to Plaintiffs have provided minimal responses and objections to the form interrogatories. Plaintiffs expressly do not oppose the motions but request more time to respond due to health and family issues. (See oppositions.) An independent discovery conference was held on May 7, 2024, concerning the subject discovery, and Plaintiffs did not appear.The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not provided complete responses and have not justified their objections. Though neither expressly oppose the motions, thus conceding the arguments in the moving papers, Plaintiffs request more time to respond. Yet, the ongoing health issues do not provide sufficiently justify the inadequate responses to basic form interrogatories, which have been in their possession since November 2023. Plaintiffs may be experiencing health issues, such as high blood pressure and headaches, and family issues, but the issues do not appear to be so severe that they cannot respond to these requests in the abundant amount of time provided by Defendant. In sum, Plaintiffs voluntarily pursued this case and cannot simply abandon their discovery obligations.RulingFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS both of Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories.Plaintiff Spell and Plaintiff Veals are ordered to provide further responses to Form Interrogatories 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.109, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13,4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7,7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 11.1,11.2, 12.2, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 14.1, 14.2, 20.1, 20,2 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.10, and 20.11, without objection within 10 day of the date of this ruling.Currently, the Court declines to impose monetary sanctions against either Plaintiff or Plaintiffs’ counsel. Sanctions will be considered, however, if Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel continue to fail to meaningfully participate in any remaining outstanding discovery obligations.
