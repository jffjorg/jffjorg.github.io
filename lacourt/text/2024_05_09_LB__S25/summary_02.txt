And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants both of Defendant's motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not provided complete responses and have not justified their objections. Although Plaintiffs do not oppose the motions, they request more time to respond due to health and family issues. However, the Court concludes that these issues do not sufficiently justify the inadequate responses to basic form interrogatories. The Court orders Plaintiffs to provide further responses to the specified interrogatories without objection within 10 days of the date of this ruling. The Court declines to impose monetary sanctions at this time, but reserves the right to consider sanctions if Plaintiffs and their counsel continue to fail to meaningfully participate in outstanding discovery obligations.
