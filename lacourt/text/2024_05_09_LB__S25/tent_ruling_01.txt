  Case Number:  23LBCV00315    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn February 21, 2023, Plaintiff Victor M. Morales (“Plaintiff”) filed this lemon law action against Defendant Ford Motor Company (“Defendant”) for violations of the Song Beverly Act. On March 11, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not opposed. On May 2, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion and a supplemental declaration.On November 13, 2023, Defendant served a notice of deposition of Plaintiff set for December 18, 2023. (Lee Decl., ¶1, Exh. 1.) In response, on December 13, 2023, Plaintiff served an objection to the notice of deposition. (Id. at ¶2, Exh. 2.) On December 15, 2023, Defendant’s contacted Plaintiff’s counsel requesting dates when Plaintiff was available. No response was received. (Id. at ¶3, Exh. 3.) On December 21, 2023, defense counsel contacted opposing counsel again seeking Plaintiff’s availability. No response was received. (Id. at ¶4, Exh. 4.) On December 29, 2023, another email was sent by Defendant’s counsel to Plaintiff’s counsel seeking deposition dates. There was no response to this inquiry. (Id. at ¶5, Exh. 5.)On other discovery matters, Plaintiff has provided responses. For example, on December 13, 2023, Plaintiff provided discovery responses to Defendant’s discovery requests and on January 4, 2024, Plaintiff objected to Defendant’s Notice of Vehicle Inspection. (Id. at ¶6, Exh. 6.) On January 9, 2024, and January 16, 2024, defense counsel requested alterative dates to schedule a vehicle inspection, but no response was received. (Id. at ¶8, Exh. 6.) Defendant now seeks an order to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.Analysis“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce forinspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (CCP § 2025.450(a).)As evidenced by the Declaration of Michelle Lee, Defendant’s counsel many numerous attempts to reset the deposition to no avail. (Id. at ¶¶3-7, Exhs. 3-5.) Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to this motion and, thus, has not justified his objections to the taking of his deposition. Significantly, Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition and a supplemental declaration informing the Court that after this motion was filed, Plaintiff agreed to deposition on April 25, 2024, but failed to attend. (Lee Supp. Decl., ¶¶3-8, Exhs. B-G.)RulingPlaintiff failed to justify his initial objection to the first deposition notice and failed to explain his subsequent failure to attend to April 25 noticed deposition. Based upon Plaintiff’s non-cooperation, the Court finds Defendant has shown good cause to compel Plaintiff’s deposition and the motion is, therefore, GRANTED.The Court orders Plaintiff to appear at deposition by May 20, 2024.
