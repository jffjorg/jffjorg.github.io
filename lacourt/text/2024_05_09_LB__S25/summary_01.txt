The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition is granted. The plaintiff failed to justify his initial objection to the first deposition notice and failed to explain his subsequent failure to attend the deposition. The defendant made numerous attempts to reset the deposition, but the plaintiff did not respond. The plaintiff agreed to deposition on April 25, but failed to attend. The court finds that the defendant has shown good cause to compel the plaintiff's deposition and orders the plaintiff to appear at deposition by May 20, 2024.
