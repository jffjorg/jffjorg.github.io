[1] Defendants failed to lodge
a courtesy copy of their opposition in violation of the Presiding Judge’s First
Amended General Order re: Electronic Filing. 
Defense counsel is admonished to follow this order and provide courtesy
copies with all future court filings.


            [2] The courts look to the
substance of an injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or
mandatory.  Agricultural Labor
Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


            [3] However, a court may issue an
injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the
complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).


[4] The court has ruled on the
parties’ written evidentiary objections, placing “S” for “sustained” and “O”
for “overruled” where appropriate, sometimes with a comment or pursuant to Fibreboard
Paper Products Corp. v. East Bay Union of Machinists, Local 1304, Steelworkers
of America, AFL-CIO, (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712 (court may overruled
objection if any portion of objected to material is admissible).  The clerk is ordered to scan and
electronically file the court’s rulings.
