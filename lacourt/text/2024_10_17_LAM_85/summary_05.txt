And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and an order to show cause (OSC) from plaintiff Modlin. Modlin requests judicial notice of various documents from his bankruptcy case, which the court grants. The court also considers Modlin's argument that Oakhurst's secret arrangement with Bierman violates the notice provisions in the deed of trust, but Modlin does not explain how this affects the one-action rule. The court notes that Oakhurst's $1 million paydown notice was only provided to Bierman, but does not respond to Modlin's argument. The court invites Oakhurst to focus on the issue of whether the prohibition against advance waivers only applies to the anti-deficiency rules and not the one-action rule, but Oakhurst's response is silent on this point.
