And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion by the Receiver, David P. Stapleton, to approve and settle his Final Report and Accounting, terminate the Receivership, discharge him as Receiver, exonerate all bonds, and dissolve the injunction. The Receiver has collected rents from tenants, incurred fees and expenses, and maintained books and records of income and expenses. The Receiver's account balance is currently $43,038.89.

The judge notes that no opposition has been filed, and therefore, the motion is granted. The Receiver's final account, including fees and costs, is approved. All potential claims against the Receiver where his misconduct could have been discovered are barred. The Receivership will terminate, and the Receiver will be discharged.
