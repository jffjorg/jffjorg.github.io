 Case Number:  24STCV24661    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  85 
Andrew Modlin v. Oakhurst
Income
Fund and Platinum Loan
Servicing, 
24STCV24661 
Tentative decision on application for preliminary injunction:   denied



 
 
            
Plaintiff Andrew Modlin (“Modlin”) applies for a preliminary
injunction to enjoin Defendants Oakhurst Income Fine I, LP (“Oakhurst”) and
Platinum Loan Services (“PLS”) from foreclosing on Modlin’s real property
located at 1450 Blue Jay Way, Los Angeles, CA 90069 (the “Blue Jay Way Property”).

            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
The Complaint
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on July 16, 2024, which alleges claims for declaratory relief
against both Defendants and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing against Oakhurst.  The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
or about March 2, 2022, Oakhurst made a joint loan to Modlin and non-party Adam
Bierman (“Bierman”) in the principal amount of $5,000,000 (the “Loan”).  PLS is the servicer of the Loan.  
The Loan was secured by deeds of trust on two separate
parcels of real property— the Blue Jay Way Property owned by Modlin and a
property owned by Bierman.  The Loan
repayment terms were interest-only for two years followed by a balloon payment
of principal.  Oakhurst understood that Modlin
and Bierman intended to refinance the Loan prior to maturity. 
            A
few months after the Loan funded, Bierman told Oakhurst that he wanted to sell
his property without using the entire proceeds to Oakhurst to pay down the
Loan.  Oakhurst agreed, accepting a
$1,000,000 paydown in exchange for a reconveyance of its deed of trust on
Bierman’s property.  The $1,000,000 amount
was substantially less than the proceeds of the sale of Bierman’s property and
substantially less than half of the Loan balance.  At no time did Modlin consent to the sale of
Bierman’s property without all the proceeds being used to pay down the Loan. 
            The
sale of Bierman’s property closed in or about October 2022, and only $1,000,000
was paid to Oakhurst.  Oakhurst now is
seeking to foreclose on the Blue Jay Way Property based on Modlin’s failure to
make the balloon payment and has recorded a notice of default and a notice of
trustee’s sale. 
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
September 23, 2024, Modlin served Defendants with the Complaint and Summons. 
            On
September 24, 2024, the court granted Modlin’s ex parte application for a temporary
restraining order (“TRO” and order to show cause re: preliminary injunction
(“OSC”) to enjoin Defendants from foreclosing on the Blue Jay Way Property.  The court ordered Modlin to serve Defendants
with the TRO/OSC and to file a proof of service by August 28, 2024.   
Proofs of service on both Defendants were filed on September
30, 2024.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            An
injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act; it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a
judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of
the court.  Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§525.  An injunction may be more
completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or
to refrain from performing a particular act. 
See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell
v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[1]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
            The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending final resolution upon a trial.  See
Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The status quo has been defined to
mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy.  Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v. Superior Court,
(1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
            A
preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a noticed motion.  The complaint normally must plead injunctive
relief.  CCP §526(a)(1)-(2).[2]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
            A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of
“inadequacy of the legal remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time
of the early courts of chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an
unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the
remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured
plaintiff.  Department of Fish &
Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1565.
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a balancing of the
“irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. 
CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v.
Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v. Blue Cross of
California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St. Johns Hospital,
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  Doe v.
Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304. 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v.
Carlson, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
            A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
See CCP §529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.

Statement of Facts[3]
            1.
Plaintiff’s Evidence 
            On
or about March 2, 2022, Oakhurst made the Loan jointly to Bierman and Modlin in
the principal amount of $5,000,000. 
Modlin Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  The Loan
was secured by deeds of trust on two separate parcels of real property— Modlin’s
residence at the Blue Jay Way Property and a property owned by Bierman.  Modlin Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  The Note provides for two years of
interest-only payments, followed by a balloon payment of the principal balance
in April 2024.  Modlin Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  
            The
Blue Jay Way Property is also subject to a $4.5 million deed of trust from
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing (“Shellpoint”). 
Modlin Decl., ¶5.  The Shellpoint
deed of trust is in the first position with priority over Oakhurst’s deed of
trust.  Modlin Decl., ¶5.  
In 2019 Modlin purchased the Blue Jay Way Property for
approximately $11 million.  Modlin Decl.,
¶3.  Prior to issuing the Loan, Oakhurst
appraised the Blue Jay Way Property at $13 million.  Modlin Decl., ¶3.  Modlin is personally familiar with the value
of the Blue Jay Way Property because he purchased it, lived there from the
time, and has worked with brokers to market it for lease and sale.  Modlin Decl., ¶3.  In his opinion, the Blue Jay Way Property is
worth approximately $12 million.  Modlin
Decl., ¶3.  
            Modlin
has listed the Blue Jay Way Property for sale at $10.9 million, a price less
than its full value, to generate additional interested buyers who might bid
against each other; and because the threatened foreclosure puts downward
pressure on the obtainable price.  Modlin
Decl., ¶4.  
The Loan closed on or about March 11, 2022.  Modlin Decl., ¶6, Ex. B.  A few months after the Loan closed, Bierman
told Oakhurst that he wanted to sell his collateral without using the entire
proceeds to Oakhurst to pay down the Loan.  Oakhurst agreed, accepting a $1,000,000
paydown in exchange for a reconveyance of its deed of trust on Bierman’s
property.  Modlin Decl., ¶7.  Modlin knows this information because Bierman
told him and later sent him a copy of Oakhurst’s October 20, 2022 payoff
demand.  Modlin Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  Modlin was unaware of Oakhurst’s arrangement
with Bierman and did not agree to it. 
Modlin Decl., ¶9.  
Bierman’s sold his property for approximately $5.7 million,
and it was encumbered by an approximately $3.4 million senior mortgage.  Modlin Decl., ¶8.  Oakhurst ultimately released its deed of
trust for the $1 million paydown.  Modlin
Decl., ¶7, Ex. D.  
            Modlin
did not discover that Oakhurst had released Bierman’s collateral for less than
the full sale proceeds until sometime in late 2023.  Modlin Decl., ¶10.  At that time, Bierman told Modlin that he did
not have the money to pay his share of the loan.  Modlin Decl., ¶10.  Because Oakhurst had released Bierman’s
collateral for less than the full sale proceeds, the principal loan balance became
$4 million instead of $2.7 million. 
Modlin Decl., ¶11.  In addition,
because interest was accruing on the larger principal balance, the monthly
interest payments were more than $30,000 per month instead of approximately
$20,000 per month.  Modlin Decl., ¶11.  Modlin did not have enough money to pay the
Loan unless he sold the Blue Jay Way Property. 
Modlin Decl., ¶11. 
            Modlin
moved out of the Blue Jay Property temporarily around this time because he was traveling
and wanted to rent it on a short-term basis for additional income.  Modlin Decl., ¶12.  After discovering the issue with Oakhurst, Modlin
decided to continue the short-term rentals, using his personal furniture and
furnishings to rent the Blue Jay Way Property as furnished for $40,000 per
month.  Modlin Decl., ¶12.  
            In
or about November 2023, Bierman and Modlin jointly engaged James Kim, Esq. (“Kim”)
of the law firm Cole Schotz, P.C. to approach Oakhurst about restructuring the Loan.  Modlin Decl., ¶13.  Kim approached Oakhurst about a loan
modification, but Oakhurst declined to accept anything other than payment in
full.  Modlin Decl., ¶13.  
            On
January 30, 2024, Modlin filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California, initiating bankruptcy case no. 2:24-bk-10695-SK (the
“Bankruptcy Case”).  Modlin Decl.,
¶14.  
            On
August 15, 2024, the bankruptcy court dismissed the Bankruptcy Case upon Oakhurst’s
motion.  Modlin Decl., ¶15.  With the bankruptcy case dismissed and a
foreclosure again imminent, Modlin could no longer rent the Blue Jay Way Property,
so he moved back in early September 2024, and it again became his primary
residence.  Modlin Decl., ¶16.  
            On
August 27, 2024, Modlin filed a notice of appeal with the United States
Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit and that same day he filed a
motion for stay pending appeal and an application for an order shortening time.  Modlin Decl., ¶17.  
            Oakhurst
has recorded a notice of trustee’s sale. 
Modlin Decl., ¶18, Ex. E.  The
trustee’s sale is currently scheduled for October 1, 2024, at 11:00 a.m.  Modlin Decl., ¶18.  
            
2. Defendants’ Evidence 
Throughout the Bankruptcy Case, Modlin admitted that he and
Bierman were partners with respect to the $5 million Loan from Oakhurst.  Landau Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2.  Business partners Modlin and Bierman induced
Oakhurst to loan them $5 million on terms that included the Addendum to the
note providing for the release of collateral upon principal paydown.  Fine Decl., ¶4.  The terms for release of collateral are for
the benefit of the borrowers.  Fine
Decl., ¶4.  
 
            Throughout
2024, Oakhurst has been delayed in realizing upon its collateral resulting in
substantial accruals of additional interest, fees, and costs.  Landau Decl., ¶3.  Oakhurst’s notice of default period expired
in January of 2024.  Landau Decl.,
¶3.  At that point, Modlin filed a Chapter
11 bankruptcy case to stay Oakhurst’s sale set for January 30, 2024.  Landau Decl., ¶3.  The bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy
case on August 15, 2024.  Landau Decl.,
¶3.  On September 25, 2024, the bankruptcy
court denied Modlin’s motion for stay pending appeal, and the bankruptcy court
and Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel both denied Modlin’s motion for
stay pending appeal.  Landau Decl.,
¶3.  
            Oakhurst
is owed $4,948,225.47 as of September 30, 2024. 
Landau Decl., ¶4; Fine Decl., ¶2. 
Interest continues to accrue until satisfaction of the Loan at the rate
of $1,611.11 per day.  Landau Decl., ¶4; Fine
Decl., ¶2.  Senior encumbrances to
Oakhurst are (1) $156,512 in annual real estate taxes per the Los Angeles
County Tax Collector claim (Ex. 3) and (2) a first priority lien held by
Shellpoint in the amount of $4.5 million. 
Landau Decl., ¶4.  Thus, the gross
encumbrances total approximately $9.6 million. 
Landau Decl., ¶4.  
            Modlin
has listed the Blue Jay Way Property listed for $10.9 million.  Landau Decl., ¶5.  Modlin also has listed the Blue Jay Way Property
for rent at $65,000 monthly.  Landau
Decl., ¶5.  Per Modlin’s listing
agreement, Modlin is listing the property for a 5% real estate commission
totaling $545,000.  Landau Decl.,
¶6.  
Based on its location, the Blue Jay Way Property is subject
to the City of Los Angeles mansion tax of 5.5% upon sales in excess of $10
million.  Landau Decl., ¶5.  Together with other governmental transfer
taxes, a total of $654,000 in transfer taxes must be paid for a sale at $10.9
million.  Landau Decl., ¶5, Ex. 4.  Thus, there is a minimum of $1.2 million in
tax and broker closing costs upon sale plus miscellaneous closing costs for
escrow, title insurance, and other matters. 
Landau Decl., ¶7.  
            Modlin
claimed an intent to reside in the Blue Jay Way Property and the bankruptcy court
expressly rejected the claim and disallowed a homestead exemption.  Landau Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  
            Oakhurst’s
foreclosure sale is presently set for October 22, 2024.  Landau Decl., ¶9.  As set forth above, Oakhurst has no equity
cushion for its lien position.  Landau
Decl., ¶9.  Thus, any future accrual of
taxes, interest on the Shellpoint first mortgage or further Oakhurst interest
may result in a loss to Oakhurst upon foreclosure because those amounts are not
recoverable from its collateral.  Landau
Decl., ¶9.  
            Modlin
commenced a JAMS arbitration case to adjudicate his claim against Oakhurst on
October 9, 2024.  Landau Decl., ¶11.  JAMS Arbitration Rules & Procedures
Article 33.1 states: “In most circumstances, the dispute should be heard and be
submitted to the Tribunal for decision within nine months after the initial
preliminary conference required by Article 22, and the final award should be
rendered within three months thereafter. The parties and the Tribunal will use
their best efforts to comply with this schedule.”  Landau Decl., ¶11.  Thus, counsel for loan servicing agent PLS,
reasonably believes that the JAMS arbitration case will take at least nine
months before entry of an award.  Landau
Decl., ¶12.  The attorney’s fees and
costs Oakhurst will incur in litigating Modlin’s claims in the superior court
and the JAMS arbitration are estimated to be at least $250,000.  Landau Decl., ¶12.
 
            D.
Analysis
Plaintiff Modlin applies for a preliminary injunction to enjoin
Defendants to cease any action to foreclose on the Blue Jay Property.  PLS opposes for itself and for Oakhurst.
1.     
Probability of Success
In California, there can be but one form of action for the
recovery of any debt secured by a mortgage (deed of trust) and that form of
action is foreclosure of the security. 
CCP §726(a); Pacific Valley Bank v. Schwenke, (“Schwenke”)
(1987) 189 Cal. App. 3d 134, 140.  If the
beneficiary seeks a deficiency judgment in excess of the security’s value, he
is limited to judicial foreclosure rather than non-judicial foreclosure.  Id. 
The existence of the security denies the secured creditor the right to
bring an independent claim on the underlying note.  Id. (citation omitted).  In effect, whenever there is a deed of trust
to secure a debt, there can be but one action for the debt’s recovery.  Id. 
The law steps in and limits the action to foreclosure proceedings to
enforce the debt.  Id. (citation
omitted).  As a corollary, the debtor, by
signing a note secured by the deed of trust, does not unconditionally promise
to pay the entire obligation and only makes a conditional promise to pay any
deficiency if a judicial sale does not satisfy the debt.  Id. (citation omitted).
CCP section 726(a) has both a "single-action"
aspect, which limits the creditor to a single action to enforce the secured
debt, and a "security-first" aspect, which requires the creditor to
exhaust the security before seeking recourse against the debtor personally.
Cal. Civ. Prac. Real Property Litigation §4:77.  App. at 7.
Modlin relies heavily on Schwenke, supra, 189
Cal. App. 3d at 134, where the court applied this law to a situation in which two
borrowers (O’Brien and Schwenke) jointly borrowed from the bank, and one of
them (O’Brien), pledged real estate as collateral to secure the loan.  Id. at 137.  O’Brien later re-financed the property, but
the bank accepted less than the full proceeds of the refinancing to pay down
the joint loan. Id. at 138.  The
bank did not notify Schwenke of the money received from the O’Brien escrows or
of the reconveyance of his deeds of trust. 
Id.
The court found that CCP section 726’s one-action rule was a
complete bar to the bank’s action against Schwenke.  Id. at 141.  A creditor is not allowed to circumvent the
statute by divesting himself of his security without the debtor’s consent.  If he does so, he has waived his right to
proceed on the note.  Id.  
The bank argued that Schwenke’s consent was not necessary
since he was not the trustor on the deed of trust, but that ignored the fact
that the note and deed of trust together formed one loan contract.  Id. 

Emphasis on whether the bank’s collection from O’Brien
amounted to an “action” was misplaced. 
Where a trustor and the beneficiary agree that the latter may release a
deed of trust without retiring the note, there is no violation of CCP section
726 since the debtor is entitled to waive its protections.  Id. at 141-42.  But where the bank releases security without a
borrower’s consent, the release need not be characterized as an “’action.”  What is crucial is that it was done without Schwenke’s
knowledge.  Id. at 142.
The Schwenke court cited Cooper v. Burch, (“Cooper”)
(1906) 3 Cal.App. 470, 471, where three partners signed a promissory note and
executed a mortgage to Cooper.  Two of
the partners and Cooper executed partial releases of the mortgage as portions
of the property were sold, but money given for the releases was not applied to
the note.  The third debtor had no
knowledge of the release of security or disposition of the funds.  The court held that release of the mortgage
without his knowledge or consent relieved him from liability on the note.  Id. at 142.  Finally, Schwenke found that the
bank’s characterization of the loan as made to the partnership of O’Brien and
Schwenke was against the evidence.  Id.
at 144.
Since there was no agreement between Schwenke and the bank
to alter the terms of the loan contract, the bank was not excused from
performance.  Id. at 146.  The bank’s release of security in violation
of CCP section 726 relieved Scwenke of any personal liability.  Id. at 146.
Modlin also relies on Security Pacific Nat'l Bank v.
Wozab, (“Wozab”) (1990) 51 Cal. 3d 991, 1004–05, where the
California Supreme Court applied the security first principle in a different
context.  There, the lender set off money
in a borrower’s deposit account before foreclosing on its real property
collateral.  The court asked: “Dies an
improper bank setoff result in the forfeiture of the underlying debt?”  Id. at 1004.  The court answered no.  Id. 
Allowing t he bank to sue on the debt does not violate the two
fundamental purposes of CCP section 726: (a) preventing multiplicity of
lawsuits against the debtor and (b) requiring exhaustion of the security before
a resort to the debtor’s unencumbered assets. 
Id.  This was because the extra-judicial
setoff was not an “action”.   Id.
at 998, 1004.  A complete forfeiture of
the debt also would be punitive.  Id.
at 1006.  The result would be different
if the bank refuses the debtor's demand to return the setoff funds.  Then, the security-first rule would preclude
the bank both from foreclosing the security interest and proceeding on the
underlying debt.  Id.  App. at 7.
Modlin argues that, under this case authority, Oakhurst has
waived its collateral and forfeited its debt. Like the secured lender in Schwenke,
Oakhurst released one borrower’s collateral without consent of the other
borrower.  As the California Supreme
Court warned in Wozab, Oakhurst refused Modlin’s request to honor the
one-action rule -- i.e., reduce the underlying debt as if it had taken
the full proceeds of Bierman’s collateral.  Accordingly, it has waived both the security
and the debt.  App. at 7.
PLS attempts to distinguish Schwenke. While the
co-borrower aspect of Schwenke appears to create similarity, the
distinctions between Schwenke and the case at bar are material and
determinative: (1). Both borrowers pledged real property collateral for the
Modlin loan; (2). Modlin consented to the collateral release terms as evidenced
by the Addendum that requires Oakhurst to release one of the real property
collateral parcels upon principal paydown; (3). Oakhurst complied with the
requirements and terms of the Addendum and its failure to do so would have been
a breach of the note.  Opp. at 5-6.
PLS argues that Schwenke has no application to this
case where the terms of the Loan require that collateral be released upon
certain conditions.  Modlin agreed at the
inception of the Loan to the very term for release of collateral that he now
claims renders the Loan unenforceable. Civil Code §3517 (“No one can take
advantage of his own wrong.”).  Modlin’s consent
renders Schwenke inapposite.  Opp.
at 6.
PLS argues that Wozab contains no independent
reasoning supporting Modlin’s claim that Oakhurst’s loan is unenforceable under
the one-action rule after Oakhurst complied with the Addendum.  Wozab is a security first case and stands for
the principle that a secured lender may not setoff funds from a borrower’s bank
account against a debt secured by real property without first foreclosing on
the security. If the secured lender does take the money as a setoff, it risks
waiving their security interest.  Oakhurst
did not engage in any setoff or other action that remotely triggers the
one-action rule under Wozab.  Opp. at 5,
n.2.
The court concludes that PLS’s distinctions of Scwenke
and Wozab are ineffectual.  Modlin
has a good argument, and has shown a probability of success, that his lack of
consent to Oakhurst’s release of Bierman’s property excused him (Modlin) from
personal liability on the Loan.  That is
what Schwenke and the “security first” aspect of CCP section 726(a) is
about.  
It is not clear, however, that this lack of consent prevents
foreclosure on the Blue Jay Way Property. 
The security for the Loan consisted of multiple liens -- both Blue Jay
Way and Bierman’s property.  The issue is
what happens when Oakhurst released less than the full equity in Bierman’s
property without Modlin’s consent?  Does
that undermine Oakhurst’s lien on the Blue Jay Way Property?  The release of Bierman’s property was not a
judicial action and allowing foreclosure on Blue Jay Way would not violate
either of the fundamental purposes of CCP section 726: (a) preventing
multiplicity of lawsuits against the debtor and (b) requiring exhaustion of the
security before a resort to the debtor’s unencumbered assets.  Indeed, it is consistent with the analysis in
Wozab, supra, 51 Cal. 3d at 1004–05. 
The court need not reach a conclusion on this issue except
that Modlin has not shown that the release of the Bierman security without
Modlin’s consent also requires release of the Blue Jay Way security.
 
The Advance Waiver
PLS notes that the promissory note Addendum contains an
express requirement that Oakhurst release one of the properties upon principal
paydown of the note: 
 
“The Lender and
Borrower do hereby agree that the property located at either 4619 Roma Ct, Los
Angeles CA 90292, or 1450 Blue Jay Way, Los Angeles CA 90069 shall be
released from the loan agreement by way of principal paydown such that the
loan-to-value of the remaining asset is less than or equal to 65% of the market
value at the time of such release. Lender may or may not require an updated
appraisal at time of release and final approval of release to be determined at
lenders sole and absolute discretion.” Modlin Decl., Ex. A (emphasis added).
 
There is no dispute that Oakhurst performed in accordance
with the Addendum when releasing the Roma Property. Thus, the question on the
merits is whether the Addendum is a valid and binding agreement that does not
violate CCP Section 726.  Opp. at 4-5.
Modlin contends that Oakhurst cannot argue that it was
permitted to violate the rule because it obtained an advance waiver in the addendum
to the note.  Courts have long upheld the
principle that the one-action rule is not waivable in advance.  Cadle Co. II v. Harvey, (“Harvey”)
(2000) 83 Cal. App. 4th 927, 932 (anti-deficiency statutes and CCP section 726
reflect policy limiting the right to recover deficiency judgments and debtor
cannot be compelled to waive them in advance). 
App. at 8.
This judicial rule against advance waivers was codified in
Civil Code section 2953: 
 
“Any express agreement
made or entered into by a borrower at the time of or in connection with the
making of or renewing of any loan secured by a deed of trust, mortgage or other
instrument creating a lien on real property, whereby the borrower agrees to
waive the rights, or privileges conferred upon the borrower by … Sections
580a or 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure, shall be void and of no effect.”

 
See Salter v. Ulrich, (1943)
22 Cal. 2d 263, 267 (“The rule against waivers in advance has been codified by
section 2953 of the Civil Code, which was adopted in 1937.”).  Under these clear authorities, Oakhurst’s
cannot rely on an advance waiver of the one-action rule.  App. at 8.
PLS argues that Modlin cites no decision for the proposition
that a note containing specific collateral release terms constitutes an
unlawful advance waiver. If so, then every construction loan that has a partial
collateral release clause triggers the one-action rule. A plain reading of the
Addendum reveals there is no waiver in the Addendum. Third, Modlin’s consent
exists in the Addendum and the Addendum did not require a second formal consent
under the terms of the deed of trust. Modlin could have negotiated for that
notice but did not do so.  Opp. at 6-7.
PLS argues that Harvey, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th 927,
is a “sham guaranty” case in which a purported guarantor waives anti-deficiency
protections. Since the guaranty is a sham, the waivers of anti-deficiency
protections set forth in an otherwise valid guaranty are void. As such, it has
no precedential value.  Opp. at 7.  
PLS’s argument is untenable. 
It ignores Civil Code section 2953’s plain language as well as Harvey’s
language that “well-established principles” reflect that advance waivers of
deficiency are not permitted by legislative policy.  Modlin is also correct that PLS’s analogy to
construction loan partial releases are not an advance waiver; they are terms
that future waivers will occur during the course of construction.  Reply at 4. 
The court accepts that the Addendum’s advance waiver is ineffectual for
any effort by Oakhurst to obtain a deficiency judgment against Modlin.[4] [5]
 
Other Defenses
PLS also argues that Modlin has repeatedly confirmed that he
and Bierman were business partners in connection with the Oakhurst loan. Landau
Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2.  The note confirms that
it is a business purpose loan.  Modlin
Decl., Ex. A, ¶11.  Under Corporation
Code section 16301, an act of a partner, including the execution of an
instrument in the partnership name in the ordinary course the partnership
business binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority to act for
the partnership.  Bierman’s consent binds
the partnership.  Opp. at 7-8.
Modlin rebuts this defense. 
As in Schwenke, the facts do not support a partnership decision
to release Bierman’s property   The Note
and Deeds of Trust were not executed on behalf of any partnership.  In any event, a general partner’s consent is
imputed to the general partnership for partnership purposes, not personal
purposes.  Modlin personally owns the
Blue Jay Way Property and Bierman personally owned his property.  Bierman could not waive Modlin’s rights under
the one-action rule by obtaining a release for his personal property.
PLS also relies on equitable estoppel, which applies in
circumstances where a party has induced another into forbearing to act.  Lantzy v. Centex Homes, (2003) 31
Cal..App.4th 363, 383.  The elements of
estoppel are: (1) the party to be estopped must be appraised of the facts; (2)
he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon; (3) the other party must
be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct
to his injury.  Driscoll v. City of
Los Angeles, (1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 305. 
The doctrine applies to a public entity in the same manner as a private
party when the elements of equitable estoppel have been shown, and when the
injustice which would result from a failure to estop the agency is sufficient
to justify any adverse effect upon public interest or policy which would
result.  City of Long Beach v. Mansell,
(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 496-97.
PLS argues that business partners Modlin and Bierman induced
Oakhurst to loan them $5 million on terms that included the Addendum to release
collateral upon principal paydown. No additional consent to release collateral
was required beyond the paydown of the loan as set forth in the Addendum.  Modlin was aware of these facts when Bierman
paid down the loan and Bierman obtained the release of his property as collateral.
Oakhurst was unaware that Modlin would claim that the Blue Jay Way Property and
Modlin himself were released upon compliance with the Loan terms. Oakhurst
relied upon the terms of the Addendum when releasing the Roma Property.  Fine Decl., ¶ 5, 6.  Opp. at 8.
This argument is spurious. 
The pertinent facts would be those surrounding the release of Bierman’s
property as collateral, not Modlin’s claim that the one-action rule
applies.  
 
Conclusion
Modlin has shown a probability of success under CCP section
726 against his personal liability on the Loan but not against foreclosure of
the Blue Jay Way Property.
 
2. Balancing of Harms
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the second factor which a trial court examines is the interim harm that
plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the
harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary
injunction.  Donahue Schriber Realty
Group, Inc. v. Nu Creation Outreach, (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1177.  This factor involves consideration
of the inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the
necessity of preserving the status quo.  Id.
 
Modlin’s Harm
Modlin argues that, if this application is not granted, the
Blue Jay Way Property will be sold at the trustee’s sale and he will be
deprived of his most valuable single asset. 
Real property is usually deemed ‘unique,’ so that injury or loss cannot
be compensated in damages, and injunctive relief is therefore more readily
granted.” Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide, Civ. Pro. Before Trial, § 9:509
(2024).  Thus, Modlin’s loss would not be
adequately compensated with monetary damages if the Blue Jay Way Property is
sold at a trustee’s sale.  App. at 9.
Modlin argues that this harm greatly exceeds any harm that
will be suffered by Defendants if injunctive relief is granted.  If Defendants prevail, their only injury will
be a delay in foreclosure, a brief delay given that the matter will be
litigated before an arbitrator resulting in fewer procedural delays.  Baypoint Mortg. Corp. v. Crest Premium
Real Est. etc. Tr., (1985) 168 Cal. App. 3d 818, 824–25 (balance of harms
weighed in favor of plaintiff who was facing foreclosure because defendant will
have suffered only some delay in foreclosure).
PLS notes that Modlin’s argument about the uniqueness of
residential property only applies if the moving party genuinely resides in the
property.  A remedy at law is adequate
for investment property.  Real Estate
Analytics, LLC v. Vallas, (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 463, 468.  Opp. at 11.
Modlin previously sought to claim a homestead exemption in
the Blue Jay Property that was rejected by the bankruptcy court.  Landau Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. 6.  More recently, in September 2024 rulings
denying Modlin’s motions for stay pending appeal, the bankruptcy court and
Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel denied Modlin’s motions for a stay
pending appeal because Modlin did not prove irreparable harm in the foreclosure
loss of the Bluey Jay Way Property. 
Landau Decl., ¶3.
Modlin is being dishonest if he now claims to reside in the
Blue Jay Way Property as a means to manufacture the presumption of uniqueness
for real property.  If Modlin did
recently move back to the Blue Jay Property, he did so after receiving
Oakhurst’s August 28, 2024 notice of trustee’s sale.  Most importantly, Modlin admits that he is
listing the property for $10.9 million and online records confirm the property
is listed for rent at $65,000 monthly. 
Landau Decl., ¶ 5. Modlin is obviously still treating the Blue Jay Way
Property as an investment property whether he has occasionally slept there or
not.  Opp. at 11.
Modlin replies that he is willing to sell the Blue Jay Way
Property in bankruptcy for two reasons. First, the bankruptcy code allows a
debtor to sell property free and clear of liens without the lienholder’s
consent – an ability the debtor lacks outside of bankruptcy.  Second, selling the property allowed Modlin
to propose a feasible plan of reorganization -- i.e., a Chapter 11 plan
that would provide for payment of Oakhurst’s secured claim in full. Having
succeeded in getting Modlin’s bankruptcy case dismissed and preventing him from
selling or renting the Blue Jay Way Property, Oakhurst cannot complain that
Modlin has decided to return to his home. 
Reply at 6-7.
Like the bankruptcy court, this court does not believe that
the Blue Jay Way Property is anything more than an investment property for
Modlin.  It is still unique, but damages
can be an adequate remedy at law. 
 
Oakhurst’s Harm
PLS argues that Oakhurst will be harmed by a delay in
foreclosure because the equity in the Blue Jay Way Property has been
exhausted.  Oakhurst’s notice of default
period expired in January 2024.  At that
point, Modlin filed a bad faith Chapter 11 bankruptcy case to stay Oakhurst’s
sale on January 30, 2024, which was an election of remedies. After finding that
Modlin filed his bankruptcy case in bad faith, the bankruptcy court dismissed
the bankruptcy case on August 15, 2024.  Landau
Decl., ¶3.  Oakhurst is now owed
$4,948,225.47 as of September 30, 2024 with a per diem interest accrual of
$1,611.11.  Fine Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1. 
Senior encumbrances to Oakhurst consist of $156,512 in
annual real estate taxes (Landau Decl., ¶4) and a first priority lien held by
Shellpoint in the amount of $4.5 million. (Modlin Decl.,  ¶5). Thus, gross encumbrances total $9,604,737.47
in the following priority: Taxes: $156,512 Shellpoint: $4,500,000 Oakhurst:
$4,948,225.47.  
Modlin has the Blue Jay Property listed for $10.9 million.  Modlin Decl.,  ¶4.  There
is a minimum of $1.2 million in tax and broker closing costs upon sale plus
miscellaneous closing costs for escrow, title insurance and other matters.  As such, a sale at $10.9 million yields at net
of $9,601,000 as follows: 1. Sale price: $10,900,000 2. Taxes: $654,000 3.
Commission: $545,000 4. Miscellaneous: $100,000.  Based on the listing price for the Blue Jay
Property, closing costs and the senior encumbrances, any delay in foreclosure
results in immediate harm to Oakhurst. 
Opp. at 10.
Modlin replies that Oakhurst introduces no evidence of the
value of the Blue Jay Way Property except to say that Modlin lowered the
listing price after his bankruptcy case was dismissed and foreclosure was
imminent.  This is hardly proof of
value.  Reply at 7.  
The short answer is that the listing price is not proof of
real market value, but it is evidence of maximum value.  PLS was entitled to rely on it for its equity
calculations.   Oakhurst will suffer monetary
harm if foreclosure is delayed, particularly if it has waived any right to
pursue Modlin personally on the Loan.
The balance of harms works in favor of Oakhurst.
 
E. Conclusion
The application for a preliminary injunction is denied.
