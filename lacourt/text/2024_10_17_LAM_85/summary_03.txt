And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the court proceedings. First, the court admonishes the defense counsel to follow the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order re: Electronic Filing and provide courtesy copies with all future court filings, as they failed to do so in this case. Second, the court notes that an injunction can be mandatory or prohibitory, and that a mandatory injunction carries a heavy burden, which is only permitted in extreme cases. However, the court also has the discretion to issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint. The court has ruled on the parties' written evidentiary objections and ordered the clerk to scan and electronically file the court's rulings.
