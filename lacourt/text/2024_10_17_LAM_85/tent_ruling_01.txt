2. Course of Proceedings

B. Applicable Law
Pursuant to CCP
section 564(b), “[a] receiver
may be appointed by the court in which an action or proceeding is pending, or
by a judge of that court,…(11) [i]n an action by a secured lender for specific
performance of an assignment of rents provision in a deed of trust, mortgage,
or separate assignment document. The appointment may be continued after entry
of a judgment for specific performance if appropriate to protect, operate, or
maintain real property encumbered by a deed of trust or mortgage or to collect
rents therefrom while a pending nonjudicial foreclosure under power of sale in
a deed of trust or mortgage is being completed.”  CCP § 564(b)(11).
“[T]he appointment
of a receiver rests in a large measure in the sound discretion of the court.
However, such power is not entirely uncontrolled and must be exercised with due
regard to the facts presented in each particular case. And because the remedy
of receivership is so drastic in character, ‘Ordinarily, if there is any other
remedy, less severe in its results, which will adequately protect the rights of
the parties, a court should not take property out of the hands of its owners.”  Alhambra-Shumway Mines, Inc. v. Alhambra
Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 869, 873; see also Medipro Medical
Staffing LLC v. Certified Nursing Registry, Inc. (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 622,
628.

(4) created a rent roll attached as Exhibit B to the Final Report; and (5) maintained

Stapleton Decl., ¶6.

and pay any other pending Receivership expenses, are estimated to be
$15,000.  Stapleton Decl., ¶9.  Receiver
intends to pay all remaining expenses from cash held by the Estate once the
final invoice has been prepared and the notice period expires.  Stapleton Decl., ¶9.  
 
D. Analysis
Receiver moves the court for an order (1) approving and
settling his Final Report and Accounting, (2) terminating the Receivership, (3)
discharging him as Receiver, (4) exonerating all bonds, and (5) dissolving the
injunction.    
Receiver fails
to explain why the Receivership should terminate.  In this case, Plaintiff BMO seeks judicial
foreclosure and money damages for beach of two loan agreements in the amounts
of $22,500,000 and $4,902,000. Plaintiff alleges that the deficiency on the
$22,500,000 loan exceeds $17,000,000 and that the deficiency on the other loan
exceeds $4,000,000.  On September 19,
2024, the court was informed that the parties had settled by entering into a
forbearance agreement.  Therefore, the
Receivership should terminate.
Receiver’s evidence
shows that he has collected monthly rent from each tenant, maintained books and
records of income and expenses, has incurred fees and expenses from inception
through July 31, 2024 of $41,075, has an account balance of $43,038.89, and
will pay all other Receivership expenses and Receiver fees, estimated to be
$15,000, from cash held by the Estate. 

No opposition has been filed and the motion is granted. The
Receiver’s final account, including fees and costs, is approved.  All potential claims against the Receiver
where his misconduct could have been discovered are barred.  See Aviation Brake Systems, Ltd. v.
Voorhis, (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 230, 234.
