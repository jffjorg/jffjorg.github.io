And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered on September 26, 2024. The defendant had failed to answer the breach of contract claim filed by the plaintiff, and a default judgment was entered against him. However, the defendant moved to set aside the default, arguing that he had consulted with an attorney on or about July 22, 2024, and that he had not received notice of the default. The judge found that the defendant had made a sufficient showing to warrant relief from default, citing the strong public policy in favor of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court. The judge also noted that the defendant's admission that he was uncertain of the status of the case was suggestive of mistake of fact, which is a separate ground for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge has deemed the defendant's answer filed on October 8, 2024 as the operative answer for this action.
