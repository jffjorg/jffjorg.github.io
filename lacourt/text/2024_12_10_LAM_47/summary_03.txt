The court has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury action brought by a minor, KJ, against unknown defendants. KJ seeks to have her mother, Brittany, appointed as her guardian ad litem, and to proceed with her mother using only her first name and last initial. KJ argues that anonymity is necessary due to the nature of the action, which involves alleged bullying and assault. The court has granted KJ's motion to appoint a guardian ad litem without using the guardian's full name, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 372 subdivision (a)(1). The court finds that KJ has demonstrated good cause for the relief requested, and grants the motion.
