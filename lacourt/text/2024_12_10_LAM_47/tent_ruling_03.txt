 Case Number:  24STCV12202    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  47 Plaintiff KJ, by and through her proposed guardian ad litem,
moves for leave for her guardian ad litem to be appointed without the use of
the guardian’s full name. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 subdivision (a)(1)
provides that “[w]hen a minor, a person who lacks legal capacity to make
decisions, or a person for whom a conservator has been appointed is a party,
that person shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or
by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding
is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.”

Plaintiff is a minor who seeks to have her mother, Brittany, appointed as
guardian ad litem in this personal injury matter. Plaintiff seeks to proceed
with her mother only using her first name and last initial, contending that
anonymity is required by the nature of this action as a personal injury action
stemming from alleged bullying and assault. (Declaration of Michelle Iarusso
ISO Mot. para. 5.) Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for the relief
requested. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Appoint Guardian ad Litem
Without Full Names is GRANTED.
