And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the dispute. The plaintiff has alleged discrimination and retaliation, and the defendant has moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement. The judge finds that there is an agreement to arbitrate between the parties, and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the arbitration agreement. The judge also finds that the arbitration agreement delegates questions of arbitrability and enforceability to the arbitrator.

The judge has stayed the action pending resolution of the arbitration, and has set a status conference for December 8, 2025. The moving party is required to give notice of the tentative ruling.

The judge has disagreed with the plaintiff's argument that the defendant has not demonstrated the involvement of interstate commerce, and has found that the defendant has provided sufficient evidence that the FAA applies.

The judge has also found that the arbitration agreement contains a "clear and unmistakable" delegation clause, which delegates questions of arbitrability and enforceability to the arbitrator. The judge has concluded that the agreement is enforceable unless it is revocable under the same defenses as any contract, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.
