STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
This is a landlord-tenant dispute. Plaintiffs allege that
Defendants have engaged in an ongoing campaign of harassment against them.
Plaintiffs assert claims for harassment, invasion of privacy, breach of
contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
Plaintiffs move to compel
further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
(Set Two) Propounded to Defendant Kashani is GRANTED IN PART as to Requests
Nos. 26 through 55.
 
            Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) Propounded to Defendant Yang is
GRANTED IN PART as to Requests Nos. 52 through 81. 
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Three) Propounded to
Defendant Kashani is GRANTED as to Interrogatory No. 78 only.
 
            Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Three)
Propounded to Defendant Yang is GRANTED as to Interrogatory No. 76 only.
 
Defendants are ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses to
these requests without objections within 30 days of this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production
 
            Plaintiffs move to compel further
responses to 39 requests for production propounded to Defendants Yang and
Kashani, each. As the requests and responses at issue are substantively
identical, the Court addresses these motions jointly. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) To make
this showing, “a discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in
reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend
to prove or disprove the fact.” (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224, disapproved of on unrelated grounds by Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557 fn. 8.) 
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day
requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
            Plaintiffs propounded the Requests
for Production at issue on this motion on January 17, 2024. (Declaration of
Earl Washington ISO Mot. ¶ 2.) Defendants served responses by electronic
service on February 16, 2024. (Id.) Accounting for the two-day extension
for electronic service pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, the
deadline to serve notice of this motion was April 3, 2024. (See Code Civ. Proc.
§ 1010.6.) As this motion was filed and served on that date, Plaintiffs’ motion
is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before moving to compel further
responses to requests for production, the party who seeks further responses is
required to meet and confer with the responding party in a good faith attempt
to informally resolve the issues presented in the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2016.040; see also 2031.310(b)(2).) The motion must then be accompanied by a
sworn affidavit which must “state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at informal resolution.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2016.040; see
also 2030.300(b)(1); 2031.310(b)(2).) 
 
The accompanying declaration of
Earl Washington only states that “On March 18, 2024, counsel of record met and
conferred regarding Defendants’ verified responses and Plaintiffs’ requests for
further responses. The parties did not resolve active discovery disputes.” (Declaration
of Earl Washington ISO Mot. ¶ 2.) The Court is not inclined to accept the
conclusory assertion proffered by Plaintiff as evidence of a sufficient meet
and confer effort. Moreover, the
parties’ joint statement filed October 16, 2024 indicates that Plaintiff
entirely failed to meet and confer in good faith during the parties’ subsequent
court-ordered discussions. (Joint Statement filed October 16, 2024; see also
September 23, 2024 Minute Order.) Rather than make an honest and good-faith
effort to informally resolve this dispute, it appears that Plaintiff Washington
merely restated the Plaintiffs’ position. Plaintiffs have not satisfied their
statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
Defective Notice
of Motion
 
            Defendants object to Plaintiffs’
Notice of Motion as defective because it does not specify the legal authority
on which it is based and fails to identify the discovery requests at issue on
the motion. The California Rules of Court require that a notice of motion state
the nature of an order being sought and the grounds for issuance of that order.
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1110.) Further, in the context of a discovery
motion, the Notice of Motion must identify the requests at issue by set and
number. (Cal. Rule of Court 3.1345(d).) As Defendants state, the Notice of
Motion does not comply with these requirements. That said, Plaintiffs’
Memorandum of Points and Authorities specifies both the legal grounds and the
requests for production at issue on this motion, thereby curing the deficiency
in the Notice. (366-386 Geary St. L.P. v. Superior Court (1990) 219
Cal.App.3d 1186, 1200.) 
Defendants’
Evidentiary Objection
 
            Defendants object to portions of the
Declaration of Earl Washington in support of this motion. The Court rules on
those objections as follows:
 
            Objection No. 1: SUSTAINED
for lack of authentication and foundation. (Evid. Code §§ 403; 1400.) 
 
            Objection No. 2: SUSTAINED
for lack of foundation and authentication. (Evid. Code §§403; 1400.)  
 
Good Cause
 
            Plaintiffs move to compel further
responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) Nos. 26 through 65 propounded to
Defendant Kashani and Nos. 52-91 propounded to Defendant Yang. 
 
As stated above, the burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a
separate statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule
3.1345(c).) This burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) To make this showing, “a discovery proponent must identify
a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and explain how the
discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to
other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” (Digital Music
News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224, disapproved of
on unrelated grounds by Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
557 fn. 8.) 
 
            Plaintiffs’ requests for production
fall into four broad categories: (1) communications between the Defendants and
various third parties “relating to Plaintiffs” (Kashani Requests Nos. 26-35;
Yang Requests Nos. 52-61); (2) communications relating to the 2022 sale of the
Runyon (Kashani Nos. 36-45; Yang Nos. 62-71); (3) communications relating to
apartment 30 of the Runyon (Kashani Nos. 46-55; Yang Nos. 72-81); and (4) video
footage produced to Defendants (Kashani Nos. 57-65; Yang Nos. 82-91.) 
 
With respect to the first category, Plaintiffs claim that the Court
previously required production of similar communications “relating to
Plaintiffs” on June 23, 2023. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, the Court did
not rule that such documents were “presumptively” relevant. Rather, the Court found
that Plaintiff Washington’s declaration in support of that motion offered the
required fact-specific showing. (See June 23, 2023 Minute Order p.5.) Here,
however, Plaintiff Washington’s corresponding declaration contains no such
information, and the unsupported assertions in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Points
and Authorities do not constitute a “showing” of good cause. That said, Plaintiffs’
Separate Statements offer more insight, explaining that communications about
Plaintiffs between these Defendants and various other parties are relevant
because they are “foundational” to Plaintiffs’ stalking claims, citing the
then-operative Third Amended Complaint. (See, e.g., Separate Statement ISO Mot.
[Kashani] p.2:2-21.) Plaintiffs have thus demonstrated good cause for these
requests.
 
With respect to the second category, although Plaintiffs’ papers fail to
provide any direct connection to the pleadings, the Fourth Amended Complaint,
filed September 9, 2024, describes certain correspondence in connection with
the 2022 sale of the property that concerns the closure or removal of amenities
in the building. (4AC ¶ 20.) Thus, the requests are directly relevant to the
now-operative pleadings.
 
With respect to the third category, Apartment 30 is the unit which is
alleged to have been occupied by Defendant Kashani to harass Plaintiffs. (See, e.g.,
4AC ¶ 19.) Thus, for the reasons stated with respect to the first category,
Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for these requests.
 
As to the fourth category, however, Plaintiffs offer no explanation as to
how any video footage is relevant to the litigation beyond the bare assertion
of that fact. Plaintiffs do not, as an example, explain how any video footage
might tend to prove or disprove any of the allegations in the pleadings.
Plaintiffs have thus failed to demonstrate good cause for these requests.
 
Defendants’
Responses
 
            Defendants responded to the first
category of requests (Kashani Requests Nos. 26-35; Yang Requests Nos. 52-61) by
objecting to each request as overbroad with respect to time, before either
stating no documents were available (e.g., Kashani Request No. 26) or by
producing certain responsive documents (e.g., Kashani Request No. 28.) Although
Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have withheld certain responsive documents,
Plaintiffs offer no admissible evidence in support of that contention.
Defendants also entirely fail to their justify or even substantively address
their objections to the first category of requests, and, for that reason alone,
Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling further responses to these requests.

 
            With respect to the second and third
categories of requests, Defendants offered boilerplate objections for
overbreadth, vagueness, irrelevance, and invasion of privacy rights, before
either identifying some responsive documents (e.g., Kashani Request No. 45) or
stating no responsive documents existed (No. 46.) Defendants make no effort,
either in their response to the Separate Statement or in their opposition
papers, to substantively justify these objections beyond the conclusory
assertion of their validity. In particular, with respect to privacy, Defendants
fail entirely to identify a legally protected privacy interest, a
reasonable expectation of privacy in these circumstances, or a threatened
intrusion that is serious. (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 552.) Defendants have therefore failed to justify these
objections. 
 
//
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) Propounded to
Defendant Kashani is GRANTED IN PART.
 
            Defendant Kashani is ordered to
provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to Requests Nos. 26
through 55 within 30 days of this order  
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
(Set Two) Propounded to Defendant Yang is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Defendant Yang is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses
without objections to Requests Nos. 52 through 81 within 30 days of this
order  
 
Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
 
Plaintiffs move to compel further responses to special
interrogatories propounded to Defendants. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Timeliness
 
A
motion to compel a further response must be noticed within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.
App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Plaintiffs propounded the special interrogatories at issue on this motion
on January 17, 2024. (Declaration of Earl Washington ISO Mot. ¶ 2.) Defendants
served responses by electronic service on February 16, 2024. (Id.)
Accounting for the two-day extension for electronic service pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010.6, the deadline to serve notice of this motion was
April 3, 2024. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6.) As this motion was filed and
served on that date, Plaintiffs’ motion is timely. 
 
Meet and
Confer
 
A party making a
motion to compel further responses must include a declaration stating facts
showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues
presented by the motion before filing the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2030.310(b).) 
 
The accompanying declaration of
Earl Washington only states that “On March 18, 2024, counsel of record met and
conferred regarding Defendants’ verified responses and Plaintiffs’ requests for
further responses. The parties did not resolve active discovery disputes.”
(Declaration of Earl Washington ISO Mot. ¶ 2.) The Court is not inclined to
accept the conclusory assertion proffered by Plaintiff as evidence of a
sufficient meet and confer effort. Moreover,
the parties’ joint statement filed October 16, 2024 indicates that Plaintiff
entirely failed to meet and confer in good faith during the parties’ subsequent

September 23, 2024 Minute Order.) Rather than make an honest and good-faith
effort to informally resolve this dispute, it appears that Plaintiff Washington
merely restated the Plaintiffs’ position. Plaintiffs have not satisfied their
statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
Defective Notice
of Motion
 
            Defendants object to Plaintiffs’
Notice of Motion as defective because it does not specify the legal authority
on which it is sought and fails to identify the discovery requests at issue on
the motion. The California Rules of Court require that a notice of motion state
the nature of an order being sought and the grounds for issuance of that order.
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1110.) Further, in the context of a discovery

requests for production at issue on this motion, thereby curing the deficiency
in the Notice. (366-386 Geary St. L.P. v. Superior Court (1990) 219
Cal.App.3d 1186, 1200.) 
 
Defendants’
Evidentiary Objection
 
            Defendants object to portions of the
Declaration of Earl Washington in support of this motion. The Court rules on
those objections as follows:
 
            Objection No. 1: SUSTAINED
for lack of authentication and foundation. (Evid. Code §§ 403; 1400.) 
 
            Objection No. 2: SUSTAINED
for lack of foundation and authentication. (Evid. Code §§403; 1400.)  
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiffs
move to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 78 and 80
through 83 propounded to Defendant Kashani, and Special Interrogatories Nos. 76
and 78 through 81 propounded to Defendant Yang. 
 
Special Interrogatory No. 78
propounded to Defendant Kashani asks the respondent to identify her current
residential address. (Defendant Kashani’s Separate Statement ISO Opp. No. 78.)
Defendant objected to the interrogatory as not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence and invading Defendant’s privacy. (Id.) Defendants’
opposition stands on those objections, asserting that Defendant Kashani’s
current residential address is private and irrelevant to this dispute. The
Court disagrees. The operative Fourth Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant
Kashani moved into Unit 30 in the Subject Property as part of a campaign of
harassment against the Plaintiffs. (4AC ¶ 19.) Moreover, although Defendant asserts
a privacy objection, she does not clearly identify a legally protected privacy
interest, a reasonable expectation of privacy in these circumstances, or a
threatened intrusion that is serious. (Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) Defendant has not demonstrated the merits
of her objection to this interrogatory, and Plaintiffs are entitled to an order
compelling a further response.
 
Special
Interrogatories 80 through 83 propounded to Defendant Kashani ask whether
Defendant Kashani or her son’s safety were in jeopardy in November 2022, and if
so, why. (Defendant Kashani’s Separate Statement ISO Opp. Nos. 80-83.)
Defendant objected to each interrogatory as overbroad as to time, vague and
ambiguous as to “safety” and “jeopardy,” and not reasonably calculated to lead
to admissible evidence. The Court concurs with Defendant that these
interrogatories do not seek information which is reasonably calculated to lead
to admissible evidence. These requests are not germane to the allegations in
the operative pleading, and Plaintiffs’ sole basis for the assertion that
Defendant Kashani claimed her safety was at risk is a purported text
conversation of unknown provenance and unclear authenticity. Plaintiffs are not
entitled to an order compelling further responses to these interrogatories. 
 
As to the Special Interrogatories
propounded to Defendant Yang, Interrogatory No. 76 is identical to
Interrogatory No. 78 propounded to Defendant Kashani, and Interrogatories 78
through 81 to Defendant Yang are likewise identical to Interrogatories Nos. 80
through 83 to Defendant Kashani. The responses to those interrogatories are
likewise identical. (See Defendant Yang’s Separate Statement ISO Opp.)
Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are
entitled to an order compelling further responses to Special Interrogatory No.
76 to Defendant Yang, but not to the remaining interrogatories.
