And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery responses is referred to a discovery referee. The Plaintiff had requested to compel responses to multiple sets of discovery, which the court finds is unfair and manipulates the Court's reservation system. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff failed to attach a meet and confer declaration to the motion, and advises the Plaintiff to provide one in the future.

The judge has appointed Ann Kough as the discovery referee, with a cap of $10,000 on expenses. The motions will be addressed by the referee, who will make recommendations to the court. The judge believes that this approach will be the most beneficial use of a referee and will help to efficiently address the discovery issues in the case.
