MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Hearing Date: 8/14/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV40586 STATE OF
CALIFORNIA vs ARNOLDO RODRIGUEZ
Moving Party: Plaintiff State of California
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED 
 
This consolidated
workers' compensation subrogation and personal injury action arises from a
three-vehicle, rear-end collision that occurred on November 20, 2019, in Los
Angeles, California. The State of California filed its complaint on November 3,
2021, and Maria Hernandez Luna filed her complaint on November 12, 2021. The
actions were consolidated on June 13, 2022. The parties have signed a
stipulation to continue the trial to sometime in January 2025 due to a second mediation
scheduled for November 2024 and counsel’s unavailability in December 2024. The
Court finds good cause to continue the trial given that the mediation is a
second effort and the mediator is unavailable until November. However, given
the age of this case and that this will be the fourth trial continuance, no
further continuances will be granted. 
The new Trial Date is
set for January __, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued
to January __, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. All case-related deadlines remain tied to the
September 3, 2024, trial date.
