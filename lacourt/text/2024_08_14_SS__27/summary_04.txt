And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted summary adjudication to the defendant, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (KFHP), on the plaintiff's negligence and wrongful death causes of action. The judge found that the defendant met its burden of showing that the plaintiff's daughter, Nicole Lorraine, was not acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the traffic collision that caused her death. The judge concluded that Lorraine was not performing any work-related tasks for KFHP at the time of the incident and was not authorized to perform any work outside of Kaiser West LA.

The judge also granted summary adjudication on the plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim, finding that KFHP did not assign a company vehicle to Lorraine and did not require her to use a particular method of transportation for commuting. The judge concluded that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence to raise a triable issue of fact on this claim.

The judge noted that the plaintiff's arguments that Lorraine's supervisors were aware of her poor work performance and mental instability the day prior to the incident did not raise a triable issue of fact regarding KFHP's liability for negligence or wrongful death. The judge also found that Lorraine's leaving work early without informing her supervisor did not constitute job abandonment, as she was not performing any errands or tasks for KFHP at the time of her departure.
