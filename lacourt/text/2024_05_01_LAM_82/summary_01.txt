**Summary of the Tentative Ruling**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for a writ of mandate filed by Bel-Air Bay Club (BABC) against the California Coastal Commission (Commission). BABC seeks an exemption from the Commission's coastal development permit (CDP) requirements to replace a portion of its lanai structure, which was damaged in January 2023. The Commission denied the exemption application, finding that the damage was caused by normal wave action and scouring over many years, rather than the severe winter storms in January 2023.

**Facts and Issues**

The lanai structure was built in the 1920s and has been subject to periodic flooding and scouring due to its location on the beach. Experts from Moffatt & Nichol, BABC's coastal consultants, have reported on the structural instability of the lanai and the need for repairs. In 2023, a severe winter storm caused significant damage to the lanai, which was later found to be structurally unsound.

**Legal Issues**

The court must review the Commission's decision under a deferential standard of review, which means that the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission unless the Commission's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

**Holding**

The court finds that the Commission's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support. The evidence shows that the lanai was structurally unstable and prone to damage from wave action and scouring over many years, which was exacerbated by the January 2023 storm. The court does not find that the storm was the sole or predominant cause of the damage to the lanai.

**Conclusions**

Based on the evidence and the deferential standard of review, the court denies the petition for a writ of mandate and affirms the Commission's decision denying the exemption application.
