[1] Martinez argues
that a stay would be against the public interest because of alleged prejudice
to another “terminated employee,” Nelly Corcio, who reportedly agreed to a
continuance of her own administrative appeal until this court decides the
instant writ petition.  (Oppo. 3.)  Martinez does not submit a declaration or
other evidence supporting this contention. 
Also, a stay of Commission’s order would not impact the amount of time
required for the instant writ petition to be adjudicated.  Martinez does not show that Corcio’s
individual interests weigh against a stay.
