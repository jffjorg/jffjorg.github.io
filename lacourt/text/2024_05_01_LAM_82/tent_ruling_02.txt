[1] Neither party has
cited a published appellate decision interpreting section 30610(g).  
 


[2] Respondent makes
additional arguments.  Respondent argues
that “[t]he disaster exemption is also unavailable
because the force that damaged the lanai was not beyond BABC’s control.”  (Oppo. 15-16.)  Respondent also argues that the Decision is
consistent with Coastal Act Objectives and also special conditions in the 2004
CDPs.  (Oppo. 18-19.)  The court need not address these
arguments.
