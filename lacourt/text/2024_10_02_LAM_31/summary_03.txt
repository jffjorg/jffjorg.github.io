Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer with motion to strike filed by the plaintiff, Celeste M. Mulrooney, against the cross-complaint filed by the defendant, Susan Florence Scalzo. The cross-complaint alleges intentional misrepresentation. The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the cross-complaint fails to state a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation because it lacks specificity. The judge has also found that the cross-complaint is not uncertain, vague, or ambiguous, and that the claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has granted leave to amend the cross-complaint and ordered the defendant to file and serve a second amended cross-complaint within 15 days.
