And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling based on the information presented in the Complaint. The Complaint alleges that life settlement investments are contracts where an insured sells the benefits of their life insurance policy to a third party investor, such as Reliant, at a discount, in exchange for immediate cash. The third party investor, Reliant, then sells fractional interests in the policy benefits to retail investors. The Complaint also notes that premiums may need to be paid if the insured out-lives their projected life expectancy. The Judge has taken these facts into consideration and will consider them further at the upcoming Court Hearing.
