And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint in the case of Joseph Perry v. Reliant Life Shares, LLC, et al. The lawsuit is a fraud action stemming from Perry's investment in Reliant's life settlement investments, which were allegedly fraudulent. The First Amended Complaint seeks to add factual allegations and specify causes of action against the defendants, including Reliant and seven Doe defendants. The motion complies with the requirements of the California Rules of Court and the court finds no prejudice will result if leave is granted. The judge has granted the motion and directed the plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint within five court days.
