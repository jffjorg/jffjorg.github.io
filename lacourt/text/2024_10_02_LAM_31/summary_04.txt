```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by defendant Mulrooney against plaintiff Scalzo's fraud claim. Mulrooney argues that the claim fails because it lacks allegations of a legally-recognized relationship between the parties, material facts, and a legally-recognized means of obtaining an ownership interest in the property. The judge disagrees, finding that Scalzo's intentional misrepresentation claim does not require a fiduciary relationship and that Mulrooney misreads the allegations of the complaint. The judge notes that Scalzo alleges that Mulrooney intended to use direct payments to the mortgage lender to falsely build a case for ownership, which is part of a larger scheme. The court sustains the demurrer on other grounds.
