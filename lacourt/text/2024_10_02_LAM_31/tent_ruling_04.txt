[1] Mulrooney also argues the fraud
claim fails because (1) there is no allegation of any legally-recognized
relationship between the parties that confers standing to pursue a fraud action
against a sibling; (2) there is no allegation of material fact; and (3) the
alleged secret intent by Mulrooney to obtain an ownership interest in the
property by directly making her mortgage payments to the mortgage lender is a
misstatement of the recognized law regarding how a party obtains on ownership
interest in property.  Mulrooney’s first
and second arguments are based on a reading of Scalzo’s fraud claim as one for
concealment/suppression of a material fact. 
Although that cause of action does require some fiduciary duty between
the parties and the concealment of a material fact (see Hoffman v. 162 North
Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1186-87), Scalzo alleges an intentional
misrepresentation claim.  Such a fraud
claim does not require the existence of a fiduciary relationship.  (See CACI No. 1900.)  Further, Mulrooney misreads the allegations of
the FACC.  Scalzo does not allege that
Mulrooney could obtain an ownership interest in the property by simply making direct
payments to the mortgage lender.  Scalzo
specifically alleges that Mulrooney “intended to use the fact that she made
partial payments directly to the mortgage lender, with Scalzo’s permission and
consent, to falsely build a case that she had an ownership
interest in the Property.”  (FACC, ¶ 11,
emphasis added.)  In other words, the
direct payments to the mortgage lender were allegedly part of a larger scheme
to establish ownership interest.  The
court sustains the demurrer on other grounds.
