```

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the case is dismissed for lack of prosecution, as the plaintiff has not shown sufficient diligence in bringing the case to trial despite the extraordinary circumstances of the suspension of mail service to Russia and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing of efforts to overcome the obstacles presented by these circumstances, and therefore does not find that the statute of limitations should be tolled.
