```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings in this matter. The court found that Petersen had produced prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate, but Lewis challenged the validity of the agreement, alleging that his signature was obtained by fraud in the execution. The court found that Lewis's account of the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement was credible and that Petersen did not offer any evidence to refute his account. Therefore, the court denied Petersen's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the proceedings. The court also denied Bistagne Defendants' joinder to Petersen's motion.
