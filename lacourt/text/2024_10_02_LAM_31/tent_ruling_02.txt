[1] As alleged in the Complaint, “Life
settlement investments are contracts whereby an insured sells the benefits of
his or her life insurance policy(s) to a third party purchaser/investor at a
discount, in exchange for immediate cash. The third party investor becomes the
beneficiary of the policy(s) and is thereby entitled to a death benefit equal
to the face value of the policy upon the insured’s demise, if the policy is
valid and kept in force. The third party investor, which was Reliant in this
case, then sells fractional interests in the benefits of the policies to retail
investors.”  (Complaint, ¶ 5.)


[2] As alleged in the Complaint, premiums
might have to be paid if the insured out-lived their projected life
expectancies.  (Complaint, ¶ 7.)
