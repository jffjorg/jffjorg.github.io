BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises out of Plaintiff
Zix, Inc.’s (“Plaintiff”) claim for quiet title for four
properties located at 314 E. Mission Road, #A-D, San Gabriel, CA 91776, APN:
5368-019-046, 5368-019-047, 5368-019-048 and 5368-019-049 (“Subject
Properties”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on April 13, 2023, alleging four
causes of action for (1) quiet title, (2) fraud, (3) partition, and (4)
declaratory relief.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Defendants’
motion to set aside default and default judgment are ordered CONTINUED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both discretionary and
mandatory relief. [Citation.]” (Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th
298, 302.)  The discretionary relief provisions of Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subd. (b) provide in relevant part: “The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application
shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” 
 
The mandatory relief provision provides that a court shall grant
relief “whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after
entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc.
section 473, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants
move to set aside the entry of default and default judgment. On June 27, 2023,
default was entered against both Defendants. On November 15, 2023, a default
judgment prove-up hearing was held. On December 4, 2023, this court entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff. Defendants filed their motions to set aside
default and judgment on January 3, 2024. 
 
            As
a preliminary issue, Defendant’s reserved hearing date is improper. Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), requires moving papers to be
served at least 16 court  days before the
hearing plus two calendar days for the service similar to electronic service.
Defendants’ motions were served on January 2, 2024, and filed on January 3,
2024. Thus, Defendants’ motions should be filed, at the latest, by December 27,
2024. The current hearing date is procedurally defective. 
 
            It is
also unclear what basis Defendants seeking to set aside default. However, based
on Defendants’ two paragraph declaration, it appears that Defendants argue that
relief should be granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b) and (d).
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides that
application for relief  “shall be made within
a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months”. In Pulte Homes Corp. v. Williams
Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 267, 273, a motion for relief was
filed within six months of entry of default judgment but more than six months
after entry of default. The Court held that the “trial court therefore could
not set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section
473. And because it could not set aside the default, it also could not
set aside the default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, because that would be ‘an idle act.’ ” (Ibid.) Similarly here, the
underlying default was June 27, 2023, a few days past the six-month deadline
for Defendants to move for relief. Thus, Defendants’ motions are untimely. 
 
            That
leaves only the basis of void judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (d).
 
            “A party may move
to set aside a void judgment under section 473, subdivision (d).
‘A default judgment is void if the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the
parties.’ [Citation.] A default judgment entered against a defendant who was not
served in the manner prescribed by statute is void. [Citation.] ‘Under section 473, subdivision (d), the court may set aside a
default judgment which is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due
to improper service.’ ” (First American Title Ins. Co. v. Banerjee (2022)
87 Cal.App.5th 37, 42.) 
 
            “Section 415.20, subdivisions (a) and (b) authorize
substitute service in lieu of personal delivery. ‘If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, ... a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the
summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode,
usual place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States
Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a competent member of
the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of
business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service
post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the
contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the
complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at
the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left. Service of a
summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.’ (§ 415.20, subd. (b).)” (Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371-72.) 
 
            Plaintiff
filed two proofs of service that stated that Defendants were served by
substituted service at 2799 S. Native Avenue, Rowland Heights, California 91748
on May 5, 2023. The proofs of service state that the documents were left with a
John Doe occupant in his 60s who refused to provide his name. The process
server provides he previously attempted to serve Defendants at the location on
May 2 and 3 of 2023. In support of his argument that service was improper,
Plaintiff merely contends that he did not live at the Rowland Heights address
because his ex-girlfriend’s mom lived there so he stayed at an alternative
residence. (Ji Decl. ¶ 2.) In opposition, Plaintiff
contends that Li did in fact reside at 2799 S. Native Avenue, evinced by the
fact that Li owned the property located at 2799 S. Native Avenue and listed
that address when attempting to refinance the loan for the Subject Properties.
(Yang Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)
 
            At the current juncture, because Defendants’ motions
failed to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b), the hearing on Plaintiff’s motions are ordered continued 30
days. Defendants are ordered to submit further declarations demonstrating why
proof of service was improper. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’
motion to set aside default and default judgment are ordered CONTINUED to Feb
7, 2024 at 8:30a.m.
 
Moving
Party to provide notice.
