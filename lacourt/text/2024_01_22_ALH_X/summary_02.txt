And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge, Joel L. Lofton, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Zix, Inc. v. US Longton, Inc. et al. The ruling addresses the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them. The Judge finds that the defendants' motion is untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the default was entered. The Judge also notes that the defendants failed to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), which requires moving papers to be served at least 16 court days before the hearing. The Judge orders the hearing on the defendants' motion to be continued 30 days, and instructs the defendants to submit further declarations demonstrating why proof of service was improper. The Judge also notes that the proof of service filed by the plaintiff raises a question about whether the defendants were properly served, and orders the defendants to provide additional information on this issue.
