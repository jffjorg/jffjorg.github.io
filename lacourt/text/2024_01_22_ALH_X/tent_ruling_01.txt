RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant Octavio Covarrubias
moves for an order compelling Defendant Alfred Murillo to provide responses to
his discovery requests.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff John
Morales’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that he suffered injuries as a result of an
automobile collision on November 6, 2021. Plaintiff filed this complaint on
October 27, 2022. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Covarrubias’s motion for an order compelling a response to his
form interrogatories and requests for the production of documents is GRANTED.
 
Murillo is ordered to provide code-complaint responses without
objections within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
            Covarrubias’s request for sanction is granted for a total of $340.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant Octavio Covarrubias (“Covarrubias”) moves for an order
compelling Defendant Alfred Murillo (“Murillo”) to provide responses to his
discovery requests. Covarrubias provides he served discovery requests
consisting of form interrogatories and requests for the production of documents
on Murillo on March 30, 2023. (McCabe Decl. ¶ 2.) Covarrubias also provides that Murillo has not
provided discovery responses. (Id. ¶¶
3-4.) 
 
            Covarrubias has demonstrated that he served discovery
responses, but Murillo has failed to provide responses. Covarrubias’s motion to
compel responses to his requests for the production of documents and form
interrogatories is granted. Covarrubias’s request for sanctions is granted for
2 hours worked at a rate of $140 plus $60 for a total of $340.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Covarrubias’s motion for an order compelling a response to his
form interrogatories and requests for the production of documents is GRANTED.
 
Murillo is ordered to provide code-complaint responses without
objections within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
            Covarrubias’s request for sanction is granted for a total of $340.
