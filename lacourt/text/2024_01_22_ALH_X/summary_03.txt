```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to set aside the entry of default is granted. The defendants argue that the plaintiff improperly sought default because an automatic extension was in place. The court finds that the defendants' declaration for the purpose of seeking an extension was timely, and that the parties were unable to meet and confer at least 5 days before the date the demurrer was due. Therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to the automatic extension, and the defaults entered against the defendants are void. The court orders that the demurrer currently scheduled for July 16, 2024, be advanced to April 22, 2024, at 8:30 am.
