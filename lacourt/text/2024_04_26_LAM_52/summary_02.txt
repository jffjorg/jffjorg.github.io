And here is the English-text summary:

The defendants, Armando Berriz and Berriz Law Group, PC, have moved for judgment on the pleadings on the plaintiff, The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, APC's, first amended complaint. The dispute arises from a personal injury action between the plaintiff, a discharged attorney, and the defendants, a subsequent attorney and law firm. The defendants rely on the rule that an attorney must bring a separate action against the client to establish the existence of the lien, determine the amount of the lien, and enforce it. However, the court finds that this rule does not apply in this case, as the plaintiff has sued the client, Karen Edmonson, and the defendants have not provided any authority requiring the former attorney to bring two independent actions. The court denies the defendants' motion and allows the plaintiff's claims against the defendants to proceed.
