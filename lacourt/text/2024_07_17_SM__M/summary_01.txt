And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff for failure to obey a court order to pay monetary sanctions. The Defendant had sought to impose sanctions in the amount of $660.00 and $1,060.00, respectively, for the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order. The Judge ruled that while the Defendant's motion was not without merit, the failure to pay monetary sanctions alone did not justify terminating sanctions. Additionally, the Judge was disinclined to grant sanctions-on-sanctions, as monetary sanctions are enforceable as judgments under the typical procedures available to such orders.
