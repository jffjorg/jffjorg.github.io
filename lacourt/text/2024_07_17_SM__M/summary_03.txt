And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's initial responses to discovery requests, including form and special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendants had propounded the discovery requests on February 20, 2024, and the plaintiff had failed to respond, despite being given five extensions. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to respond within 10 days without objections. Additionally, the judge has imposed sanctions of $1,110.00 on the plaintiff and their counsel of record, to be paid in 30 days, for failing to justify their non-response and opposing the motion to compel.
