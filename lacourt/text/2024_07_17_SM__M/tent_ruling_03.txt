CASE NO.:                24SMCV00082
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   7/17/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required.  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendants Mona S. Srivastava and Luiz-Carlos Da Silva Dias Jr. move
for orders compelling Plaintiff Myles Anicete’s initial responses to: 1)
form and special interrogatories, set one; and 2) requests for production of
documents, set one. Defendants also requests $555.00 in sanctions for each
motion against Plaintiff and counsel of record, Steven Zelig.
 
Defendants
meet their burden to show Plaintiff failed to respond to duly served discovery.
On February 20, 2024, Defendants propounded the subject discovery upon
Plaintiff. (See Germany Decls., ¶¶ 2, Exs. A.) Plaintiff was given five
extensions, but did not respond to the discovery requests. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs.
B.) Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED. Responses are due within 10 days
without objections.
 
Sanctions are
mandatory. The Court must sanction any party that unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response, “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (See, e.g., CCP, § 2030.290(c).) Plaintiff failed to oppose, and
therefore failed to justify their non-response. Sanctions are therefore imposed
in the noticed, total amount of $1,110.00 against Plaintiff and
counsel of record. Sanctions are to be paid in 30 days.
