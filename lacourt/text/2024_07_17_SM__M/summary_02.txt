The judge has also sustained the demurrer as to the emotional distress claim, finding that the complaint does not plead extreme and outrageous conduct or intent on the part of Defendant. However, the judge has given Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint as to the defamation claim. The judge has denied leave to amend the complaint as to the emotional distress claim, finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish a cause of action. The plaintiff has 20 days to file an amended complaint consistent with this order.
