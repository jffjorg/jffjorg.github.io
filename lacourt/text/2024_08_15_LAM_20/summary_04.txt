Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Eva Niño's Motion to set aside the Court's order granting the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP). The MJOP was granted on March 27, 2024, and the Plaintiff seeks relief under Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b). The Judge holds that the mandatory provision of CCP § 473(b) does not apply because the dismissal was not the procedural equivalent of a default. The discretionary provision of CCP § 473(b) requires a satisfactory excuse for the default and diligence in seeking relief, which the Plaintiff has not shown. The Judge also notes that the stipulated judgment in the unlawful detainer action cannot be set aside, and even if the MJOP order could be set aside, the stipulated judgment would remain in force and the issue of res judicata would remain. The Motion is denied, and the Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is granted.
