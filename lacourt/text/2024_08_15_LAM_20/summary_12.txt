And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case between University of Southern California (USC) and Aluminum Precision Products, Inc. (Defendant). USC alleges that the Defendant underpaid for medical services provided to three patients at USC's facilities. The Defendant demurred to the Complaint, arguing that it failed to state sufficient facts. The Court has sustained the demurrer as to the first, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action (breach of implied contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and account stated) with twenty days leave to amend. The Court has also sustained the demurrer as to the UCL claim, without leave to amend. The Court found that USC's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the UCL claim does not warrant injunctive relief. The Court encouraged counsel to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
