The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Rafael Castillo to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for admissions.

The judge has granted Castillo's motion in part, ordering Loomis to provide further responses to certain interrogatories and requests for admissions. However, the judge has denied Castillo's motion with respect to other interrogatories and requests for admissions that are deemed to be overbroad or overburdensome. The judge has also set an order to show cause (OSC) re: discovery referee to address the parties' unreasonable discovery practices. The judge has declined to award sanctions at this time.
