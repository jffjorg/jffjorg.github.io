English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Eric Harmon in the case of Elaine Strother v. Bryan Gusdorf (Case Number: 23VECV05217). The defendant, Bryan Gusdorf, moved for terminating sanctions and the dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint due to the plaintiff's failure to timely respond to discovery requests and failure to pay monetary sanctions. The court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery orders was not willful, and that a lesser sanction would be effective to compel compliance. The court noted that this was the first time the plaintiff had failed to comply with the discovery orders, and that the defendant had not made any efforts to obtain the discovery since the court's order on May 7, 2024.
