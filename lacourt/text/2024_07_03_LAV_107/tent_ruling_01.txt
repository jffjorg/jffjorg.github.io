COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  RULING RE: 
Motion for Terminating Sanctions



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE
CASE]:        
Defendant Bryan Gusdorf moves for
terminating sanctions dismissing plaintiff Elaine Strother’s complaint. Defendant’s motion is denied.
 
I. BACKGROUND
On November 22, 2023, plaintiff Elaine Strother (“Plaintiff”)
initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint alleging a single cause of action
for motor vehicle negligence related to an incident with defendant Bryan
Gusdorf (“Defendant”) that occurred on January 3, 2022. (Complaint p. 4.) 
 
On January 5, 2024, Defendant propounded discovery requests
on Plaintiff. (Motion p. 1.) 
 
On May 7, 2024, this court granted Defendant’s motion to
compel responses to form interrogatories, motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories, and motion to compel responses to demand for identification
and inspection of documents. (5/7/24 Minute Order p. 4.) This court ordered
Plaintiff to serve responses to the three discovery requests within 20 days and
to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant. (Ibid.)
 
On June 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for
terminating sanctions (the “Motion”), which is unopposed.
 
III. LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may impose a terminating sanction by an
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d)(1).) “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery
abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of
the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach
to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of
New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at 992.) “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to protect the interests of
the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Ibid.) “But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.,
quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279–280); Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690,
702, quoting Doppes and Mileikowsky.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
For example, the Third District held that terminating
sanctions were warranted when a party repeatedly failed to propound adequate
discovery responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty
Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
1093.) In Mileikowsky, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to
compel created a record “replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to
answer discovery requests.” (Mileikowsky, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th
at 279–280.)¿ 
¿¿ 
The court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly,
but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p.
992.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must
make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to
serve the required discovery responses. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los
Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall
v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)¿¿
 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
“The terminating
sanctions sought by Defendants is the dismissal of [Plaintiff’s] complaint or
other further relief as the Court deems just and proper.” (Motion p. 1.)
Defendant explains that as of the date of the filing of the Motion, no response
to the three sets of discovery requests that this court ordered Plaintiff to
respond to on May 7, 2024 had been received, nor had Defendant received payment
of the monetary sanctions that this court ordered Plaintiff to pay Defendant.
(Kothary Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
This court
observes that this is the first time in this action that Plaintiff has failed
to timely comply with this court’s discovery order, and that only monetary
sanctions have so far been imposed on Plaintiff. This case is therefore unlike
that in Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc., supra,
163 Cal.App.4th 1093, in which the sanctioned party had repeatedly failed to
propound adequate discovery responses. And, this case is therefore unlike that
in Mileikowsky, in which other parties had already brought motions to
compel against the sanctioned party five times. Here, the three motion to
compel brought by Defendant are the only discovery motions that have been heard
against Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s failure to timely comply with this court’s May 7
order to respond to the discovery requests does not show a “pattern” of
discovery abuse, and we see no reason why a lesser sanction would not be
effective to compel Plaintiff’s compliance with this court’s orders. Following Lang
v. Hochman, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th 1225 at 1246, we also consider the number
of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery. Although Defendant
submits with the Motion a declaration by his counsel, the declaration is silent
as to any informal attempts to contact Plaintiff regarding her responses to the
discovery requests. We see no indication that Defendant has made any effort
since this court made its order on May 7 to obtain the discovery from
Plaintiff. Thus, we see no indication that Plaintiff’s failure to timely comply
with this court’s May 7 order was willful. We therefore may not impose the
“ultimate sanction” against Plaintiff.
 
Accordingly, this
court DENIES the Motion.
