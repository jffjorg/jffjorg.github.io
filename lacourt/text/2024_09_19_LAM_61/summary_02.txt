Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Jesus Daniel Benitez to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Jorge Alamilla Perez and Jenny Colindres Morales. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the Complaint does not state any facts sufficient to support the motor vehicle negligence claim. However, the judge has found that the Complaint is sufficient to survive demurrer. The Complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs were injured on January 4, 2023, at the intersection of Spring and Aliso Streets in Los Angeles, and that the Defendant's negligent operation of a motor vehicle caused their injury. The judge has concluded that the Complaint is reasonably read to state that the Defendant's negligent operation of a motor vehicle caused the Plaintiffs' injury, and that the Defendant has not shown that the Complaint is so vague that it cannot reasonably respond. Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED, and the Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days of this Order.
