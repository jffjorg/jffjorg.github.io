And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the parties' dispute over whether a report is absolutely protected by the litigation privilege. The report is alleged to be defamatory and damages the plaintiff's reputation. The defendants argue that the report is protected by the litigation privilege, while the plaintiff argues that it is not. The judge notes that the report contains errors and that the two petitions filed by the parties are identical except for the gender of the conservatee. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's reliance on a previous case is misplaced and that the alleged potential financial conflicts of interest were leveled against the defendant Cohen, not the plaintiff. The judge will discuss this matter further in the written opinion.
