Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the Special Motion to Strike the Complaint filed by the defendants, Frank D. Lanterman Regional Center, Inc. et al., against the plaintiff, Selma Blunk. The court also overrules the demurrer filed by the defendants as moot. The court finds that the plaintiff's entire complaint is based on protected speech, namely the report submitted to the court during the limited conservatorship petition, and that the litigation privilege applies to the report sent to Gloria Cohen, a co-conservator. The court further finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide admissible evidence to support her claims that the statements in the report are false. As a result, the court grants the Special Motion to Strike the Complaint and overrules the demurrer as moot.
