[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



            
            Plaintiff KC Jewelry, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendants Zakaria Jewelry, Inc. and Khaled Fuad Zakaria aka
Khaled Zakaria. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $30,201.80, comprising $27,936.25 in damages, $503.84 in
interest, $561.71 in costs, and $1,200.00 in attorney’s fees. 
            The Court notes a few defects with the
submitted default judgment package.¿
First,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]ttorney’s fees requested in the
within action are requested in the sum of $1,200.00, pursuant to Civil Code §1717.5(a), based on the Second Cause of
Action of Plaintiff’s Complaint for Open Book Account.” (Tabibi Decl., ¶ 3.) The Court
notes that Civil Code section 1717.5, subdivision (a)
provides in part that “[i]f there is a written agreement between the
parties signed by the person to be charged, the fees provided by this section
may not be imposed unless that agreement contains a statement that the
prevailing party in any action between the parties is entitled to the fees
provided by this section.” 
In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that
“[b]etween in or about October 2019 and in or about September 2022, Plaintiff
and Defendants Zakaria Jewelry, Zakaria OC, Khaled, Eva, Mary, Kamil, Ihab,
Nasim, and Does 1 through 50, inclusive, and each of them, among other
transactions, entered into a written agreement for the consignment of
diamonds/jewelry goods from Plaintiff to Defendants Zakaria Jewelry, Zakaria
OC, Khaled, Eva, Mary, Kamil, Ihab, Nasim,, [sic] and Does 1 through 100,
inclusive, and each of them, having an agreed value of $28,286.25, for
examination and inspection by prospective purchasers.” (Compl., ¶ 12.) However,
Plaintiff does not appear to provide a copy of such written agreement or
demonstrate that any such agreement “contains a statement that the prevailing
party in any action between the parties is entitled to the fees provided by
this section.” (Civ. Code, § 1717.5, subd. (a).) 
Second, Plaintiff seeks
interest from the dates of July 5, 2023 through October 6, 2023. (Youssian
Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s calculations appear to indicate that there are 94
days between July 5, 2023 and October 6, 2023. (Ibid.)
However, there are 93 days between these dates. 
Accordingly, the request
for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice. The Court will
discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment
package.
