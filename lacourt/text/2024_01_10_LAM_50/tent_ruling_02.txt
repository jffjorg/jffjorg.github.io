[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
DEMURRER BY DEFENDANTS
  JOSEPH DANIEL DAVIS AND HILARY DAVIS TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
            Plaintiff
Douglas A. Bagby (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December 22, 2022 against
defendant Joseph Daniel Davis. 
            On
August 31, 2023, Plaintiff submitted a Verified Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) against defendants Joseph Daniel Davis, Hilary Davis, and Randi
Desnoes. The Court notes that Plaintiff’s SAC indicates that it was
“electronically received” on “08/31/2023.”
The SAC alleges causes of action for (1) “perjury by Defendants Joseph
D. Davis and Hilary Davis Regarding the Transfer of Title of the Ketchum Home
to Hilary Davis,” (2) “intentionally transferring $3.5 million to Nevis Island
to ‘Hinder, Delay, or Defraud’ Plaintiff,” (3) “perjury regarding [Defendant
Joseph D. Davis’s] alleged move to Florida in 2020,” (4) “transfers of assets
to Hilary Davis to ‘hinder, delay, or defraud’ Plaintiff,” (5) “aiding and
abetting defendant Joseph D. Davis in violating the Uniform Voidable
Transactions Act,” (6) “violating orders of the court,” and (7) “assets
transferred to any such Doe Defendants.”[1]

            Joseph Daniel Davis and Hilary Davis
(jointly, the “Davis Defendants”) now demur to the first, second, third,
fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action of the SAC, as well as the request
for punitive damages in the SAC. Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion
As an initial matter, the Court notes that the Davis
Defendants’ counsel’s declaration filed in support of the demurrer indicates, inter
alia, that “[o]n October 2, 2023 I wrote to Plaintiff Douglas A.
Bagby with respect to an anticipated demurrer on behalf of Defendant Joseph
Daniel Davis and Hilary Davis to the Second Amended complaint. A true copy of
my letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. Mr. Bagby did not reply to my
letter.” (Nemecek Decl., ¶ 2.) 
The Court notes that the Davis Defendants’ counsel’s
declaration and the letter
attached thereto as Exhibit 1 do not
demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person. Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement
can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”
(Emphasis added.)
 Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer. 
In
addition, as set forth above, the SAC shows that it was “electronically
received” on August 31, 2023 and the docket shows “entered 9/1/23.” It is
unclear whether the SAC has been “filed.” The Court notes that on August 4,
2023, the parties filed a “Stipulation of the Parties Regarding the Filing of a
Second Amended Complaint and Response by Defendants.” The Stipulation provides,
inter alia, that “Plaintiff shall file and serve a Second Amended
Complaint on Defendants…within thirty (30) days of this Stipulation.” An Order
on the Stipulation was issued on August 4, 2023. 
In light
of the foregoing, the hearing on the Davis Defendants’
demurrer is continued to _______________,
2024
at 2 p.m. in Dept. 50.¿
The Davis Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiffs¿within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, the Davis Defendants
are to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to
meet and confer in compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿The Davis Defendants shall also include in such declaration
an update regarding the status of the filing of the SAC. 
The Davis Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.¿
