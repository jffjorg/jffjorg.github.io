And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Background**: The case involves a dispute over real property and a deed of trust. The plaintiff, Siranush Akherdyan, filed a complaint against the defendants, Masis Tamazyan and Elen Tahmasian. The defendants filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and others. The plaintiff was granted a default judgment against one of the defendants, Soorage Tomasian, who is now seeking to set it aside.

**Discussion**: The court is considering Tomasian's motion to set aside the default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The court notes that the law favors trial and disposition on the merits, and that any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.

**Facts**: Tomasian received service of the cross-complaint, but hired an attorney who did not inform him of the need to file a responsive pleading. Tomasian was surprised by the entry of default and hired a new attorney to represent him. He has submitted a copy of his proposed answer to the cross-complaint.

**Conclusion**: Based on the facts and lack of opposition, the court finds that Tomasian has demonstrated good cause for setting aside the default judgment. The motion is granted, and the default judgment is set aside. Tomasian is ordered to file his proposed answer to the cross-complaint within 10 days and to give notice of this order.
