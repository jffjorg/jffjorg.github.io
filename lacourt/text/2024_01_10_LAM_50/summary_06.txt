The Judge, Hon. Teresa A.

The Plaintiff seeks judgment in the amount of $30,201.80, comprising damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. However, the Judge notes several defects with the submitted default judgment package, including the lack of a written agreement that meets the requirements of Civil Code §1717.5(a) for attorney's fees and an error in the calculation of interest. As a result, the Judge denies the request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss with the Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
