[1]The
Court notes that default was entered by the Clerk
against Tomasian on November 21, 2023, default judgment has not
yet been entered by the Court. Thus, the Court construes the instant motion as
one to set aside the subject November 21, 2023 default. Tomasian’s motion asserts,
inter alia, that “[t]he
Court entered default judgment against Defendants on November 21, 2023, so this
Motion is well within the six-month limit proscribed by statute.” (Mot. at p.
2:21-23.)
