Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition filed by the Malibu County Estates Homeowners Association (HOA) to reduce the percentage of votes necessary to amend the CC&Rs. The HOA seeks to amend the CC&Rs to allow for the conversion of the HOA into a gated community and to increase the annual assessments. The Judge finds that the Proposed Amendments are reasonable and that the HOA has met the statutory requirements for reducing the percentage of votes necessary to amend the CC&Rs. The Judge notes that the HOA has conducted a reasonably diligent effort to permit all eligible members to vote on the Proposed Amendments and that the amendments are rationally related to the purpose of the HOA. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further argument and evidence presented by the parties.
