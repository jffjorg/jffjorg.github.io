  Case Number:  22SMCV01790    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Farzan v. Passebani CASE NO.:                22SMCV01790 MOTION:                  Motion  to Compel Initial Discovery Responses  HEARING DATE:   1/10/2024    Legal  Standard   If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to  serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The  statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have  been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of  interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to  respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach  v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.)    Pursuant to CCP section 2033.280(b), a party may move for  an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely  respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA  must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of  any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a  monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court  “shall” grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party  to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the  hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that  is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).)    Analysis               Defendant/Cross-Complainant Mahmoud  Passebani moves to compel Plaintiff Janet Farzan’s responses to Form  Interrogatories, set one; Special Interrogatories, set one; and Requests for  Admission, set one. Further, Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff in  the sum of $1,510.00 per motion.               On May 10, 2023, Defendant served  Plaintiff by mail and email with the above-noted discovery. (Miller Decls., Exs.  1.) Responses were due on June 9, 2023. Defendant attempted to meet and confer regarding  the non-response on August 8, 2023, but Plaintiff did not reply. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4.)                 Plaintiff opposes, contending that  Plaintiff was ill when she needed to respond. She claims that her assistant is  in the process of responding to the discovery, but that sanctions are  premature. Plaintiff does not provide any declaration evidencing her illness or  any of her contentions. Thus, Plaintiff does not substantiate any excuse for  her non-response. Further, Plaintiff admits that the discovery responses are  outstanding.                Accordingly, the motions to compel  interrogatories are GRANTED and the motion to deem matters admitted is GRANTED.  Responses are due without objection within 10  days.   Monetary  sanctions are mandatory, unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or  the party subject to the sanctions acted with substantial justification. (CCP §  2030.290(c).) further, sanctions are mandatory without exception as to the  RFAs. (CCP § 2033.280(c).)    Defendant request $1,510.00 per  motion in sanctions, which account for 1.8 hours on the moving papers, and an  anticipated 3.2 hours reviewing oppositions to the motions, replying and  appearing at the hearing, at a rate of $290/hr. Defendant also requests $60  filing fees.    The Court finds the requested fees  excessive and unreasonably high. The motions have substantial overlap with one  another and the opposition was minimal. The sanctions would therefore be  duplicative if granted as requested. Accordingly, Defendant’s request for  sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced total amount of $1,630.00, inclusive of  costs, against Plaintiff. Sanctions to be paid to Defendant’s counsel within 30  days.
