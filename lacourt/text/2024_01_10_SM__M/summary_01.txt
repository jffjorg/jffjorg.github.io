```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of the defendant, granting the motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, which were served on May 10, 2023, and were due on June 9, 2023. The plaintiff's excuse for not responding, that she was ill, is not substantiated by any evidence. The judge orders the plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests within 10 days. The judge also grants the motion to deem the matters admitted, as requested by the defendant. As for sanctions, the judge finds that the defendant's request of $1,510.00 is excessive and reduces the amount to $1,630.00, which includes costs and filing fees. The plaintiff is ordered to pay this amount to the defendant's counsel within 30 days.
