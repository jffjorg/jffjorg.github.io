ANALYSIS
 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party
to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . .
.   [and] The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an
order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290 (a)-(b).)  
 
Similarly,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, “[i]f a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it . . . [t]he party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.  (Id., § 2031.300(a)-(b).)

Discussion
 
The
substance of the motions is moot. The parties agree Plaintiff responded after
Defendant filed its motion. (Hosharian Decl., ¶ 10; Feffer Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The
only matter that remains is sanctions.
 
Sanctions
 
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under [section 2023.010 et seq.] against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel [initial responses] ... unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300(c) [requests for production].)
 
Plaintiff
was substantially justified in failing to respond, and/or circumstances would
make imposition of sanctions unjust. The Court notes that the only deficiency
in Plaintiff’s responses was failure to provide a signed verification.
Plaintiff’s counsel attests Plaintiff has health problems that prevented her
from signing a verification, but she did so as soon as she could once her
health improved, and Counsel had it promptly delivered to Defendant. (Hosharian
Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, 10.) Plaintiff’s counsel contends he kept Defendant’s
counsel apprised of the situation, an assertion which Defendant’s counsel
denies. (Hosharian Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Feffer Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.) This is immaterial;
the Court’s finding is based on Plaintiff’s health condition and the relatively
minor deficiency in her responses, neither of which Defendant refutes.
 
Sanctions
are denied.
