And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, but it does not cover representative PAGA claims. The plaintiff has only pleaded representative PAGA claims, and the arbitration agreement explicitly excludes class or collective actions. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to this arbitration agreement. The defendant has shown that its employment relationships with its employees, considered in the aggregate, affect interstate commerce. The court finds that the PAGA representative claims are not arbitrable and allows them to proceed.
