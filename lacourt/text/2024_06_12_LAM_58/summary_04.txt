And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the attorney fee award, which was granted in the anti-SLAPP motion. The plaintiff argued that the award of $7,200 was "extremely unreasonable, unilateral and excessive." However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not presented new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support the motion for reconsideration, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff failed to provide adequate notice of the motion for reconsideration, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. The judge also denies the defendant's request for additional attorney fees incurred in opposing the motion for reconsideration, as these fees were not incurred in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion.
