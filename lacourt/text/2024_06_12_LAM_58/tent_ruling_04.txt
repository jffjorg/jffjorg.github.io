 
            This is a malicious prosecution
action. Plaintiff Young Ja Cho (Plaintiff or Plaintiff Cho) sued Defendant
Hyoung Wook Ko (Defendant or Defendant Ko) for maliciously and frivolously
suing Plaintiff in an underlying civil litigation. The Complaint alleges causes
of action for (1.) malicious prosecution, and (2.) intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
            On February 6, 2024, Defendant filed
a Special Motion to Strike the Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16 (anti-SLAPP motion). Plaintiff opposed the anti-SLAPP motion. On
May 13, 2024, the special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16 was granted. The Court also awarded $7,200 in attorney fees. 
 
            On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff moved for
reconsideration of the attorney fee award contained within the May 13, 2024
order. Defendant opposes the motion. A reply declaration was filed.
 
            The motion for reconsideration based on statutory
grounds is denied.
 
Discussion
 
            In moving for reconsideration, Plaintiff
argues that the award of attorney fees in the amount of $7,200 was “extremely
unreasonable, unilateral and excessive.” 
 
            A
motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the moving party can offer
“new or different facts, circumstances, or law” which it could not, with
reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the time of the prior
motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see Jade K. v. Viguri
(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467.) A motion for reconsideration will be denied
absent a strong showing of diligence. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) Where evidence addressed in the motion for reconsideration
was available to a party before the initial motion was heard, such evidence is
not considered “new” evidence for purposes of a motion for reconsideration.
(See Lucas v. Santa Maria Public Airport Dist. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1017, 1028.) 
 
In other words, the party seeking reconsideration must
provide not only new evidence, but also a satisfactory explanation for failing
to present that evidence earlier. (Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) The statute is jurisdictional. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (e).) If the moving party does not present new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, then the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain
reconsideration. If the statutory requirements are not met, then the motion
will be denied.
 
            As a preliminary matter, in opposition,
Defendant notes that the motion fails to comply with Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005, subdivision (b). Specifically, on May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed and
served – by mail – the Motion for Reconsideration with a hearing date of June
12, 2024. Sixteen (16) court days after May 20, 2024 is June 11, 2024; however,
adding five (5) days for service by mail is June 17, 2024. Therefore, Plaintiff
has not provided the requisite amount of notice. The motion may be denied on
this procedural ground alone. 
 
            Moreover, as also noted in the opposition,
Plaintiff has not set forth new or different facts, circumstances or law as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a). Thus, the
motion must be denied on these substantive grounds as well. 
 
            Finally, the opposition also seeks attorney
fees in the amount of $2,677.50, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,
subdivision (c)(1). However, these attorney fees were incurred in opposing this
motion for reconsideration and not the anti-SLAPP motion. Therefore, Defendant
has not shown any statutory entitlement to fees. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16
[“a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to
recover that defendant's attorney's fees and costs”].) Defendant’s request for
additional attorney fees is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion for reconsideration on statutory grounds
is denied.
