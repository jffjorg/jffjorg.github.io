And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is overruled, and the defendant's motion to strike is granted. The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) and Penal Code section 638.51. The court also finds that the plaintiff has alleged a reasonable expectation of privacy over IP addresses and the type of information allegedly collected by the defendant's pen register and trap software. The court grants the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages claim and the request for attorney's fees, as the plaintiff fails to allege fraud, malice, or oppression, and the statutory penalties under Penal Code section 637.2 are the only penalties that may be recovered. The defendant is ordered to serve and file its Answer on or before August 28, 2024.
