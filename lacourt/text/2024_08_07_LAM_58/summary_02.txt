And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendants' motion to stay proceedings pending appeal and for a protective order staying discovery. The Defendants had argued that the Court should stay the proceedings and enter a protective order to accommodate the ends of justice, but the Judge found that the burden on the Plaintiff outweighed any potential prejudice to the Defendants. The Judge also denied the Defendants' request for a protective order staying all discovery pending the appeal, finding that the Defendants would not be unfairly prejudiced by participating in discovery. Finally, the Judge granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $4,500 against the Defendants and their attorney, finding that the Defendants had acted without substantial justification in bringing the motion.
