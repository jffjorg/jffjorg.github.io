I.  Background
 
            This is an
action in which Plaintiff alleges he was defrauded of money lent for supposed
real property and cannabis businesses. On June 10, 2019, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) fraud—intentional
misrepresentation, concealment, and false promise, (2) negligent
misrepresentation, (3) actual fraud—intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
creditor, (4) constructive fraud, (5) reformation of contract, (6) judicial
foreclosure of real property, (7) judicial foreclosure of security interest,
(8) breach of written contract, (9) breach of oral contract, (10) breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (11) common count, (12)
conversion, (13) unfair business practices, (14) breach of fiduciary duty, (15)
declaratory relief, and (16) accounting.
 
            On February
21, 2024, the Court issued a statement of decision after bench trial.  The Court found in Plaintiff’s favor on the
FAC against Defendants Mavusi, Pyramid Technologies< Inc. and Professional
Business Properties, Inc.  The Court
found against Plaintiff on the FAC against Defenant Motal or any entity owned
by Motal. The Court ordered that Mavusi and Haig Mgrdichian take nothing by
their cross-complaints.  
 
II.  Discussion
 
            The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either
client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An
attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation.
(See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a
motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi &
Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) The court should consider whether
the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue
prejudice to the client’s
interests.” (Ramirez v. Sturdivant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
            California
Rule of Court rule 3.1362 requires: (1) notice of motion and motion to be
directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—
Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion
and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed
order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
 
            Here,
counsel has filed the necessary paperwork. For each Defendant, counsel has
filed a notice of motion and motion on Form MC-051, a declaration in support on
Form MC-052, a proposed order on Form MC-053, and proof of service by email and
physical mail.
 
            In his
declarations in support, on Item 3b.(1)(c), counsel Bowers indicates
confirmation of the clients’ addresses by conversation within the past 30 days.
Bowers also reviewed the most current Secretary of State filing of Statements
of Information for the corporate clients. 
Based on counsel’s declarations, the Court is satisfied that service has
been properly effectuated.
 
            In his
declarations in support, counsel also he must withdraw due to health
reasons.  Bowers testifies that he has
stage IV kidney failure and will require a kidney transplant.  Bowers will be incapacitated for an
indefinite amount of time.
 
            Based on
these representations, the Court agrees that counsel's withdrawal would not
harm the administration of justice. Due to counsel’s health, he can no longer
represent Defendants.  Furthermore,
counsel's withdrawal will not prejudice Defendants.  The action is post-judgment.  
 
III. Conclusion
 
            The
Court therefore grants counsel David Bowers’ motions to be relieved as counsel
for Defendants Professional Business Properties, Inc. and Pyramid Technologies,
Inc.
