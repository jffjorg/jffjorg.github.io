[1] In Casillas
v. Transitions Optical, Inc., 23STCV30742, which is also before this Court,
the Court sustained demurrer with leave to amend to the original complaint in
that action on grounds that no details are alleged regarding the pen register
or trap and trace software allegedly deployed on the website.  The FAC in Casillas is essentially
identical to the FAC in this action.  The
demurrer to the FAC in Casillas is set for hearing on September 9,
2024.  The Court’s ruling on demurrer in
23STCV30742 is therefore not controlling in this action.  The FAC in this action has never been
assessed for sufficiency and contains additional allegations to those in the
original complaint in Casillas.
