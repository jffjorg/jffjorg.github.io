And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kevin C. Brazile, issued a tentative ruling on May 29, 2024, in the case Esparza v. Conagra Brands, Inc., et al. (Case No. 20STCV37014).

The Judge granted the motion to quash filed by Defendant Full-Fill Industries, LLC, which sought to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Judge found that the Defendant had no contacts with the forum and that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate sufficient facts to support the exercise of jurisdiction in California.

The Judge also overruled the demurrer filed by Defendant Elan Chemical Company, Inc., which sought to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The Judge found that the complaint sufficiently alleged a toxic tort claim and that the Defendant's arguments were without merit.

The Judge denied the motion to strike punitive damages filed by Defendant Elan Chemical Company, Inc.

The Judge encouraged counsel to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
