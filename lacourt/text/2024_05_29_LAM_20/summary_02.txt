And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the motion for protective order filed by Non-Party Deborah Tropp, Esq. The motion sought to prevent Tropp from being required to appear for a second subpoenaed deposition and produce any documents in response to the second deposition. The judge found that good cause exists for a protective order because the second deposition is duplicative and unduly burdensome on Tropp. The judge also awarded sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,250.00 in favor of Tropp and against Plaintiff Jonathan Alvarez Llanos and his attorneys of record, Heidari Law Group, PC.
