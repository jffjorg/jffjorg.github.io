Background
Plaintiff Abel Nevarez sues Defendant
Norberto Fregoso, Complete Industrial Repair, Inc., and Does 1-15 pursuant to a
September 8, 2022 First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Breach
of Written Contract, (2) Breach of Oral Contract, (3) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Conversion, (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (6) Fraud and Deceit, and (7) Accounting.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendants failed to comply with the terms of agreements between Nevarez
and Fregoso relating to the establishment of a thermal spray services
partnership between them.
On October 13, 2022, Defendant
Fregoso filed an Answer to Complaint.
That same day, Defendant Fregoso
filed a Cross-Complaint suing Plaintiff Nevarez and Roes 1-20 pursuant to
claims of (1) Dissolution of Partnership, (2) Breach of Partnership Agreement,
(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Accounting, (5) Intentional
Misrepresentation, and (6) Negligent Misrepresentation.
On November 4, 2022, Plaintiff
Nevarez filed a substitution of attorney, which substituted out counsel and
noticed Plaintiff’s appearance in pro per.
On December 12, 2022, Plaintiff
Nevarez filed a notice of limited scope of representation for the “01/23/2024”
hearing, with Cristina M. Saca, Esq. of the Law Office of Cristine M. Saca
substituting in.
On December 13, 2022, Plaintiff
Nevarez filed an Answer to Cross-Complaint. The Answer to Cross-Complaint is
signed by Cristina Saca as counsel for Plaintiff Nevarez.
On May 11, 2023, Defendant Fregoso served
a Form Interrogatories – General, Set One (FROGs, Set One), a Special
Interrogatories, Set One (SROGs, Set One), a Request for Production of
Documents, Set One (RPDs, Set One), and a Request for Admission, Set One (RFAs,
Set One).
On August 28, 2023, due to
Plaintiff Nevarez’s nonresponse, Defendant Fregoso’s counsel emailed Nevarez’s
counsel—Cristina Saca—regarding the failure to respond to Plaintiff’s
discovery.
On September 1, 2023, according to Fregoso’s
Declaration and Exhibit C attached thereto, Nevarez’s counsel responded by
indicating that she was no longer able to serve as Plaintiff’s counsel and
requested 30 days for Plaintiff to respond.
Defendant Fregoso’s counsel
ultimately assented to the request. However, Plaintiff never served responses
or made production.
As a result, on November 3, 2023, Defendant
Fregoso filed motions to compel Plaintiff Nevarez’s initial responses to FROGs,
Set One, SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, and to admit the requests for
admission in RFAs, Set One. All four motions seek monetary sanctions from
Plaintiff Nevarez and were served on Plaintiff Nevarez and Cristina Saca by
mail at the addresses reflected in Plaintiff’s substitution of attorney filing
and the notice of limited scope of representation filing for Cristina Saca
(hereafter, Plaintiff’s and Saca’s addresses).
On November 4, 2023, the
substitution of attorney was filed, substituting in Mr. Nevarez in pro per.
On November 6, 2023, at a Status Conference
re: ADR, plaintiff appeared without his counsel and said he was now unrepresented.
The minute order from that hearing reflects that he was informed that he “needs
to file responses to the motions to compel.”
Plaintiff Nevarez failed to oppose
the four motions, which are now before the Court.
 
Motions
to Compel Initial Responses to Interrogatories and Production and to Admit
Admission Requests
I.
Legal Standard – Interrogatories
and Production
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce]).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
Order
Compelling Initial Responses: GRANTED.
Defendant
Fregoso shows evidence reflecting service of FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One,
and RPDs, Set One on Plaintiff Nevarez by mail to Plaintiff’s and Saca’s
addresses on May 11, 2023. (FROGs Mot., Marchetti Decl., Ex. A, Proof of
Service; SROGs Mot., Marchetti Decl., Ex. A, Proof of Service; RPDs Mot.,
Marchetti Decl., Ex. A, Proof of Service.)
Defendant
Fregoso shows facts permitting the conclusion that the expiration of the
deadline to respond to this discovery occurred. (FROGs Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶
3-4, 6 [discussing no responses from Plaintiff; implies 30 day-statutory deadline
from May 11, 2023 service, yielding Monday, June 12, 2023 response date]; SROGs
Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6 [same]; RPDs Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6
[same].)
Defendant
Fregoso shows that Plaintiff Nevarez has not served responses or production to
FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One. (FROGs Mot., Marchetti
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6 [discussing no responses from Plaintiff]; SROGs Mot.,
Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 3-4 [same], 6; RPDs Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6 [same].)
A
review of FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, shows that the
requests are within the scope of discovery because they seek information that
is germane to a determination of liability in this action.
Defendant
Fregoso’s motions to compel initial responses to FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set
One, and RPDs, Set One are thus GRANTED.
II.
Legal
Standard – Admissions
The
discovering party can make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests
for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a)
[RFA responses must be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton
v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636 [unsworn response
to RFAs is treated like no response].) These requests are not automatically
deemed admitted; the discovery party must make the motion. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.070);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b));
and
(3)
That (a) the responding party served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response
(see Appleton v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636
[unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra,
263 Cal.App.2d at p. 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].) 
Order
Deeming RFAs Admitted: GRANTED.
Defendant
Fregoso shows evidence reflecting service of RFAs, Set One on Plaintiff Nevarez
by mail to Plaintiff’s and Saca’s addresses on May 11, 2023. (RFAs Mot.,
Marchetti Decl., Ex. A, Proof of Service.)
Defendant
Fregoso shows facts permitting the conclusion that the expiration of the
deadline to respond to this discovery occurred. (RFAs Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶
3-4, 6 [discussing no responses from Plaintiff; implies 30 day-statutory deadline
from May 11, 2023 service, yielding Monday, June 12, 2023 response date].)
Defendant
Fregoso shows that Plaintiff Nevarez has not served responses to RFAs, Set One.
(RFAs Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6 [discussing no responses from
Plaintiff].)
A
review of RFAs, Set One, shows that the requests are within the scope of
discovery because they seek information that is germane to a determination of
liability in this action.
Defendant
Fregoso’s motions to admit RFAs, Set One is thus GRANTED.
III.
Legal
Standard – Sanctions
The
Court must impose monetary sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or
attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes the motion, unless it finds that
the person to be sanctioned acted withs substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to
produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to
produce].)
The
Court must also award sanctions when a party’s response is untimely, and the
discovering party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see Stover v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th
19, 31-32; see e.g., Appleton v. Superior Court, supra, 206
Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636 [sanctions are mandatory].)
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)

Order Granting Sanctions: GRANTED,
in part.
Here, despite service of the four
motions on Plaintiff Nevares by mail to Plaintiff’s and Saca’s addresses,
Plaintiff has failed to respond to an authorized method of discovery—the FROGs,
SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs—for which reason sanctions are merited. (See All Motions,
Proof of Service; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d); Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
However, the Court finds that the
sanctions sought by Defendant Fregoso are excessive. For each of the four
motions, Defendant Fregoso seeks $1,861.65 in sanctions, comprised of one hour
drafting each motion, two anticipated hours replying to any opposition and
attending the hearing, at a rate of $600 per hour, plus $61.65 in costs related
to reserving this motion on calendar. (All Motions, p. 4, Marchetti Decl., ¶¶
9-11.)
Because Plaintiff Nevarez filed no
opposition, no compensation is required for replying to any opposition.
Moreover, sanctions are excessive
insofar as Defendant Fregoso seeks recovery for four hours expended by counsel
in drafting each of the four motions at issue at this hearing, one hour per
motion. A comparison of all four motions and their supporting declarations shows
that they are essentially identical to one another. (Compare FROGs Mot., pp.
1-4, Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 1-11, Exs. A-C [only Ex. A differing], with SROGs
Mot., pp. 1-4, Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 1-11, Exs. A-C [only Ex. A differing], and
RPDs Mot., pp. 1-4, Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 1-11, Exs. A-C [only Ex. A differing],
and RFAs Mot., pp. 1-4, Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 1-11 [only Ex. A differing].) It is
reasonable to expect that one of these briefs was typed up, completed with
attachments, and modified for the purposes of the other three motions within 2.5
hours. A single hour expended by counsel in attending this hearing for all four
motions is proper and reasonable, as are all the costs.
Sanctions for each of the four
motions are thus GRANTED, in part, at a rate of $600 per hour, times 3.5 hours,
plus $61.65 in costs, for total sanctions of $2,161.65.
