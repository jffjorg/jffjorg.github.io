And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant Norberto Fregoso's motions to compel Plaintiff Abel Nevarez to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Document Requests. The court has also deemed admitted the admission requests in Defendant Fregoso's Request for Admission, Set One. Additionally, the court has granted Defendant Fregoso's requests for sanctions in the amount of $2,161.65.

The court's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff Nevarez failed to respond to discovery requests, despite being served with the requests and having an opportunity to respond. The court has found that Plaintiff Nevarez's failure to respond was unreasonable and that Defendant Fregoso has been prejudiced by the lack of response.

The court has ordered Plaintiff Nevarez to provide responses to the discovery requests within 21 days of the order or notice of ruling, whichever is later. The court has also ordered Plaintiff Nevarez to remit payment of $2,161.65 to Defendant Fregoso within 21 days of the order or notice of ruling, whichever is later.
