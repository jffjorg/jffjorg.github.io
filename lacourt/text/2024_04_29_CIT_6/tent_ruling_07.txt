 Case Number:  23PSCV03804    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  PFG Lending, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendants: Leonard S. Duenas and Alicia M. Leon TENTATIVE RULING           Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is GRANTED, without prejudgment interest, in the reduced  amount of $52,502.04.           BACKGROUND           This is  a breach of contract case. On December 7, 2023, plaintiff PFG Lending, LLC dba  Home Run Financing (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Leonard S.  Duenas (Duenas), Alicia M. Leon (Leon) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1  to 5, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and common counts. On March  21, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. On the same date, Plaintiffs  filed a request for entry of default judgment against Defendants. On March 29,  2024, the Court issued a notice of rejection, denying the request for entry of  default judgment without prejudice, and indicating Plaintiff may submit a  supplemental brief/declaration regarding prejudgment interest under Delaware  law. On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff submitted an amended request for entry of  default judgment, amended declaration, and a proposed judgment.           LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of military status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $55,232.28,  including $49,961.21 in damages, $2,730.24 in interest, $1,888.83 in attorney  fees, and $652.00 in costs. Plaintiff’s amended declaration fails to address  the issues set forth in the Court’s prior notice of rejection. (See Notice of  Rejection of Electronic Filing (3/29/24).) As the Court noted previously,  Delaware law, and federal law to the extent applicable, governs the underlying  loan agreement in this case. (See Id.; Schulze Decl., Ex. A, pp. 8, 10.)  “Where parties validly choose a state’s law to govern their contractual rights  and duties under [Code of Civil Procedure section 187], that state’s  substantive law will govern the measure of recovery for a breach of contract. [Citation].  In turn, the measure of recovery includes a determination of whether plaintiff  can recover interest, and, if so, the rate, upon damages awarded him for the  period between the breach of contract and the rendition of judgment.” (Airs  Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2020) 50  Cal.App.5th 1009, 1014, internal citations and quotations omitted.) The  issue here is not that the 9.24% provided under the loan agreement is less than  the 10% maximum legal interest permissible under California law for breach of  contract claims. (See Schulze Decl., ¶ 7; Civ. Code, § 3289, subd. (b).) The  issue here is that the loan agreement specifically states it is governed by  Delaware law, not California law. (Schulze Decl., Ex. A, pp. 8, 10.) Plaintiff  only posits that its prejudgment interest declaration is under 10% and  therefore complies with California law. (Schulze Decl., ¶ 7.) This is  unavailing. For Plaintiff to recover prejudgment interest here, Plaintiff  needed to show the Court that the amount requested complies with Delaware law,  or alternatively to provide a different calculation based on Delaware law  prejudgment interest rates. Plaintiff failed to provide any Delaware authority  showing that it is entitled to prejudgment interest under Delaware law and that  the interest calculation complies with Delaware law. (See Schulze Decl., ¶ 7;  Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3); Airs Aromatics, supra, 50  Cal.App.5th at p. 1014 [New York choice-of-law clause governed recovery of  prejudgment interest].) Accordingly, the Court declines to award Plaintiff  prejudgment interest. The  Court otherwise finds Plaintiff’s request to be properly supported by the  evidence, and will therefore GRANT Plaintiff’s request in the reduced amount of  $52,502.04. CONCLUSION  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED, without prejudgment interest,  in the reduced amount of $52,502.04.
