And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This case involves a breach of contract dispute between PFG Lending, LLC (Plaintiff) and Leonard S. Duenas and Alicia M. Leon (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks default judgment against the Defendants in the total amount of $55,232.28. The Court has previously denied the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment due to a failure to provide a valid calculation of prejudgment interest. In its amended request, the Plaintiff has failed to address the issues set forth in the Court's prior notice of rejection. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's request is properly supported by the evidence and will grant the request in the reduced amount of $52,502.04. The Court declines to award prejudgment interest as the Plaintiff failed to provide a valid calculation under Delaware law, which governs the underlying loan agreement.
