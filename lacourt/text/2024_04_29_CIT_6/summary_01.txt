Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to relieve Brian Van Allen as Plaintiff's counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed by Van Allen, who sought to be relieved as counsel due to an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the court found that Van Allen failed to comply with the necessary procedures for serving the motion and declaration on the Plaintiff, Shamel Nelson. As a result, the court denied the motion without prejudice. The court ordered Van Allen to give notice of the ruling and file proof of service within five calendar days.
