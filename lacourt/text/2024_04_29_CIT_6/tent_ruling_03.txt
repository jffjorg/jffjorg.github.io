Robin Garcia v. Unlimited Rubber Supplies, LLC, et al. 
Motion to be
Relieved as Defendant Michael Antonio Diaz’s Counsel 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
             Counsel is ordered to give notice of

BACKGROUND 
This is a motor vehicle accident case. On January 30, 2023, plaintiff
Holly Robin Garcia (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Unlimited
Rubber Supplies, LLC, Michael Antonio Diaz (Diaz), Malcolm Defrantz, and Does 1
to 50, alleging causes of action for general negligence and motor vehicle. 
On April 2, 2024, Douglas D. Cullins of Cullins & Grandy LLP,
counsel for Diaz, moved to be relieved as counsel.[1] The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and
such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite
forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in
the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Douglas D. Cullins of Cullins & Grandy LLP (Counsel), counsel
for Diaz, seeks to be relieved as counsel on the grounds that a conflict has
arisen rendering it impracticable to continue the attorney-client relationship
and there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. (Grandy
Decl., ¶ 2.) The Court finds this sufficient grounds for withdrawal. 
Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation
include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the
lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to
withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) 
Counsel also filed and served the appropriate Judicial Council
forms, namely forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
             Counsel is ordered to give notice of
the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
