 Case Number:  23PSCP00529    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Swift  Financial, LLC, as Servicing Agent of WebBank v. Lumenos Technologies, et al.  Petition  to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS the petition to confirm contractual arbitration  award. Petitioner must submit a proposed judgment consistent with this order.               Petitioner is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a contractual arbitration matter. On December 8, 2023, petitioner  Swift Financial, LLC, as Servicing Agent for WebBank (Petitioner) filed a  petition against respondents Lumenos Technologies, Inc., Matthew Laney  (collectively, Respondents) and Does 1 to 10, to confirm an arbitration award  issued on July 12, 2023 in the amount of $111,196.02. Respondents did not oppose  the petition.  LEGAL  STANDARD            “Any party to an arbitration in which an award has  been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “[A] court, before granting a petition to compel  arbitration, must  determine the factual issue of ‘the existence or validity of the arbitration  agreement.’ [Citation.]” (Toal v. Tardif  (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1208, 1219, italics added.)  “No petition may be served and filed under this  chapter until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the award  upon the petitioner.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) “A petition under this title  shall be heard in a summary way in the manner and upon the notice provided by  law for the making and hearing of motions, except that not less than 10 days'  notice of the date set for the hearing on the petition shall be given.” (Id.,  1290.2.)  DISCUSSION            Service of  Petition  The  arbitrator served  a copy of the arbitration award upon Respondents by mail and electronic service  on July 12, 2023. (Petition, Attachment 8, subd. (c).) Petitioner served the  petition and notice of the hearing on the petition on Respondents by substitute  service on February 9, 2024. (Proofs of Service (2/9/24).) The Court finds this  is proper service. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288.4, 1290.2.)  Contractual  Arbitration Award  Petitioner seeks  to confirm an arbitration award issued on July 12, 2023, in the amount of $111,196.02,  in favor of Petitioner and against Respondents. (Petition, ¶ 8, subd. (b).) Petitioner  also seeks prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees incurred for this  petition. (Petition, ¶ 10, subd. (d)-(g).) Petitioner submitted a copy of the  underlying loan agreement and arbitration agreement with Respondents’  signatures. (Petition, Attachment 4, subd. (b).) Petitioner also submitted a  copy of the arbitration award, which awards $106,895.02 in damages, comprised  of $106,795.02 for the unpaid loan balance plus $100.00 for a returned item  fee, $1,296.00 in attorney’s fees, and $3,005.00 in administrative fees, for a  total of $111,196.02, in favor of Petitioner and against Respondents. (Id.,  Attachment 8, subd. (c).) The Court finds that Petitioner has met its burden in  proving the award and establishing the existence of a valid arbitration  agreement. (See Toal, supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.)    Respondents  did not respond to or oppose the petition, and thereby failed to dispute the  award or the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. (See Toal, supra, 178  Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.) The Court further construes Respondents’ lack of  response or opposition as a tacit admission that the petition is meritorious.  (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C.  Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.  Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶¿9:105.10.)   Based on the  foregoing, the Court GRANTS the petition to confirm contractual arbitration  award.   Prejudgment  Interest  “A person who is entitled to recover damages certain,  or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which  is vested in the person upon a particular day, is  entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day, except when the debtor is prevented by law, or by  the act of the creditor from paying the debt.” (Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (a).)  (a) Any legal rate of interest stipulated by a  contract remains chargeable after a breach thereof, as before, until the  contract is superseded by a verdict or other new obligation.  (b) If a contract entered into after January 1, 1986,  does not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the  obligation shall bear interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach.  (Civ. Code, § 3289, subd.  (a).)  Petitioner seeks prejudgment interest under Civil  Code section 3289 from the date of the award, July 12, 2023, to the date of  entry of judgment. (Petition, ¶ 10, subd. (g).) The Court finds this request  proper and therefore GRANTS it. (Tenzera, Inc. v. Osterman (2012) 205  Cal.App.4th 16, 21 [prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3287 applies  to arbitration awards from the date of the final arbitration award until entry  of judgment].) Prejudgment interest will accrue at the statutory rate of 10%  from July 12, 2023, to the date of entry of judgment. The per diem rate will be  $30.46, i.e., $111,196.02 times 10%, divided by 365.  Attorney’s  Fees and Costs In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically  provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that  contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing  party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the  contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,  shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs. (Civ. Code, §  1717, subd. (a).) The party seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show  "the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the  conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount." (Nightingale  v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) To satisfy this  burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in  sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case was  overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the  reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014)  230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.) “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or  lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and  reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney… involved in the presentation  of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165  Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the  discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such  factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience  and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. [Citation.] The court  may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or  duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99  Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the  best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her  courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly rate  that will be used in the lodestar calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.  Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th  426, 436–437.) Petitioner seeks $3,001.96 in attorney’s fees. The Court declines  to grant this request, finding the amount of $3,001.96 excessive for simply  filing a petition and the arbitrator awarded much less for the arbitration.  (See Petition, Attachment 8, subd. (c).) Additionally, Petitioner provided no  explanation or supporting documentation for this amount. Therefore, the Court DENIES  the $3,001.96 in attorney’s fees. Petitioner also seeks $435.00 in costs. The Court finds this  request proper and therefore GRANTS it. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.  (a)(1) [filing fees]; Gov. Code, § 70611.)  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the petition to confirm contractual arbitration  award. Petitioner must submit a proposed judgment consistent with this order.                Petitioner is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
