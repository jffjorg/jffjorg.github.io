RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Lusine Ghazaryan (“Ghazaryan”)
moves to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Katherine Perez. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Katherine
Perez’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that she was struck by two motor vehicles,
separately operated by Octavio Lara and John Doe, on June 3, 2021. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
             
The court will delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until (1) proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the clients and (2) proof that the clients have been properly
served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court.
 
            Subject to
service of the proofs of service, Ghazaryan’s motion to be relieved as counsel
is GRANTED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure §284(1) allows for a change or substitution of
attorney “[u]pon the consent of both client and attorney, filed with the clerk,
or entered upon the minutes.” If both parties do not consent to a substitution
of attorney, Code of Civ. Proc. §284(2) allows for a substitution “[u]pon the
order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after
notice from one to the other.” California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 sets forth
procedures for relieving counsel without the mutual consent of both parties.
 
Under California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362, an attorney seeking to
withdraw by motion rather than by consent of the client, as here, is required
to make that motion using approved Judicial Council forms. The motion also
requires a declaration stating “in general terms, and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).” (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1362(c).)  Judicial Council form
MC-052, the attorney’s declaration, requires that the client be provided no
less than five days’ notice before hearing on the motion.  A proposed order prepared on form MC-053 must
also be lodged with the court with the moving
papers.
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 subd. (d) also requires that the motion, notice of
motion, the declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. The notice served on the
client by mail must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts that show
that either the service address is current or “that [t]he service address is the last known residence or business
address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current
address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the
filing of the motion to be relieved.”
(California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 subd. (d)). 
 
The Court of Appeals has recognized, “A lawyer violates his or her
ethical mandate by abandoning a
client [citation], or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby
prejudicing the client’s case. 
[Citation.]  We are, however,
aware of no authority preventing an attorney from withdrawing from a case when
withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client’s
interests.” (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Ghazaryan
moves to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff. Ghazaryan provides
that there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Ghazaryan
specifically provides that counsel has been unable to contact Plaintiff despite
multiple attempts. Ghazaryan provides that Plaintiff was served at the client’s
last known address but fails to provide how the address was confirmed. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The court will delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until (1) proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the clients and (2) proof that the clients have been properly
served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court.
 
            Subject to
service of the proofs of service, Ghazaryan’s motion to be relieved as counsel
is GRANTED.
