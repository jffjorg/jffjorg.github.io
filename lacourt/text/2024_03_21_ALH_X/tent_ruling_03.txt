RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendants demurrer to Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Brian P.
Daly’s (“Plaintiff”) legal malpractice claims against Defendants Ideal Legal
Group, Inc. and Evie P. Jeang (“Defendants”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on
August 21, 2023, alleging two causes of action for (1) legal malpractice and
(2) breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
The parties requests for judicial notice are granted pursuant to Evidence
Code section 452, subdivision (d). However, the court does not take notice of
the contested facts therein. “Although the existence of a
document may be judicially noticeable, the truth of statements contained in the
document and its proper interpretation are not subject to
judicial notice if those matters are reasonably disputable.” (Unruh-Haxton
v. Regents of University of California (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 343, 364.)
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. 
(Code Civ. Proc. section 430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  (SKF
Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants demurrer to the current
case on the grounds that the same case already exists in another court.
Defendant specifically argue that an identical case exists in the dissolution
proceedings between Plaintiff and Hong Lu Zhang.
 
            “Since the
rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and the statutory plea in abatement
are mandatory and not discretionary judicial actions, these issues should be
raised by demurrer where the issue appears on the face of the complaint and by
answer where factual issues must be resolved.” (People ex rel. Garamendi v.
American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 771.) 
 
                “A single cause
of action cannot be the basis for more than one lawsuit. [Citation.] A demurrer
raising this objection to a second action between the same parties ‘is strictly
limited so that ... the defendant must show that the parties, cause of action,
and issues are identical, and that the same evidence would
support the judgment in each case.’ ” (Pitts v. City of Sacramento (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 853, 856.) 
            
            Defendants arguments that the cases are identical are readily rejected.
In the dissolution proceeding, a complaint in joinder was filed by Hong Lu
Zhang, who is not a party to this present case, and the complaint alleged two
causes of action for accounting and constructive trust. (RJN Exhibit 1.)
Defendants’ contentions that Zhang argued that similar theories of recoveries
applied is not subject to judicial notice nor complies with the requirements that
the causes of action are identical. Thus, Defendants’ demurrer is overruled.
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’ demurrer is OVERRULED.
