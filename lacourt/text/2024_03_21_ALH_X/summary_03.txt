And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a dispute between Plaintiff Brian P. Daly and Defendants Ideal Legal Group, Inc. and Evie P. Jeang. The dispute arises from Plaintiff's claims of legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty against the Defendants. The Defendants have filed a demurrer, arguing that the same case is already pending in another court. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the cases are not identical. The judge has also granted the parties' requests for judicial notice, but only to the extent that the existence of documents is concerned, and not to the truth of the statements contained in those documents. The judge's ruling is based on the legal standards governing demurrer proceedings and the requirements for identical causes of action.
