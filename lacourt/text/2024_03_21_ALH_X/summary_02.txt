And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Lusine Ghazaryan's motion to be relieved as counsel for Katherine Perez, but has delayed the effective date of the order until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the clients and proof that the clients have been properly served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court. The court has also required that Ghazaryan provide a declaration stating why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1). The judge has noted that California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that the motion, notice of motion, the declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
