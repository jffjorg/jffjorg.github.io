Case #22CHCV00942
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 7/2/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Johnny Rundell
CLIENT: Plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Johnny Rundell
as counsel for Plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins in this action.  
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 4/29/24, attorney Johnny Rundell filed and served a motion
seeking an order relieving him as attorney for Plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins (Plaintiff)
in this action.  Due to issues with the
service of that motion, it was placed off calendar by the Court on
6/24/24.  (See 6/24/24 Minute
Order).  
 
On 7/2/24, attorney Rundell filed the instant motion
seeking an order relieving him as attorney for Plaintiff in this action.  The proof of service for the motion indicates
that on 7/2/24, it was served on counsel for the opposing party and on
Plaintiff via electronic mail.  While the
service on opposing counsel/counsel for Defendant Choosing Independence, Inc.’s
(Defendant) is sufficient, there are still issues with the service of the
motion on Plaintiff.  
 
Again, there is no indication that Plaintiff agreed to
accept service via email.  See CCP
1010.6(c).  Additionally, the declaration
filed in support of the motion indicates that Plaintiff’s address was confirmed
“[b]y personal service after skip trace on 7/01/2024.”  (See Declaration, No.3.b.(1)(d)).  It is not clear what the foregoing statement
means.  The declaration goes on to state that
“[o]n July 1, 2024, Plaintiff was served motion papers and documents regarding
her case via substituted service to a competent adult in her household who
confirmed Plaintiff currently resided there but wasn’t [sic] there at the
time.”  (See Declaration,
Attachment 2).  It is not clear who
accomplished this “substituted service” of the motion papers as the declaration
is signed by attorney Rundell and the proof of service, which only indicates
service by U.S. mail and email, is signed by Janice Inekhomon.  As such, there is no proper proof of the
purported substituted service or personal service of the motion papers on
Plaintiff as alluded to in the declaration filed in support of the motion.  
 
Since there is no response to the motion by Plaintiff to
cure the defects in notice, the motion is placed off calendar.
