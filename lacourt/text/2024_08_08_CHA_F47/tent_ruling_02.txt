SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from the purchase of real property
located at 21137 Placerita Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, California (the
Property) in or about May of 2020 by Defendant Tory McLaurin (Defendant), Lisa
Gill (Lisa), Gloria Palmer (Gloria) and Plaintiff Taraya Gill (Taraya) (recorded
on 3/1/21).  (Complaint ¶9, Ex.1).  Taraya, Plaintiff Margaret Gill (Margaret)
and Lisa are sisters and Gloria, who is now deceased, is their mother.  (Complaint ¶8).  According to the Grant Deed, at the time of
the purchase, Defendant and Lisa were husband and wife.  (Complaint, Ex.1).  In or about March of 2021, Defendant, Taraya,
Lisa and Gloria took out First and Second Trust Deed mortgages secured by the
Property.  (Complaint ¶¶11-12, Ex.2 and 3).
 On or about 5/12/22, Gloria passed
away.  (Complaint ¶10).
 
Plaintiffs/Taraya and Margaret allege that they along
with their sister, Lisa, and their mother, Gloria, agreed to purchase the
Property.  (Complaint ¶15).  However, because Margaret’s credit score was
too low to obtain a loan, Defendant offered to put himself in Margaret’s place
to qualify for the loan to purchase the Property.  (Complaint ¶15).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant promised that
he would hold title for Margaret until she improved her credit score to
refinance the loans on the Property. 
(Complaint ¶16).  Plaintiffs
allege that Margaret contributed $150,000.00 and Lisa contributed $60,000.00
for the down payment on the Property. 
(Complaint ¶17).  Plaintiffs
allege that Margaret and Lisa paid the mortgage payments on the Property,
Defendant never paid the mortgage or any other payments for maintenance on the
Property, until March of 2024, and has never lived at the Property.  (Complaint ¶18).
 
In January of 2024, Defendant commenced eviction
proceedings against Margaret (24CHUD00569). 
(Complaint ¶19).  In March of
2024, Defendant paid one of the First Deed of Trust mortgage payments for the
first time.  (Complaint ¶20).  In July 2024, judgment in the unlawful
detainer action was entered in favor of Margaret and against Defendant.  (See 7/10/24 Minute Order in
24CHUD00569).
 
On 4/19/24, Plaintiffs (Margaret and Taraya) filed this
action against Defendant (Tory) and Doe Defendants for: (1) Quiet Title, (2)
Declaratory Relief, (3) Constructive Trust, (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duties and
(5) Promissory Estoppel.  After meet and
confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Defendant had with the complaint,
on 7/3/24, Defendant filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire
complaint and motion to strike which seeks an order striking various paragraphs
of the complaint (¶¶9, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 and 56)
relating to title to the Property.  (See
Murphy Decl.).  On 7/24/24, Plaintiffs
filed an opposition to the demurrer and on 7/26/24, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition to the motion to strike. 
However, the oppositions were not timely served resulting in Defendant
filing a Notice of Non-Opposition on 7/29/24. 
(See Barsegyan Decl. filed 8/1/24).  Thereafter, on 8/1/24, Defendant filed and
served a reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Each cause of action must specifically state the party
asserting it if more than one party is represented on the pleading.  See CRC 2.112(3).  Here, the complaint does not specify which
plaintiff is asserting each cause of action. 
Therefore, it is presumed that each cause of action is being asserted on
behalf of both Margaret and Taraya.
 
1st cause of action – Quiet Title
 
Pursuant to CCP 761.020, in order to state a claim for quiet
title:
 
“The complaint shall be verified
and shall include all of the following:
(a) A description of the property
that is the subject of the action. In the case of tangible personal property,
the description shall include its usual location. In the case of real property,
the description shall include both its legal description and its street address
or common designation, if any.
(b) The
title of the plaintiff as to which a determination under this chapter is sought
and the basis of the title. If the title is based upon adverse possession,
the complaint shall allege the specific facts constituting the adverse
possession.
(c) The adverse claims to the title
of the plaintiff against which a determination is sought.
(d) The date as of which the
determination is sought. If the determination is sought as of a date other than
the date the complaint is filed, the complaint shall include a statement of the
reasons why a determination as of that date is sought.
(e) A prayer for the determination
of the title of the plaintiff against the adverse claims.”
 
Contrary to Defendant’s assertion, the complaint is
verified by Plaintiffs.  (See
Complaint, pp.21-22).  The complaint contains
a description of the property. 
(Complaint ¶6).  The complaint also
sufficiently alleges that Plaintiffs seek a determination of their claimed
title to the Property based on their contributions to the down payment,
mortgage payments, maintenance payments, etc., Defendant’s lack of contribution
to same and Defendant’s adverse claims to the Property.  (See Complaint ¶¶17-24).  Plaintiffs have alleged that they seek to
quiet title to the Property as of the date of the execution of the Grant Deed
which would be 5/14/20.  (See
Complaint ¶28, Ex.1).  Plaintiffs have
also included a prayer that title to the Property be quieted in the names of
Margaret, Taraya, Lisa and Gloria, now deceased.  (See Complaint Prayer ¶1, p.18:13-15).
 
As such, the complaint satisfies the pleading
requirements for a quiet title claim.  See
CCP 761.020. 
Whether Plaintiffs will ultimately be able to prove their quiet title
claim by the applicable evidentiary standard cannot be determined on demurrer.  However, it is not clear why Taraya is making
a claim for quiet title against Defendant as she is already on title to the
Property.  (See Complaint, Ex.1).  As such, the claim is uncertain with regard
to Taraya.  CCP 430.10(f).
 
2nd cause of action – Declaratory Relief
 
Defendant notes that “[t]he fundamental basis of
declaratory relief is the existence of an actual, present controversy over a
proper subject. City of Cotati v. Cashman, 29 Cal. 4th 69, 79, 52 P.3d
695, 702 (2002) citing 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, §817,
p. 273). In the broadest sense, an action for declaratory relief in a complaint
is sufficient if it sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual
controversy relating to legal rights and duties of respective parties under a
contract and requests that the rights and duties be adjudged. Code Civ. Proc.
§1060.”  (See Demurrer Memorandum
of Points & Authorities, p.7:25-p.8:4). 
Without providing any argument or analysis, Defendant merely concludes
that “[e]ven this minimal standard has not been met in Plaintiff’s [sic] case.”
 
Contrary to Defendant’s assertion, Margaret has
adequately alleged an actual controversy exists between her and Defendant
regarding their rights to title of the Property.  See CCP 1060 (“Any person interested
under a written instrument, excluding a will or a trust, or under a contract,
or who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to
another, or in respect to, in, over or upon property, or with respect to the location
of the natural channel of a watercourse, may, in cases of actual controversy
relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an
original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration
of his or her rights and duties in the premises, including a determination of
any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or
contract. He or she may ask for a declaration of rights or duties, either alone
or with other relief; and the court may make a binding declaration of these
rights or duties, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed at the
time. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect,
and the declaration shall have the force of a final judgment. The declaration
may be had before there has been any breach of the obligation in respect to
which said declaration is sought.”).
 
However, as with the quiet title cause of action, the
basis for Taraya’s declaratory relief claim against Defendant is not clear as
she is already on title to the Property. 
(Complaint, Ex.1).  As such, this
cause of action is also uncertain as to Taraya’s claim.  CCP 430.10(f).
 
3rd cause of action – Constructive Trust
  
“A constructive trust is an involuntary equitable trust
created by operation of law as a remedy 
to compel further transfer of property from the person wrongfully
holding it to the rightful owner.”  Campbell
(2005) 132 CA4th 904, 920.  Contrary to
Defendant’s assertion, the complaint does allege the intent of the parties upon
Defendant taking title to the Property with Lisa, Gloria and Taraya.  Plaintiffs allege that because Margaret’s
credit score was too low to obtain a loan, Defendant offered to put himself in
Margaret’s place to qualify for the loan to purchase the Property and promised
that he would hold title for Margaret until she improved her credit score to
refinance the loans on the Property. 
(Complaint ¶¶15-16).  However,
once again, the basis for Taraya’s claim for constructive trust is unclear as
she is already on title to the Property and there are no allegations that
Defendant was supposed to hold title to the Property for her benefit.  See CCP 430.10(f). 
 
4th cause of action – Breach of Fiduciary
Duties
 
The elements of a breach of fiduciary duty cause of
action are: (1) existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) breach of the fiduciary
duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by the breach.  Gutierrez (2011) 194 CA4th 925, 932.  A fiduciary relationship is required for a
defendant to owe a plaintiff a fiduciary duty. 
Cal Pak Delivery, Inc. (1997) 52 CA4th 1, 11.  Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient
facts to establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship between them and
Defendant, their former brother-in-law, such that Defendant owed them a
fiduciary duty.  (See Complaint
¶42).  Additionally, based on the
allegations in the complaint, it appears that Plaintiffs only claim that
Defendant owed Margaret a fiduciary duty. 
(Complaint ¶¶42-44).  As such, it
is not clear if/why Taraya is intended to be a plaintiff on this cause of
action rendering the cause of action uncertain as to her.  CCP 430.10(f).    
 
5th cause of action – Promissory Estoppel    
 
The elements of a promissory estoppel cause of action
are: (1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the
party to whom the promise is made; (3) the reliance must be both reasonable and
foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must be injured by his
reliance.  Jones (2014) 230 CA4th
935, 945.  
 
Contrary to Defendant’s assertion, Margaret has alleged a
clear promise by Defendant to take title to the Property for her benefit and
transfer same back to her when she was able to refinance the Property in her
name.  (Complaint ¶¶15-16, 49, 50).  Margaret has also sufficiently alleged her
reliance on the promise by contributing $150,000.00 to the down payment on the
Property and paying half of the mortgage payments on the Property.  (Complaint ¶¶17-18, 49, 50).  Based on the facts alleged, Margaret’s reliance
on the promise was foreseeable.  Whether Margaret’s
reliance on Defendant’s alleged promise was reasonable is a question of fact
that cannot be determined on demurrer. 
Margaret has also sufficiently alleged that she was damaged by the
reliance by Defendant’s refusal to return the Property to her and Defendant’s attempt
to evict her from the Property. 
(Complaint ¶¶19, 49, 52).
 
While Margaret has adequately pled a claim for promissory
estoppel against Defendant, again, the basis for Taraya’s claim is
uncertain.  CCP 430.10(f).  
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendant seeks to strike allegations regarding title to
the Property on essentially the same grounds he has demurred to each of the
causes of action in the complaint.  As
noted above, Margaret has sufficiently stated claims related to the title to
the Property against Defendant.  However,
since Taraya is already on title, the basis for her claims relating to title
are unclear.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd
and 5th causes of action by Plaintiff Margaret Gill is
overruled.  The demurrer as to the 4th
cause of action by Plaintiff  Margaret
Gill is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
The demurrer as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
4th and 5th causes of action by Plaintiff Taraya Gill is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
The motion to strike is denied as to Plaintiff Margaret
Gill and moot as to Plaintiff Taraya Gill based on the ruling on the demurrer
as to Taraya Gill.
