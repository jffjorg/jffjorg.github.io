And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed off calendar a motion filed by Johnny Rundell, counsel for plaintiff Kryshawn Cousins, seeking an order relieving him as counsel. The motion was filed on 7/2/24 and served on the opposing party and plaintiff via email. However, the service on plaintiff is defective as there is no indication that plaintiff agreed to accept service via email. Additionally, the proof of service is incomplete and does not indicate who accomplished the substituted service of the motion papers on plaintiff. As a result, the motion is placed off calendar due to the failure of plaintiff to cure the defects in notice.
