(1)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Brenden Smith
(2)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Aria Silva-Espinosa
(3)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Kimberly Quitzon
The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with each
motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Carpenter & Zuckerman (“Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) separately moves to
be relieved as counsel of record for (1) plaintiff Brenden Smith (“Smith”), (2)
plaintiff Aria Silva-Espinosa (“Silva-Espinosa”), and (3) plaintiff Kimberly
Quitzon (“Quitzon”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  In the interest of efficiency, the court
discusses the three pending motions to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs
together.
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
The court finds that Plaintiffs’ Counsel (1) has served plaintiff Smith
with the moving papers at Smith’s last known address, return receipt
requested, and has been unable to confirm that the address is current or to
locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so; (2) has
served plaintiff Silva-Espinosa with the moving papers at Silva-Espinosa’s last
known address, which Plaintiffs’ Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days
is current; and (3) has served plaintiff Quitzon with the moving papers at
Quitzon’s last known address, return receipt requested, and has been unable to
confirm that the address is current or to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so. 
(MC-052 as to Smith, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(2)(a), (b)(2)(b),
(b)(3)(e); MC-052 as to Silva-Espinosa, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(d);
MC-052 as to Quitzon, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(2)(a), (b)(2)(b), (b)(3)(e).)  The court also finds that Plaintiffs’ Counsel
has shown sufficient reasons why the motions
should be granted, and why counsel has brought the motions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under
section 284, subdivision (1).  (MC-052
Forms, ¶ 2.) 
The court therefore grants
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel for (1)
plaintiff Brenden Smith, (2) plaintiff Aria Silva-Espinosa, and (3) plaintiff
Kimberly Quitzon. 
Carpenter & Zuckerman will be relieved as counsel of record for
plaintiffs Brenden Smith, Aria Silva-Espinosa, and Kimberly Quitzon effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of the signed “Order[s] Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel -- Civil” as to each plaintiff on the clients.¿ 
The court orders
Carpenter & Zuckerman to give notice of this ruling and the “Order[s] Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
-- Civil” to plaintiffs Brenden Smith, Aria
Silva-Espinosa, and Kimberly Quitzon, and to all other parties who have
appeared in this action.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
