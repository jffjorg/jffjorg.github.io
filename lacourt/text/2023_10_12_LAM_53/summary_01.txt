Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the first through seventh and ninth causes of action. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff, Ricardo Flores, did not have a physical disability or perceived disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). However, the judge found that the defendants had not adequately addressed each theory of disability alleged in the complaint and had not presented sufficient evidence to show that the plaintiff did not have a real or perceived disability.

The judge noted that the plaintiff had alleged that he suffered from abdominal injuries and resultant anxiety and depression, and that he had not established that his condition did not limit a major life activity. The judge also found that the defendants had not presented any evidence showing that they did not perceive the plaintiff as having a physical condition that made achievement of a major life activity difficult, or as having a disease that did not have a present disabling effect but may become a disability in the future.

Therefore, the judge denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
