And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further discovery responses from defendant American Honda Motor Co. (Defendant) regarding a 2022 Acura TLX purchased by plaintiff Elizabeth Diaz Perez (Plaintiff).

The Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle exhibited defects and nonconformities, including electrical, structural, transmission, and suspension system defects, and that Defendant failed to repurchase or replace the vehicle. The court found that some of the Plaintiff's requests for production of documents were overly broad or unintelligible and therefore denied those requests.

The court granted the motion as to some of the requests, including RFP Nos. 9, 15, 17-18, 20-21, 26, 32, 38, 40-41, 43-44, 49, 61, 63-64, 66-67, and 72, which relate to customer complaints, internal investigations, and reports regarding the same defects alleged by Plaintiff in her Complaint in vehicles of the same year, make, and model, sold in California.

The court denied the motion as to other requests, finding that Defendant had already provided a Code-compliant response or that the requests were too broad or unintelligible.

The court also noted that the Defendant's previous responses were incomplete and that the Plaintiff was entitled to further discovery responses.

The court set the hearing for December 12, 2024, and invited the parties to submit on the tentative ruling.
