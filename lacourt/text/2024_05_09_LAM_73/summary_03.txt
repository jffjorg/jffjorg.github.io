English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case and the legal issues at hand. The plaintiff, Lester Jimenez, filed a complaint against Whole Foods Market, Inc., et al., alleging harassment and wrongful termination due to his disability. The defendants filed a demurrer and motion to strike, which the plaintiff opposed. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of harassment did not state a cause of action, and the demurrer was sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer to the wrongful termination cause of action was found to be moot since the plaintiff had previously dismissed it. The motion to strike the punitive damages allegations was granted since the plaintiff failed to plead specific facts showing oppression, fraud, or malice by an officer, director, or managing agent for the defendants.
