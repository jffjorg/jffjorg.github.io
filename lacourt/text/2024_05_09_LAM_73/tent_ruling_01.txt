TENTATIVE
RULING
 
The
Court GRANTS the joint stipulation to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This is a
wrongful termination action arising from plaintiff Rene Martinez’s
(“Plaintiff’s”) employment with defendant Farmers Financial Solutions, LLC
(“Farmers”) from February 2015 through March 2018. 
 
On January
23, 2019, Plaintiff filed this action’s Complaint against defendants Farmers,
Steve Klein (“Klein”), and Jimmy Coicoechea (“Coicoechea”). The Complaint
asserts the following causes of action against the defendants: 
1.    
Discrimination in Violation of Cal.
Gov. Code §§ 12940 et seq.; 
2.    
Failure to Prevent Discrimination in
violation of Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12940 Et Seq.; 
3.    
Retaliation; 
4.    
Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy; 
5.    
Retaliation in Violation of Cal. Labor
Code § 1102.5; 
6.    
Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; 
7.    
Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; 
8.    
Failure to Provide Accurate Wage
Statements in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 210, 226; 
9.    
Failure to Pay Wages Upon Termination
in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 201, 203; 
10.  Failure to
Pay Overtime in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 510, 1194; 
11.  Failure to
Provide Rest Periods in Violation of Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders
and Cal. Labor Code § 226.7; and  
12.  Failure to
Provide Meal Periods in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 226.7, 512 
 
The parties reached a settlement in this case except for attorneys
fees excluding costs. (See Court’s 01/31/24 Minute Order.) The parties
requested the court to retain jurisdiction to hear the attorneys’ fees motion.
(Ibid.)
 
On February 28, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.
 
Defendants did not file an opposition.
 
On April 29, 2024, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation to
continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees. The parties assert that the Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees was not served to the legal assistant for Farmers’ counsel
but Farmers’ counsel incorrectly assumed that it was, and thus, the Motion and
any deadlines related to the Motion were not calendared. To allow Farmers the
opportunity to timely file an opposition, the parties stipulate the hearing be
continued from May 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. to May 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m., or to the
earliest available date thereafter but no later than June 10, 2024.
 
II.
DISPOSITION
 
Accordingly,
to allow Farmers the opportunity to timely file an opposition, the Court GRANTS the joint stipulation to continue the
hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees.
