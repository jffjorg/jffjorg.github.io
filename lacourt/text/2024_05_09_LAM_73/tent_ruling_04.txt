MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO DEEM PLAINTIFF’S
REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED (filed 03/28/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted
Requests for Admission admitted. 
BACKGROUND
 
On August 25,
2023, Plaintiff David Cordier (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Duane Levandowski; Duane Levandowski, LLC; Scooter Factory; Debra Schulman; and
Andy Subachan (collectively “Defendants”).
 
On March 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for
(1) false advertising, and (2) unfair competition.
 
The FAC
alleges the following. Defendants falsely advertised to California residents on
their website that their product known as the E-Jeep did not require a driver’s
license or a registration in order to be driven on public roads, or
alternatively could be registered. (FAC, ¶ 19.) However,
Plaintiff alleges these statements were false and Plaintiff has suffered
economic injury or damage as a result of Defendants’ false advertising. (Ibid.)
 
On February
14, 2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Admission, Set One on Defendant Duane
Levandowski. (Cordier Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.) Defendant Levandowski did not
respond to this discovery request. (Id., ¶ 4.) 
On March 28,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
to deem admitted Requests for Admission admitted. Defendants did not file an opposition to
Plaintiff’s motion. Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
Where there
has been no timely response to a request for admissions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (CCP §
2033.280(b).)  The party who has failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon
a showing (1) that the party has subsequently served a substantially compliant
response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (CCP §
2033.280(a)(1-2).)  The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted
requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests
for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,
a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
 
If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for a monetary sanction. (Code of Civ. Proc.§
2033.280(b).) “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction…on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).  
 
Further, the
Court may impose a monetary sanction against anyone engaging in a misuse of the
discovery process, ordering the person to “pay reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030(a).) A misuse of discovery includes “[f]ailing to respond or
to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2023.010(d).) 
 
B.     Discussion
 
On February
14, 2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Admission, Set One on Defendant Duane
Levandowski. (Cordier Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.) Defendant Levandowski has
failed to provide a timely response. (Id., ¶ 4.) Defendants have
not filed an opposition to the instant motion. 
 
The Court grants the motion pursuant to C.C.P.
§2033.280 and deems the requests to be admitted. 
 
Plaintiff also seeks sanctions by way of a subsequent
motion as Plaintiff cannot determine the amount of monetary sanctions he would
be entitled to. Section 2033.280(c) states “It is mandatory that
the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with¿Section
2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” Since
Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys fees, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request
to seek sanctions by way of a subsequent motion.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted
Request for Admissions, Set One is GRANTED.  
 
CONCLUSION 
Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted Request for Admissions,
Set One is GRANTED. Defendant Levandowski is deemed to have admitted the truth
of all matters specified in the Request for Admissions as of this date.
