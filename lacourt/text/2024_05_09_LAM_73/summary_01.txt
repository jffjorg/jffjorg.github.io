And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the joint stipulation to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Rene Martinez, filed a wrongful termination action against Farmers Financial Solutions, LLC and others. The parties reached a settlement in the case, except for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff filed a motion for attorneys' fees, which was not opposed by the defendants. The parties then filed a joint stipulation to continue the hearing on the motion for attorneys' fees due to an oversight in serving the motion to the defendants' counsel. The court grants the stipulation to allow the defendants to file an opposition and to schedule a new hearing date.
