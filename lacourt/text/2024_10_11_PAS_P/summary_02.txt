And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiff's second amended complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Laurie Moore, is seeking damages for medical malpractice and statutory violations allegedly committed by the defendants, Luisana Gomez, Ramachandran Srinivasan, Howard Sofen, and Complete Care Community Health Center.

The defendants argued that the second cause of action for statutory violations fails to state a cognizable cause of action, as the California Physician Assistant Practice Act does not provide a private right of action. However, the judge found that the plaintiff has provided sufficient factual allegations to support a finding that the facts are pleaded with particularity.

The judge also recognized that negligence per se may serve as a basis for the plaintiff's recovery and intends to allow the plaintiff to allege a cause of action for statutory violation under the doctrine of negligence per se.

The court orders that the demurrer be overruled, and the defendants are to give notice and provide an answer within 10 days of the hearing.
