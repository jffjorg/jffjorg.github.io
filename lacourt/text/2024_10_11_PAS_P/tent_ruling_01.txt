  Case Number:  23AHCV00796    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET TWOI.        INTRODUCTION
          On April 10, 2023, Plaintiff Elena
Rubio ("Plaintiff") filed a lawsuit against Defendant American Honda
Motor Company ("Defendant") asserting three causes of action under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act: (1) breach of express warranty, (2)
breach of implied warranty, and (3) violation of section 1793.2 of the Act. The
claims concern a 2018 Honda Accord that Plaintiff purchased in October 2018,
alleging the vehicle had serious defects which worsened over time. Despite
multiple repair attempts, Defendant allegedly failed to conform the vehicle to
its warranty obligations.
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff propounded Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Two. On April 5, 2024, Defendant responded with
verified "boilerplate objections." On April 22, 2024, Defendant
provided additional responses, reiterating the same objections. As a result,
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has failed to produce any of the requested
responsive documents.
This motion is now before the Court, with Plaintiff
seeking to compel further production of documents from Set Two, which are
relevant to the claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”)
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          A party responding to requests for inspection must either
provide a statement of compliance, represent that it lacks the ability to
comply, or object. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.210.
          - If a party responds with a statement of compliance, the
statement must indicate whether production will be allowed in whole or in part and
that all documents in the responding party’s possession, custody or control to
which no objection is being made will be included in the production. Code Civ.
Proc. §2031.220.
          - If a party responds that a particular demand cannot be
complied with it must include a representation that a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry have been made and that the inability to comply is because
the item has never existed, has been lost, stolen, or misplaced, or has never
been in or is no longer in the responding party’s possession, custody, or
control; such response must also identify the name and address of any person or
entity known or believed to have possession, custody, or control of the item or
category of item.  Code Civ. Proc. §2031.230.
          - If a response includes objections, a privilege log
identifying documents being withheld must be provided. Code Civ. Proc.
§2031.240.
          When a party propounding demands for inspection deems
responses to the responses to be incomplete or evasive, or deems objections to
be without merit, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
further responses. Such motion must set forth facts showing good cause for the
discovery, be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, and include a
separate statement. Such motion must also be made within 45 days of verified
responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later date
the parties have agreed to in writing. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310(a)-(c). 
          Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310 (h) provides for the imposition
of monetary sanctions against any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
such a motion unless the court finds that the one subject to sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of sanctions unjust.
 
III.     ANALYSIS
A.   Position
of the Parties
Moving Party’s Position
Plaintiff
brings this Motion pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.310,
and 2031.320, on the grounds that Defendant´s objections are not
Code-compliant, and that Defendant failed to provide adequate responses to
Plaintiff’s RPDs, which seek documents relevant to the asserted SBA causes of
action.
Responding Party’s
Opposition
          Defendant argues that its objections are necessary based on
the phrasing of the requests because Plaintiff includes qualifying phrases. asserting
that the requests are overbroad and vague, particularly because they include
qualifying terms such as "concerning," "referring," or
"relating to." Defendant asserts that it provided responses to 39 of
55 requests, making its objections and responses code-compliant under Code of
Civil Procedure. Defendant also contends the requests are irrelevant, as they
seek information unrelated to the specific vehicle at issue, such as data on
other vehicles and customer complaints. Furthermore, Defendant raises concerns
over privacy and confidentiality, arguing that the requests improperly seek
trade secrets and proprietary information. Lastly, Defendant claims that
Plaintiff has failed to show good cause for producing additional documents.
 
B.    Meet
and Confer
A
motion to compel further discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration stating, “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt
at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.)¿ 
Here,
on April 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent Defendant’s counsel a letter in an
attempt to meet and confer in good faith regarding Defendant’s responses to
Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. (Derderian Decl. ¶
19; Ex. 5.) In this letter, Plaintiff’s counsel explained the relevance and
importance of each request in Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents,
Set Two, and supported this position with statutory and case law to demonstrate
that good cause exists to produce the requested documents. (Id.) On April 22,
2024, Defendant provided further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production, Set Two, following its initial objections-only responses.
(Tahsildoost Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. F.)
On
May 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served a further meet and confer letter
addressing Defendant’s discovery responses. Plaintiff’s counsel provided
detailed explanations as to why the documents sought are both relevant and
probative. Specifically, the requested documents are directly related to the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”) claims, including those involving:
(1) Defendant’s policies and procedures for handling Song-Beverly cases and the
subject vehicle (Request Nos. 1-9); and (2) Defendant’s internal investigations
of the defects exhibited in the subject vehicle, including electrical defects
(Request Nos. 10-32) and suspension defects (Request Nos. 33-55). (Derderian
Decl. ¶ 20.)
Therefore,
the court notes the meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
C.    Legal
analysis 
Plaintiff’s
Set Two contains 55 requests. Of these, Defendant objects to 16 requests.
Defendant claims to have responded to 39 of Plaintiff’s requests by either
agreeing to produce documents or stating that it was unable to comply after a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry. (Opposition, p. 2.)
Defendant
asserts that, for Request Nos. 6, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35,
36, 41, 42, 48, 50, 52, 53, and 55, it agreed to produce responsive documents
in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220.
As
to Request Nos. 5, 7, 10, 14, 16, 22, 23, 24, 28, 33, 37, 39, 45, 46, 47, and
51, Defendant responded that it was unable to comply with each request because,
after a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, no responsive documents were
found, or the request was otherwise inapplicable to Defendant. This response is
in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230.
Accordingly,
the requests that remain in dispute are Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 15, 17,
20, 21, 26, 29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, and 54.
Defendant
objects to Plaintiffs Request For Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 1, 2,
3, 4, 8, 9, 15, 17, 20, 21, 26, 29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, and 54. Defendant
objected to each request on the bases of relevance, overbreadth, undue burden
and trade secret privilege. 
Request for Production
Nos.1-9; (which 1-4 and 8-9 are in dispute)
Plaintiff
Requests Nos. 1-4, 8-9 seek documents relating to Defendant’s policies and
procedures for handling SBA cases and the subject vehicle. Specifically,
Plaintiff states that these requests seek documents regarding Defendant’s
written warranties and its policies and procedures for addressing customer
complaints, as well as whether Defendant fulfills its affirmative duties to
repurchase defective vehicles under the SBA. Plaintiff asserts that these
requests are crucial to Plaintiff’s claim for civil penalties, and to
demonstrate that Defendant’s awareness of a prevalent defect that neither
Defendant nor authorized repair facilities were able to repair. (Derderian
Decl. ¶ 21; Motion, pp. 5-6.) Plaintiff further asserts that these requests
focus on documents and information relating to the 2018 Honda Accord, VIN
1HGCV1F34JA244110, which is the subject of this lawsuit.
 
Requests for Production
10-55 (which 
Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production Nos. 10-55 seek documents relating to Defendant’s
internal investigations into the defects exhibited in the subject vehicle,
specifically focusing on electrical defects. Plaintiff contends that these
requests seek documents reflecting Defendant’s internal assessments and
knowledge of the electrical issues and warranty records related to the subject
vehicle and other vehicles experiencing similar defects. Plaintiff asserts that
these requests define the defects based on the symptoms and repairs documented
in the subject vehicle’s repair orders. Plaintiff argues that these documents
are essential to establishing "willfulness" by demonstrating
Defendant's knowledge of the alleged defects—either through evidence that the
subject vehicle was not repaired after a reasonable number of attempts or
through internal investigations and records showing that other consumers
experienced similar problems. (Derderian Decl. ¶ 22; Ex. 6.)
As
stated above, Defendant objects to Plaintiffs Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 15, 17, 20, 21, 26, 29, 31, 38, 40,
43, 44, 49, and 54. Defendant objected to each request at issue on the bases of
relevance, overbreadth, undue burden and trade secret privilege. 
 
a.              
Scope/Relevance
Discovery
is relevant if it is admissible as evidence, or “appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)
“Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or
of any other party to the action.” (Ibid.)¿¿ 
b.    
Improper/Undue
Burden
Plaintiffs
further argue that Defendant’s objections to their first set of RFPs on the
basis that they are unduly burdensome and oppressive are meritless without any
additional showing of any such undue burden or oppression. The party objecting
to a discovery request on this basis bears the burden of supplying evidence of
“the quantum of work required.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 549.)¿¿ 
 
c.    
Overbreadth
To the extent that the court
considers this objection, the court notes that the standard for overbreadth is
to be ambiguous to the point of being unintelligible, which is not met here. (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)¿ 


d.    
Trade Secrets
“‘Trade secret’ means
information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device,
method, technique, or process, that: (1) Derives independent economic value,
actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other
persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) Is
the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain
its secrecy.” (Civ. Code § 3426.1, subd. (d).)¿ 
 
Nos.1 and 2
In
response to most of the discovery requests at issue, Defendant did
substantively respond. Here, for request No.1, Defendant asserts that “it was
unable to comply with the request because, pursuant to a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry, AHM had no responsive documents, and none had ever
existed.” The Court finds this is compliant with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.230. 
 
As
for No.2, Defendant “agreed to produce responsive documents pertaining to
Plaintiff and/or the Subject Vehicle.”  To
the extent that such documents have not yet been produced, the Court orders
Defendant to produce them.
No. 3
Defendant
objects to this request on the grounds that it is overbroad, vague, and
ambiguous. However, to the extent the Court considers this objection, the Court
notes that the standard for overbreadth requires ambiguity to the point of
being unintelligible, which is not satisfied here. (Obregon v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) Accordingly, Defendant is ordered to provide a
further response. 
 
No. 4
Defendant
objects to this request on the grounds of irrelevance, vagueness, and
ambiguity, specifically arguing that the term "recall policy and
procedure" is not defined and is therefore vague and ambiguous, making the
information sought indeterminable. (Opposition to Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement.) However, to the extent the Court considers this objection, the
Court notes that the standard for overbreadth requires ambiguity to the point
of being unintelligible, which is not the case here. (Obregon v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) Additionally, the information sought is
relevant, as Plaintiff is seeking documents related to Defendant’s policies and
procedures for handling Song-Beverly Act cases, which is directly at issue in
this action. Therefore, Defendant is ordered to provide a further response.
 
Nos 8-9
Request
No. 8 seeks all documents used since 2011 to evaluate consumers’ requests for
repurchases pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. For this request,
Defendant states that it voluntarily agreed to produce what it was not
otherwise obligated to “for purposes of promoting the cooperative exchange of
information between the parties.” (Opposition to Plaintiff SS, p. 9).  To the extent that such documents have not
yet been produced, the Court orders Defendant to produce them.
Request
No. 9 seeks information regarding Defendant’s "warranty buyback reduction
goals." Defendant objected to this request, arguing that it is irrelevant
to any element of Plaintiff’s case under the statutory framework of the
Song-Beverly Act. Specifically, Defendant asserts that this information has no
bearing on whether Plaintiff’s vehicle exhibited a nonconformity that
substantially impaired its use, value, or safety, nor whether Defendant was
unable to repair the vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts.
Additionally, Defendant objects on the grounds that the request seeks
information that violates the right to privacy or is confidential, commercially
sensitive, proprietary, or a trade secret. Defendant further objects to the
extent that this request seeks responses on behalf of any other entity. The
Court agrees with Defendant that this request exceeds the scope of permissible
discovery and may encroach upon confidential information. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s Request No. 9 is DENIED.
 
Nos 15, 17, 20, 21, 26,
29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, 54
Defendant
raises several arguments and groups them together for Requests for Production
Nos. 10-55, including Nos. 15, 17, 20, 21, 26, 29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, and
54, which are at issue here. Defendant first argues that the requests are
overbroad and vague, particularly due to the use of terms like
"concerning," "referring," or "relating to"
without sufficient particularity, which fail to describe the requested
documents with the specificity required by the Code of Civil Procedure.
Next,
Defendant contends that these requests are irrelevant because they seek
information about other vehicles, customer complaints, or defects unrelated to
Plaintiff’s vehicle. Defendant asserts that this information does not pertain
to the specific claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, which is
focused on whether Plaintiff’s vehicle exhibited a nonconformity that
substantially impaired its use, value, or safety.
Defendant also raises
concerns regarding privacy, particularly with Requests Nos. 15-55, which may
involve the disclosure of trade secrets, proprietary information, and other
confidential data. As a result, Defendant argues that these requests exceed the
permissible scope of discovery and should be denied.
Here,
the Court notes that the parties may stipulate to a protective order to
safeguard against the disclosure of any claimed private, trade secret, or
confidential proprietary information. To the extent that the Court considers
Defendant's objection based on privacy and confidentiality, the Court observes
that the standard for overbreadth requires ambiguity to the point of being
unintelligible, which is not the case here. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
Moreover,
the Court finds that Defendant has not sufficiently substantiated its claim of
undue burden in producing the requested documents. The Court also agrees with
Plaintiff that the requests for production relating to the disputed requests
are essential to demonstrate "willfulness" specifically regarding
whether the manufacturer had knowledge of the alleged defects. This knowledge
could be evidenced by the fact that the subject vehicle was not repaired after
a reasonable number of attempts or through internal investigations and warranty
records showing that other consumers experienced similar issues.
Accordingly,
the Court compels Defendant to provide further responses to Requests for
Production Nos. 15, 17, 20, 21, 26, 29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, and 54.

motion to compel Further Responses to Request for Production, Set Two is
GRANTED IN PART as to Request for Production Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 17, 20, 21,
26, 29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, and 54.
