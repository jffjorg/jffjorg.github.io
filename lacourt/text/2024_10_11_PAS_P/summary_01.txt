Here is a brief summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents in part. The Court orders Defendant to provide further responses to certain requests for production, including Requests Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 17, 20, 21, 26, 29, 31, 38, 40, 43, 44, 49, and 54. The Court finds that these requests are relevant and necessary to demonstrate "willfulness" by Defendant, specifically regarding whether the manufacturer had knowledge of the alleged defects. The Court also orders Defendant to provide a further response to Request No. 9, which seeks information regarding Defendant's "warranty buyback reduction goals." The Court denies Plaintiff's request for discovery regarding Request No. 9, finding that it exceeds the scope of permissible discovery and may encroach upon confidential information.
