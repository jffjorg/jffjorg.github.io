 Case Number:  23AHCV01038    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING
DEFENDANTS' DEMURRER TO SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINTI.         INTRODUCTION
In this medical malpractice action,
Plaintiff Laurie Moore ("Plaintiff") alleges that on May 6, 2022,
Defendants Luisana Gomez, Ramachandran Srinivasan, Howard Sofen, and Complete
Care Community Health Center provided her with medical care. Plaintiff claims
that the medical care she received from Defendants was deficient, leading to
significant harm and injury. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants
negligently prescribed Plaquenil for her psoriatic arthritis, which resulted in
serious adverse health conditions. On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed
Howard Sofen from the case. 
On May 31, 2024, the Court issued
an order sustaining Defendants Luisana Gomez, Ramachandran Srinivasan and Complete
Care Community Health Center (collectively “Defendants”) demurrer as to
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). In response, on June 21, 2024,
Plaintiff filled her Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) asserting 1) Medical Negligence
and 2) Statutory Violations.
            On
July 24, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer as to the SAC, arguing that the
second cause of action for statutory violations fails to state a cognizable
cause of action. Plaintiff filed an Opposition on September 26, 2024, and
Defendant filed a Reply on October 3, 2024. 
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and confer
with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the responsive
pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video conference with
the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer. Additionally, the
demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing the meet and confer
efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to meet and confer is
not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer or granting or
denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a)(4), 435.5,
subd. (a)(4).)
In this instance, the Court finds that Defendants sufficiently
complied with the meet-and-confer requirements. The Declaration of Jacob S.
Rosenberg is offered in support of counsel's compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure Section 430.41, which requires parties to meet and confer before
filing a demurrer. Rosenberg declares that he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s
counsel on July 17, 2023, regarding the issues raised in Defendants’ demurrer.
Plaintiff’s counsel responded the same day, disputing the grounds for the
demurrer. (Rosenberg Decl. ¶ 5). 
Accordingly, the Court finds that
the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.
MOVING PARTY’S ARGUMENT
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s
second cause of action for Statutory Violations under the California Physician
Assistant Practice Act fails because the Act does not provide a private right
of action, and any alleged violations should be incorporated into the medical
negligence claim. Defendants also argue that the Second Cause of Action is
uncertain.
Defendants do not demur as to the
first cause of action for Medical Negligence. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f)
provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
A.   
General Demurrer – Failure to State Facts
Sufficient to Constitute a Cause of Action
Defendants demur to the second
cause of action for statutory violations, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to
demonstrate a private right of action under the California Physician Assistant
Practice Act. (Demurrer, pp. 12-17).  Plaintiff, however, seeks to hold
Defendants liable for violations of this Act, as set forth in Division 2,
Chapter 7.7 of the Business & Professions Code (§ 3500, et seq.), as well
as the California Physician Assistant Regulations under Title 16, Division 13.8
of the California Code of Regulations (§ 1399.500, et seq.) (SAC, p. 7).
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated several provisions,
including California Code of Regulations, Title 16, §§ 1399.540, 1399.541,
1399.545, 1399.546, and 1399.547 (SAC, p. 8).
The relevant statutes and
regulations govern specific duties on a physician assistant and his or her
supervising physician. The legislative intent of the Act is to “encourage the
effective utilization of the skills of physicians and surgeons, and physicians
and surgeons and podiatrists practicing in the same medical group practice, by
enabling them to work with qualified physician assistants to provide quality
care.” (Business & Professions Code § 3500).
In the SAC, Plaintiff cites several
provisions of the California Code of Regulations. Specifically, Title 16, §§
1399.540, 1399.541, 1399.545, 1399.546, and 1399.547 (SAC, p. 8). § 1399.540(c)
requires physician assistants to consult with or refer patients to a licensed
physician when a task exceeds their competence. Similarly, § 1399.541(e)
imposes duties on physician assistants to instruct and counsel patients on
matters related to their physical and mental health. §1399.545 mandates that
supervising physicians must be available and maintain responsibility for the
medical services provided by the physician assistant. §1399.546 requires
physician assistants to document the supervising physician for each episode of
patient care, while § 1399.547 requires notification to patients that the
physician assistant is licensed and regulated by the board.
Here, Plaintiff pleads that
Defendants violated these regulations by failing to properly supervise the care
provided by Defendant Gomez, a physician assistant. Specifically, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Dr. Srinivasan failed to evaluate Gomez’s competency and
skill (SAC, ¶33a, p. 8), This allegation directly violates §1399.546.
Furthermore, Plaintiff asserts that both Defendants Dr. Srinivasan and Health
Center failed to adequately supervise Gomez’s care of Plaintiff between March
8, 2022, and approximately April 12, 2023, which would violate § 1399.540(c).
These failures allegedly misled Plaintiff into believing that she was receiving
care from a licensed medical doctor, constituting a violation of § 1399.547.
Additionally, Plaintiff contends that Defendants did not provide proper
notification that Gomez was a licensed physician assistant, and that Gomez
improperly prescribed medication in violation of § 1399.541 (SAC, pp. 7-9). Given
these allegations, The Court finds that Plaintiff has provided sufficient
factual allegations sufficient to support a finding that the facts are plead
with particularly.
Additionally, Defendants cite Lopez
v. Ledesma (2022) 12 Cal.5th 848, a Supreme Court of California case
concerning the scope of a physician assistant's practice under MICRA's cap on
non-economic damages. However, this case is not controlling here, as the
Plaintiff is not asserting MICRA applicability but rather claims under the
California Physician Assistant Practice Act. Defendants argue that the Act is
improperly used here as a means to circumvent non-economic damage limits,
citing that it was not intended to be a separate cause of action (Demurrer, p.
9).
This argument is unpersuasive. The
Plaintiff is not precluded from asserting a cause of action based on alleged
violations of the Physician Assistant Practice Act. For purposes of ruling on
the demurrer, the Court must determine whether the Plaintiff’s SAC sufficiently
alleges that Defendants violated the Act.
Defendants argue that there is no
private right of action under the Act, and any statutory violations should be
incorporated into the medical negligence claim. (Reply, p.5) However, Plaintiff
argues that Defendants have cited no case law that specifically prohibits
Plaintiff from pleading statutory violations of the Act as a separate cause of
action. (Opposition, p.18)
After conducting its own research,
the Court has not found any appellate court decisions directly addressing this
issue or finding that such a cause of action cannot proceed. Thus, the Court intends
to allow Plaintiff to allege a cause of action for statutory violation under
the doctrine of negligence per se.
The Court finds that while
negligence per se is not a separate cause of action (see Johnson v.
Honeywell International, Inc. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 549, 555; Millard
v. Biosources, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1353 n.2.), it is a
separate theory of negligence upon which recovery may be based. (See e.g., Randi
W. v. Muroc Joint Unified School Dist. (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1066,
1086-87.)  Therefore, the Court
recognizes that negligence per se may serve as a basis for Plaintiff’s
recovery.
Given that such a claim is not
expressly prohibited, the Court will permit Plaintiff to proceed on this
alternate negligence per se theory.
Accordingly, the Court finds that
the SAC pleads sufficient facts to proceed on this cause of action and the
demurrer is overruled.
