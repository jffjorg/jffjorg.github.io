And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Zvi Kriple vs. Holly Hawk. The plaintiff, Kriple, filed a motion to compel the defendant, Hawk, to serve responses to Form Interrogatories. However, the judge has denied the motion because the proof of service is incomplete and defective. The judge notes that the proof of service does not include the date of service, and that the person who served the interrogatories, Tiffany Buda, was not authorized to do so until June 13, 2023. As a result, the judge has denied the motion and the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $240. The judge also notes that even if the motion had been successful, the request for sanctions would have been denied because the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence of expenses incurred in preparing the motion. The parties are advised to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling, and to be aware that other parties may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
