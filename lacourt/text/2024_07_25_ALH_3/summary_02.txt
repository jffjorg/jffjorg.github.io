And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint for declaratory relief. The plaintiff, Jose Rivera, alleges that he purchased a winning lottery ticket for the $2.04 billion Powerball Lottery draw on November 7, 2022, but the ticket was stolen by co-defendant Urachi F. Romero. The defendant, California State Lottery Commission, argues that there is no "actual controversy" between the two parties regarding the ownership of the lottery ticket. The Court agrees and sustains the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant was ever in possession of the ticket and that the plaintiff's right to a share of the winnings accrues solely from possession of a winning ticket. The Court declines to grant leave to amend and orders the parties to notify the Court if they intend to submit on the tentative.
