And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for an order requiring the plaintiff, Nelson Enrique Vanegas Toro, to file an undertaking in the amount of $29,649.81 to secure an award of costs and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff had argued that he was indigent and should not be required to post an undertaking, but the judge found that the plaintiff had failed to establish his indigency by providing documentation of his income and expenses. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to show that he had made any attempts to obtain an undertaking and that his expense history belied his claim of indigency. The judge further found that the plaintiff's action was not frivolous, but rather that the defendant had a reasonable possibility of prevailing at trial.
