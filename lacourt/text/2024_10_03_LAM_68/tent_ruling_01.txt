SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Garrett Matsunaga alleges a General Motors vehicle suffers from defective battery
system, which recalls and software updates have not fixed, thereby lowering the
value of the vehicle.
 
On
June 14, 2023, plaintiff filed a complaint against General Motors LLC for 1.
Fraud Concealment and Misrepresentation; 2. Negligent Misrepresentation 3.
Business & Professions Code §17200 4. Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act –
Breach of Express Warranty; 5. Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Breach of
Implied Warranty; 6. Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Civil Code §1793.2(B).
On October 26, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the complaint with 20
days leave to amend. 
 
On
November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for 1. Fraud -- Concealment;
2. Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Breach of Express Warranty; 3.
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; 5.
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Civil Code §1793.2(B). On January 29,
2024, the court overruled the demurrer to the first amended complaint. General
Motors answered the first amended complaint on July 24, 2024. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Garrett Matsunaga moves to compel further
responses to special interrogatories (set one), numbers 14, 20, 23, 25, 26, 39,
41, and 43. Plaintiff maintains the objections lack merit and demonstrate a
lack of good faith. Defendant General Motors (GM) in opposition maintains the subject
items “elevate form over substance.” GM challenges the sufficiency of the meet
and confer effort, and stands by the objections, based on the responsiveness in
prior production and fully answered responses. Plaintiff in reply maintains it
seeks relevant information, represents a sufficient meet and confer process,
and maintains identification of the technicians constitutes a valid form of
discovery.
 
Due to the increasing volume of filed Lemon Law cases
in this courtroom and presumably countywide, including the increasing number of
motions to compel further responses, this court generally adheres to certain,
consistent guidelines for its cases: an approach allowing discovery into the
relevant make and model year for all impacted systems or parts, without opening
the door for a general inquiry into any and all lemon law claims filed against
vehicle manufacturers for all makes and models, including varying individual
and potential system defects. The goal is to facilitate robust adjudication of
the case, without imposing any burden on defendant to determine the cause of
the purported defects, while also allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to
investigate. The court in no way doctrinally adheres to this policy. The court
established this policy based on established practice standards common among
counsel in this field based on standards established and reviewed by practice
and reviewed at least in party by appellate courts. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153-154; Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc., supra,
90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1104-1105.) No doubt other courts may take different approaches.
The court in no way seeks to invite comparisons with other courtrooms. The
court only notes its reasoning behind its policy.
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, “[a] plaintiff pursuing
an action under the Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a
nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the
use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the
vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the manufacturer of
the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or
his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number
of repair attempts (the failure to repair element). (Civ.Code, § 1793.2; Ibrahim v. Ford Motor Co.
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886–887, 263 Cal.Rptr. 64.)” (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)
 
Normally,
the court lists all items. While the subject motion only relies on an 18 page
separate statement, the court still finds the eight individual items need not
be listed. Items 14, 20 address identification of the technicians responsible
for inspections, warranty repairs. Numbers 23, 25, 26, 39, 41, and 43 present a
much broader based request for identification of any and all persons with
knowledge. 
 
GM admits to
already providing the information in document production, GM cannot rely on
responses to other discovery items. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784 [“Answers must be complete and responsive. Thus, it is
not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my deposition’, ’See my pleading’, or
‘See the financial statement’”].) GM must therefore provide complete responses.
 
The
motion is granted in its entirety. Production to occur within 30 days.
 
Plaintiff
makes no request for sanctions. 
 
Trial
remains set for December 9, 2024.

RULING: Granted in
Part/Denied in Part.
Plaintiff Garrett Matsunaga moves to compel further
responses to request for production of documents (set one), numbers 16, 17, 20,
24, 28-29, 37-64, 67-70, 73-74, and 77-86. Plaintiff maintains the objections
lack merit and demonstrate a lack of good faith. Defendant General Motors (GM) in
opposition maintains the numerous separate requests constitute an unnecessarily
voluminous and overbroad discovery request. GM challenges the sufficiency of
the meet and confer effort, and stands by the objections, based on the
responsiveness in prior production and denial of the necessity for production
of information regarding other unrelated vehicles. Plaintiff in reply maintains
it seeks relevant information, represents a sufficient meet and confer process,
and challenges any claims regarding the inability to conduct database searches.

 
Due to the increasing volume of filed Lemon Law cases
in this courtroom and presumably countywide, including the increasing number of
motions to compel further responses, particularly for document production, this
court generally adheres to certain, consistent guidelines for its cases: an
approach allowing discovery into the relevant make and model year for all
impacted systems or parts, without opening the door for a general inquiry into
any and all lemon law claims filed against vehicle manufacturers for all makes
and models, including varying individual and potential system defects. The goal
is to facilitate robust adjudication of the case, without imposing any burden
on defendant to determine the cause of the purported defects, while also
allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to investigate. The court in no way
doctrinally adheres to this policy. The court established this policy based on
established practice standards common among counsel in this field based on
standards established and reviewed by practice and reviewed at least in party
by appellate courts. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153-154; Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc., supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 1104-1105.) No doubt
other courts may take different approaches. The court in no way seeks to invite
comparisons with other courtrooms. The court only notes its reasoning behind
its policy.
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, “[a] plaintiff pursuing
an action under the Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a
nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the
use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the
vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the manufacturer of
the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or
his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number of
repair attempts (the failure to repair element). (Civ.Code, § 1793.2; Ibrahim v. Ford Motor Co.
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886–887, 263 Cal.Rptr. 64.)” (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)
 
Normally,
the court lists all items, but given the 46 individual items and 114 page
separate statement submitted by Plaintiff alone, the court declines to
reproduce each and every disputed items. The court generally adheres to a
policy limiting discovery to the make, model and year. The complaint identifies
the claims involve defects with the battery and now satisfactorily pled fraud –
concealment cause of action. The court declines to allow open ended broad based
discovery spanning multiple years, and other makes and models under the GM
umbrella of vehicles regardless of any potential shared parts, common
issues/defects, etc. In ordering discovery, the court seeks adjudication on the
applicable vehicle, and discourages discovery practices intended to facilitate
the creation of databases for Plaintiff’s firms to document every defective
vehicle across a fleet of manufactured vehicles. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
216, 224–225.) 
 
The court assumes familiarity between counsel, and invites
the parties to further meet and confer in order to refine database search terms
to items, such as trouble codes, reports, similar defect reports and recalls,
fire hazards, etc. All search terms must directly relate to the claims in the
subject action regarding battery defects and fraudulent concealment on the
subject vehicle model and year only.
 
With this criteria stated, GM is ordered to produce further
responses to numbers 16, 17, 43, 49, 51, 55, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68,
69, 70, 73, 74, 80, and 81. To the extent the 60s and 70s series documents on
battery melts or burns address non-model years, GM may state no applicable
documentation exists in conformance with the limitations imposed by the court. The
fire hazard threat and battery charge issues addressed in number 39, 40, 41 are
both relevant and subject to narrowing as well. 
 
Numbers 38 and 42 limits the subject matter to batteries,
but it’s not clear if other forms of battery defect complaints were presented.
The court invites refinement of terms.
 
On numbers 20, 24, 28, 29, 38, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 52,
53, 54, and 56, the court finds the requests impermissibly broad. It’s not
clear whether the parties can meet and confer to narrow the terms to make,
model and year, given the open ended terms like “repeat complaints,” “handling
of complaints” on any and all manufactured vehicles, “policies and procedures
for the issuance of recalls” “technical service bulletins,” NHTSA
communications, TREAD reports. The court invites the parties to meet and confer
on the make, model, year and defect, but if GM maintains no such applicable
information exists, GM must state as much in verified responses. 
 
While number 37 appears capable of refinement, the probative
value of the request as some form of establishing a basis of magnitude in the
allegedly known battery defect remains tenuous. Numbers 57-58, 77, 78, 79, 82,
83, 84, 85, and 86, are too general (or lack apparent applicability such as
hybrid systems on an alleged all electric vehicle), and any narrowing would be
redundant with other items addressing customer complaints. The court denies the
motion on these items.
 
Upon
agreement to terms, GM to provide further responses, including documents or a
lack of existence of said documents under the search terms, where applicable on
numbers 16, 17, 20, 24, 28, 29, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53,
54, 55, 56 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73, 74, 80, and 81 GM must
also provide a privilege log. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (c).) The
motion is denied as to 37, 57-58, 77, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, and 86.
 
The
parties are ordered to meet and confer within 15 days of this order. Production
shall occur no later than 30 days after the lapse of the meet and confer
period. 
 
Plaintiff
makes no request for sanctions. 
 
Trial
remains set for December 9, 2024.
