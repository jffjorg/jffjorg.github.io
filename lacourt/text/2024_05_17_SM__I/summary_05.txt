And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the judgment. First, the court confirms that post-judgment interest will accrue automatically upon entry of the judgment. Second, the court agrees with cross-complainants that the total award should be included in the judgment to avoid ambiguity. Third, the court finds that cross-complainants are the prevailing party and awards fees to them. The court also allows cross-defendants to oppose the fees. Finally, the court orders cross-defendants to prepare a revised judgment that includes the fee award and returns it to the court for signature within 10 court days.
