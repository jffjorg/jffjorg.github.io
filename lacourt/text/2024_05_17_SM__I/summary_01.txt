```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has decided to grant the application brought by CAIC, which claims to be the actual insurer of the property. The court is reluctant to grant the application, but CAIC has demonstrated that it informed plaintiff's counsel of its insurer liability in November 2022. The court notes that it cannot force a party to trial in less than three months, and CAIC may need additional time to prepare for trial. The court will hear brief explanations from plaintiff's counsel as to why CAIC was not brought into the case earlier. If no good reason is provided, the court will vacate the trial date and set a new date, potentially as late as December 2025.
