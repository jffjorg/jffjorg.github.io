  Case Number:  22SMCV00521    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  I The court reluctantly must GRANT the application.  It is brought by a newly added party, who was
served recently and answered earlier this month.  According to that party, it is the actual
insurer of the property, and thus to the extent that there is insurer
liability, it would be the party responsible, not Mercury.  According to the moving party (CAIC), it informed
plaintiff of this in November 2022, and plaintiff’s counsel was well aware of
the problem. 
 
Assuming that is true, the court cannot force a party to
trial in less than three months.  That is
not enough time to bring a summary judgment motion or to take discovery.  Even if the court were to rule that discovery
is cross-admissible and even were plaintiff to agree to forego discovery as to
CAIC, CAIC might still need to retain experts and have its own additional
discovery to do.  
 
The court will hear from plaintiffs—briefly—as to why CAIC
was not brought into the case earlier. 
But if a good reason is not given, the court will need to vacate the
trial date.  The court warns that if such
is the case and there is no good cause for the problem, the court’s next
available trial date is December 2025. 
The court makes no guarantees that it can get the case on the trial
docket earlier than that, although it is possible.
