And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is inclined to grant the motion to continue the MSJ hearing, but not for 90 days as initially requested. The court recognizes the need to analyze the defendant's deposition before filing an opposition to the MSJ hearing. However, 90 days is considered excessive. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not shown diligence in obtaining the deposition earlier. The judge is willing to give the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to gather evidence to oppose the MSJ hearing. If the evidence is sufficient, justice will be done by granting the continuance. If the evidence is not sufficient, the defendant will be happy that the procedural ground for appeal will be rendered moot. The judge will discuss this further with the parties.
