The judge believes that the investigative file was obtained in confidence and that the LAPD has not weighed each piece of evidence to determine what can be produced without jeopardizing the investigation. The judge will review the evidence in camera and continue the hearing to allow time for the review. The judge will inquire of the LAPD and investigating detective about each piece of information and will endeavor to have as much of the hearing in public as possible.
