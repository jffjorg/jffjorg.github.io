 Case Number:  SC123117    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  I On the issues that remain, the court's thinking is as follows.  Post judgment interest follows as a matter of course upon entry of the judgment.  Therefore, the language in the judgment that interest will accrue at the legal rate from the date of the judgment until paid is appropriate.  The court agrees with cross-complainants as to item (b).  The court sees no problem including the total award, and it will avoid ambiguity and confusion.  The court believes that cross-complainants are the prevailing party for purposes of costs and therefore the court agrees with cross complainants as to item (c).  As to item d, the court agrees with plaintiffs.  Cross-complainants may move for fees as provided by law, but plaintiffs may oppose the motion.  However, deleting the paragraph leads to problems because unless there is room for it in the judgment, an entirely new judgment will be required if they are granted.  Therefore, the court will include the following language: "Cross-complainants may move for an award of attorneys' fees as provided by law and cross-defendants may oppose both the entitlement to fees and the amount of the fees sought.  Accordingly, fees in the amount of $________ are awarded to cross-complainants and against Hertzel Illulian.  For clarity, the amount in this paragraph may be zero or higher, depending on the outcome of the motion."  Interest on this amount is likely to run from the date of the award, not the date of the judgment.The court will ask cross-defendants to prepare a judgment that conforms to the above and submit it to the court for signature within 10 court days.  Once signed and served, either party may file motions for a new trial or JNOV.
