 Case Number:  23SMCV00851    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the motion to continue the
MSJ hearing, but not for 90 days.  The
court understands the need to take defendant’s deposition and analyze it before
filing an opposition.  But 90 days is
excessive.  The court also notes that
there is no declaration showing diligence by plaintiff in getting the
deposition earlier.  That said, the court
is inclined to be sure that plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to marshal the
evidence to oppose the motion.  If that
evidence is sufficient, then justice is done by the continuance.  If it is not sufficient, then defendant will
be all the happier in that the procedural ground for appeal will have been
rendered moot.  The court will discuss
this with the parties briefly.
