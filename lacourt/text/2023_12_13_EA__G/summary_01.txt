Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to seek sanctions against the defendant. The motions are granted, and the defendant is ordered to provide responses to the discovery requests without objection within 30 days. The court also awards sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $336.65, payable within 30 days. The court declines to award sanctions against the defendant's counsel. The ruling is based on the defendant's failure to provide discovery responses despite court orders, and the court finds that the defendant's alleged inability to communicate with defense counsel does not excuse its responsibility to comply with discovery obligations.
