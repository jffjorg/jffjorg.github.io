And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the cross-complainant's motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The cross-complainant, Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc., filed a motion on August 9, 2024, seeking summary judgment or summary adjudication in its favor and against the cross-defendant, David Maijala. However, Mulgrew failed to file a motion or application to file two exhibits conditionally under seal, which it lodged with the court. The judge notes that this may have been an oversight, but because the documents were not formally filed with the court, they are not part of the permanent record and will not be reviewed in ruling on the motion.

The judge finds that it is appropriate to continue the hearing on the motion to give Mulgrew an opportunity to file an ex parte application to file the documents under seal. The hearing is continued to November 26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 53.
