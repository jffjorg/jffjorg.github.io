[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
cross-complainant’s motion for summary
  judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Cross-complainant Mulgrew
Aircraft Components, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Cross-defendant
David Maijala 
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. (“Mulgrew”) filed
the pending motion on August 9, 2024, moving the court for an order granting
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication, in its favor and
against cross-defendant David Maijala (“Maijala”) on its Cross-Complaint. 
The court notes that, in support of its motion, Mulgrew has filed a
“Notice of Lodging of Documents Conditionally Under Seal,” informing the court
that it has lodged two exhibits conditionally under seal “[p]ursuant to Rule
2.551(b)(4), and paragraph 17 of the Protective Order . . . , pending
determining of Cross-Complainant and Defendant’s Application for an Order to
File Under Seal.”[1]  (Aug. 9, 2024 Notice of Lodging, p. 2:3-11.)  However, Mulgrew did not file a motion or
application to file these documents under seal as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.551, subd. (b)(1)
[“A party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a
motion or an application for an order sealing the record[,]” which “must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient o
justify the sealing”] [emphasis added].) 
The court notes that this might have been an oversight, because Mulgrew
filed a “[Proposed] Order re Application to an Order to File Under Seal.”  (Aug. 9, 2024 Proposed Order re Sealing.) 
Because Mulgrew has only lodged, and has not filed, these documents
with the court, they are not part of the court’s permanent record, such that
court will not review them in ruling on Mulgrew’s motion.  (Mao’s Kitchen, Inc. v. Mundy (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 132, 150 [“Filing a document makes it a part of the permanent
court file, whereas lodging a document makes it only temporarily a court
record”].)  However, the court notes that
Mulgrew has relied on these documents in order to prove that Maijala misappropriated
its trade secrets, and therefore may require the court’s review.  (See, e.g., Mot., pp. 14:14-21 [asserting
that Maijala removed Mulgrew’s documents, citing material facts numbers 15 and
19], 22:16-20 [asserting that it owns 7 separate trade secrets], 23:10-13
[arguing that Maijala, in removing documents, misappropriated its trade
secrets]; Nenni Decl., ¶ 18 [asserting that the documents obtained by Maijala
are attached as Exhibit O and appear to constitute Mulgrew’s trade secrets];
Def. Material Fact Nos. 15 [citing Exhibit O as supporting evidence], 19
[citing Exhibit O in support of material fact that “[t]he documents which
Maijala removed from Mulgrew on or about October 2, 2019, include trade
secrets”].)  
Thus, the court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises
its discretion, to continue the hearing on this motion in order to give Mulgrew
an opportunity to file an ex parte application to file these documents under
seal pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 2.550-2.551.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.’s motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication, is continued to November
26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court finds good cause to hear this motion within 30 days before the
date of trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a)(3).) 
Cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. may file an ex
parte application pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 2.550-2.551 to
seal the documents it has lodged with the court conditionally under seal in
support of its motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary
adjudication. 
The court orders cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
