considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July
13, 2022, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants David Malcom Tutuila Iosia Jr. (“David Iosia”),
Yvonne Vanimonimo Iosia (“Yvonne Iosia”) and Does 1-10 for subrogation recovery.  The complaint demanded $44,176.27. 
On
July 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service of
the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on David Iosia
on July 23, 2022. 
On
September 1, 2022, the clerk entered David Iosia’s default. 
On
April 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service of
the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on Yvonne
Iosia on March 24, 2024. 
On
May 17, 2024, the clerk entered Yvonne Iosia’s default. 
On
August 29, 2024, the Court dismissed Does 1-10 without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgment against David Iosia Jr. and Yvonne Iosia
and award Plaintiff $51,419.14, consisting of $44,176.27 as the demand of the
complaint, $6,582.87 in prejudgment interest, and $660.00 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment against
Defendants for $44,176.27, including $35,000.00 for bodily injury damages
sustained by driver Summer Sagewen French (“Summer French”).  (See Arias Decl. ¶¶
5, 9.)  To support the assertion that Summer
French sustained $35,000.00 in bodily injury damages, Plaintiff cites Exhibit I
to the Arias declaration. 
Exhibit
I describes medical expenses incurred by Nanette Lopez, not Summer French.  Nanette Lopez is apparently the person to
whom Plaintiff issued the insurance policy and the owner of the vehicle which Summer
French was driving when the accident occurred. (See Arias Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  Plaintiff
does not explain why Exhibit I describes Nanette Lopez, rather than Summer
French, as the “patient” who incurred the listed medical expenses. 
Even
assuming Exhibit I describes Summer French’s medical expenses, the exhibit does
not demonstrate that Plaintiff was required to pay Summer French $35,000.00 in
bodily injury damages.  Based on Exhibit
I, Summer French appears to have incurred no more than $5,500.00 in medical
expenses as a result of the accident. 
Plaintiff should explain the basis for its request for $35,000.00 in
bodily injury damages. 
In
addition, the declarant has not signed Section 8 of the CIV-100 form.  
The
Court denies the petition.         
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Interinsurance
Exchange of the Automobile Club’s application for default judgment against
Defendants David Malcom Tutuila Iosia Jr.
and Yvonne Vanimonimo Iosia filed on August
29, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
