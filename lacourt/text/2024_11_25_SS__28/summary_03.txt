And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor plaintiff Jaxon Beltran's claims. The petition was filed by Petitioner Tiffany Rodriguez, who is asking for expedited approval of the compromise. However, the judge found several inconsistencies in the petition and attachments, including the amount of medical expenses to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The judge also noted that the proposed order was inconsistent with the petition. As a result, the judge denied the petition and ordered Petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
