And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a petition to approve a compromise of a lawsuit filed by Michele Woodward. The petition was filed by Mari Woodward, who was ordered to submit revised documents, including a petition, special needs trust paperwork, and a proposed order, at least 10 days before the continued hearing. However, Mari Woodward failed to submit these documents and did not provide an explanation for the failure. As a result, the court has denied the petition and ordered Mari Woodward to give notice and file proof of service of the ruling with the court within five days.
