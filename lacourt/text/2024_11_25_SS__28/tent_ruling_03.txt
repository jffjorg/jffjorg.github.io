 Case Number:  21STCV23542    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On June
24, 2021, Plaintiffs Tiffany Rodriguez and Marcos Beltran filed this action
against Defendants Ofelia Duran (“Duran”), Gabriel Herrera, and Does 1-25 for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
November 22, 2021, the clerk entered Duran’s and Herrera’s defaults.  On February 28, 2023, the Court vacated the
defaults based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On
September 12, 2024, the Court added Jaxon Beltran, a minor by and through his guardian
ad litem Tiffany Rodriguez, as a plaintiff to the complaint based on the
parties’ stipulation. 
On
September 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
September 19, 2024, Petitioner Tiffany Rodriguez (“Petitioner”) filed a
petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Jaxon
Beltran’s claims. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromise of the claims of minor
Plaintiff Jaxon Beltran. 
DISCUSSION 
          Section 13a(1) of the petition states that total medical
expenses were  $843.00.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that the
medical expenses were not subject to any reduction.  That should mean that all of the medical
expenses ($843.00) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the
petition states that only $115.00 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  As a result, $728.00 of the
medical expenses remain unaccounted for. 
The Court cannot grant a petition unless it shows that all medical
expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds. 
          The Kaiser medical bill attached to the petition appears to
show that Kaiser reduced its charges by $493.00.  If this is correct, Petitioner can place that
figure in Section 13a(3) of the petition as a reduction of the total medical
expenses. 
          Section 13a(2) of the petition states that $728.00 of the
medical expenses were paid.  Section 13e
states that Petitioner paid $235.00 of the medical expenses and is asking for
reimbursement.  However, Attachment 13a
states that Petitioner is not requesting reimbursement for her payment of
$235.00 from the settlement proceeds. 
Section 13e and Attachment 13a should be consistent. 
Attachment
13a also states that health insurer Kaiser Permanente paid $435.00 of the medical
expenses.  The petition does not provide
evidence supporting this statement. 
          Petitioner has not filled out Section 15 of the petition. 
          The proposed order states that Kaiser is to receive $435.00
from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section
13a(4) of the petition states that only $115.00 is to be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds, which is consistent with the Kaiser bill attached
to the petition. 
          The proposed order also states that Plaintiff’s counsel is
to receive $435.00 in costs.  However,
Sections 14b and 17d of the petition request only $367.00 in costs. 
          The Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff
Jaxon Beltran’s claims filed by Petitioner Tiffany Rodriguez on September 19,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
