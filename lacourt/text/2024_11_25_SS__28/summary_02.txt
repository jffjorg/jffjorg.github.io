And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the documents submitted in support of the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has denied the application. The plaintiff, Tony Nguyen, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Grant McPheron, and is requesting $200,000 in damages. However, the Judge has found that the plaintiff's evidence does not support the requested damages, and the application has been denied. The Judge has noted that the plaintiff's bills show only about $6,333 in medical expenses, and that the plaintiff's declaration from Dr. Doan does not provide sufficient evidence to support the requested damages. The Judge has also found that the declaration from Thomas Winn, who claims to have personal knowledge of the plaintiff's income, does not provide sufficient evidence to support his statements. As a result, the Court has denied the application for default judgment.
