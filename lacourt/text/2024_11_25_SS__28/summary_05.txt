And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff seeks default judgment against David Iosia Jr. and Yvonne Vanimonimo Iosia and award of $51,419.14, consisting of $44,176.27 as the demand of the complaint, $6,582.87 in prejudgment interest, and $660.00 in costs. However, the court denies the petition due to lack of evidence supporting the damages claimed. Specifically, the court finds that the exhibit submitted by the plaintiff, Exhibit I, describes medical expenses incurred by Nanette Lopez, not Summer French, and does not demonstrate that the plaintiff was required to pay Summer French $35,000.00 in bodily injury damages. The court requires the plaintiff to explain the basis for its request for $35,000.00 in bodily injury damages and to submit a signed Section 8 of the CIV-100 form. The court also notes that the plaintiff's request for default judgment is denied without prejudice.
