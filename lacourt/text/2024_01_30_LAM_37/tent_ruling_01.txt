Background
 
On May 22, 2023, Jeryl Smith (“Plaintiff”), filed a
Complaint against the Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD” or “Defendant”)
and Does 1 to 20.  
 
The Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleges seven causes
of action: (1) violation of Ed. Code § 22458, (2) negligence, (3) conversion,
(4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) fraudulent misrepresentation, (6) elder
abuse, and (7) retaliation.  
 
On
October 4, 2023, Defendant LAUSD’s demurrer and motion to strike the SAC was
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On
October 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”)
alleging six causes of action: (1) violation
of Ed. Code § 22458, (2) negligence, (3) conversion, (4) negligent
misrepresentation, (5) intentional misrepresentation, and (6) elder abuse.   
 
On
December 20, 2023, Defendant LAUSD filed a demurrer with a motion to the TAC.
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer and motion to strike. The matter is now before
the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695,
713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
A.        Plaintiffs’ Claims Cannot Rely on the
Delayed Discovery Rule Without a Showing of Diligence
 
On October 4, 2023,
the court sustained the demurrer to the first through seventh causes of action on
the basis that Plaintiff’s claims may be time barred because Plaintiff failed
to state the time and manner of when she discovered that her retirement date
was off by five months. 
 
The TAC has been
amended to state that in October 2019, Plaintiff decided to file for Social
Security benefits, which required a Verification of Benefits letter from
CalSTRS. (TAC ¶ 10.) From the CalSTRS data, Plaintiff found discrepancies,
including overpayments interspersed with underpayments, and “unusual
activities” in her account. (TAC ¶ 11.) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaintiff
had difficulty reaching either CalSTRS or LAUSD for clarification. (TAC ¶ 11.) 
 
Towards the end of
2020, Plaintiff established contact with CalSTRS by telephone and she requested
documents showing her years of service and changes made to her account since
retirement. (TAC ¶ 12.) Plaintiff received the information, but she did not
understand the calculation or how the changes were made so she requested
clarification from CalSTRS which informed her to expect clarification on the
issue by July 2021. (TAC ¶ 14.) After receiving no response, Plaintiff called
again on October 5, 2021, and a CalSTRS representative informed her that she
was being paid 24.142 years of service credit instead of the 24.430 reported in
the CalSTRS’ letter of February 2021. (TAC ¶ 14.) On or about October 5, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a formal complaint with CalSTRS.  On October 14, 2021, CalSTRS’ Ombuds, Mark
Gini, emailed Plaintiff and informed her that the form received from LAUSD in
2008 showed her termination date as being “3/6/2008” rather than August 26,
2009. (TAC ¶¶ 15, 16.) Accepting as true Plaintiff’s allegations, Plaintiff did
not discover that her termination date was wrongfully reported until October
14, 2021. 
 
LAUSD asserts that
Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations
because the issue with Plaintiff’s retirement date should have been discovered
in 2008 when Plaintiff retired. However, LAUSD fails to show how Plaintiff
would have become aware of such discrepancies in her date of retirement when
she started receiving benefits from CalSTRS. LAUSD does not assert that every
time that Plaintiff received benefits a Verification of Benefits letter or
other similar document was attached that would have given Plaintiff notice that
there were discrepancies in her benefits. 
 
Alternatively, LAUSD
claims that the statute of limitations began to run when Plaintiff suspected
that there were discrepancies with her benefits in  October 2019 when she began making inquiries
into the alleged discrepancies in her benefits from CalSTRS. (TAC ¶¶ 11, 13.) 
 
To invoke the delayed discovery
rule, Plaintiff must specifically allege “(1) the time and manner of discovery”
and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable
diligence.” (Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d
292, 297 (Saliter).) The TAC admits that Plaintiff suspected
discrepancies in her retirement benefits in October 2019 but it was  not until “[t]owards the end of 2020, that
Plaintiff finally established contact with CalSTRS.” (TAC ¶ 12.) Plaintiff
fails to allege that from October 2019 to the end of 2020 she diligently tried
to contact CalSTRS such that she could not have discovered the reason for the
discrepancy “despite reasonable diligence.” (Saliter, supra, 81
Cal.App.3d at p. 297.) Accordingly, the court agrees that Plaintiff has failed
to show that earlier discovery was not possible despite reasonable diligence. 
 
However, the TAC alleges that
“[a]s a result of the misrepresentation, Plaintiff received and has continued
to receive retirement benefits calculated at a reduced rate.” (TAC ¶ 80)
In Aryeh
v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th
1185, the California Supreme Court recognized two theories that
may extend the statute of limitations: “The continuing
violation doctrine aggregates a series of wrongs or injuries for purposes of
the statute of limitations,
treating the limitations
period as accruing for all of them upon commission or sufferance of the last of
them. [Citations.] Finally, under the theory of continuous accrual, a series of wrongs or injuries
may be viewed as each triggering its own limitations period, such that a suit for relief may be
partially time-barred as to older events but timely as to those within the
applicable limitations
period.” (Id. at p. 832.) 
 
Here, the unlawful act of
paying Plaintiff retirement benefits at a reduced rate continues to occur. (TAC
¶ 80.) “The right to pension payments is a continuing right. Petitioner by her conduct may
have barred herself from collecting payments which have accrued, but this does
not mean that she is without means to enforce the right to present and future pension
payments, as distinguished from past and accrued pension payments, provided she
proceeds to do so in the manner required by law. (Dryden v. Board of Pension
Com'rs of City of Los Angeles (1936) 6 Cal.2d 575, 580–581 [italics
original].) In Blaser v. State Teachers'
Retirement System (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 349, the appellate court found
that the continuous accrual theory applied to CalSTRS monthly pension payment
such that CalSTRS was entitled to recoup prior overpayments and to correct
errors. (Id. at p. 367.) 
 
Since Plaintiff’s
right to correct pension benefits is a continuing one, the statute of
limitations accrues each time a deficient payment is made. Therefore, the statute
of limitations for the first cause of action for violation of Ed. Code § 22458
and the third cause of action for conversion continue to accrue. Section 22458
requires that the information “be submitted annually,” such that any reports by
LAUSD that do not contain the correct retirement date can be deemed a violation
of section 22458. Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that she never saw LAUSD’s letter
to CalSTRS such that she could have discovered the incorrect retirement date in
2008. TAC ¶ 16.) 
 
However, the second
and fourth causes of action for negligence and negligent representation appear
to be barred as Plaintiff lacked diligence as she waited until “the end of year
2020” to contact CalSTRS, despite being on notice of the benefit discrepancies
in October 2019. (TAC ¶¶ 10, 11.) The fifth and sixth causes of action also
similarly appear to be barred since they relate to intentional
misrepresentations made by LAUSD and Elder Abuse rather than the Plaintiff’s
continued entitlement to retirement benefits. As Plaintiff fails to show
diligence, the court is persuaded that the delayed discovery rule does not
apply to Plaintiff’s second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action.
Moreover, Plaintiff fails to allege any alternate theories that may extend the
statute of limitations as to these claims. 
 
B.        Plaintiff’s Failure to Comply with the
Government Tort Claims Act in Seeking Damages
 
Defendant LAUSD alleges
that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred for failing to comply with the Government
Tort Claims Act. However, in the previous demurrer, the court found that under
Gov. Code § 905(f), “[a]ppications or claims or money or benefits under any
public retirement or pension system” were exempt from the Government Tort
Claims Act. 
 
The court previously
found that the first and third causes of action fall under the exemption of
Gov. Code § 905(f) but not the remaining claims. (See Order of 10/04/23.)
Although the first and third causes of action allege violation under Ed. Code §
22458 and conversion, Plaintiff is not seeking to recover “money or benefits”
but instead alleges she was “deprived of her property rights in violation of
the California Constitution, art. 1 § 7”, and she is entitled to “damages
according to proof.” (TAC ¶¶ 45, 61.) Additionally, both the first and second
causes of action incorporate Paragraph 39, wherein Plaintiff alleges she is
entitled to general damages. (TAC ¶¶ 39.) 
 
To obtain general
damages, Plaintiff is required to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act
such that the first and third causes of action no longer fall exclusively under
the exemption outlined in Gov. Code § 905(f). See Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility
Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1574 [“[Plaintiffs] do not seek
money due to them under the terms of the existing pension system; rather, they
claim defendants treated them unfairly in administrating the system and seek to
change the 1989 administrative decisions. Consequently, we conclude plaintiffs
were required to file a claim pursuant to section 905. Having failed to file
their claim, plaintiffs' suit is barred by section 911.2”].)


The court is not
persuaded that the remaining causes of action fall under the exemption outlined
in Gov. Code § 905(f).  The second,
fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action seek damages due to LAUSD’s
misrepresenting Plaintiff’s retirement date to CalSTRS, including compensatory
damages, attorney’s fees, and prejudgment interest. These damages do not seek
to purely recover money or benefits due under CalSTRS. “[C]ommentators have
construed the section 905 exceptions as essentially nontortious claims ‘for
which some other adequate claims procedure has already been devised or for
which the procedural protection of the Tort Claims Act is believed to be
unnecessary.’ ” (Dalton, supra, 18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1574.)
Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff was required to comply with the
Government Tort Claims Act. (TAC ¶ 39.) 
 
Had Plaintiffs’
relief been limited to the correct payment of money due rather than damages, Plaintiffs’
claims would not be time-barred and would be exempt under section 905(f). Based
on the above, the demurrer to the first and third causes of action is sustained;
those claims may amended to limit the relief sought money due under a
retirement system. However, the demurrer to the second, fourth, fifth, and
sixth causes of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff’s
request for prejudgment interest and attorney’s fees. Plaintiff asserts she is
entitled to prejudgment interest under Ed. Code § 23006 and attorney’s fees
under CCP § 1021.5 for enforcing an important right. The court notes that
section 23006 awards penalties and not prejudgment interest. 
As the demurrer has been sustained,
Defendant’s motion to strike is granted with leave to amend. 
Conclusion
 
Defendant LAUSD’s demurrer is sustained
with 10 days leave to amend as to the first and third causes of action and
sustained without leave to amend as to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth
causes of action. LAUSD’s motion to strike is granted with 10 days leave to
amend. The court set a Non-Appearance OSC re Amended Complaint for February 16,
2024, at 8:30 am. Defendant to give notice.
