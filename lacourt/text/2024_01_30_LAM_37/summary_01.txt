And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Jeryl Smith, the plaintiff, and the Los Angeles Unified School District, the defendant. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to report her correct retirement date, resulting in overpayments and underpayments. The defendant has moved to strike certain claims and dismiss the action.

The Judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer with 10 days leave to amend as to the first and third causes of action, which allege violation of Ed. Code § 22458 and conversion. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, which allege negligence, negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation, and elder abuse.

The Judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest and attorney's fees. The Judge has set a Non-Appearance OSC re Amended Complaint for February 16, 2024, at 8:30 am, and requires the defendant to give notice.

The Judge has concluded that the plaintiff must show diligence in investigating and pursuing her claims, and that the delayed discovery rule does not apply to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action. The Judge has also ruled that the plaintiff was required to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act for certain claims.
