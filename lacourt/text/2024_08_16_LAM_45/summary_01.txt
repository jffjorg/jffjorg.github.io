And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions and special interrogatories filed by Defendant Donald G. Norris. The Plaintiff, Baird A. Brown, has failed to provide code-compliant responses to these requests. The Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for admissions and special interrogatories within 30 days.

The Court also imposes sanctions of $1,248.00 against the Plaintiff for failing to provide complete and responsive answers to the requests for admissions and special interrogatories. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's arguments against providing these responses are without merit and that the requests are relevant to the action.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide a privilege log to support its claim of privilege and did not provide any substantial justification for failing to provide the requested information. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's conduct is unacceptable and that the imposition of sanctions is necessary to deter similar conduct in the future.
