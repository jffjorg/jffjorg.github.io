And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the motions to tax costs filed by the plaintiffs. The court grants in part the motion to tax Defendant Bramzon's Memorandum of Costs, taxing Defendant Bramzon's costs in the amount of $36,385.15.

The court also grants in part the motion to tax Defendant BASTA Inc.'s Memorandum of Costs, taxing Defendant BASTA Inc.'s costs in the amount of $113,524.94.

The court finds that Defendant Bramzon's expert witness fees are not reasonable and invalid, and therefore strikes these costs in their entirety. The court also finds that Defendant BASTA Inc.'s expert witness fees are not made in good faith and therefore strikes these costs in their entirety.

The court declines to tax Defendant Bramzon's electronic filing fees and court reporter fees, finding that these costs are reasonable and necessary for the conduct of litigation.

The court also declines to tax Defendant BASTA Inc.'s court reporter fees, finding that these costs are not authorized under statute and have not been substantiated.

The court orders that Defendant BASTA Inc. pay the costs taxed against it in the amount of $113,524.94, and that Defendant Bramzon pay the costs taxed against him in the amount of $36,385.15.
