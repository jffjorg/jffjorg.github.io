 Case Number:  EC067254    Hearing Date:   June 17, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER (1) GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO TAX COSTS BY DEFENDANT DANIEL
BRAMZON; AND (2) GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO TAX COSTS BY DEFENDANT
BASTA INC.          I.
       INTRODUCTION
           Plaintiffs Dennis P. Block, individually and
dba as Dennis P. Block & Associates, Hasti Rahsepar, inter alia,
initiated this defamation action on September 5, 2017 against Defendants Daniel
Bramzon (“Bramzon”), BASTA, Inc., John Doe, and Brett Schulte. This action
arose from statements made online through a parody twitter account of Dennis P.
Block and his firm. 
           On August 10, 2018,
the trial court granted in part Defendants BASTA Inc and Bramzon’s special
motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16, finding that the
allegations in the complaint arose from protected activity and struck the fifth
and sixth causes of action. 
          Following appeals by both sides, on January 22, 2021, the
appellate court determined that the trial court erred in finding that
Defendants’ alleged speech and conduct arose from protected activity. On
remand, the appellate court directed the trial court to deny the motion to
strike in its entirety.  Notably, the
appellate court did not express any findings regarding whether Plaintiffs
demonstrated a probability of prevailing on their claims. 
          By February 6, 2024, a jury verdict had been reached, and
on February 26, 2024, judgment was entered in in favor of Defendants BASTA Inc
and Bramzon.
          On March 12, 2024, Defendant Bramzon filed his Memorandum
of Costs, seeking to recover $44,084.07 in costs. On the same day, Defendant
Bramzon filed a Notice of Errata stating that his Memorandum of Costs
erroneously included a $1,900 charge from Dr. Dana Chidekel (dated July 5,
2023). 
On March
12, 2024, Defendant BASTA, Inc. filed its Memorandum of Costs, seeking to
recover $140,236.57 in costs. 
          On March 25, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their motion to tax
Defendant Bramzon’s Memorandum of Costs. On March 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
their motion to tax Defendant BASTA, Inc.’s Memorandum of Costs. Defendants
Bramzon and BASTA, Inc. respectively oppose the instant motions.
 
II.      EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
          Plaintiffs object to various portions
of the evidence submitted by BASTA in support of its opposition to the
Plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs. The court rules as follows. The sole objection
directed at the Declaration of Eric Anderson is sustained. The objections
directed at portions of the Declaration of Jeanett Alvarez-Webster are
overruled in their entirety. The objections directed at portions of the
Declaration of Charles Glasser are overruled in their entirety. The sole
objection direct at the Declaration of Sameer Somal is overruled.  
 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §1032(b) provides that a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs. Section 1033.5 itemizes
those costs that are recoverable. 
          California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1) requires that
a motion to tax costs musts be filed within 15 days of service of the cost
bill. Rule 3.1700(b)(2) provides, “Unless objection is made to the entire cost
memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each item objected
to by the same number and appear in the same order as the corresponding cost
item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must state why the item is
objectionable.”  
          “ ‘If the items in a cost memorandum appear proper, the
verified memorandum is prima facie evidence the expenses were necessarily
incurred by the’ prevailing party. (Citation.) To controvert this evidence, the
burden is on the objecting party to present evidence showing the contrary. (Ibid.)”
(Whatley-Miller v. Cooper (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1103, 1115.)
          “[A] party’s ‘mere statements in the points and authorities
accompanying its notice of motion to strike cost bill and the declaration of
its counsel are insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing [that the costs
were necessarily incurred].’” (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1258, 1266.)
 
IV.     ANALYSIS
          Plaintiffs seek to tax Defendant Bramzon’s costs in the
total amount of $40,570.87 and Defendant BASTA Inc.’s costs in the total amount
of $122,558.32. The Court shall address these motions in turn. 
          A. Motion to Tax Defendant Bramzon’s Costs
          With regard to Defendant Bramzon’s Memorandum of Costs,
Plaintiff seeks to tax or strike the following categories: (1) item 1 in the
amount of $19.25; (2) item 4 in the amount of $595.40; (3) item 8 in the total amount
of $36,385.15; (4) item 12 in the total amount of $2,815.08; and (5) item 14 in
the total amount of $755.99.
i. Item 1: Filing and Motion Fees
          With regard to item 1 for Filing and Motion Fees,
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Bramzon impermissible seeks recovery of $19.25
for “credit card percentage fees.” However, this argument is not persuasive.
Filing fees are recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(1).) As Defendant
Bramzon points out in his opposition, the credit card fees were charged through
Los Angeles Superior Court’s Court Reservation
System when reserving a motion. (Opposition re: Taxing Bramzon’s Costs.) Thus,
the costs associated with the credit card fees were necessary to the conduct of
litigation. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(2).) Therefore, the Court declines to
tax these costs. 
                    ii. Item 4: Deposition Costs 
          Next, Plaintiffs seek to tax Defendant Bramzon’s requested
deposition costs in the amount of $595.40, which is attributed to Plaintiff
Rahsepar’s failure to appear for her February 7, 2024 deposition. Plaintiffs
contend that Plaintiff Rahsepar had appeared for this deposition as noticed,
and therefore, this cost is unreasonable. (Motion re: Taxing Bramzon’s Costs at
pg. 13.) However, in their reply, Plaintiffs clarify that Plaintiff Rahsepar
did not appear for her February 7, 2022 deposition, and instead, she had
objected to the deposition date on February 4, 2022 on the grounds that not all
defendants had agreed to a date for her deposition. (Reply re: Taxing Bramson’s
Costs at pg. 9.) Thus, Plaintiffs reason that the February 7, 2022 deposition
should have been taken off calendar. Under the circumstances, the Court is not
persuaded by this reasoning. This objection was not proper under Code of Civil
Procedure § 2025.410 because it is not directed to any error or irregularity
with the deposition notice. As a result, Defendant Bramzon was not under any
obligation to cancel a properly noticed deposition. Because Defendant Bramzon
has provided proof of an invoice for Plaintiff Rahsepar’s nonappearance on
February 7, 2022, the Court finds that this cost is proper and declines to tax
it in the amount requested.  (Rosenberger
Decl, Exh. 2 at pg. 2; see Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(3).)  
                    iii. Item 8: Expert Witness Fees
          Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Bramzon impermissibly seeks
to recover his costs for expert witness fees because his Code of Civil
Procedure § 998 offer made on May 10, 2022 only to Plaintiff Rahsepar in the
amount of $101 was vague and a “token” offer, rendering it invalid.  (Motion re: Taxing Defendant Bramzon’s Costs
at pp. 7-12; see also Defendant Bramzon’s Memorandum of Costs, Exh. 1.)
Plaintiffs claims that the language "compromise Plaintiff Hasti Rahsepar’s
(Plaintiff) litigation” was vague because the Section 998 Offer did not clarify
the terms “compromise” or “litigation.” (Motion re: Taxing Defendant Bramzon’s
Costs at pp. 7-8.) The Court disagrees. The offer was made solely by Defendant
Bramzon for the purpose of settling Plaintiff Rahsepar’s claims against him in
this action. For this reason, this offer was not vague or unintelligible. 
          Next, Plaintiffs contend that the offer was not made in
good faith because it was made after the appellate court found that the conduct
alleged in the complaint did not arise from a protected activity and after the
trial court denied Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Id.
at pp. 8-9.) Based on the costs incurred at that point, Plaintiffs reason that
the offer for $101 was a token offer. (Id. at pg. 9.) 
          In opposition, Defendant Bramzon argues that his Section
998 offer was made in good faith because its value included a waiver of costs.
(Opposition re: Taxing Bramzon’s  Costs
at pg. 4, relying on Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th
1475, 1485 and Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1263.)
Considering Plaintiffs had prevailed on the appeal of Defendants Bramzon and
BASTA Inc.’s special motion to strike and the trial court previously determined
that Plaintiffs had shown a probably of success on the merits of their claims,
the Court does not find that the likelihood of Plaintiffs’ success at trial
were slim at the time the Section 998 offer was made. (See Adams v. Ford
Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1485-1486 [determining that a
Section 998 offer should be measured it in light of the likelihood that [the
plaintiff] would prevail at trial].) Under these circumstances, the Court finds
that Bramzon’s Section 998 Offer was not reasonable and not made in good faith.
(Elrod. Oregon Cummins Disel, Inc., (1987), 195 Cal.App.3d 692, 700
“[W]hether a section 998 offer was reasonable
and made in good faith is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial
court.”].)   Thus, it was invalid. (Wear v. Calderon
(1981) 121 Cal. App. 818, 821.)
          Accordingly, because Defendant Bramzon’s Section 998 Offer
is not valid, he is not entitled to recover his expert witness fees pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 998(c)(1). As a result, Defendant Bramzon’s expert
witness fees of $36,385.15 are stricken in their entirety.
                    iv. Item 12: Models, Enlargements and Photocopies
of Exhibits 
          Next, Plaintiffs seek to strike Defendant Bramzon’s costs
for photocopies of exhibits. However, Code of Civil Procedure. §1033.5(a)(13)
permits recovery for this cost. Additional, Defendant Bramzon states that these
copies were used to prepare his trial binders. The preparation of the trial
binders are determined to be reasonable and necessary for the “conduct of
litigation,” regardless of whether they were presented before the jury. (Heppler
v. J.M. Peters Co.¿(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1298–1299.) Moreover,
whether an exhibit is used at trial is not dispositive; the proper standard is
whether the exhibits “were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” (County
of Riverside v. City of Murrieta (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 616, 629.) Thus, the
Court declines to strike the costs associate with this category. 
                    v. Item 14: Electronic Filings Fees
          Lastly, Plaintiffs seek to strike Defendant Bramzon’s costs
associated with electronic filing fees because there was no requirement that
documents in this action had to be filed electronically. This argument is not
persuasive. In Los Angeles County, electronic filing has been mandated for
Non-Complex Unlimited Civil cases where litigants are represented by counsel
since January 2, 2019. (See First Amended General Order filed May 3, 2019; see
also CRC, rule 2.253(b.) Also, there is
no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements or other supporting
documentation be attached to the bill of costs; however, if costs have been put
in issue by a motion to tax costs, the burden shifts to the party claiming
costs to establish reasonableness.  (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) Defendant Bramzon has
submitted sufficient proof to substantiate these costs. In reply, Plaintiffs
merely argue that it was unreasonable for Defendant Bramzon to utilize a
company that charges a higher fee for electronic filings. (Reply re: Taxing
Bramzon’s Costs at pg. 11.) This argument is again unpersuasive because Code of
Civil Procedure §1033.5(a)(14) does not
mandate which service provide must be used, and upon review of the invoices
submitted, the Court does not find the amounts unreasonable. (See Opposition
re: Taxing Bramzon’s Costs; Rosenberger Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. 8.) As a result, these costs are proper in their
entirety.  
          Considering the above, the Court
grants in part Plaintiffs’ motion to tax Bramzon’s Memorandum of Costs.
Defendant Bramzon’s costs are taxed in the amount of $36,385.15.
 
          B. Motion to Tax Defendant BASTA Inc.’s Costs
          With regard to Defendant BASTA Inc.’s Memorandum of Costs,
Plaintiff seeks to tax or strike the following categories: (1) item 2 in the total
amount of $8,715.43; (2) item 4 in the amount of $2,497.75; (3) item 5 in the
total amount of $975; (4) item 8 in the total amount of $104,207.45; (5) item 11
in the total amount of $5,156.14; (6) item 14 in the amount of $478.45; and (7)
item 16 in the amount of $528.10.
                    i. Item 2:
Jury Fees 
          Plaintiff seeks to strike Defendant BASTA Inc’s claim of
$8,715.43 in jury fees because invoices were not submitted within its
Memorandum of Costs to substantiate this cost. (Motion re: Taxing BASTA Inc.’s
Costs at pg. 13.) These costs are allowed under Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5(a)(1), proof has been submitted to substantiate these costs. (Opposition
re: Taxing BASTA Inc’s Costs; Alvarez-Webster’s Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A.) As a
result, the Court declines to tax these costs. 
                    ii. Item 4: Deposition Costs  
          Plaintiffs next move to strike $2,497.75 from Defendant
BASTA Inc.’s claimed deposition costs. Deposition costs are generally recoverable
under Code of Civil Procedure §1033.5(a)(3). Plaintiffs argues that Defendant
BASTA Inc. is not entitled to recover costs associated with the rough
transcript of Sidia Calfa when recovery is also sought for her deposition
transcript. The Court agrees. While Defendant BASTA Inc. claims that it had
ordered the rough transcript to refute that Plaintiffs’ allegation that
Defendant Brett Schulte was one of its employees, it is clear that the usage of
the rough transcript was merely convenient, not necessary to the conduct of
litigation. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(2).) Thus, this cost is taxed in the
amount of $532.80.
          Also, Plaintiffs argue that the cancellation fee of $520
for Dr. Readings’ deposition should be taxed because he had appeared for his
deposition. In opposition, Defendant BASTA points out that the cancellation fee
is associated with Dr. Reading’s first scheduled deposition. (Opposition re:
Taxing BASTA Inc.’s Costs at pg. 6.) As Plaintiffs point out in their reply,
the parties had mutual agreed to continue Dr. Readings’ deposition because
trial had been continued. (Reply, Roshanian Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. Q.) In light of
this, the Court finds that this cost was not reasonable based on the mutual
understanding of the parties that Dr. Readings’ deposition was being continued.
As a result, this cost is taxed. 
          Moreover, Plaintiffs move to tax the deposition transcripts
of Kevin Hermansen, Victoria Guzman, and Cyrus Whittaker because they did not
testify at trial. (Motion re: Taxing BASTA Inc.’s Costs at pg. 14.) However, as
Defendant BASTA Inc. points out in its opposition, these were Plaintiffs’
witnesses, and it had no way of determining whether these witnesses would be
ultimately called at trial. For this reason, these deposition costs are
reasonable. 
          Considering the above, item 4 is taxed in the amount of
$1,052.80.
                    iii. Item 5: Service of Process
          Plaintiffs moves to strike these costs in their entirety
because invoices have not been properly substantiate these costs. In
opposition, Defendant BASTA Inc. contends that these costs were associated with
payments made to a third-party process server for the service of subpoenas to
potential witnesses in this case. (Opposition, Alvarez-Webster Decl. ¶ 15.)
Notably, Defendant BASTA, Inc. has failed to submit proof of these invoices.
For this reason, the Court strikes these costs in their entirety, i.e. $975.
                    iv. Item 8:
Witness Fees 
Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant BASTA Inc. impermissibly seeks to recover its costs for
expert witness fees because its Code of Civil Procedure § 998 offer made on January
6, 2023 to both Plaintiffs for the amount of $11,101 amounted to a token offer.
(Motion re: Taxing BASTA Inc.’s Costs at pp. 9-; BASTA Inc.’s Memorandum of
Cost, Exh. 2.) While Defendant BASTA Inc.’s offers to compromise were higher
than that offered by Defendant Bramzon, the Court continues to find that these
offers were not made in good faith at the time that they were made. Considering
Plaintiffs had prevailed on the appeal of Defendants Bramzon and BASTA Inc.’s
special motion to strike and the trial court previously determined that
Plaintiffs had shown a probably of success on the merits of many of their
claims, the Court does not find that the likelihood of Plaintiffs’ success at
trial were slim at the time the Section 998 offer was made. This is further
corroborated by the fact that 27 out of 28 online statements were deemed
defamation per se. Because these offers to compromise were not made in good
faith, Defendant BASTA is not entitled to recover its expert witness fee costs.
Therefore, these costs are stricken in their entirety, i.e. $106,207.00.  
                    v. Item 11 –
Court Reporter Fees
          Next, Plaintiffs seek to strike Defendant BASTA Inc.’s
costs associated with court reporter fees because these are not authorized
under statute and they have not been substantiated. (Motion re: Taxing BASTA
Inc’s Costs at pg. 17.) In opposition, Defendant BASTA Inc. argues that these
costs were for the court reporter’s rates for rough trial transcripts.  (Opposition re: Taxing BASTA Inc.’s Costs at
pg. 6.) Because it is conceded that these costs are associated with transcripts
of court proceedings and the Court did not order the production of these
transcripts, these costs are not allowable. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(5).
For this reason, these costs are stricken in their entirety, i.e. $5,156.14.
                    vi. Item 14: Electronic Filing Fees
          Plaintiffs also move to tax these costs associated with
electronic filing fees. As stated above in connection with the motion to tax
costs directed at Defendant Bramzon’s Memorandum of Costs, this argument is
unpersuasive. As a result, the Court declines to tax this category. 
                    vii. Item 16: Other
          Defendant BASTA has agreed to withdraw $134 from these
costs, and as a result, Plaintiffs do not object to the correct cost of
$394.10.
          In light of the above, the Court grants in
part Plaintiffs’ motion to tax Defendant BASTA Inc.’s Memorandum of Costs.
Defendant BASTA Inc.’s costs are taxed in the amount of $113,524.94
 
V.       CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Based on the foregoing, the
Court grants in part Plaintiffs’ motion to tax Defendant Bramzon’s Memorandum
of Costs. Defendant Bramzon’s costs are taxed in the amount of $36,385.15.
Also, the Court grants in part Plaintiffs’ motion to tax Defendant BASTA Inc.’s
Memorandum of Costs in the amount of $113,524.94.
