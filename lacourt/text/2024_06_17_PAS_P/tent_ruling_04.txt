 Case Number:  23AHCV02345    Hearing Date:   June 17, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING MOTION TO RELATE AND CONSOLIDATEI.        INTRODUCTION
          Defendants Victoria Rose Johnson and Joseph Anthony Russi
(Defendants) are defendants in two matters with the court: 23AHCV02345 and
23STLC07082. A third party, Christopher James Curtin, is a Defendant in
23STLC07082 but was dismissed from 23AHCV02345 on February 6, 2024.  These two cases were not related at the time
of filing this motion.
          On November 19, 2021, Javier Diaz-Santana (“Diaz-Santana”)
was acting in the course and scope of his employment with V&I Investments,
Inc. when he was in an automobile accident with Defendants near 5500 Rosemead
Blvd. in Temple City. (23AHCV02345 Complaint, GN-1; 23STLC07082 Complaint,
MV-1.) 
On
October 10, 2023, Plaintiff Cypress Insurance Company, as administered by
Berkshire Hathaway Homestead, (“Cypress”) filed a complaint against Defendants
for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence to have paid out workers'
compensation reimbursed. The case number in this matter is 23AHCV02345. On December
20, 2023, Defendants Victoria Rose Johnson and Joseph Anthony Curtin filed an
answer.
On November
3, 2023, Diaz-Santana filed a complaint against Defendants for motor vehicle
negligence. The case number in this matter is 23STLC07082. On February 22,
2024, Defendants Victoria Rose Johnson and Joseph Anthony Curtin filed an
answer. Defendant Christopher James Curtin has yet to appear in that matter.
No
notice of related cases has been filed in 23STLC07082. Notice of related cases
was filed in 23AHCV02345 on November 17, 2023. The cases have yet to be
related.
          On April 25, 2024, Cypress filed this motion to relate and
consolidate 23AHCV02345 and 23STLC07082. No opposition has been filed.
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §1048 provides as follows:       
(a) When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(b) The court, in furtherance
of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive
to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action,
including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate
issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of
trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the
United States.
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Cypress seek an order consolidating 23AHCV02345 and 23STLC07082.
The
motion to consolidate is denied, although once the procedural requirements are
satisfied, this Court finds it likely that consolidation will occur. While
notice of related cases, form CM-015, was filed in 23AHCV02345 on November 17,
2023; no notice of related cases, form CM-015, has been filed in 23STLC07082. California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(d) requires the notice of related cases to be filed
in all pending cases listed in the notice. As such, the matters have not been
related. Cypress’s notice of related cases incorrectly states 23STLC07082 is an
unlimited civil matter; 23STLC07082 is a limited civil matter. As such, it must
also be reclassified as unlimited, and a reclassification fee paid. (Local Rule
3.3(g)(3).)  This has not yet occurred.
Local
Rule 3.3(g)(1) requires cases to be pending in the same department before being
consolidated. As the cases have not yet been deemed related, each of the
matters remains in different departments, 23AHCV02345 in Dept. P at the
Pasadena Courthouse, and 23STLC07082 in Dept. 26 at the Spring Street
Courthouse. 
Cypress
has filed notice of this motion to relate and consolidate in both 23AHCV02345
and 23STLC07082. 
“The
Notice of Related Case must: (1)  List
all civil cases that are related by court, case name, case number, and filing
date; (2)  Identify the case that has the
earliest filing date and the court and department in which that case is
pending; and (3)  Describe the manner in
which the cases are related.” (California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(c).) 
The
April 25, 2024 filed notice of motion to relate and consolidate contains both
matters’ case names and numbers, but fails to include the filing date for
23STLC07082. This notice also fails to include which case was filed earlier.
The notice does provide that the matters arise out of the same accident with
the same named defendants and share common questions of fact and law as to
liability. The Court finds that this notice of motion to related and
consolidate does not meet all the requirements of California Rules of Court,
rule 3.300(c) to relate the matters.
Therefore,
the motion to relate and consolidate is denied.
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Plaintiff Cypress Insurance Company, as administered by
Berkshire Hathaway Homestead’s motion to relate and consolidate 23AHCV02345 and
23STLC07082 is DENIED.
