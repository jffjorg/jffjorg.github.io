And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Deborah Yearby's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against her. The defendant had moved to set aside the default, alleging that she never received service of the summons and complaint. The judge finds that the defendant's motion is timely and grants it, vacating the default judgment entered on June 7, 2022. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days of the hearing date, November 30, 2023. The judge also disregards the plaintiff's untimely opposition to the motion, finding that the defendant has provided sufficient basis for setting aside the default. The judge's decision is supported by the strong public policy of deciding matters on the merits, which will lead to a more orderly and just proceeding.
