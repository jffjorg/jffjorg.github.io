And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Christian Ochoa versus The Regents of the University of California, et al. (Case No. 22STCV23028). The Defendant has moved to compel the Plaintiff to submit to an Independent Medical Examination (IME) to explore alternative sources for the Plaintiff's alleged injuries. The Judge grants the Defendant's motion, citing case law that when a party alleges mental and emotional injuries, they implicitly claim that the injuries were not caused by pre-existing mental conditions, thereby raising the question of alternative sources for the distress. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of mental distress and injuries are in controversy, and the Defendant is entitled to explore alternative sources for the alleged injuries.
