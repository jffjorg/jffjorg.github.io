English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Jon R. Takasugi in the case of Iris Au v. Enzo Zelocchi, et al. The defendant has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that plaintiff's claims are not factually supported. The court has granted the motion in part, denying it as to the first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, and granting it as to the third cause of action. The court finds that plaintiff's allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, attempted extortion, and defamation per se are sufficient at the pleading stage, but that the claim of aiding and abetting attempted extortion is insufficiently pled. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change if all parties submit on the tentative.
