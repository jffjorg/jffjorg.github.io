Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant's motion for a new trial and motion to set aside the judgment. The Plaintiff alleged fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of contract, and financial elder abuse against the Defendant. The Defendant argued that a new trial was necessary due to alleged errors and misconduct during the trial.

The Judge found that the evidence supported liability under the Financial Elder Abuse Statute and denied the Defendant's motion for new trial. The Judge also denied the Defendant's motion to set aside the judgment, finding that the Defendant had not shown that the Court's decision was incorrect or unsupported by the facts.

The Judge ruled that the damages awarded to the Plaintiff were reasonable and did not constitute an excessive amount. The Judge also found that the Defendant had not shown that the Court had applied the wrong standard of care or that the evidence would not support the ruling under a different standard.

The motion was denied, and the judgment stands.
