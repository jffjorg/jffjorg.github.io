RULING
 

Attorney’s Fees

 
            Defendant (“D”) is the prevailing
party in this UD action against his Plaintiff Landlord (“P”).  Both sides agree that Paragraph 8 of the lease
agreement caps attorney’s fees at $500 and that D is the prevailing party.  The only dispute is that D requested $1,500
on the cover page of his motion, which appears to be a typo because within the
body of his brief he repeatedly requests only $500.  P concedes that P D entitled to $500 in
attorney’s fees.  Thus, this Court awards
$500 in attorney’s fees to defense counsel.  
 

Sanctions

 
P seeks sanctions against D per CCP § 128.5 for proceeding on his motion
for $1,500 in 
Attorney’s fees when
only $500 is permitted per the lease agreement. 
This Court agrees that D’s motion is “made in bad faith” and “frivolous.”  Although sanctions may appear harsh for what
appears to have been a typo in D’s Brief, the aggravating factor which pushes
an innocent mistake into the field of frivolity and bad faith is the fact that P’s
counsel made no less than 5 attempts to contact D’s counsel (Sept. 13th,
18th, 19th , 22nd , and 30th) to informally
resolve the ambiguity in D’s brief and received no response.  Moreover, D’s failure to respond to P’s
inquiries is further compounded by the fact that P’s even left a message that
it would be willing to stipulate to the $500 in attorney’s fees if only D would
clarify its position to request only that amount.  In short, this ambiguity should have been
cleared up with a simple return telephone call rather than wasting both P
counsel’s time as well as that of this Court. 
For these reasons, D is sanctioned $500.
 
            As an offset, P is ordered to pay
the $500 in attorney’s fees to the Clerk of this Court and this Court will
thereby deem D’s sanctions paid in full. 
Such payment to occur within 5 days of this hearing.
