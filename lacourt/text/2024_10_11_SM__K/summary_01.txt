And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Beach Front Property Management Inc. v. Jose Arroyo de Los Santos, et al. The defendant has been granted his motion for attorney's fees, but only to the tune of $500, which is the amount capped by the lease agreement. The plaintiff has been granted his motion for sanctions, with the defendant being ordered to pay $500 to the Clerk of the Court. The judge found that the defendant's motion was made in bad faith and was frivolous, and that the defendant's failure to respond to the plaintiff's attempts to resolve the ambiguity in his brief was a significant aggravating factor.
