And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Rusnak Westlake BMW's motion for summary judgment as to the claims of David Ballen Cortes. Cortes had alleged a claim of Negligent Entrustment against Rusnak Westlake BMW, but the judge has ruled that Rusnak Westlake BMW was not the owner of the vehicle at the time of the incident, and therefore Cortes has failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact as to ownership. The judge has relied on the undisputed evidence presented by Rusnak Westlake BMW, including the declaration of its Chief Operating Officer, Brian Beatt, which showed that the vehicle was sold to Emmanuel Wholesale after Rusnak relinquished title. As a result, the judge has granted Rusnak Westlake BMW's motion for summary judgment, dismissing Cortes' claim.
