And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge F.M. Tavelman in a case involving the death of Sarkis Baghikian, who was treated for Covid-19 at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center. The defendants, including the medical center and several physicians, demurred to the plaintiffs' claims, alleging that they are barred by the Federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act). The judge sustained the demurrers, finding that the plaintiffs' claims arise from the administration of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone, which are covered countermeasures under the PREP Act. The judge concluded that the PREP Act provides immunity to the defendants and that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Act.
