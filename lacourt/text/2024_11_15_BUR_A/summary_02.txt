And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Topa Insurance Company (Plaintiff) for relief from admissions made in response to Taltech Construction, Inc.'s (Defendant) Request for Admissions. The Plaintiff is seeking subrogation for losses caused by the Defendant's alleged failure to design and contract ventilation safeguards at a property in Sunland, California.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated that its admissions were the result of "mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect". The judge is also critical of the Plaintiff's declaration, which relies on hearsay and lacks sufficient detail to support the motion.

Despite these deficiencies, the judge is inclined to deny the motion without prejudice, permitting the Plaintiff to renew the motion should it be able to cure the deficiencies. The judge sustains the Defendant's objection to the Plaintiff's declaration and denies the motion for relief from admissions.
