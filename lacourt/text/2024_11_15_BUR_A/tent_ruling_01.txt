ALLEGATIONS: 
 
On March 1, 2022, David
Ballen Cortes (Cortes) filed a Complaint against Ri Won Kim (Kim), Andres
Steven Osorio-Ardila (Osorio), and Rusnak Westlake BMW (Rusnak) in Los Angeles
Superior Court Case No. 22STCV07604. Cortes alleges that, on November 11, 2019,
he was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Osorio (hereinafter the BMW) which
collided with a vehicle driven by Kim. 
 
On December 13, 2023,
Cortes’ action was consolidated with Kim’s own action against Osorio and Rusnak,
identified as Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 21STCV42678. Case No. 21STCV42678
was designated the lead case and is the case number under which this motion
proceeds.  
 
Before the Court is
Rusnak’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to the claims of Cortes. Cortes alleges
a singular cause of action against Rusnak for Negligent Entrustment. Cortes has
rendered no opposition to this motion. The Court notes that, pursuant to C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c), a failure to oppose a
motion may be deemed consent to its being granted.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co.¿(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) C.C.P.¿§ 437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to¿any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”¿ (Juge¿v. County of
Sacramento¿(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing¿FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima¿(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)¿ 
¿ 
As to each claim as
framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy
the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element,
or to establish a defense. (C.C.P.¿§437c(p)(2);¿Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc.¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿ 
¿ 
Once the defendant
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v.¿Paetkau¿(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)¿ 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
The elements of Negligent Entrustment
are (1) that the driver was negligent in operating the vehicle, (2) that
defendant was an owner of the vehicle operated by the driver, (3) that
defendant knew, or should have known, that the driver was incompetent or unfit
to drive the vehicle, (4) that defendant permitted the driver to use the
vehicle, and (5) that the driver's incompetence or unfitness to drive was a
substantial factor in causing harm to plaintiff." (CACI 724; see Jeld-Wen,
Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 853, 863-64; Lindstrom v.
Hertz Corp. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 644, 648; White v. Inbound Aviation
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 910, 920.)
 
Here, the undisputed evidence shows that
Rusnak was not the owner of the vehicle at the time of the incident. Rusnak
presents the declaration of its Chief Operating Officer, Brian Beatt (Beatt).
Beatt states that, on August 28, 2019, Rusnak purchased the BMW as a trade-in.
(Breatt Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 4.) Beatt further states that on September 6, 2019, the
BMW was sold at auction to Emmanuel Wholesale. (Beatt Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 4.)
Beatt states that Rusnak then relinquished title to Emmanuel Wholesale and had
no further involvement with the BMW, including any subsequent sale. (Beatt
Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.) 
 
By virtue of his non-opposition, Cortes
has presented no evidence in contravention of that provided by Rusnak. The
record is clear that Rusnak was not the legal owner of the BMW at the time of
the November 11, 2019 incident. As such, Cortes has failed to demonstrate a
triable issue of fact as to ownership and cannot sustain his claim for
Negligent Entrustment against Rusnak. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
