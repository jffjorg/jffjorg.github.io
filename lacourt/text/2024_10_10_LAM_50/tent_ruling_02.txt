[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests
that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant Marquita Leonard. Plaintiff
seeks judgment in the total amount of $75,345.45, comprising $65,878.99 demanded
in the Complaint, $8,266.46 in interest, $683.00 in costs, and $517.00 in
attorney fees. 
The Court notes a few defects with the
submitted default judgment package. 
First, Plaintiff’s counsel has not
submitted any declaration attesting to the amount of attorney’s fees requested.
Second, Plaintiff cites to paragraph 32 of
the subject lease agreement to support Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees.
(Garner Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) However, it appears that portions of paragraph 32
(and other sections of the lease agreement) are missing. (Ibid.) It
appears that the bottom of the pages of the lease agreement are cut-off and/or
obscured. (Ibid.)  
  
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the request
for default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with counsel a
schedule for submitting a new default judgment package.
