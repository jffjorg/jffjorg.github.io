[1]On April 17, 2024,
Duane Morris filed an IDC Statement in advance of the April 24, 2024 IDC
providing, inter alia, that “Defendants seek to compel Plaintiff to
produce the invoices of its counsel in this action.”


[2]Duane Morris’s Fourth Set of Requests for Production
of Documents define “MALPRACTICE CASE” as “the lawsuit entitled Intelligent
SCM, LLC, et al. v. Russell W. Roten, an individual, Duane Morris, et al.,
Los Angeles Superior Court case number BC572581, filed on February 13, 2015,”
i.e., the instant case. (Scott Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 2.)


[3]The Court notes Duane
Morris does not appear to show what Interrogatory No. 9 seeks. Thus, it is
unclear what exactly ISCM’s second amended supplemental response to
Interrogatory No. 9 is responding to.  


[4]In addition, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2018.030, subdivision (b), “[t]he work product of an attorney, other than a writing described
in subdivision (a), is not discoverable unless the court determines that denial
of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing
that party’s claim or defense or will result in an injustice.”
