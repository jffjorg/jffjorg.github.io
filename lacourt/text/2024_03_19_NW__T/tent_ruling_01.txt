  Case Number:  23VECV00579    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  T Frandsen v Foxman
23VECV00579
Tentative ruling on ex parte
application
Grant relief.  The hearing on the demurrer will be on
3/21/2924 at 8:30 a.m.  Reply to the demurrer
should have been submitted with the request for relief as it has already been 6
days since notice of the ex parte application and demurrer opposition. The reply shall be efiled and emailed no later than noon on 3/20/2024.  The demurrer can be heard on 5 days notice in
a UD case with the opposition due in writing the day before or orally at the
hearing.  Ordinarily there would be no written reply.
The court notes that in 23STCV19020, the court in
that matter has declined to relate this matter to that case by order of
3/1/2024.  Accordingly, this case is not
related to that action and there is no basis to stay this action.
