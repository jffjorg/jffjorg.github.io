```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge grants relief to the ex parte application and sets a hearing on the demurrer for March 21, 2024 at 8:30 am. The reply to the demurrer should have been submitted with the request for relief, but since it has already been 6 days since notice of the ex parte application, the reply must be e-filed and emailed by noon on March 20, 2024. The demurrer can be heard on 5 days' notice in a UD case, with the opposition due in writing the day before or orally at the hearing. The court notes that the case is not related to another case (23STCV19020) and there is no basis to stay this action.
