 Case Number:  23STCV25551    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On October
19, 2023, Plaintiff Jose Munoz, Jr. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Dorothy Weichi Pan (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle
tort and general negligence. 
On
February 9, 2024, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
September 23, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions and (2) a motion
to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and
for sanctions.  The motions were set for
hearing on November 7, 2024.  On October
25, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions and requests for sanctions.  On October 29, 2024, Defendant filed replies.  The Court continued the hearing to December
12, 2024. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
Counsel for the
parties participated in an IDC on September 19, 2024. 
B.       Timeliness of motion 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses to interrogatories must be given
within 45 days of the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses,
or on or before any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c) [interrogatories].) When, as
here, the responses are electronically served, the moving party has an
additional 2 court days to file the motion. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3); L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 8:1146, p. 8F-60
(Cal. Practice Guide).)  Failure to file
a motion within this time period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel
further responses to interrogatories. 
 Counsel
agreed to extend the deadline for Defendant’s motions to compel further
responses to two weeks after the IDC.  Defendant’s
motions are timely. 
C.   Meet and confer 
A
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.040.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).)  “A meet
and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Defendant
has provided meet and confer declarations. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
Defendant
has filed separate statements. 
APPLICABLE LAW  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
 “(2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 provides: 
“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
“(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. 
“(c) If the responding party does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so
state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.220.) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230 provides: 
“If the answer to an interrogatory would necessitate
the preparation or the making of a compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of
or from the documents of the party to whom the interrogatory is directed, and
if the burden or expense of preparing or making it would be substantially the
same for the party propounding the interrogatory as for the responding party,
it is a sufficient answer to that interrogatory to refer to this section and to
specify the writings from which the answer may be derived or ascertained. This
specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the propounding party to
locate and to identify, as readily as the responding party can, the documents
from which the answer may be ascertained. The responding party shall then
afford to the propounding party a reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or
inspect these documents and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or
summaries of them.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230.)
