  Case Number:  22STCV20019    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
A.   Prior proceedings 
On
June 20, 2022, Plaintiff Amanda Montano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Metro”)
and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  The Court issued a notice of case assignment
setting the trial on December 18, 2023. 
On
July 27, 2022, Metro filed an answer. 
On
October 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application and
continued the trial to May 20, 2024.  The
Court did not continue discovery deadlines. 
On
January 16, 2024, the Court granted Metro’s motion to reopen discovery.  The Court ruled that discovery deadlines
would be based on the May 20, 2024 trial date. 
On
February 21, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Joseph Aquino as Doe 1. 
On
March 11, 2024, based on the parties’ stipulation, the Court continued the
trial to November 20, 2024 and ruled that discovery and motion cut-off dates
would be based on the new trial date. 
On March
20, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to compel Metro
to produce its employee Aquino for a deposition to May 28, 2024.  The Court noted that while Metro was willing
to provide Aquino for a deposition, he was on a medical leave. The Court
ordered Metro to provide an update on when Aquino would be available for
deposition. 
On
April 25, 2024, the Court dismissed Aquino without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
May 24, 2024, Metro filed a supplemental response asserting that Aquino was
still on medical leave, was unable to endure a deposition, and was hopeful that
he would return to work in August 2024. Metro submitted its attorney’s
declaration to support the supplemental response and asked the Court to
continue the hearing for 90 days. 
On
May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response arguing that the attorney declaration
attached to Metro’s May 24, 2024 supplemental response did not show the
attorney could competently testify about Aquino’s ability to testify. Plaintiff
charged that Metro was claiming Aquino was on medical leave as a ploy or
pretext to avoid a deposition. Plaintiff asked the Court to deny Metro’s
request for a continuance, to compel Metro to produce Aquino for a deposition,
and to impose sanctions. The Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument,
and continued the hearing to July 10, 2024. 
On
July 3, 2024, Metro filed its counsel’s declaration stating that on July 2,
2024, Aquino told Metro’s counsel (1) he is still on medical leave and expects
to return to work in or around January 2025, (2) due to health concerns, he
could not attend a deposition before he returns to work, and (3) he would be
available for a deposition in February 2025. 
On
July 10, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument, and
continued the hearing to August 28, 2024. 
On
August 21, 2024, Metro filed a supplemental response in support of its
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to compel Aquino’s deposition. 
On
August 28, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Metro to
produce Aquino for deposition, ordered Metro to produce Aquino for deposition
within 30 days, and imposed sanctions on Metro. 
On
October 3, 2024, the Court denied Metro’s ex parte application to continue the
trial. The Court stated that, while the ex parte application asserted that
Aquino was recovering from surgery and therefore could not participate in
trial, “Metro has provided no evidence to support the assertion. Metro has
provided only counsel's hearsay statement that ‘Our office has been advised
that unfortunately, Mr. Aquino has been experiencing serious health issues that
will make him unable to take part in the defense of the case.’ ” 
On
November 7, 2024, the Court denied Metro’s motion to continue the trial to
April 8, 2025.  The Court observed that
Metro had provided no admissible evidence to support its contention that
Aquino’s medical condition prevented him from being deposed or attending the
trial and had offered no reason for failing to provide this evidence.  However, the Court granted Metro’s request to
continue the trial to November 25, 2024 to accommodate its expert’s schedule. The
Court did not continue or reopen discovery or related deadlines. 
On
November 12, 2024, the parties stipulated that stipulated that Aquino “is
recovering from lung cancer surgery and is on medical leave until January,
thereby making it more difficult for Metro to properly defend against the case
. . . .”  The parties stipulated that discovery
would remain closed “except for any outstanding expert and witness
depositions.” Based on the stipulation, the Court continued the trial to
January 14, 2025.  
Trial
is currently scheduled for January 14, 2025. 
B.   These motions 
1.    Plaintiff’s motion for terminating and monetary
sanctions 
On
September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for terminating and monetary
sanctions against Metro.  The motion was
set for hearing on November 21, 2024.  On
November 6, 2024, Metro filed an opposition and request for sanctions.  On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
notice of errata.  On November 13, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply.  The Court
continued the hearing to December 12, 2024. 
2.    Aquino’s motion for protective order 
On
August 23, 2024, Aquino filed a motion for a protective order.  The motion was set for hearing on November
21, 2024.  No opposition has been
filed.  The Court continued the hearing
to December 12, 2024.

I.        PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING AND MONETARY SANCTIONS
 A.   Legal standard
  1.  Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(b) The court may impose an issue sanction ordering
that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance
with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery
process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or
opposing designated claims or defenses. 
“(c) The court may impose an evidence sanction by an
order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from introducing designated matters in evidence. 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. 
“(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
“(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other
section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not
impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide
electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or
overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic
information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.) 
 2.  Sanctions for failure to comply with order
compelling deposition 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.450, subdivision (h), provides: 
“If [a] party or party-affiliated deponent then fails
to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production [at a
deposition], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that party
deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of,
or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that deponent or against
the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any
party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the expectation that the
deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to that order.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (h).) 
3.  Terminating sanctions for failure to comply
with discovery orders 
A
violation of a discovery order may support the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (See Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (“Mileikowsky”).)  
B.   Discussion 
On August 28, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel
Metro to produce Aquino for deposition, ordered Metro to produce Aquino for
deposition within 30 days, and imposed sanctions on Metro. 
On
September 6, 2024, Plaintiff noticed Aquino’s deposition for September 23,
2024.  Metro did not object to the
deposition notice.  However, Aquino did
not appear for the September 23, 2024 deposition and Plaintiff took a notice of
non-appearance.  Metro’s counsel stated
that Aquino would be available on September 27, 2024.  Plaintiff noticed Aquino’s deposition for
that date. 
Aquino
appeared for his deposition on September 27, 2024.  Plaintiff argues that (1) Metro’s counsel
asserted frivolous objections, coached Aquino, and interrupted the deposition
and that (2) Aquino “failed to answer Plaintiff's counsel's questions,
responded with smart aleck remarks, and continuously stated he did not
understand simple questions.”  As a
result, Plaintiff contends, its counsel was forced to terminate the deposition
after 36 minutes.  Arguing that Metro “engaged
in an egregious, bad faith and virtually unprecedented litigation misconduct,”
Plaintiff asks the Court to impose terminating sanctions and strike Metro’s
answer. 
In
response, Metro argues that Plaintiff’s counsel “harass[ed]” Aquino at the
September 27, 2024 deposition. 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff has not shown that less severe
sanctions would be ineffective in producing Metro's compliance with the discovery
rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.) 
However,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  The Court has reviewed the transcript of the
September 27, 2024 deposition and finds that Metro’s counsel engaged in
obstructive, uncivil behavior that justified Plaintiff’s counsel’s decision to
terminate the deposition.
Plaintiff
requests $3,578.30 in sanctions based on eight hours of attorney time at a rate
of $450.00 per hour, the Certified Reporter's bill of $718.30, the videographer
bill of $365.00, and the filing fee of $60.00. 
Counsel spent five hours to prepare the motion and anticipated spending
two hours to prepare a reply and one hour to attend the hearing. 
The
Court awards $1,893.30 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour, the Certified Reporter’s bill, the
videographer bill, and the filing fee. 
The
Court also grants Plaintiff’s request to order Metro to make Aquino available
to attend a second session of his deposition. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h) [if party-affiliated
deponent fails to obey order compelling deposition testimony, “the court may
make those orders that are just”].)  The
Court orders Metro to make Aquino available to attend a second session of his
deposition on a date in February 2025.  The
combined length of the first and second sessions of Aquino’s deposition may not
exceed seven hours.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.290, subd. (a).) 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s request to appoint a discovery referee at Metro’s expense.  The Court expects that the second session of
Aquino’s deposition will proceed more smoothly than the first session. 
The
Court denies Metro’s request to impose sanctions on Plaintiff's counsel. 
II.      AQUINO’S MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
A.   Legal standard 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.420 provides in part: 
“(a) Before, during, or after a deposition, any party,
any deponent, or any other affected natural person or organization may promptly
move for a protective order. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) The court, for good cause shown, may make any
order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural
person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include, but
is not limited to, one or more of the following directions: 
* * *
“(2) That the deposition be taken at a different time.
. . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420,
subds. (a), (b)(2).) 
B.   Discussion 
Aquino
asks the Court to issue a protective order permitting Aquino to delay his
deposition until February 2025 based on his medical condition. 
As
noted, Aquino attended his deposition on September 27, 2024.  However, the Court has now granted Plaintiff’s
request to order Metro to produce Aquino for a second session of his deposition due to the
obstructive and uncivil conduct of Metro’s counsel at the September 27, 2024
deposition.  Therefore, Aquino’s motion
for a protective order is not moot. 
On
November 12, 2024, the parties stipulated that Aquino “is recovering from lung
cancer surgery and is on medical leave until January . . . .”  Based on the parties’ stipulation, the Court
finds good cause to grant Aquino’s motion for a protective order.  The Court orders that the second session of Aquino’s
deposition may not take place until February 2025. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Amanda
Montano’s motion for terminating and monetary sanctions as follows: 
The
Court ORDERS Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its counsel to pay Plaintiff Amanda Montano $1,893.30 in sanctions by
January 13, 2025. 
The
Court ORDERS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
to make its employee Joseph Aquino available to attend a second session of his
deposition on a date in February 2025. 
In
all other respects, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court GRANTS Joseph Aquino’s motion for a protective order and orders that the
second session of his deposition may not take place before February 2025. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
