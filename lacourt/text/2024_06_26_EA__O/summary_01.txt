Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a partition action filed by Plaintiff Crystal Duron, administrator of the decedent estate of Joe Jesse Duron, against Defendant Alice Duron Sandoval. The complaint alleges that Defendant Alice Sandoval illegally converted the 50% interest belonging to the decedent to herself. The court has previously denied Plaintiff's default judgment application because it appeared that Defendant Alice Sandoval was rightfully entitled to the decedent's ½ interest.

Defendant Alice Sandoval has since passed away, and Plaintiff has filed a motion to substitute Defendant Alice Sandoval with her son Anthony Sandoval. However, the court is unclear whether Anthony is the rightful successor in interest to Alice's estate. The motion notes that the certificate of death shows that Alice is survived by a husband, Rene Sandoval, but it is unclear whether Rene Sandoval is the successor in interest.

Therefore, the court's ruling is tentative because it is unclear whether Anthony is the rightful successor in interest to Alice's estate, and the court needs more information to determine whether Anthony should be substituted as the defendant.
