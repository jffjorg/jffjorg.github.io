And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to vacate a default. The case involves a dispute over the service of a complaint, with the defense arguing that service was improper and the plaintiff's counsel stating that service was proper. The defense counsel reached out to the plaintiff's counsel in November 2023, expressing concerns about the service and offering to accept service, but the plaintiff's counsel did not respond. The defense counsel later sent a letter asking that the default be set aside, but the plaintiff's counsel did not respond. The judge finds that the motion should be granted due to the state's strong policy in favor of adjudication on the merits and the lack of any prejudice. The judge expresses frustration with the parties for not communicating and avoiding the need for a motion, and orders both parties to review the LA Superior Court's Litigation Guidelines.
