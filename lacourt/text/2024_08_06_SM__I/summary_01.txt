And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to quash a defense subpoena seeking records related to a minor accident and the subsequent repair of the vehicle. The plaintiff claims that the documents are private, privileged, and confidential, but the Judge finds no basis for these claims. The Judge notes that the documents requested by the defendant are not confidential or privileged and may be relevant to the case. The Judge also rejects the plaintiff's suggestion that the defendant can obtain the same information from the plaintiff's wife, stating that the defendant has the right to seek documents from a disinterested party rather than relying on an interested party or their spouse.
