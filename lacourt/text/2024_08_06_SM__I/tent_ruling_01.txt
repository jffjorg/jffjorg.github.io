  Case Number:  22SMCV00497    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  I This is a Song-Beverly Act discovery motion—but going the
other way.  Almost all of these motions
are brought by the plaintiff seeking discovery against the defense.  This one is the defense against the
plaintiff, or, more precisely, it is a motion to quash brought by plaintiff
concerning a defense subpoena.  In a
nutshell, plaintiff was involved in what appears to have been a minor accident
and had the car repaired.  Defendant,
being sued under Song-Beverly, seeks the records concerning that repair.  Plaintiff resists, asserting that the
documents are private, privileged, and confidential.  The court notes that the records pertain only
to the vehicle at issue in the case, but the documents sought go beyond the
alleged defect. 
 
The court sees nothing that would be confidential or
privileged here.  These are
communications regarding the subject vehicle and the repair of it.  While it might be that they turn out to be
irrelevant, defendant is not required to take plaintiff’s word for it.  There could have been something that happened
to the car while it was being repaired that had some impact on the alleged
defect or might pertain to it in some way. 
Plaintiff also seems to claim that defendant can get this through
plaintiff’s wife.  Maybe, but that hardly
seems to be relevant to this motion. 
Defendant can seek documents from a disinterested party rather than rely
on an interested party or that party’s spouse.
 
Therefore, the motion to quash is DENIED.
