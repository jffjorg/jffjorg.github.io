 Case Number:  24SMCV00647    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion for trial preference.  It is unopposed.  In support, plaintiff’s counsel states that
plaintiff is 77 years old and was injured in the accident at issue in this case
and has had to undergo surgery in relation thereto.  What the motion and attached declaration does
not do is show that plaintiff’s health is declining to the point where
plaintiff’s interest will be prejudiced by a normal trial setting.  Right now, that would be February 2026.  
 
The court must therefore deny the motion to the extent that
it is brought under subdivision (a). 
However, noting that there is no opposition, the court will inquire as
to whether plaintiff is also moving under subdivision (e).  If so, the court will discuss setting this
motion on a more accelerated schedule, although likely more than 120 days from
now.
