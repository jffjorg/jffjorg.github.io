And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's ex parte application to postpone the deposition. The application was made due to the disappearance of the plaintiff's counsel, who has failed to communicate with the defense counsel despite repeated attempts. The Judge is concerned that the plaintiff's counsel has abandoned the case and is not responding to the defense's efforts to schedule the deposition. The Judge is willing to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and assume that they will appear for the deposition on the scheduled date, but if they do not, the defense may need to file a motion to compel further. The Judge is hopeful that the situation will resolve itself, but if it does not, the matter may be dismissed.
