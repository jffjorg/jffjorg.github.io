And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion brought by the plaintiff to enforce a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required Luminosity, GVN Releasing, and MMJ Productions to make monetary payments to the plaintiff. However, the payments were not made, and the plaintiff is now seeking to enforce the agreement by obtaining a judgment against GVN and MMJ. GVN and MMJ oppose the judgment, arguing that it is only applicable to Luminosity. The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, holding that the settlement agreement provides for a stipulated judgment that can be entered on an ex parte basis against Luminosity, and that GVN and MMJ are also liable for the unpaid amounts. The court will enter a judgment against GVN and MMJ and award the plaintiff its costs and fees, except for fees relating to enforcing the settlement agreement.
