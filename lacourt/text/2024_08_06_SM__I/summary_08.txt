And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for trial preference filed by the plaintiff, who is 77 years old and was injured in an accident, requiring surgery. The motion is unopposed, but the court must deny it under subdivision (a) because it does not demonstrate that the plaintiff's health is declining to the point where a normal trial setting would prejudice their interests. However, since there is no opposition, the court will inquire about whether the plaintiff is also moving under subdivision (e) to accelerate the trial schedule, potentially setting the trial date more than 120 days from now.
