And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction without prejudice. The plaintiff, Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, sought to enjoin the defendant entities from spending, disposing, depleting, dissipating, pledging to creditors, encumbering, and otherwise hypothecating their bank accounts and other assets. The court found that the plaintiff failed to carry its initial burden of establishing its likelihood of success on the merits of its specific claims alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. The court noted that the plaintiff's evidence of the defendants' alleged misappropriation of funds did not establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims for fraud, common counts, unfair business practices, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and declaratory relief. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendants made representations or promises with the requisite "knowledge of falsity" and "intent to defraud" the plaintiff. Therefore, the court denied the plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction without prejudice.
