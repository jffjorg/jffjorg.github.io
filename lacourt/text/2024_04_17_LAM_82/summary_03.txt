And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition from Petitioner, who allegedly received overpaid benefits from the EDD. The EDD issued two notices of overpayment, one for benefits paid in the first four months of 2021 and another for benefits paid in 2020 and January 2021. The second notice indicated an overpayment of $13,939.90, plus a 30 percent statutory penalty. However, the judge is not considering the amount of the overpayment, but rather whether there was actually an overpayment. The issue turns on whether Petitioner was required to report certain payments received for providing In-Home Support Services (IHSS). The EDD claims that some payments, including "difficulty of care payments," are excludable from taxable income under section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the judge notes that IHSS payments received by Petitioner do not relate to foster care, which would be covered under section 131. The judge is considering the facts and the law to determine whether there was an overpayment and whether Petitioner is liable for the overpaid amounts.
