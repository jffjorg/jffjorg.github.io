Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to amend the judgment in a case involving allegations of sexual misconduct. The petitioner, John Doe, had filed a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus against the Chancellor of the California State University and the Board of Trustees. The court denied the writ and entered judgment in favor of the respondents. The respondents have now moved to amend the judgment to add costs of $5,813.70 and to reflect the true name of the petitioner. The judge has granted the motion to amend the judgment to include the costs, but has denied the motion to reflect the true name of the petitioner. The judge has also ordered the respondents' counsel to lodge an amended judgment and to provide notice and proof of service with the court.
