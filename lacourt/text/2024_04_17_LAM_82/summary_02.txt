And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Petitioner's petition for a writ of mandate, which seeks to set aside the decision of the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. The Board affirmed the decision of the Employment Development Department (EDD) that Petitioner received an overpayment of unemployment insurance benefits. The court finds that the Petitioner has not demonstrated error by the Respondent and that the decision of the ALJ and the Board was supported by the evidence. The court also notes that the Petitioner's arguments regarding the exclusion of IHSS payments from wages are not applicable to the issue of whether an individual has "wages" for purposes of determining entitlement to unemployment insurance benefits.
