  Case Number:  21STCV45094    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  T Motions to Compel DepositionsCase Name: Victor Jimenez Sanchez, et al. v. Matthew Dwane HarrisonMoving Party: Defendant Dunn-Edwards CorporationResponding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDThis is a car collision case in which Plaintiffs Victor and Lydia Sanchez (“Plaintiffs”) allege their car was struck by Defendant Matthew Dwane Harrison. (Complaint, p. 4.) Defendant noticed Plaintiffs’ depositions for May 22, 2024 and continued the depositions to June 7, 2024 in response to Plaintiffs’ request.  On June 4, 2024, Plaintiff served objections to the June 7 depositions.  Several meet and confer efforts occurred to schedule new depositions. Defendant continued the depositions again and set them for Plaintiffs’ provided date of September 6, 2024, and then again for October 25, 2024. (See Declaration of Angela G. Kim, paragraphs 9-16; Motions to Compel, Exhibit E.)  Plaintiffs did not attend the scheduled October 25 depositions. (See Declarations of Angela G. Kim, paragraphs 16-17.)MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant argues good cause exists to compel Plaintiffs’ depositions and production of documents, as Defendant attempted to meet and confer multiple times prior to filing this motion. (Motion to Compel, p. 15.) Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,554.58 against Plaintiff. (Id. at 16.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed to this motion.ANALYSISI. Motion to Compel Deposition The Discovery Act allows “[a]ny party [to] obtain discovery . . . by taking in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) Service of a deposition notice makes attendance by a party deponent and production of requested document mandatory. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) This notice must be served at least 10 days prior to the date scheduled for the deposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (a).) “[T]he deposition proceeding is initiated by notice alone. The statutes confer upon litigants the right to take the deposition in a pending case . . . without prior court order and without a showing of good cause.” (Snyder v. Superior Court (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 579, 585, see also, Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 388.) If, after receiving notice, a party fails to appear, to answer any question, or to produce any document or tangible thing specified in the deposition notice, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling attendance and production. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) a. Meet and Confer California Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450, subdivision (a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action … , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document … described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition notice.” The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party deponent fails to attend the deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating that the moving party has contacted the party deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(b)(2).) The moving party must show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution. (Code of Civil Procedure §2025.450(b).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.” (Code of Civil Procedure §2016.040.)Here, there were more than adequate good faith efforts to meet and confer.b. Good CauseWhere a would-be deponent fails to appear, proceed with, or produce documents for deposition in a duly noticed deposition notice, the noticing party may move for an order to compel said deponent’s attendance, testimony, and/or production for inspection of any document described in the deposition notice.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.230, 2025.450 (a).) A motion to compel deposition attendance and production of documents must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the relief requested. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (b).) Good cause is established by a showing that the request is made in good faith and the documents sought are relevant to the subject matter of the action and material to the issues in the litigation. (Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 588.) For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez v. Superior Court, 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546 (1995).)Here, Defendant timely served Plaintiffs with Notices of Deposition which identified matters for examination. (Motion to Compel, Exhibit H.) Defendant’s Notices seek information about Plaintiff’s claims, injuries and alleged medical expenses. (See Declaration of Angela G. Kim, paragraphs 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, and 25; Motion to Compel, Exhibits A, H.) Namely, Defendant here seeks basic factual information about Plaintiffs’ injuries and related events, in addition to other information that may influence issues relating to liability and damages. (See, Motions to Compel, Exhibit A.) The information sought is thus highly relevant, and Defendant’s requests are reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. (Id.) As Defendant needs the requested documents to properly assess Plaintiffs’ claims and prepare a defense for trial, the Court finds Defendant has established good cause for its motion to compel deposition and production of documents. (See Declaration of Angela G. Kim, paragraphs 22-26.)II. SanctionsIf the court grants a motion to compel deposition and produce documents, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) Defendant requests sanctions, fees and expenses in the amount of at least $4,554.58. Defendant incurred fees of $295.00 per hour, and attests that 7 hours were spent preparing the instant motion, and an anticipated 2 hours will be incurred replying to any opposition, in addition to 1 hour preparing for the hearing and 2 hours attending it – totaling $3,540.00. Defendant also requests sanctions for the costs incurred from the $120.00 filing fees and $954.58 court reporter and videographer fees. (Motions, p. 17-18.)The Court finds Defendant’s $295.00 hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of hours Defendant may recover sanctions for is not. First, these are relatively routine motions and are unopposed.  Thus Defendant incurred no costs drafting replies.  Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that 5 hours of incurred fees resulting from preparing the instant motions to be reasonable. Defendant will likely incur 1 hour attending the hearing on these unopposed motions.  Defendant is thus entitled to 6 hours of incurred fees resulting from these motions – totaling $1,770. Defendant is also entitled to the $120.00 filing fees and $2,002.91court reporter and videographer fees. Defendant is entitled to sanctions in the amount of $3,892.91.RULINGDefendant’s motions to compel depositions are GRANTED. Depositions are to be completed by January 17, 2025.  Defendant’s motion for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $3,892.91.
