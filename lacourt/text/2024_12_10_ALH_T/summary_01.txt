And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel depositions and production of documents. The defendant had previously served notices of deposition on the plaintiffs, but the plaintiffs did not attend the scheduled depositions. The defendant made multiple attempts to meet and confer with the plaintiffs to schedule new depositions, but the plaintiffs did not respond. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the motion, as the information sought is highly relevant to the case and is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence.

The judge also grants the defendant's motion for sanctions in the amount of $3,892.91. The defendant incurred fees of $295.00 per hour in preparing the motion, and is entitled to recover 6 hours of incurred fees, totaling $1,770. The defendant is also entitled to the filing fees and court reporter and videographer fees.

The judge orders the depositions to be completed by January 17, 2025.
