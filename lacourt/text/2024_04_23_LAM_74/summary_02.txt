The defendant failed to respond to the RFAs, which is a violation of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to the requests for production of documents (set one) and orders the defendant to provide responsive documents and verified, Code-compliant responses within 30 days. The court also awards the plaintiff's counsel $400 in sanctions.
