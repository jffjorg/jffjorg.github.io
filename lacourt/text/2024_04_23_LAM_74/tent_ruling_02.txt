 Case Number:  22STCV41032    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  74 Richard
Gonzalez v. 2013 Madrid Family Irrevocable Trust Dated May 31, 2013, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests
for Admission (Sets One) Admitted and Request for Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a landlord-tenant dispute.
            On
December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Richard Gonzalez (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant 2013 Madrid Family Irrevocable Trust Dated May 31, 2013
(Defendant) and Alfredo Madrid Jr. 
            In
the complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) tortious breach of the implied warranty of habitability, (3)
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, (4) unlawful and unfair business
practices, (5) violation of Civil Code section 1942.5, (6) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and (7) violation of Civil Code section 51.
            On
July 6, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with requests for admission (RFAs).
            However,
Defendant never provided responses.
            On
October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to deem the RFAs admitted.
LEGAL STANDARD
            If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party
may move for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).) Further, the Court¿shall¿make this order, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing¿on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) ¿
            While tardy
responses may defeat the motion, they will not avoid monetary sanctions. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction [Citation] on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”].)  

DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Defendant has not provided timely responses to
the RFAs. Moreover, sanctions are mandatory. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Plaintiff’s counsel’s proposed hourly
rate is reasonable, and he has provided a breakdown of work performed.
(Alatorre Decl., ¶ 8.) However, this motion largely duplicates Plaintiff’s
counsel’s work on his other discovery motions. Accordingly, the court will
award Plaintiff’s counsel $400 in sanctions.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to deem the RFAs admitted. The court grants Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel attorney fees in
the sum of $400 within 30 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice./////////////////Richard
Gonzalez v. 2013 Madrid Family Irrevocable Trust Dated May 31, 203, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Requests for Production (Set One) of Documents and
Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a landlord-tenant dispute.
            On
December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Richard Gonzalez (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant 2013 Madrid Family Irrevocable Trust Dated May 31, 2013
(Defendant) and Alfredo Madrid Jr. 
            In
the complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) tortious breach of the implied warranty of habitability, (3)
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, (4) unlawful and unfair business
practices, (5) violation of Civil Code section 1942.5, (6) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and (7) violation of Civil Code section 51.
            On
July 6, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with requests for production of
documents (set one) (RFPs).
            However,
Defendant never provided responses.
            On
October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant’s responses
to the RFPs and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Defendant has failed to provide timely
responses to the RFPs. Moreover, sanctions are warranted because Defendant has
not demonstrated that it acted with substantial justification. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Plaintiff’s counsel proposed hourly rate is
reasonable and he has provided a breakdown of work performed. (Alatorre Decl.,
¶ 8.) However, this motion largely duplicates work from Plaintiff’s other
discovery motion. Accordingly, the court will award Plaintiff’s counsel
sanctions in the amount of $400.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to requests for
production of documents (set one.) Defendant shall provide responsive documents
and verified, Code-compliant responses, without objections, within 30 days of
this order. The court grants Plaintiff’s counsel request for sanctions.
Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel $400 within 30 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
