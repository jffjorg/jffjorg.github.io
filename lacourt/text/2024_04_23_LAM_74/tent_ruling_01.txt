  Case Number:  20STCV20832    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  74 Blas Garcia
v. Maderia Kitchen, et al.
Motion for Leave to File Second
Amended Complaint
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from an
employment dispute. 
            On
June 2, 2020, Plaintiff Blas Garcia (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendants Madera Kitchen and Milton Sznaider (Defendants).
            On
June 22, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.
            On
March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file a second amended
complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be
allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal
citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of
the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend . . .”  (Morgan v.
Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations
are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration
specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and the reason the request for amendment was not made earlier must also
accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
DISCUSSION 
            The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint because
Plaintiff has substantially complied with the applicable California Rules of
Court. Moreover, Defendants have not demonstrated any resulting prejudice in a
timely opposition.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
