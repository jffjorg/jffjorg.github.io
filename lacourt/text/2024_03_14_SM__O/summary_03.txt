And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the demurrer filed by the defendants, Saman Manavi and Manavi Law Group. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff, Jay Scott Cohen, cannot bring claims for legal malpractice because he pleaded nolo contendere to a felony count in a prior criminal proceeding. The judge agrees with the defendants and sustains the demurrer as to the 2nd through 6th causes of action, which allege defective representation by the defendants. The judge finds that these causes of action require the pleading of actual innocence as an essential element, and since the plaintiff has not alleged that he has been exonerated of the felony he pleaded guilty to, he cannot plead an essential element of these causes of action. The judge also sustains the demurrer as to the 1st cause of action for civil conspiracy, which is not a valid cause of action under California law.
