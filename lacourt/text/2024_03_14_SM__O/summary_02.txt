And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is tentatively ruling in favor of the plaintiff, Skylark (UK) Servicing LLC, and granting their motion for the appointment of a receiver. The judge finds that Skylark has met its prima facie case to establish the need for a receiver appointment under California Code of Civil Procedure § 564(b)(2). The judge notes that Tree Lane, LLC, the defendant, has defaulted under the loan documents and has waived its right to oppose the appointment of a receiver in the Deed of Trust. The judge also finds that Tree Lane has refused to cooperate with Skylark's appointed independent manager, Matthew Mason. The judge concludes that the collateral is at risk due to Tree Lane's gross delinquency on property taxes, mechanic's and materialmen's liens, and HOA fees, and that the appointment of a receiver is necessary to preserve the property and rights of the parties. The judge will address the issue of Mr. Mason's status as Skylark's nominee to be the independent manager at the hearing.
