Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that all causes of action brought by the plaintiff, Aaron Coppelson, are barred by the statute of limitations. The defendants, N.E. Designs, Inc. and Erin Gispan, argued that Coppelson's claims arose out of a breach of contract and that the statute of limitations has expired. The judge found that the discovery rule does not apply to toll the statute of limitations, as Coppelson was aware of the defendants' unlicensed status as early as 2013 and was placed on inquiry notice when the defendants ceased performance on the contract in 2014. The judge also found that Coppelson failed to meet his burden to show a triable issue of material fact as to the defendants' complete statute of limitations defense. The motion for summary judgment is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed judgment.
