VI.        
BACKGROUND
 
On November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Horizons Senior Apts, Cirrus Asset Management, and Does 1 to
10, alleging a single “Intentional Tort” cause of action. (Complaint p.
5.)  
 
On June 6, 2024, Defendants 26705 Malibu
Hills Road LLC (erroneously sued as Horizons Senior Apts) and Cirrus Asset
Management, Inc. demurred to Plaintiff’s complaint. (Demurrer filed 06/6/24.)
This court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. (07/15/24 Minute Order
pp. 5-6.)  
 
On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
first amended complaint. (First Amended Complaint, “FAC” p. 1.) Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint added Defendants Gary Fidler, Debbie Lush, Greg Meyers,
Steve Heimler, Shirin Shojapour, Elliot Hakakzedah, Manisha K. Bajaj, and
Cynthia Gutierrez. (FAC p. 2.) The first amended complaint also added various
causes of action. (FAC pp. 4-16, 18, 32.)
 
On September 11, 2024, Defendants 26705
Malibu Hills Road LLC (erroneously sued as Horizons Senior Apts), Cirrus Asset
Management, Inc., Cynthia Gutierrez, and Greg Meyers demurred to Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint. On October 16, 2024, this court sustained the demurrer
without leave to amend. (10/16/24 Minute Order p. 10.)
 
On October 29, 2024, Defendants 26705 Malibu Hills Road LLC (erroneously
sued as Horizons Senior Apts), Cirrus Asset Management, Inc., Cynthia
Gutierrez, and Greg Meyers filed a motion to dismiss (the “Motion”).  The
opposition was due December 20, 2024. As of December 24, 2024, no opposition
has been filed.
 
VII.      
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The court may dismiss the complaint as
to that defendant when . . . Except where section 597 applies, after a demurrer
to the complaint is sustained without leave to amend and either party moves for
dismissal[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 591(f)(1).)
 
VIII.   
DISCUSSION
 
On September 11, 2024, Defendants 26705 Malibu Hills Road LLC (erroneously
sued as Horizons Senior Apts), Cirrus Asset Management, Inc., Cynthia
Gutierrez, and Greg Meyers (“Defendants”) demurred to Plaintiff’s first amended
complaint. On October 16, 2024, this court sustained the demurrer without leave
to amend. (10/16/24 Minute Order pp. 9-10.) Defendants now
request this court dismiss this action as to moving Defendants 26705 Malibu Hills Road LLC (erroneously
sued as Horizons Senior Apts), Cirrus Asset Management, Inc., Cynthia
Gutierrez, and Greg Meyers. (Motion p. 3.) 
 
Defendants Cynthia Gutierrez and Greg
Meyers were removed from this action. Thus, only Defendants 26705 Malibu Hills
Road LLC (erroneously sued as Horizons Senior Apts) and Cirrus Asset
Management, Inc. remain in this action.
 
This court “may dismiss the complaint as to that
defendant when . . . a demurrer to the complaint is sustained without leave to
amend and either party moves for dismissal[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 591(f)(1).) Those
conditions are satisfied here. Accordingly, this court grants the Motion.
 
IX.        
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, this court grants Defendants’
Motion and dismisses the complaint as to Defendants 26705 Malibu Hills Road LLC
(erroneously sued as Horizons Senior Apts) and Cirrus Asset Management, Inc. 
Dated: January 6, 2025
