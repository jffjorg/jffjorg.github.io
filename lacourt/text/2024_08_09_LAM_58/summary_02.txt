And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants approval of the PAGA settlement. The settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to all concerned parties. The parties attended a day-long mediation and exchanged informal discovery. The plaintiff's counsel assessed the maximum value of the PAGA claims to be released by the settlement, which was approximately $899,500.00. However, the existence of numerous disputes in this case makes the outcome uncertain. The judge finds that the settlement is a result of arm's-length bargaining and that the plaintiff's counsel has experience in similar litigation. The judge awards $71,666.66 in attorney's fees and $10,570.96 in costs, as well as a service award of $10,000.00 to the plaintiff. The judge also approves the requested $7,500.00 for settlement administration costs.
