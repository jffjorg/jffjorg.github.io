On December 15, 2023, the Court
entered judgment in favor of Defendant Christina Hayek and against Plaintiff Cameron
Kaminski.  The judgment awarded Defendant
$140,000.00 in attorney fees and $4,456.50 in costs.  On January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Filing of Notice of Appeal.
On
March 8, 2024, the Court scheduled a hearing date of May 2, 2024 for the parties’
motions regarding judgment enforcement.
On
April 10, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel production of communications
with Plaintiff’s parents and for a discretionary undertaking.
On
April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to stay enforcement or for a protective
order.
STAY OF ENFORCEMENT AND UNDERTAKING
“Except
as provided in Sections 917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, the perfecting
of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed
from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 916, subd. (a).)
One
exception is a money judgment, which requires an undertaking in order to stay enforcement.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.1, subd. (a).)  However, no undertaking is required when the money
judgment is solely for costs, including statutory attorney fees.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.1, subd. (d); see Code
Civ. Proc., § 1021.)
“[A]
SLAPP plaintiff’s perfecting of an appeal from a judgment awarding attorney fees
and costs to a prevailing SLAPP defendant under subdivision (c) of section 425.16
does not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment.  . . . [T]o stay enforcement of such a judgment,
the SLAPP plaintiff must give an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the
money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule.”  (Dowling v. Zimmerman (2001) 85 Cal.App.4th
1400, 1406 (Dowling).)
Plaintiff
urges the Court to not follow Dowling and to instead follow the “more recent
and better reasoned decision” in Quiles v. Parent (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 130
(Quiles), which concluded that enforcement of an award of attorney fees,
as a category of costs, was stayed pending appeal.  (Pl. Motion at pp. 16-17.)  Plaintiff specifically points to the Quiles
court’s consideration of the 1993 legislative amendment to Code of Civil Procedure
section 917.1 and attorney fees as “costs awarded under” sections 1021 through 1038.  (Pl. Motion at p. 16.)
The
Court declines to follow Quiles, a Fair Labor Standards Act case, over Dowling,
an anti-SLAPP case.  The Dowling court
also considered the 1993 amendment when interpreting section 917.1, subdivision
(d) specifically as it applies to anti-SLAPP awards.  (Dowling, supra, 85 Cal.App.4th at pp.
1429-1432.)  That court noted that “only the
SLAPP defendant [is entitled] to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs
after prevailing on a special motion to strike a complaint under the anti-SLAPP
statute.  A plaintiff who prevails
by defeating the motion to strike is not entitled to recover fees and costs
under the anti-SLAPP statute simply by prevailing on the motion.”  (Id. at p. 1432.)  Therefore, “a statutory award of attorney fees
and costs under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 is not routine because it is not
reciprocal,” and “only a judgment for routine costs (i.e., costs awarded
under § 1021 et seq.) is stayed automatically by the perfecting of an appeal.”  (Id. at pp. 1432-1433.)  The court also cited the legislature’s intent
to “broadly” protect the right of petition and “to provide SLAPP defendants an efficient
tool to quickly and inexpensively unmask and defeat SLAPP suits.”  (Id. at p. 1433.)  The court was “persuaded the Legislature intended
to deter SLAPP litigation not only at the trial court level, but also in the appellate
courts in order to protect the proper exercise of First Amendment rights.”  (Ibid.)  Accordingly, the requirement of an undertaking
in order to stay enforcement “will promote meritorious appeals, and will deter continued
SLAPP litigation at the appellate level.” 
(Id. at pp. 1433-1434.)
Additionally,
enforcement of a judgment solely for costs is not stayed if the Court, in its discretion,
requires an undertaking and the debtor does not post the undertaking.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.9, subd. (a)(3).)  Following the binding and on-point authority of
Dowling, and also in its discretion, the Court concludes that an undertaking
is required to stay enforcement of the judgment.
Defendant’s
motion for an undertaking is GRANTED.
Defendant
asks the Court to impose an undertaking in the amount of 1.5 times the amount of
the judgment.  (Def. Motion at p. 10.)  Plaintiff asks that any undertaking not exceed
$30,000.  (Reply to Pl. Motion at p. 4.)
The
Court imposes an undertaking of $100,000. 
The undertaking is conditioned upon payment of the sums required by the judgment
if the judgment is affirmed or the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.9, subd. (c).)  If the judgment or any part of it is affirmed,
or if the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed, Plaintiff will pay all damages that
Defendant may sustain by reason of the stay in the enforcement of the judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.9, subd. (c).)
The
undertaking must be posted no later than May 30, 2024.
Plaintiff’s
motion for a stay is GRANTED IN PART.  Enforcement
of the judgment is STAYED through May 30, 2024. 
If Plaintiff does not timely post the required undertaking, the stay will
be lifted.
MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION/REQUEST
FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
In
light of the above, Defendant’s motion to compel production of communications for
judgment enforcement is DENIED without prejudice to renewal if the enforcement stay
is lifted.
Plaintiff’s
request for a protective order is DENIED AS MOOT.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s
and Defendant’s motions are GRANTED IN PART as set forth above.
Clerk
