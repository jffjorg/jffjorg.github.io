[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO ENFORCE
  SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 2, 2024



 
On November 30, 2022, Plaintiff Westlake Flooring Company,
LLC and Defendant Jennifer Ashley Neese filed a stipulation to dismiss this action
pursuant to a settlement, with the Court retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 for enforcement of the settlement.  On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to
enforce the settlement.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
Plaintiff
and Defendant entered into a settlement agreement under which Defendant would pay
$72,000.00 to Plaintiff, via consecutive monthly payments of no less than $750.00
each beginning by no later than December 1, 2022, and continuing on the first day
of each subsequent month for 12 months and then a $63,000.00 balloon payment by
no later than December 1, 2023.  (Friedman
Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.)  If Defendant defaulted, Plaintiff
could seek entry of judgment for the amount due.  (Friedman Decl., Ex. A.)  Defendant made sporadic payments for a total of
$9,000.00, but Defendant has defaulted and $63,000.00 in principal remains due.  (Friedman Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8.)
Plaintiff
seeks entry of judgment for the outstanding $63,000.00.  Defendant did not oppose the motion.
Accordingly,
the unopposed motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
