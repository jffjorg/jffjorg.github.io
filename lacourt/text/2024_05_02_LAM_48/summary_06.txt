The tentative ruling denies the defendant's demurrer and grants the defendant's motion to strike. The court holds that the Legislature has the power to revive lapsed claims and exempt childhood sexual abuse claims from the claims presentation requirement. The court also finds that the retroactive application of AB 218 does not violate the Gift Clause. The court grants the defendant's motion to strike Paragraphs 53-55 and the Prayer for statutory treble damages.
