[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO CONDUCT MENTAL EXAMINATION OF PLAINTIFF; GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 2, 2024



 
Pending
before the Court are two discovery motions filed by Plaintiff Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman
and Defendants The Accelerated School and Johnathan Williams.
LEAVE TO CONDUCT MENTAL EXAM
On
April 2, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for leave to conduct a mental examination
of Plaintiff.
A
party must obtain leave of court when seeking to obtain discovery by a physical
examination or by a mental examination.  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (a).)  A
motion for an examination shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and specialty, if any, of
the person or persons who will perform the examination.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).)  The Court shall grant the motion only for good
cause shown.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320,
subd. (a).)
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges severe emotional distress (including grief, shame, humiliation,
embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, panic, depression, anguish,
nervousness, fright, shock, and anxiety) due to Defendants’ conduct.  (E.g., Complaint ¶¶ 81, 105, 134, 164, 208, 238,
270, 301, 308, 331, 378, 397.)  Plaintiff’s
discovery responses and deposition testimony also identified emotional distress.  (See Motion at p. 4; Pizarro Decl., Exs. 2-3.)
Plaintiff
argues that the exam should be limited to an inquiry from 2014 to 2024.  (Opposition at pp. 2-3, 8-9.)  However, Plaintiff’s medical records show mental
health treatment as far back as 2006.  (See
Pizzaro Decl., Ex. 3.)  Defendants are entitled
to an exam that includes all mental health concerns for comparison over time and
for possible alternative causes of her emotional distress.
Plaintiff
argues that it is unreasonable for Defendants to require that Plaintiff pay the
doctor’s “no show” fee if Plaintiff is late or belatedly reschedules the exam.  (Opposition at p. 9.)  This term is not in the Notice of Motion, nor
is it in the proposed order that incorporates the Notice of Motion.  However, its exclusion as an express term does
not foreclose the possibility of Defendants seeking sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.410.
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants should not be allowed to inquire into her sexual conduct
and history.  (Opposition at pp. 9-10.)  This is not a topic expressly noticed in the manner
or scope of exam, and “absent evidence to the contrary (and there is none), it must
be presumed that the examiners will act appropriately.”  (Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior
Court (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1391, 1397.)
Plaintiff
also requests that certain terms be included in the order.  (Opposition at pp. 10-11.)  Many of these terms are already addressed in Defendants’
terms, such as who may be present, Plaintiff’s ability to take breaks as needed,
and Plaintiff’s ability to record the examination.  Other terms, such as the limitation of ten years
of history and payment cancellation fees, have already been considered by the Court
as set forth above.  Plaintiff has not shown
good cause for any of her other proposed terms and limitations.  The Court therefore declines to include Plaintiff’s
proposed terms.
Defendants’
motion complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, and the Court finds
there is good cause to order the mental examination.
Accordingly,
the motion for leave to conduct a mental examination of Plaintiff is GRANTED.
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
On
November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set Three.
On
January 19, 2024, the parties stipulated to continue the hearing on the motion because,
after meeting and conferring, Defendants agreed to produce further documents and
responses.
As
of the February 27, 2024 continued hearing, the parties did not provide any further
update, so the Court continued the hearing again.
On
April 25, 2024, the parties filed an amended joint statement.
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
A.        Defendants Have Provided Full Responses
for RFP Nos. 77, 85-89.
For
RFP Nos. 77, 85-89, 129 Defendants’ supplemental responses stated that they would
produce the responsive documents and identified them by Bates stamp.  Plaintiff argues that these are not the full documents
requested, but Defendants respond that the documents they produced are responsive
and complete.  Plaintiff has not shown that
the responses are insufficient and that there is good cause to order further production.
The
motion is denied for these requests.
B.        Plaintiff Has Not Shown Good Cause For
RFP Nos. 80, 82-83.
RFP
No. 80 requests “All Local Control Accountability Plan and Annual Update (‘LCAP’)
surveys that you administered to the parents in From [sic] January 2017 to January
2018.”  RFP No. 82 requests the same from
January 2016 to January 2017.  RFP No. 83
requests all responses to the surveys administered from January 2016 to January
2017.  Defendants provided only objections,
including that the requests exceed the permissible scope of discovery.  Defendant explains that surveys administered during
that time period would be for the 2016-2017 and 2015-2016 school years.  Plaintiff’s claims are based on conduct beginning
in May 2018.  (E.g., Complaint ¶ 22.)  Plaintiff has not shown good cause for this discovery.
The
motion is denied for these requests.
C.        RFP Nos. 91-97, 99-100, 103-5, 107-111,
113-114 Are Burdensome.
RFP
No. 91 requests “All notes, emails, or other documents as defined in Evidence Code
250 that Mr. Reading took during any meeting he had with Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman
from 2014 to July 2019.”  RFP Nos. 92-95,
97 request the same regarding Patricia Rodriguez, Marcus Wilhite, Rene Quon, and
Lenita Lugo, as well as Asha Marshall (with no time limitation).
RFP
No. 96 requests “All notes, emails, or other documents as defined in Evidence Code
250 between Patty Rodriguez and Francis Reading concerning Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman
from 2014 to July 2019.”  RFP Nos. 99-100
request the same between Asha Marshall and (1) anyone at The Accelerated Schools,
and (2) Dr. Juli Quinn.
RFP
No. 103 requests “All emails between plaintiff and Jonathan Williams from 2017 to
2019.”  RFP Nos. 104-105 request the same
between Plaintiff and (1) Patricia Rodriguez, and (2) Asha Marshall.
RFP
No. 107 [sic] requests “All emails between plaintiff and Robert French and anyone
at THE ACCELERATED SCHOOLS regarding Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman.”  RFP Nos. 108-111 request the same between Plaintiff
and (1) Frances Reading and anyone at The Accelerated Schools, (2) Asha Marshall
and anyone at The Accelerated Schools, (3) Patricia Rodriguez and anyone at The
Accelerated Schools, (4) Jonathan Williams and anyone at The Accelerated Schools.
RFP
No. 113 requests “All emails from Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman regarding Norma Acosta.”  RFP No. 114 requests “All emails between Juli
Quinn and Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman.”
 Defendants responded that “Plaintiff is invited
to meet and confer about the scope of this request.”  Defendants explain that the requests are overbroad,
burdensome, and oppressive.  In order to comply,
Defendants would have to retain a third-party service provider to assist with the
review and production of ESI, and those costs could exceed $75,000 based on the
amount of data.  (Suppl. Pizzaro Decl. ¶¶
2-3.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel makes several presumptions about Defendants’ calculations without foundation.  (Suppl. Gallagher Decl. ¶¶ 14-18.)  She declares that “[w]e do not need to pay $75,000
to have an outside company sort through an rename emails saved in a folder, my office
can do that,” and “[t]he Defendants can turn over their less than 100,000 emails
to my office and we can sort them and save them in folders.”  (Suppl. Gallagher Decl. ¶¶ 17-18.)  This does not address the initial concern of reviewing
which ESI is responsive and should be produced. 
Defendants have shown that, as currently framed, these requests are overbroad,
burdensome, and oppressive.
The
motion is denied for these requests.
D.        Plaintiff Has Not Shown Good Cause For
RFP No. 116.
RFP
No. 116 requests “The August 28, 2018 complaint from Hilda Rodriguez-Guzman to Asha
Marshall regarding Ms. Norma Acosta.”
Defendant
objected, in part, on privacy grounds.  Defendant
further explains that this complaint involves another employee, and that employee-witness
has a right to privacy.  Plaintiff argues,
“This is a clear simple request for a specific complaint that plaintiff made about
Willliams the CEO harassing another employee.” 
As phrased, the request is not clear that it involves Williams, and this
complaint is not alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint.
The
motion is denied for this request.
E.        Defendants Must Provide Supplemental Responses
to RFP Nos. 121, 126.
RFP
No. 121 asks Defendants to “Produce all policies and procedures that were in effect
from 2017 to 2019 for sexual harassment training of supervisors.”
RFP
No. 126 requests “All interview notes from Patty Rodriguez of interviews with Jonathan
Williams regarding any complaints from Hilda Rodriguez Guzman from 2016 to 2019.”
Defendants
responded, “Defendant will comply with this request by producing all responsive
documents in its possession, custody and/or control to the extent they exist.”  Plaintiff argues that the supplemental responses
did not include any documents.  Defendants
explain that they “continue to search for documents and will produce them once located,
or will amend this request to indicate that no responsive documents exist if none
are ultimately located.”
The
motion is granted for these requests.  Defendants
must provide code-complaint responses within 14 days.
F.         Defendants Must Provide Supplemental
Responses to RFP No. 140.
RFP
No. 140 requests “All documents that show YOU conducted any investigation into the
November 9, 2018 complaint from Hilda Rodriguez Guzman.”
Defendants’
supplemental response states, “After a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, Defendant
is unable to comply with this request since Defendant is currently unable to locate
any complaint made by plaintiff dated November 9, 2018.”  This does not fully comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230.
The
motion is granted for this request.  Defendants
must provide code-complaint responses within 14 days.
G.        Defendants Must Provide Supplemental Responses
and a Privilege Log for RFP Nos. 147-149.
RFP
No. 147 requests “Any documents that show that took [sic] any action into the allegations
contained in the Open letter to The Board of Trustees, read at the December 14,
2018 Board of Trustees meeting.”
RFP
No. 148 requests “Any documents that show that took [sic] any interviews you conducted
into the allegations contained in the Open letter to The Board of Trustees, read
at the December 14, 2018 Board of Trustees meeting.”
RFP
No. 149 requests “Any documents that show that took [sic] any findings you made
regarding the allegations contained in the Open letter to The Board of Trustees,
read at the December 14, 2018 Board of Trustees meeting.”
Defendants
objected, in part, based on the attorney client privilege and the attorney work
product doctrine.  If that is true, then Defendants
must produce a privilege log.
The
motion is granted for these requests.  Defendants
must provide code-complaint responses and a privilege log within 14 days.
H.        RFP No. 81 Is Not Set Forth in the Joint
Statement.
The
joint statement does not contain RFP No. 81, although it does set forth the responses
and arguments about production.  Without setting
forth the full text of the request, as required, the Court cannot determine whether
further production should be ordered.  Accordingly,
the motion is denied for RFP No. 81.
I.          Conclusion
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as set forth above.  Any requests for sanctions are denied.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
