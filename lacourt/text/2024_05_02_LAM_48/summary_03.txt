And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants Defendant's motion to seal the substantive portion of Jana I. Lubert's declaration in support of its motion to vacate default, as the declaration contains private, statutorily protected employment information and personal information about former counsel Ariadne Gianni. The Court also grants Defendant's motion to set aside/vacate default, as Defendant timely filed the motion and demonstrated excusable neglect in failing to respond to Plaintiff's motions and failing to file pretrial documents. The request for entry of default judgment is denied.
