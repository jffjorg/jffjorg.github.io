And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's demurrer and overrules the defendant's demurrer. The defendant had argued that AB 218, which retroactively revives lapsed claims and exempts said claims from the claim presentation requirement of the Government Tort Claims Act, is unconstitutional because it violates the Gift Clause. The plaintiff argues that the Legislature has the power to waive an established immunity and create liability for a public purpose. The judge finds that the Legislature has the power to revive lapsed claims and exempt said claims from the claim presentation requirement of the Government Tort Claims Act. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to strike Paragraphs 55-59 and the Prayer for statutory treble damages.
