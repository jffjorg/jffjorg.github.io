[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER; GRANTING
  MOTION TO STRIKE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 2, 2024



 
On July 21, 2023, Plaintiff R.J.
filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District arising from childhood sexual abuse.
On
August 25, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer and a motion to strike.
DEMURRER
The
parties’ requests for judicial notice of trial court orders in other cases are denied.  These orders are unpublished and nonprecedential.  (See Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center v. Belshe
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 831 [“a written trial court ruling has no precedential
value”].)
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
Defendant
argues that the retroactive application of AB 218 violates Article XVI, Section
6 of the California Constitution.
Under
the Government Claims Act, no person may sue a public entity or public employee
for money or damages unless a timely written claim has been presented to and denied
by the public entity.  (County of Los Angeles
v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267.)  Absent an applicable exception, failure to timely
present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing
suit against that entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.  (State of California v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.)
Currently,
claims brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 for damages resulting
from childhood sexual abuse are exempt from the claims presentation requirement.  (See Gov. Code, § 905, subd. (m).)  Before the passage of AB 218, Government Code
section 905, subdivision (m) limited the exception to the claim presentation requirement
to childhood sexual abuse claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after January
1, 2009.  When AB 218 became law in October
2019, it amended section 340.1 to revive expired claims and enlarged the time to
file suit.  AB 218 also (1) amended Government
Code section 905, subdivision (m) by deleting the language limiting the claim presentation
exception to claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after January 1, 2009,
and (2) added Government Code section 905, subdivision (p), which made this change
retroactive. 
Defendant
challenges AB 218 as unconstitutional in that it violates California Constitution,
Article XVI, section 6, which prohibits gifts of public funds (also referred to
by the parties as the “Gift Clause”).  The
Gift Clause states, in relevant part, that the Legislature shall have no “power
to make any gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing
of value to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever.”  (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 7.)  “[T[he term ‘gift’ includes ‘all appropriations
of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim, even if there
is a moral or equitable obligation.’”  (Jordan
v. California Dept. of Motor Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450 [citing
Conlin v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17, 21-22 (Conlin)].)

Defendant
argues that AB 218 is a gift of public funds that violates the Gift Clause by excusing
compliance with the Government Claims Act. 
Importantly, Defendant does not dispute that the Legislature’s authority
to enlarge or amend a statute of limitations to revive claims; instead, it argues
that timely claim presentation is a substantive element of any cause of action against
a public entity and is not merely a procedural requirement.  Therefore, Defendant contends, AB 218 is unconstitutional
because it creates liability for past acts where no right to recovery previously
existed.  Defendant relies on California Supreme
Court cases which it admits are old but insists are still on point and therefore
are controlling.  In one of these cases, Chapman
v. State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, 693, the Supreme Court stated that “the legislature
has no power to create a liability against the state for any . . . past act of negligence.”  Subsequently, in Heron v. Riley (1930)
209 Cal. 507, 517, the Supreme Court stated that the imposition of liability for
a past act of negligence “would, in effect, be the making of a gift.” 
Defendant
argues that its demurrer should be sustained because Plaintiff was allegedly abused
and assaulted several decades ago, but did not timely submit a claim.  Defendant argues that after Plaintiff failed to
submit a claim, Defendant became immune from liability, and AB 218, which retroactively
strips this immunity away, should be invalidated.
In
opposition, Plaintiff largely argues that the Legislature is permitted to waive
an established immunity and create liability as long as there is a “public purpose.”  Plaintiff cites County of Alameda v. Carleson
(1971) 5 Cal.2d 730, 745-746 (Carleson), in which the California Supreme
Court stated: “It is generally held that in determining whether an appropriation
of public funds is to be considered a gift, the primary question is whether the
funds are to be used for a ‘public’ or ‘private’ purpose; the benefit to the state
from an expenditure for a public purpose is in the nature of consideration and the
funds expended are therefore not a gift even though private persons are benefited
therefrom.”  The court further stated that
“[t]he determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter
for the Legislature to determine and its discretion will not be disturbed by the
courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.”  (Carleson, supra, 5 Cal.2d at p. 746.)  Plaintiff then extensively cites to the legislative
history of AB 218 to describe its clear and established public purpose provide tort
relief to victims of child sexual abuse and hold perpetrators and institutions accountable.  Plaintiff argues that the public purpose serves
as the consideration for the expenditure of public funds and is therefore consistent
with the Gift Clause.
In
reply, Defendant cites Conlin and argues that retroactively imposing liability
on public entities for unenforceable claims, as a matter of law, serves no public
purpose.  Defendant also cites Orange County
Foundation v. Irvine Co. (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 195, 200 (Orange County Foundation)
for the proposition that the appropriation of public funds for the payment of unenforceable
claims serves no public purpose.  That case
held that the settlement of a good faith dispute between the state and a private
party is an appropriate use of public funds and is not a gift “because the relinquishment
of a colorable legal claim in return for settlement funds paid by the State is good
consideration and accomplishes a valid public purpose.”  (Orange County Foundation, supra, 139 Cal.App.3d
195 at p. 200.)  However, if the claim is
invalid or unfounded, a promise to compromise “is not valuable consideration.”  (Id. at p. 201.) 
Here,
the Court is unpersuaded that the Legislature lacks the power to revive lapsed claims
and exempt said claims from the claim presentation requirement of the Government
Tort Claims Act.  This case is distinguishable
from those cited by Defendant, in which the legislature appropriated funds to pay
specific individuals (see Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321; Conlin v.
Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17) or passed legislation that a specific
class of persons would be paid a specified amount out of the counties’ general funds
(see Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271).  AB 218 does neither of these things, but rather
revives previously time-barred claims that still must be proven in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the manner provided by law, consistent with due process requirements.

The
cases Defendant relies on also predate the Government Claims Act, enacted in 1963.  Before the Government Claims Act was enacted,
“tort liability for public entity defendants was barred by a common law rule of
governmental immunity.  Over time, however,
the common law rule became ‘riddled with exceptions,’ both legislative and judge
made, and in 1961 this court abolished the rule altogether [in Muskopf v. Corning
Hospital Dist. (1961) 55 Cal.2d 211].” 
(Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798,
803.)
 More than a decade after the Government Claims
Act was passed, the California Supreme Court pronounced that “Government Code section
815 restores sovereign immunity in California except as provided in the Tort Claims
Act or other statute.”  (Williams v. Horvath
(1976) 16 Cal.3d 834.)  Even if the Legislature
confined potential governmental liability to “rigidly delineated circumstances,”
the Court is not persuaded that the Legislature is barred from changing those circumstances;
it is also not persuaded that the Legislature necessarily “creates” liability” when
it eliminates a statutory immunity (in the form of the prefiling claims requirement)
that previously applied to a negligent act that occurred in the past. 
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
MOTION TO STRIKE
A
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds.(a)-(b).)
Defendant
moves to strike Paragraphs 55-59 and the Prayer for statutory treble damages.  “Government Code section 818 prohibits the imposition
of enhanced damages under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, subdivision (b)(1)
against a public entity.”  (Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. v. Superior Court (2023) 14 Cal.5th 758, 790.)
The
unopposed motion to strike is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
