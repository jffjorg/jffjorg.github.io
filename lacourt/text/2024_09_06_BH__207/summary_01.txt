As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. The plaintiff, West Knoll Townhouse Homeowners Association, Inc., sought to access the defendant's townhouse unit for plumbing leak and environmental remediation repairs, but the judge found that the plaintiff failed to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting ex parte relief. The judge noted that the water leak has been ongoing for several months, and the plaintiff delayed in filing the lawsuit and requesting ex parte relief. The judge also pointed out that the City of West Hollywood's Code Compliance Department has not acted with urgency in addressing the issue. As a result, the judge determined that the plaintiff's request for ex parte relief was not justified and denied the application.
