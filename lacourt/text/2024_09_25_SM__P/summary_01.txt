Significant Statements:
  - "Plaintiff offers absolutely no evidence on two critical points...

Second, plaintiff provides no evidence, only speculation, that a hypothetical employer would treat an incomplete with a follow-up letter grade as a negative or draw conclusions – let alone what those conclusions a might be --- from the simple fact that a student at one point had an incomplete in specific class."
  - "Plaintiff failed to provide evidence that she or other disabled students suffered harm as a result of the policy. Instead, plaintiff asserts people with disabilities are more likely to request additional time to accommodate their disabilities, so their transcripts are disproportionately marked with permanent "incomplete" designations. There is no foundation for this assertion."

Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling addresses the motions for summary adjudication filed by both the plaintiff and defendant in the case of D.E. v. Regents of the University of California. The plaintiff seeks judgment on claims under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and Cal. Gov. Code §11135, while the defendant seeks summary adjudication on the disparate impact claim.

The Judge sustains 4 of the defendant's 19 evidentiary objections and overrules 13. The Judge also grants the plaintiff's motion for judicial notice of certain documents.

The Judge denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff's statistical analysis is flawed and that the defendant's expert, Dr. Saad, has raised a material question of fact regarding the impact of UCLA's "incomplete" policy on disabled graduate students.

The Judge grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the disparate impact claim, finding that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact.
