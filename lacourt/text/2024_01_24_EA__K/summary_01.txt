And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Benchmark Insurance Company's application for default judgment against Aqua Construction Inc. The ruling denies the application without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file the application if the defects are corrected. The defects noted include the fact that the plaintiff's declaration attached a copy of a letter from CompStar Insurance Services, rather than the actual insurance policy. The judge requests that the plaintiff provide a copy of the insurance policy to the court. The hearing date is set for January 24, 2024.
