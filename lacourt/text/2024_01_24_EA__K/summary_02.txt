The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of BD&J, PC (Firm) to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Juvani Licea. The Firm seeks to withdraw as counsel due to a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has impeded their ability to effectively prosecute the case. The Firm served the client with copies of the motion papers, but was unable to confirm the client's current address. The court finds that the requirements of California Rule of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, and grants the motion, effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the client at the client's last known address, return receipt requested.
