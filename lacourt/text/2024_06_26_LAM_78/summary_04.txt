And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Autonation Ford Torrance, a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Felix Rivera and others. The lawsuit alleges that Autonation failed to disclose a defect in a 2017 Ford F150 vehicle, which was purchased by the plaintiffs. The demurrer challenges the fifth cause of action for negligent repair, arguing that the complaint fails to plead damages.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint does not adequately plead the element of damages. Specifically, the complaint does not allege how the alleged negligent repair specifically caused the plaintiffs' alleged damages. The judge has also granted leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies.

The judge notes that the economic loss rule grounds for the demurrer are unable to be analyzed due to a lack of information about the timing and nature of the repairs at issue. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to list the repairs by date and to allege the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties for each repair.

The judge has also noted that the failure to meet and confer requirements does not constitute grounds for sustaining or overruling the demurrer.
