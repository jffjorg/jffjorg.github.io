NEFSKY, et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  21STCV09973  Hearing Date:  June 26, 2024    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  PLAINTIFF FRANCES FALCO’S MOTION TO TAX COSTSPlaintiff’s motion to tax costs is granted in part. The Court will tax a total of $9,917.93.Moving party to give notice. DISCUSSIONPlaintiff moves to tax costs from the memorandum of costs filed by Defendants. Legal StandardExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc. section 1032, subd. (b).) Under Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5, subd. (c)(2), allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” Subdivision (3) requires: “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount.” There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the memorandum. Only if the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs must supporting documentation be submitted. (Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.)Where a cost item does not appear proper and necessary on its face, the burden of proof is on the claimant to show the cost is appropriate. (Murphy v. F.D. Cornell Co. (1930) 110 Cal. App. 452, 454.) If the items appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761.) Where items are properly objected to as not reasonable or necessary, however, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) The trial court’s determination on a motion to tax or strike costs will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. (Santantonio v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 102, 121.)    Analysis Plaintiff moves to tax costs. Plaintiff disputes costs for (1) filing and motion fees, (2) jury fees, (3) deposition costs, (4) court reporter fees, and (5) fees for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits.1. Filing and Motion FeesFiling and motion fees are expressly allowable under Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5, subd. 9(a)(1). Plaintiff first argues that the filing fees for Defendants’ motion for summary judgment must be taxed because the motion and a subsequent writ were denied. However, the motion for summary judgment was denied after Defendants met their initial burden and Plaintiff submitted evidence showing a triable disputes of material fact remained over statute of limitations and resulting trust issues. (See minute order dated March 1, 2023.) Therefore, the motion was not frivolous. Under the circumstances, the Court finds the filing fees were reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation. The fees will not be taxed.2. Jury FeesJury fees are also expressly allowable under Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5, subd. 9(a)(1). Plaintiff argues that jury fees should be taxed because Defendants waived a jury trial. However, Defendants paid jury fees early in the litigation in December 2021. Plaintiff demanded a jury trial in November 2021. This matter did not become a non-jury trial until October 2023. Because the fees were paid early on in litigation and the matter proceeded for years as if it would be a jury trial, the Court finds Defendants reasonably incurred these fees.3. Deposition Fees Allowable costs include “the cost of making, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5, subd. (a)(3).)Plaintiff next argues various costs related to depositions should be taxed.• Service fees for the deposition subpoena served on Mark Brandt ($290.21, $462.81, $563.39, $204.77. $140.34, $274.30, $2898.50. Plaintiff argues Brandt was never served or deposed and that the deposition was set one day before the discovery cutoff.Defendants’ counsel represents that he noticed Brandt’s deposition well before the close of discovery. (Levin Decl., ¶¶7-8.) However, Brandt lived in Colorado and appeared to be evading service. (Id.) Defendants provide records showing the deposition notice set the deposition for July 17, 2023 and that Defendants’ process server made four attempts to serve the notice around early July 2023. (Id., Exhs. 14-17.)The Court finds that these expenses were reasonably incurred. Even if Defendants waited until just before the discovery cutoff to set Brandt’s deposition, Defendants still noticed the deposition before the close of discovery. Although Defendants failed to serve the notice, there is no evidence that Brandt’s deposition was not necessary for litigation. Therefore, these fees will not be taxed. • Service fees for the deposition subpoena served on Jerry Diamond ($794.77). Plaintiff argues Diamond was never served, his deposition was never taken, and his deposition was taken off calendar due to Diamond’s illness.Defendants’ counsel testifies that Diamond was in fact served with the deposition notice and provides records showing these charges. (Levin Decl., ¶10, Exhs. 11-13.) The Court finds that these costs were reasonably incurred. Even if the deposition was ultimately taken off calendar due to Diamond’s illness, there is no evidence that Diamond’s deposition was not necessary for litigation. These costs will not be taxed.• Plaintiff’s deposition ($3,748.15, $1,895). Depositions of Kurt Kuhn ($2,737.40) and Antonio Avalos ($2,198). Plaintiff argues that the fees are excessive and there is no indication of the amount charged per page. Defendants note that the service fees for Kuhn and Avalos’s deposition were incorrectly labelled as Brandt’s deposition in the memorandum of costs. Although Plaintiff argues that the deposition costs for the deposition if Plaintiff, Kuhn, and Avalos are excessive, Plaintiff provides no evidence that the fees are unreasonable on their face. Additionally, there is no rule that a memorandum of costs must be supported by bills, invoices, or other records. Even if there was such a rule, Defendants provide records showing Defendants incurred these expenses. (Levin Decl., Exhs. 1-4.) Because Defendants incurred these expenses and there is no evidence that they are unreasonable, these costs will not be taxed. • Deposition of Philip Snyder ($203.03, $461.78). Plaintiff argues that Plaintiff arranged and served notices for this deposition, not Defendants. Defendants represent that these costs were to serve deposition subpoenas on Saul and Philip Snyder to appear and produce business records. Defendants provide records of these expenses. (Opp., Exhs. 5-10.) Because Defendants provide evidence that these costs were actually incurred, the Court finds the fees should not be taxed.4. Reporter FeesCourt reporter fees are only allowable if they are allowed by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).) When an official court reporter is not available, a party may arrange and pay for a certified shorthand reporter, and those fees are recoverable as taxable costs.  (Gov. Code, section 68086(d)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.956(c)(1).) Here, Defendants’ memorandum of costs states the court reporter’s fees were for a summary judgment hearing and trial. For each proceeding, the Court appointed a certified shorthand reporter. (See orders dated November 27, 2023 and March 1, 2023.) Thus, the court reporter’s fees are expressly allowable under Gov. Code, section 68086 and Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.956. However, the Court did not order transcripts of trial or for the summary judgment hearing. Therefore, the costs for transcripts are not allowable under Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5(b)(5). The Court will tax a total of $9,917.935. Models, Enlargements, PhotocopiesThe cost of models, enlargements, photocopies, electronic presentations, and other similar costs are allowable if they were reasonably helpful to aid a trier of fact. (Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5(a)(13).) These costs are not recoverable if the materials were not presented to the trier of fact. (Segal v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 665.) However, the courts have discretion under Code Civ. Proc., section 1033.5(c)(4) to allow the costs if they were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation. (Id.)Here, the memorandum of costs states the costs for models, enlargements, and photocopies were for the trial binders submitted before trial. The Court requires the parties to produce trial binders at the Final Status Conference in each case. The Court also requires exhibit binders to be exchanged and lodged with the Court before trial. Because the materials were reasonably necessary to conduct litigation, the Court will exercise its discretion and allow the costs for producing and photocopying these materials. DATED: June 26, 2024_________________________Hon.
