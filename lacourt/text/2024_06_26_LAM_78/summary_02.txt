```

And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against him. The defendant's attorney, Armstrong, failed to timely file a responsive pleading, which led to the default judgment. The Court found that Armstrong's failure was due to his neglect in handling the case, rather than excusable neglect. Although the Court did not find Armstrong's actions to be reasonable, it was required to grant the motion under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b) because Armstrong's affidavit attested to his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Court set a new deadline for the defendant to file his answer and cross-complaint and scheduled a case management conference for July 30, 2024. The Court also denied the parties' objections to each other's evidence filed in support of and against the motion.
