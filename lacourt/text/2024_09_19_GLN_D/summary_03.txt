Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to reclassify the case to limited jurisdiction and has denied the motion. The defendant argues that the amount in controversy does not exceed $35,000, but the court finds that it is not clear that the damages will not exceed the jurisdictional amount of $25,000. The plaintiff may require future treatment and has a claim for pain and suffering, which could result in damages exceeding the jurisdictional amount. The court also notes that the plaintiff has a claim for general damages, which are not subject to precise measurement, and therefore the possibility exists that the total damages could exceed the jurisdictional limit. The motion is denied and the case will continue in the superior court.
