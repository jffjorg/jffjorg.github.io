And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lin v. Dang, et al. The defendant, Arcadia Mental Health Center, had filed a demurrer to the original complaint, which was sustained with leave to amend. However, since the original complaint has been superseded by a First Amended Complaint, the demurrer is now moot and is taken off calendar. The parties are reminded of their obligations to meet and confer before filing a demurrer to an amended pleading. The judge also notes that remote appearances can be made via LACourtConnect, but advance registration is required. If no appearance is made, the court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
