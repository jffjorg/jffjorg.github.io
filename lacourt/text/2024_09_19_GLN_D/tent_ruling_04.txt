Dang, et al. DEMURRERMoving Party:               Defendant Arcadia Mental Health Center     Responding Party:         Plaintiff Luoting Lin       ANALYSIS:Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint in this action on August 30, 2024, after a demurrer filed by another defendant, L.A. Downtown Medical Center, was sustained with leave to amend.  Since this demurrer is directed to the original complaint, which has been superseded by the First Amended Complaint, the demurrer is taken off calendar as moot. RULING: Defendant Arcadia Mental Health Center’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is taken off calendar as MOOT in light of the filing on August 30, 2024 of a First Amended Complaint. The parties are reminded of their obligations under CCP § 430.41 (a) in connection with any further challenge to the amended pleading (“If an amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a demurrer to the amended pleading.”).  See also CCP §435.5 (a), which provides a similar requirement with respect to motions to strike. DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
