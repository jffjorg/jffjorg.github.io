And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action brought by Josef Borovic against Anastasia Damianidou and others. The defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay the action based on an arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff, which requires any disputes arising between the parties to be decided by neutral, binding arbitration. The court found that the defendants met their initial burden to show the existence of a valid arbitration clause, and since the plaintiff failed to file a written opposition to the motion, the burden shifted to the plaintiff to show that the arbitration clause should not be enforced. The court determined that the plaintiff did not meet this burden and therefore granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. An OSC re: Arbitration Status is set for a later date.
