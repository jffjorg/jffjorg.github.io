And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Redondo Beach Unified School District (Defendant) to the complaint filed by John Doe (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleges childhood sexual abuse by a teacher at Aviation High School and seeks to revive claims that were previously barred by statute of limitations or claims presentation requirements. The Defendant argues that the claims are untimely and that the statute reviving the claims is unconstitutional.

The Judge notes that the constitutionality of a statute may not be properly raised on demurrer, and that the Legislature has the power to revive claims that were previously barred by statute of limitations or claims presentation requirements. The Judge also notes that the court must consider the public purpose served by the revival of claims and whether it has a reasonable basis.

The Judge concludes that the Defendant's demurrer is overruled, and that the Plaintiff's claims are not untimely. The Judge orders the Defendant to file and serve an Answer within 10 days of the date of the ruling.
