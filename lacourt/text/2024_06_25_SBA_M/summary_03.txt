Summary in English:

This tentative ruling addresses three motions: one for a stay of execution pending appeal, and two motions to be relieved as counsel for the defendants. The judge denies the motion for a stay of execution, finding that the defendant has not established the necessary extreme hardship to justify a delay in the eviction process. The judge also notes that the defendant filed the motion in pro per, despite still being represented by an attorney.

The judge conditionally grants the motions to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, citing the breakdown in the relationship between the parties and the attorney's valid reasons for withdrawal. However, the judge notes that the attorney failed to serve the proposed order on all parties who have appeared in the action, as required by the California Rules of Court.
