```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the motion to compel arbitration and stay the non-individual PAGA claims is granted. The court determines that a stay of the non-individual claims is warranted due to the overlapping issues between the individual claims and the PAGA claims. The court orders that the controversies between the plaintiff and defendants will be arbitrated, and the non-individual representative PAGA portion of the complaint will be stayed until the arbitration is completed.
