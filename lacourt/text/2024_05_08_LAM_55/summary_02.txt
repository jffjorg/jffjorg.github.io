Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denied Flinkman Management, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment, which claimed that the Plaintiff's claims were time-barred. The Plaintiff alleged damages for habitability issues in her apartment, which she had rented from Flinkman Management, Inc. since 1995. The Court found that there were triable issues of fact regarding the relationship between Flinkman Management, Inc. and the Flinkman Family Trust, which precluded summary judgment. The Court held that the Plaintiff's claims were not time-barred, as the relationship between the parties was not clearly defined. The Court also held that Flinkman Management, Inc. was not the agent of the Flinkman Family Trust, and that the 1995 lease agreement between Flinkman Management, Inc. and the Plaintiff was still in effect.
