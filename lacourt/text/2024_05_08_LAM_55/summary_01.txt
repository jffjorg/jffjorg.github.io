And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Jeanne Louis Flynn-Morgan, has moved for a new trial under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 657 based on irregularity in the proceedings, accident or surprise, insufficiency of evidence, and error in law. The court has reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was no irregularity or surprise that deprived the defendant of a fair trial. The court also found that the evidence supported the verdict in favor of the plaintiff, Rebecca Griley. The defendant's argument that the court erred in law by not finding an implied easement was also rejected as the defense was not pleaded or argued at trial. The motion for a new trial is denied.
