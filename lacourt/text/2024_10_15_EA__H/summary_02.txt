And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Absolute Resolutions Investments, LLC's (plaintiff) application for default judgment against Jose Rodriguez (defendant) without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed a complaint and applied for default judgment after the defendant failed to respond to the complaint. However, the judge noted that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient documentation to show a chain of title, including assignments from WebBank to Prosper Funding LLC to JPRO to Prosper Pass-Thru Trust I to the plaintiff. The judge requested that the plaintiff provide these documents and directed the plaintiff to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses this issue.
