And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ruzhuan Cao, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, alleging that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has reviewed the demurrer and has sustained it in part, finding that the complaint does not state a cause of action as to plaintiff Yuzheng Chen. The judge has overruled the demurrer in part, finding that the complaint is sufficient as to plaintiff Jixian Han. The judge declines to consider the defendant's argument that the doctrine of res judicata should apply and denies the defendant's request for judicial notice. The judge will hear from plaintiff Chen at the hearing as to whether leave to amend is requested and, if so, will require an offer of proof.
