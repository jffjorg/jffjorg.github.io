Resolutions Investments, LLC v. Rodriguez, Case No. 23PSCV03422ORDER
ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATIONPlaintiff Absolute Resolutions
Investments, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice. 
Background

This is a
collections case. On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff Absolute Resolutions
Investments, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint, asserting a common counts cause
of action against Jose Rodriguez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5.
On September
25, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Rodriguez.
Pending before the
Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The following
defects are noted:
Plaintiff has
failed to sufficiently show chain of title; although Plaintiff’s authorized
representative Tifuh Regine Check (“Check”) provided the Court with a “Register
of Beneficial Ownership” (See Exhibit A, p. 1), Check has not provided the
Court with a copy of any of the assignments, from WebBank to Prosper Funding
LLC to JPRO to Prosper Pass-Thru Trust I to Plaintiff. The Court requests that
Plaintiff provide these documents.
Accordingly,
the application is denied without prejudice, and Plaintiff is directed to
submit a revise default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned issue.
