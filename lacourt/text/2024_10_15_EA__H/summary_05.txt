And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's application for default judgment is denied without prejudice. The ruling notes several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the failure to dismiss unnamed parties (Does 1-50), the lack of personal knowledge in the declaration of Vanessa Londo, the need to re-calculate attorney's fees, and the requirement to provide an interest calculation and an account summary. The court directs the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
