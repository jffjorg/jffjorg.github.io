Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

In the case of 24PSCV00420, Judge H. Borrayo has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Elsa Moreno Mojica's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against her on April 17, 2024. The motion was filed based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Mojica's counsel, John R. Ramos, claimed that he made a mistake in believing that the request for entry of default had been rejected on April 17, 2024, and therefore did not file a response to the complaint. However, the court finds that there is no evidence to support this claim and that Mojica is attempting to set aside the default based on a lack of service, which is not a valid reason. The court also notes that Mojica's counsel did not submit a sworn affidavit attesting to the mistake, as required by the code. As a result, the court denies the motion to set aside the default.
