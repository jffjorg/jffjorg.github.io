 Case Number:  24PSCV00396    Hearing Date:   October 15, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff PHH Mortgage Corporation’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.Background
Plaintiff
PHH Mortgage Corporation (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Glenda S. Ahhaitty (“Ahhaitty”) acquired title to the
property located at 1119 Angelcrest Drive in Hacienda Heights (the “subject
property”) via a grant deed recorded on July 5, 2001. On or around March 10,
2012, Ahhaitty obtained a loan, which was secured by a deed of trust recorded
on April 6, 2012 (the “subject deed”) in favor of Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems (“MERS”), acting solely as nominee for Ally Bank, as
beneficiary. The legal description in the subject deed is incorrect. The
subject deed was assigned to Plaintiff via a Corporate Assignment of Deed of
Trust recorded on April 17, 2019. Notices of Federal Tax Lien were recorded on
September 6, 2016 and February 18, 2018, respectively. Notices of State Tax
Lien were recorded on November 8, 2017 and June 16, 2022, respectively. The
subject deed is presently in default, but Plaintiff is unable to proceed with a
nonjudicial foreclosure due to the mistaken legal description therein.
On
February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against Ahhaitty,
Department of the Treasury-Internal Revenue Service, The Franchise Tax
Board of the State of California (“FTB”), and Does 1-10 for (1) reformation and
(2) declaratory relief.
On
March 26, 2024, a “Disclaimer of the United State of America” was filed.
On April 24, 2024, the Clerk entered default against FTB
and Ahhaitty.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for
October 15, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defect is noted:
“[A]
claim for reformation of an instrument based on fraud or mistake is subject to
a three-year statute of limitations.” (Jo Redland Trust, U.A.D. 4-6-05 v.
CIT Bank, N.A. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 142, 162; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 338, subd. (d).) Further, “[a] claim for declaratory relief is subject to the
same statute of limitations as the legal or equitable claim on which it is
based.” (Bank of New York Mellon v. Citibank, N.A. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th
935, 943.) Plaintiff, through its complaint filed February 7, 2024, seeks
reformation of a deed of trust recorded on April 6, 2012. The Court directs Plaintiff
to provide supplemental briefing as to the statute of limitations.
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s application
without prejudice and directs Plaintiff to submit a
new default judgment application that addresses the aforementioned issue.
