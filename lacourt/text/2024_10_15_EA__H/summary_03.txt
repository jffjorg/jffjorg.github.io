And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, PHH Mortgage Corporation, sought to reform a deed of trust and obtain declaratory relief against Glenda S. Ahhaitty and others. The judge noted that the plaintiff's claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations, and the court directs the plaintiff to provide supplemental briefing on this issue. The judge also pointed out that the legal description in the deed of trust is incorrect, which has prevented the plaintiff from proceeding with a non-judicial foreclosure. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's application and directed the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment application that addresses the issue of the statute of limitations.
