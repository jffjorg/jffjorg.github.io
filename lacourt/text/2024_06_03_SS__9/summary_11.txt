And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the petition on two grounds. Firstly, the petition is denied because no proof of publication has been filed. The court has already continued the hearing once to allow the Petitioner additional time to file proof of publication, but the Petitioner has failed to do so. Secondly, the petition is denied because the Petitioner has failed to file proof of service on the other parent, or a declaration as to why such service could not be made. The petition is dismissed without prejudice, meaning the Petitioner may file a new petition and file the necessary proofs. The Court Clerk is instructed to give notice to the parties.
