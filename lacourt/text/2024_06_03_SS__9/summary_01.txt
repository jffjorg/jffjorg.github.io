And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge grants the petition and orders that the Petitioner double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is correctly spelled and legible, the Petitioner need not appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The Judge also notes that once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
