The judge is reiterating an earlier order from May 13, 2024, which required the Name Change Clerk to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide clear notation on whether the Petitioner has any convictions, including for sex offender registration. The Clerk has not completed this task, and the Petition is continued to June 10, 2024. The judge is ordering the Clerk to re-run the assessment and provide the necessary information before the next hearing.
