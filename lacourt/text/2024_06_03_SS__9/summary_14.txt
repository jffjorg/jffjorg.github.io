And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a decision on a petition to change the name of the Petitioner. The Petitioner is required to review the proposed decree carefully to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the decree is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the decree contains errors, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The Judge grants the petition, and a signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
