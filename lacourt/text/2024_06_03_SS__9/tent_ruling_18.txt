 Case Number:  24STCP01066    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  9 The
criminal history assessment that the Clerk’s Office ran on May 17, 2024 states
in part “no information found.”  This
notation is vague and ambiguous.  It is
unclear whether this notation means (1) that no information can be found
because Petitioner cannot be identified; or (2) that Petitioner can be
identified and has no arrests or convictions and no criminal history?  The petition is continued to June 24, 2024 at
9:30 am.  The Clerk’s Office must re-run
the criminal history assessment and provide more clear notation whether
Petitioner can be identified so as to run a criminal history assessment and
whether Petitioner has any convictions, including for offenses that require sex
offender registration.
The
Name Change Clerk is ordered to run and complete a criminal history assessment
prior to the continued hearing.
Court
Clerk to give notice.
