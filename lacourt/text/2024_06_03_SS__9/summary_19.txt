And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the petition for a name change. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree with the new name and ensure it is correctly spelled and legible. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
