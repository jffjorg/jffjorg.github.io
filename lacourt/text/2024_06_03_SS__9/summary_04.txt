And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by the judge for a hearing scheduled on June 3, 2024. The petitioner's petition to change their name has been granted. However, the judge notes that the proposed decree must be reviewed for clarity and accuracy of spelling. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
