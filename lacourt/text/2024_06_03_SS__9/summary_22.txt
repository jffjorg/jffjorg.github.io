And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petition to change the petitioner's name will be granted, subject to the proposed decree being corrected to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name is not correctly written, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
