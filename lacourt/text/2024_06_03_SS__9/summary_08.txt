And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the petition due to the petitioner's failure to provide sufficient information to establish their identity. The court had previously ordered the petitioner to provide identification to enable a criminal history assessment, but the petitioner failed to comply with this order. As a result, the petition is dismissed without prejudice, and the petitioner may re-file a new petition with sufficient information.
