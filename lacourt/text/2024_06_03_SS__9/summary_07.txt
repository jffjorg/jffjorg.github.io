And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the petition for a name change, subject to the condition that the new name must be clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the new name is not satisfactory, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
