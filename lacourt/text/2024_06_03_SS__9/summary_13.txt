And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the petition for name change, but with certain conditions. The petitioner must review the proposed decree with the new name and ensure that it is correctly spelled and legibly written. If the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
