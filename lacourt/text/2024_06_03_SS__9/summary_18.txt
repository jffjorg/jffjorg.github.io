And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has tentatively ruled that the petition will be continued to June 24, 2024 at 9:30 am. The Clerk's Office is ordered to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide a clear notation on whether the petitioner can be identified and whether they have any convictions, including for offenses that require sex offender registration. The court finds that the notation "no information found" is unclear and ambiguous, and therefore requires further clarification. The court clerk is ordered to give notice of the continued hearing."
