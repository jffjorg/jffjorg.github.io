history assessment form whether Petitioner is a registered sex offender or not. In addition, the
criminal history check appears incomplete as the Clerk’s office failed to include the report from
CLETS indicating whether there are “no hits on sex/arson registration.”
. . . The Clerk’s Office must re-run the criminal history assessment and provide more clear notation
whether Petitioner has any convictions, including for offenses that require sex offender
registration."The Name Change clerk has not re-run the criminal history assessment as indicated in the May 13, 2024 order.  The criminal history form is still
incomplete as the Clerk’s office failed to check off on the criminal history
assessment form whether Petitioner is a registered sex offender or not. In
addition, the criminal history check appears incomplete as the Clerk’s office
failed to include the report from CLETS indicating whether there are “no hits
on sex/arson registration.”

The Court hereby reiterates its order
of May 13, 2024.  Prior to the continued
hearing of June 10, 2024, the Name Change Clerk must re-run the criminal
