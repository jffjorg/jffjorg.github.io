And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and allows the petitioner to change their name. However, the petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is clear and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. But if the name is not clear, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
