Based on the information presented, the judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and outlines the next steps. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If satisfied, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Additionally, once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
