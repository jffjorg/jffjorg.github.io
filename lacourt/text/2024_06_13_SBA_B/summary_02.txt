And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, City of Inglewood and Kenneth Campos, against the complaint filed by plaintiff Andrew Goosby Jr. The court finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unfair business practices, as it lacks sufficient facts and is uncertain and unintelligible. The court also finds that the City of Inglewood, as a public entity, cannot be liable for punitive damages. Therefore, the demurrer to the complaint is sustained without leave to amend, and the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is granted without leave to amend.
