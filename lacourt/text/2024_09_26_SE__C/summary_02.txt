And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff EVERYTABLE, PBC's motion to compel Defendant MJ GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, INC. to provide further responses to discovery requests. The court finds that the motion is moot because Defendant provided supplemental responses after the motion was filed. The court also declines to award monetary sanctions to either party, finding that Defendant was substantially justified in objecting to the discovery requests as drafted. The court notes that most of the discovery requests are impermissibly overbroad, but that Defendant served almost 3,000 pages of responsive documents in an effort to informally resolve the discovery dispute.
