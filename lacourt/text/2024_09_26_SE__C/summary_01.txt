And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a breach of rental contract case. The defendant, Penn-Star Insurance Company, has applied for an order to put its Anti-SLAPP motion back on calendar and to vacate the dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant claims that the plaintiff's dismissal of the complaint was an attempt to avoid the Anti-SLAPP motion and that it is prejudiced by the delay in scheduling the motion. However, the judge is not persuaded that the defendant faces irreparable harm or immediate danger and has denied the defendant's ex parte application. The judge notes that while the rescheduling of the Anti-SLAPP motion may be inconvenient, it does not rise to the level of irreparable harm or immediate danger required for ex parte relief.
