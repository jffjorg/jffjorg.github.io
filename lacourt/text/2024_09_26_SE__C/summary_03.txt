And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for issuance of letters rogatory to serve defendants Jean Succar Kuri and Gloria Pita Rodriguez, who reside in Mexico. The motion is necessary because service of process must be conducted in compliance with the Hague Service Convention, which governs the service of process in international cases. The plaintiff alleges that she was sexually abused as a child by defendants Kuri and Rodriguez, and that she has suffered emotional, physical, and psychological distress as a result. The judge finds that the letters rogatory are necessary and convenient to effectuate service upon the defendants in compliance with the Hague Convention. The motion is granted, and the moving party is directed to give notice.
