Defendant Penn-Star Insurance Company move ex parte for an order to put its Anti-SLAPP Motion (and related request for attorneys’ fees) back on calendar and to vacate the entered dismissal of plaintiff’s complaint without prejudice and to enter judgment of dismissal with prejudice or, in the alternative, to advance the hearing on the motion for the same relief.A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)Defendant contends that after the stay in this action was lifted Plaintiff dismissed this action, without prejudice as a way to avoid the Anti-SLAPP motion. Defendant contends it is prejudiced as the Anti-SLAPP motion was originally scheduled for October 17, 2024 and now it is scheduled for May 7, 2025, which is 33 months after the anti-SLAPP was originally filed.Although, the Court understands the inconvenience of the rescheduling of the Anti-SLAPP motion, the Court is not persuaded that Defendant faces irreparable harm or immediate danger.Accordingly, Defendant Penn-Star’s ex parte application is DENIED.
