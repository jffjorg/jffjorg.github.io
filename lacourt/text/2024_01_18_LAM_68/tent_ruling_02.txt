 Case Number:  21STCV13995    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  68 Dept. 68Date: 1-18-24Case # 21STCV13995Trial Date: 5-20-24SANCTIONSMOVING PARTY: Defendant, Super Center Concepts, Inc.RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Rosa LucioRELIEF REQUESTEDMotion for Terminating SanctionsSUMMARY OF ACTIONOn June 21, 2020, Rosa Lucio slipped and fell on the premises of a retail location identified as Superior Grocers, Inc. on 5824 S. Vermont Ave. On April 13, 2021, Plaintiff filed a “complaint for personal injuries premises liability.” On May 28, 2201, Super Center Concepts, Inc. answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint.On October 13, 2022, the action was transferred from Department 29 (a PI Hub Court) to Department 39. On October 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed a 170.6 challenge to the judicial officer in Department 39. The action was transferred to Department 68.RULING: Continued.Defendant Super Center Concepts, Inc. (Super) moves for terminating sanctions and additional monetary sanctions following an order to compel production of a certification for a certain forensic report from plaintiff Rosa Lucio, as well as an order compelling further deposition. Plaintiff in a one day late opposition (January 15, 2024 is a court holiday) denies any willful violation of any order, and in fact maintains compliance with “all” court orders. Plaintiff counter requests sanctions. Super in reply challenges any representations of compliance with the April 20 or November 20, 2023, orders. Super maintains extreme prejudice. Super also represents the lack of any payment of monetary sanctions.On a threshold note, the court first addresses the December 18, 2023, filed Notice of Appeal. The “perfecting” of an appeal imposes an automatic stay on the case on “matters embraced therein…but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 916, subd. (a).) The notice lacks any identification of the appealed order(s). It’s also not clear whether the appeal has been perfected for purposes of staying the subject hearing. The court therefore proceeds with the hearing. (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189; Henry M. Lee Law Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1383-1384.)The court begins with the April 20, 2023, order, whereby the court ordered the hiring of an independent forensic consultant in order to insure compliance with production of all responsive documents. The order states in relevant part: “Plaintiff's firm is to employ a qualified forensic firm to recover the material information and produce such documents within 30 days.” On the deposition, the court wrote: “Plaintiff is ordered to appear for an in-person deposition at defense counsel's office in California within 60 days after production of documents.” Documents wereproduced on June 12, 2023, in compliance with the order, but without any forensic certification, and with argument over the redundancy of production.On November 20, 2023, the court denied the motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice, and granted the motion for issue sanctions regarding the medical specials claim. The court reserved the right to grant the terminating sanction upon further violation of the order to produce certification, even after issuing the issue sanction. The court imposed $25,000 in sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel as well, payable within 45 days of the order.Although the prior court reviewed the standard for evidentiary, issue and terminating sanctions, the court again presents the standard. “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119 citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) A prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal sanction is that the party has willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) Preventing parties from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326; Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191 [“Terminating sanctions are to be used sparingly because of the drastic effect of their application.”].) “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez¿(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)A prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal sanction is that the party has willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119 citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) Preventing parties from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326.)Evidence or issue sanctions may be imposed only after parties violated discovery orders compelling further responses, except in exceptional circumstances, including where there was sufficiently egregious misconduct regarding a failure to respond to discovery, or a prior discovery order would be futile. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1428.) “The discovery statutes thus ‘evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.’(Citation.) Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure (Citations), a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving that a discovery violation was not willful is on the party on whom the discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.)Super maintains that the twice repeated violation of the court order to produce a certification of the forensic report demonstrates a sufficient violation of the court order justifying a terminating sanction. Plaintiff in opposition maintains the order for any certification on the forensic report not part of the April 20, 2023, order. Plaintiff acknowledges the language of the November 20, 2023, order but maintains any reference to a certification lacks support. As for the deposition, Plaintiff deflects any challenge with claims of an offer to present the Plaintiff for further deposition, upon mutual agreement. [Declaration of Jonathan Kashani.]In considering Plaintiff’s argument, the court acknowledges the omitted explicit key words in the April 20, 2023, written order regarding the exact identification of a certificate from the forensic examiner firm. The court later addressed the lack of the apparently assumed required certification by concluding that uncertified responses effectively constitutes a non-response, thereby violating the prior order. The November 20, 2023, order states in relevant part: “Plaintiff did not produce the forensic examiner’s certification required by the April 20, 2023, order. Plaintiff’s counsel does not address this point in his declaration. The certification requirement was imposed because there was doubt as to the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s efforts to recover responsive documents. By producing 3000 documents without the required certification, Plaintiff completely disregarded a key aspect of the Court’s April 20, 2023 order. The parties and the Court are in the same position as on April 20, 2023, unsure if a proper search for responsive documents was performed.”The court finds the continued semantically based challenge based on required key words in the April 20, 2023, order lacks legal merit. The November 20, 2023, order categorically and unequivocally expresses the basis for requiring certification. The subject motion follows a series of efforts to fundamentally compel verified document production in support of the extraordinary amount of medical specials generated from a slip and fall at a retail location. Denial based on obtusely presented and relied upon technicalities indicates extreme gamesmanship. Plaintiff denies willfully violating the order, but it appears from the motion and reply that Plaintiff in fact seeks to prevent the disclosure and/or introduction of documents involving a third party factored liens.The court generally adheres to a style of robust discovery thereby allowing the parties to present the best sides of both arguments, thereby allowing a fair prosecution and defense of the action. In cases of extreme practice, the court will follow the progression of evidentiary and issue sanctions, with terminating sanctions only reserved for the most extreme of cases, as well established in the standard. Given the subject motion constitutes the first impression on the case for this court following the change in assignment, the court hesitates to immediately impose terminating sanctions.The court therefore continues the motion to February 27, 2024, in order to allow Plaintiff to elect to produce a certificate from the forensic examiner. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer within 7 calendar days of this order for an agreed upon date of deposition no later than 25 days from this order—February 12, 2024. At the time of the hearing, the court will expect either a representation of a completed deposition or a certificate of non-appearance from Defendant.Eleven (11) calendar days before the new hearing date, to wit, February 16, 2024, the parties are each ordered to file a supplemental brief of no more than three (3) pages per party updating the court. The court finds the November 20, 2023, order specifically expresses and clarifies the requirement of, and the basis for, the compelled forensic examiner certification, and the requirement for the deposition remains undisputed. The court will therefore NOT consider any new points and authorities or argument over the validity of the order regarding any aspect of the certificate or deposition.In the supplemental brief, the court only seeks information regarding the conduct of Plaintiff and proof of compliance. If Plaintiff seeks to continue arguing over the invalidity of the order regarding the forensic examiner certification, or presents yet another new argument on the deposition, the court will proceed with the hearing, which may include further evidentiary or terminating sanctions. If no deposition is completed, the court will also proceed with the hearing.The court grants additional monetary sanctions to compensate for the costs associated with the subject motion. Sanctions in the amount of $750 joint and several against Plaintiff and counsel. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h), 2031.310, subd. (i).) Payable within 30 days.Trial remains set for May 20, 2024.Moving party to give notice.
