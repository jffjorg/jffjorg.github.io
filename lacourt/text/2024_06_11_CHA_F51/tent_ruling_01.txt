On 2/08/23,

jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6 on 2/23/23.

ANALYSIS
 
A.     Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6, subd. (a).) 
 
Here,
the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce
the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (Friedman,
Esq. Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the
Stipulation. (Id.; Exh. A p. 4.) On
2/23/23, the Court dismissed the entire case without prejudice, according to
the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall retain jurisdiction
pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (See 02-23-23 Order.) Therefore, the Court finds that
the Stipulation complies with the requirements under CCP § 664.6, and it has
retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in
this action.
 
B.     Entry
of Judgment 
The Settlement Agreement provides that the parties
agreed to settle the matter for a principal sum of $48,207.31, with Defendant
making an initial payment of $203.41 by 2/15/23. (Friedman, Esq. Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. A.) Defendant would subsequently make monthly payments of $203.41
beginning on 3/15/23, until the remaining settlement amount was paid in full. (Id.)
Plaintiff provides the Court with the declaration of its counsel who avers that
Defendant made sporadic payments totaling $1,423.87. (Id. ¶6.) Counsel states
that he notified defense counsel several times about Defendant’s default and
breach (Id. ¶ 7.) The agreement provides that Defendant is deemed to be
in default if he becomes delinquent in payments for more than three days after
the due date. (Id. ¶ 2; Exh. A. p. 3: 1-5.) Counsel further states that
the Agreement provides that no notice of default is required to be provided and
that Plaintiff was entitled to file a motion setting aside the dismissal and
have judgment entered. (Id. ¶ 6.) Based Defendant’s failure to comply
with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff requested that a judgment be entered
against Defendant. (Id. ¶¶ 8-9.)
In opposition, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff
comes to the table with unclean hands because it did not provide a functional
solar power system. In reply, Plaintiff points out that the settlement
Agreement clearly establishes the parties' respective responsibilities and that
issues with the solar power system requiring repair were to be resolved via a
warranty claim. 
The Court finds the Settlement Agreement valid and
enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here, Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant
has made sporadic payments despite Plaintiff sending notice regarding
Defendant’s default. (Id. ¶¶ 6-7.) Moreover, the agreement provides that
any issues that arise with the system are covered under the warranty. Defendant
does not dispute this nor provide any evidence indicating that she sought to
invoke the warranty. Therefore, since a valid and signed settlement agreement
between the parties has been breached, and the Court retains jurisdiction to
enter judgment, the motion satisfies the requirements under CCP § 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal
and Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on February 23, 2023, is
vacated. Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount
of $46,783.44 for the following: the principal amount of $48,207.31 less
$1,423.87 in payments made by Defendant.
CONCLUSION
 
The motion
is granted. Dismissal entered on 2/23/23 is vacated. Judgment is entered in Plaintiff’s
favor and against Defendant for $46,783.44.
