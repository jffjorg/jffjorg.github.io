Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Hill's motion for a new trial following a jury trial. Hill is seeking a new trial due to alleged irregularities and misconduct during the trial. The judge has denied Hill's motion, finding that Hill failed to establish prejudice or harm as a result of the alleged irregularities and misconduct.

The judge found that Cedars-Sinai's counsel Mosley committed misconduct by asking a question about Hill's lawsuit against Equinox Athletic Club, despite a court order to refrain from mentioning the lawsuit. However, the judge concluded that Hill failed to establish that the question or the subsequent discussion among jurors prejudiced the jury against Hill.

The judge also found that jurors introduced outside information into deliberations, including a statement by Juror 4 about a hand surgeon not performing surgery immediately due to blood loss. However, the judge concluded that Hill failed to establish that this information was prejudicial or that the verdict would have been different absent the outside information.

Finally, the judge found that the verdict was supported by evidence and that Hill's arguments regarding the verdict were unavailing. The judge noted that most judges grant a new trial only after finding that the verdict was obviously and clearly wrong, and that the jury's verdict was not clearly wrong in this case.
