And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs, awarding $62,399.79 to the plaintiff's counsel. The plaintiff's counsel had sought $108,822.91 in fees and costs, but the judge found that the fee claim was reasonable. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel's proposed hourly rates were reasonable and that the billing invoices provided competent evidence of the services rendered. The judge also found that the defendant had not persuaded the court that work billed during the abandoned arbitration was no longer associated with that proceeding. As a result, the judge will not deduct discovery fees and costs from the plaintiff's award.
