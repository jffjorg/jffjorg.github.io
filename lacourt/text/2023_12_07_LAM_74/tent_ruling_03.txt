 Case Number:  21STCV04930    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  74 Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v.
Paragon Relocation Resources, Inc., et al.
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses from Defendant Paragon Relocation Resources, Inc. to Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One)
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a
contractual dispute.
            On
February 8, 2021, Plaintiff Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Paragon Relocation Resources (Defendant) and Paragon Global
Resources, Inc. The complaint alleges breach of contract, conversion, and
unjust enrichment.
            On
September 2, 2021, Plaintiff propounded requests for production of documents
(RFPs) on Defendant. 
            On
December 7, 2021, Defendant responded to the RFPs. Plaintiff was dissatisfied
with the responses.
            On
April 26, 2023, Defendant provided supplemental responses to the RFPs.
Plaintiff was still dissatisfied with many of Defendant’s responses.
            On
June 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further response to RFP
Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7-17, 20-22, 24-28, 30, 43, 50-62, 64-74, and 77-79.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to a
demand for inspection if the propounding party deems that an answer or
statement of compliance is evasive or incomplete, or that an objection is
“without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause for the discovery sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).) ¿  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
seeks further responses from Defendant to RFP Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7-17, 20-22, 24-28,
30, 43, 50-62, 64-68, 70-74, and 77-79.[1] As a
preliminary matter, the court finds this motion timely despite Defendant’s
contention to the contrary. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c) [“Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response . . . the demanding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.”].) Plaintiff
received Defendant’s supplemental responses on April 26, 2023. (Toboco Decl., ¶
14.) Plaintiff thereafter provided notice of this motion within 45 days on June
2, 2023. The court also notes that in its opposition, Defendant claims it
provided further supplemental responses and a further supplemental production
of documents to RFP Nos. 1, 13, 14, 17, 20, 28, 43, 44, 51, 52, 54-60, 64, 74,
and 77 on October 26, 2023, making this motion to compel moot for those RFPs. Accordingly,
the court will address Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to the
remaining RFP Nos. 4, 5, 7-12, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24-27, 30, 50, 53, 61-62, 65-68,
70-73, and 78-79, which are not moot.
            In
its initial responses and initial supplemental responses to the remaining RFPs
at issue, Defendant asserted numerous objections, but Defendant does not repeat
those objections in its opposition. Defendant maintains, however, that it lacks
the ability to comply with the remaining RFPs at issue because the responsive
documents have been lost on a corrupted hard-drive. Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230, a representation of an inability to comply must
affirm that the responding party performed a diligent search and reasonable
inquiry to comply with the demand. The statement must also set forth the name
and address of any natural person or organization known or believed to have
possession, custody, or control of the sought item. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.230.) The court notes Defendant did not assert its inability to comply due
to the corrupted hard-drive in its initial responses and initial supplemental
responses to the remaining RFPs at issue. Thus, further responses will be
necessary. Defendant shall state in each response that it made a diligent
search and reasonable inquiry. More importantly, Defendant shall state the name
and address of anyone who may possess the sought items. In this context, that
would be whoever has access to another hard-drive, not affected by the
corruption, that holds the items Plaintiff seeks. 
The
court does not award sanctions because Plaintiff’s counsel has not documented
the attorney’s fees she incurred for this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel
instead requests a lump sum for the work she performed on multiple discovery
motions, which is inadequate. (Toboco Decl., ¶ 21.) 
CONCLUSION
                The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 4, 5, 7-12, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24-27, 30,
50, 53, 61-62, 65-68, 70-73, and 78-79. Defendant shall provide further,
Code-compliant responses without objection by December 17, 2023. The court
denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.
            Plaintiff
shall give notice.
