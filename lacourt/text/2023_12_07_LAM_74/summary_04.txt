Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a contractual dispute between Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. (Plaintiff) and Paragon Relocation Resources, Inc. and Paragon Global Resources, Inc. (Defendant). The Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendant for breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment. The Defendant responded to the Plaintiff's request for admission (RFA) but the Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the response. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further response to RFA No. 10, which asks the Defendant to admit whether it has identified or listed debts owed to the Plaintiff in its corporate documents. The Defendant objected to the RFA, citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.060 and 2033.060(f), but the court finds the objections lack merit. The court grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the Defendant to provide a further response to RFA No. 10 without objection by December 17, 2023. The court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
