  Case Number:  20STCV42430    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  74 Jayson
Toquia Fama v. Astro Aluminum Treating Co., Inc.
Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs.
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
November 4, 2020, Plaintiff Jayson Toquia Fama (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Astro Aluminum Treating Co., Inc. (Defendant).
            On
October 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this motion for attorney fees under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98. Plaintiff’s counsel seeks $108,822.91
in attorney fees and costs.
EVIDENCE
            The court overrules Defendant’s
evidentiary objections.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.98, subdivision (c)(1), “If the employee or consumer withdraws the
claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court of appropriate jurisdiction . .
. [t]he employee or consumer may bring a motion . . . to recover all attorney’s
fees and costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding.” 
DISCUSSION  
            On
June 7, 2023, the court found that Defendant breached the arbitration agreement
in place between the parties. Plaintiff has withdrawn his claim from
arbitration and now pursues his action here. Consequently, Plaintiff may
recover attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98,
subdivision (c)(1). Defendant in turn contends the fee claim is unreasonable. 
            The
attorney bears the burden of proof as to reasonableness of any fee claim. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as to the
nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
            To
begin, the court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s proposed hourly rates reasonable.
Defendant disagrees, but “[t]he experienced trial judge is the best judge of
value of professional services rendered in his court.”” (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) Next, Plaintiff’s counsel has
furnished billing invoices. (Koulloukian Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. 1; Ex. 2.) But
Defendant has directed the court’s attention to specific entries and argues in
part that they are redundant. (Herman Decl., ¶¶ 9, 12; Ex. 2; Ex. 10.) The
court notes that roughly 75 percent of managing partner Nazo Koulloukian
billing entries duplicate those of associate Christine Harmandayan.
Accordingly, the court will award Nazo Koulloukian 25 percent of his requested
hours for a sum of $15,474.38 ((.25 x 117.9)
x $525). The court will award Christine Harmandayan the total amount of her
requested attorney fees: $44,440.
            Defendant
also points out that the discovery work Plaintiff’s counsel billed during the
abandoned arbitration will be used in this action. However, Defendant has not
cited authority in support of the proposition that work billed during the
abandoned arbitration is no longer associated with that proceeding because the
work will be relied upon in subsequent litigation. Nor has Defendant persuaded
the court that Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98, subdivision (c)(1), may
be interpreted in this manner. Accordingly, the court will not deduct discovery
fees and costs from Plaintiff’s award. Thus, the court will award Plaintiff
attorney fees and costs in the sum of $62,399.79 ($15,474.38
(Koulloukian’s attorney fees) + $44,440 (Harmandayan’s attorney fees) +
$2,485.41 (costs).)
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff’s counsel’s request for attorney
fees and costs. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s counsel $62,399.79 by January
7, 2023.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
