And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion for reconsideration filed by Soar Real Estate Investors, LLC (Plaintiff) regarding a court order that granted a motion to stay dissolution proceedings in Tradewinds Property Group, LLC. The Plaintiff argued that new facts, including the lack of a meeting and documentation of the decision regarding the Plaintiff's membership status, warrant reconsideration of the stay. The judge found that the statutes and operating agreement cited by the Plaintiff do not require a meeting and vote, and that the optional annual meetings specified in the operating agreement do not apply in this case. Therefore, the judge denied the motion for reconsideration and upheld the stay of the dissolution proceedings.
