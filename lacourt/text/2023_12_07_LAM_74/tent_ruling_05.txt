 Case Number:  21STCV23325    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  74 The LAAC
Corp. v. Stewart, Romberger, & Kite, et al.
Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
June 23, 2021, Plaintiff The LAAC Corp. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Mistry Engineering, Inc. (Defendant) and others. In the complaint, Plaintiff
alleged the following causes of action: breach of contract, negligence, and
“indemnification.”
            In
April 2023, the parties settled.
            On
August 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file an amended
complaint.
DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiff
seeks to amend the operative complaint. The proposed amended complaint adds
allegations about the settlement agreement, which the parties entered almost
two years after plaintiff filed the operative complaint. An amended complaint
is not the proper vehicle to allege new, post-complaint facts to state a new,
post-complaint cause of action that accrued after the complaint was filed. (Foster
v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1032; Flood v. Simpson (1975)
45 Cal.App.3d 644, 647; Code Civ. Proc., § 464, subd. (a).)
CONCLUSION 
The
court denies Plaintiff’s motion.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
