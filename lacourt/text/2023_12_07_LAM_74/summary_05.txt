The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The Plaintiff, The LAAC Corp., had filed a complaint against Mistry Engineering, Inc. and others in June 2021, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and indemnification. The parties settled in April 2023, but the Plaintiff now seeks to add allegations about the settlement agreement to the complaint. The Judge has ruled that an amended complaint is not the proper vehicle to allege new, post-complaint facts to state a new cause of action that accrued after the complaint was filed. The Judge has cited relevant California law and case precedents to support this ruling.
