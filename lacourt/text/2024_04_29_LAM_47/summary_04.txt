And here is the English text summary:

The judge, Judge Theresa M. Traber, issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by the defendants, Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc. The defendants argued that certain allegations in the complaint were irrelevant, false, or improper. The judge granted the motion to strike, finding that the allegations were not relevant to the case and did not comply with the laws of this state. The judge also admonished the plaintiffs' counsel for their failure to properly label their filings and ordered them to do so in the future. The judge noted that the defendants' motion was granted without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs will not be able to add new allegations to the complaint without permission from the court.
