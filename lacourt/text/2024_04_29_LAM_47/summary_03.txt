And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the motion for approval of the settlement agreement between Plaintiff Liset Perez and Defendant Chik Enterprises. The Plaintiff seeks approval of a proposed settlement agreement in which Defendant will pay $191,750 to settle all claims. The Court finds that the proposed settlement is adequate, reasonable, and fair to all those affected by it. However, the Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide a copy of the predicate letter to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) as required by statute. Therefore, the Court orders the Plaintiff to serve and file a revised settlement agreement on or before May 22, 2024. The Court also orders that the Plaintiff provide a copy of the LWDA predicate letter to the Court for review. The hearing is continued to May 29, 2024 at 9:00 AM.
