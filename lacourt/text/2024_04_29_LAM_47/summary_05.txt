Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Cross-Defendants' motion to strike portions of the First Amended Cross-Complaint is granted. The motion seeks to strike certain prayers for relief on the first eight causes of action, including imposition of a constructive trust, disgorgement, and money damages. The judge finds that these prayers appear to be orphans of the dismissed causes of action and are therefore improper. The judge notes that the moving party has satisfied the statutory meet and confer obligations. The judge concludes that the Cross-Defendants' Motion to Strike is granted, and moving parties are to give notice. The judge also notes that any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by the day before the hearing.
