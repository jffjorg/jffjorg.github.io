·        
09/25/23: First Amended Complaint filed.
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for employment discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based
on her race, religion, and national origin, retaliated against her for
complaining about discrimination and for reporting unlawful activity, and
failed to prevent others from discriminating against and harassing her.
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production propounded to Defendant, and for
sanctions.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production propounded to Defendant, and for
sanctions.
 
The parties attended an Informal
Discovery Conference on April 10, 2024, to confer regarding outstanding issues relating
to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories, a psychological examination by
Defendant, a supplemental deposition of Defendant’s expert, and these requests
for production. (April 10, 2024 Minute Order.) The parties could not reach an
agreement on the requests for production. (Id.) The Court therefore
permitted Plaintiff’s counsel to serve and file a motion to compel further
responses to those requests by Friday, April 12, 2024 to be heard on this date.
(Id.) 
 
Defendant filed its opposition on
Tuesday, April 16, 2024, stating that it had produced, on that same date,
supplemental responses with further production of records addressed squarely to
the claimed deficiencies identified in Plaintiff’s motion. (Declaration of
Angela K. Beanum ISO Opp. Exh. F; see also Exh. G [email correspondence
accompanying supplemental production].) Defendant contends that these
supplemental responses moot the motion. As Plaintiff has not replied to this
opposition to assert any objection to the supplemental production or maintain
that sanctions are still warranted, the Court concurs.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is DENIED AS MOOT. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
