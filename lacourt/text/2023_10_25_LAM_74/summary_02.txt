And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel arbitration and related papers. The plaintiff, Kataneh Hamidi, entered into a lease with defendant Harry Bieker, which has an arbitration provision. The plaintiff filed a complaint against Bieker and Adrienne Snyder, who did not sign the lease. The judge has ordered Bieker and the plaintiff to arbitrate certain causes of action related to the lease. However, the judge has not ordered the defamation cause of action against Snyder to arbitration because she is not bound by the arbitration agreement. The judge has stayed proceedings on the intentional interference with prospective economic relationship cause of action against both Bieker and Snyder to avoid inconsistent rulings. The judge has allowed defendants to demur to this cause of action. Defendant Bieker is required to provide notice. The judge's decision is subject to change after considering further arguments and evidence at the hearing on October 25, 2023.
