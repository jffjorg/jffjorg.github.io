  Case Number:  22STCV31615    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  74 Denise
Birtch v. Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, et al.
Defendant Specialized Loan
Servicing, LLC’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
and Request for Sanctions against Plaintiff Denise Birtch
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005 [“All papers opposing a motion […] shall be filed with the court
and a copy served on each party at least nine court days […] before the
hearing.”].) 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over foreclosed real property.
            On
September 28, 2022, Plaintiff Denise Birtch (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (Defendant) and others. The
complaint alleges one cause of action for identity theft.
            On
July 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with form interrogatories.
            Plaintiff
never responded.
            On
August 24, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to compel responses to the form
interrogatories and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
            If
the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed such a motion,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)¿
DISCUSSION
            The court will grant this motion to
compel because Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the form interrogatories
at issue. In addition, sanctions are appropriate. Defendant’s counsel’s hourly
rate is reasonable, and he has substantiated his request for attorney fees with
an hourly breakdown of work performed. (Stoltzman Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) But given
Plaintiff’s lack of timely opposition, the court will adjust the award
accordingly ($1,090 = $350 x (2 hours drafting motion + 1 hour preparing for
and attending hearing) + $40 filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to
the form interrogatories. The court orders Plaintiff to serve without objection
Code Compliant responses to the form interrogatories within 10 days. The court
orders sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of $1,090 payable to Defendant by
November 25, 2023.

against Defendant Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (Defendant) and others. The

DISCUSSION
            The court will grant this motion to
compel because Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the RFPs at issue. In
addition, sanctions are appropriate. Because this motion largely duplicates
Defendant’s counsel’s other motion, the court will adjust the award accordingly
($390 = $350 x (1 hour drafting motion) + $40 filing fee). 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to
the RFPs. The court orders Plaintiff to serve without objection Code Compliant
responses to the RFPs within 10 days. The court orders sanctions against
Plaintiff in the sum of $390 payable to Defendant by November 25, 2023.
Defendant shall give notice.
