 Case Number:  22STCV40001    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  74 Kataneh Hamidi v. Adrienne Synder,
et al.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion. 
Plaintiff
Kataneh Hamidi and defendant Harry Bieker entered into a lease. The lease has
an arbitration provision. (Goergen Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. D ¶ 35(B)). In December
2022, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants Harry Galen Bieker – who
signed the lease – and defendant Adrienne Snyder, who did not sign the lease.  Plaintiff’s first four causes of action
(breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach
of covenant of quiet enjoyment of premises, and wrongful eviction) in her first
amended complaint arise from the lease. Thus, the court severs those four
causes of action and orders plaintiff and Bieker to arbitrate them.
Plaintiff
alleges a fifth cause of action for defamation against defendant Adrienne
Snyder, who did not sign the lease and is not bound by the arbitration
agreement. The court does not order that cause of action to arbitration. The
court does not stay proceedings on the defamation cause of action because the
defamation claim does not pose the risk of inconsistent rulings on a common
issue of law or fact with the arbitrable lease-based causes of action.
Plaintiff
alleges a sixth cause of action for intentional interference with prospective
economic relationship against both defendants Bieker and Snyder. Because the
arbitration agreement does not apply to Snyder, the court does not order that
cause of action to arbitration. To avoid possible inconsistent rulings on a
common issue of law or fact between the sixth cause of action and the first
through fourth lease-based causes of action, the court stays for all purposes
further proceedings on the sixth cause of action except
defendants may demur to the sixth cause of action.
Defendant Bieker shall give notice.
