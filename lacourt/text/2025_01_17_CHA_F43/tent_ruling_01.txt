MOTION TO COMPEL
DEPOSITION OF PLAINTIFF ISABELLE GARCIA
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Ford Motor Company
RESPONDING PARTIES: Plaintiffs Medardo Sosa and
Isabella Garcia
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Order compelling deposition of Plaintiff
Isabelle Garcia and $560.00 in sanctions.
 
RULING: Motion
is granted. The Court awards $560.00 in sanctions.
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On June 22, 2019, Plaintiffs Medardo Sosa and
Isabelle Garcia (Garcia) purchased a 2019 Ford Mustang from Defendant Ford
Motor Company (Ford).  The vehicle began
experiencing several mechanical defects, and Plaintiffs sued Ford for violating
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that Ford and co-defendant
Autonation Ford Valencia were unable to repair the defects and that Ford did
not replace the car or make restitution.
 
On September 18, 2023, Ford served a
deposition notice on Garcia.  The
deposition was scheduled for November 21, 2023. 
Garcia objected to the deposition notice and its requests for
production.  After subsequent meet and
confer attempts, the parties agreed to do the deposition on March 8, 2024.  The day before the deposition, Garcia’s
counsel informed Ford that Garcia would not attend the deposition.
 
Ford filed this motion to compel Garcia’s
deposition on November 12, 2024.  Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on November 27, 2024. 
Ford replied on December 5, 2024.
 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel a deposition must include
either a meet and confer declaration or, “when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, . . . a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (b), 2016.040.)   
 
Ford’s counsel of record, Ravi K. Lally,
states she attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel on three
separate occasions prior to filing this motion. 
(Declaration of Ravi K. Lally, ¶¶ 3-6.)
 
On September 18, 2023, Lally sent opposing
counsel a meet and confer letter requesting dates in December 2023 for Garcia’s
deposition.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 3, Exh.
B.)  Opposing counsel did not respond.  That same day, Lally then served on Garcia a
deposition notice for November 21, 2023, with a request for production of
documents.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. C, at
p. 4.)  On November 16, 2023, opposing
counsel served an objection to the notice stating that Ford had unilaterally
set a date and time on which Garcia was not available.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. D, at p. 2.)  Opposing counsel also objected to the
requests for production on the grounds that the requests were protected by
various privileges, sought irrelevant material, were untimely served, and sought
documents Ford could readily obtain from other sources.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. D, at p. 3.)
 
On November 17, 2023, Lally emailed opposing
counsel requesting dates for Garcia’s deposition.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 4, Exh. E, at p. 1.)  It appears Lally sent this request to an
email account called “EmailServices” rather than directly to opposing
counsel.  (Lally Dec., Exh. E, at p.
1.)  Opposing counsel did not respond.
 
On November 20, 2024, Lally served a second
deposition notice for January 23, 2024. 
(Lally Dec., Exh. F, at p. 6.)
 
After receiving no response to the second
deposition notice, Lally emailed opposing counsel Tyson Smith on January 22,
2024, requesting deposition dates for March 2024.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 5, Exh. G.)  Smith responded on January 25, 2024 with
potential dates, the parties settled on March 8, 2024, and Lally served a third
deposition notice on January 26, 2024.  (Lally
Dec., ¶¶ 5-6, Exh. H, at p. 1, Exh. I, at p. 6.)  On March 5, 2024, Garcia served objections to
the requests for production in the third deposition notice.  (Lally Dec., Exh. J.)
 
On March 7, 2024, opposing counsel Rabiya
Tirmizi emailed Lally stating that because “we have no agreed PMK deposition
date, no discovery, and the trial date is a year out (March 17, 2025), we will
need to reschedule tomorrow’s Plaintiffs depositions.”  (Lally Dec., Exh. K.)  After Garcia did not appear at the March 8th
deposition, Lally emailed opposing counsel Smith on May 1, 2024 to seek
alternative deposition dates.  (Lally
Dec., Exhs. L, M.)  No response was
received from Plaintiffs.  (Lally Dec.,
¶8.)
 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS
Ford argues the Court should compel Garcia’s
deposition because Ford has served four timely notices of deposition on Garcia
since September 2023.  Garcia’s refusal
to comply has obstructed Ford’s ability to complete essential discovery.  Garcia refuses to provide alternative
deposition dates and failed to appear and meaningfully reply to Ford’s
requests.  Garcia also waited until the day
before the March 8, 2024 deposition to inform Ford of her refusal to appear as
agreed. Such dilatory tactics are misuses of the discovery process which have
delayed Ford’s trial preparation.  The
Court should award sanctions for Garcia’s nonappearance at the deposition. 
 
Plaintiffs oppose arguing that Ford has
demanded discovery while refusing to cooperate. 
Ford has not met and conferred in good faith or inquired about Garcia’s
nonappearance at the deposition.  This
motion was unnecessary because Garcia was always willing to be deposed.  Ford has made no efforts to meet and confer
or contact Garcia since May 1, 2024. 
Ford waited until shortly before the filing deadline to file this
motion.  Prior to filing this motion,
Ford did not provide a date to depose its Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK)
despite Plaintiffs’ requests and efforts to schedule depositions.  Plaintiffs are currently working to provide
Ford with available deposition dates between now and January 31, 2025.  Further, Ford has not provided Plaintiffs
with the documentation needed to prepare Plaintiffs for depositions.  The Court should not award sanctions.
 
Ford replies that it presented sufficient
evidence—its four noticed depositions—of attempting to meet and confer with
opposing counsel.  Further, a meet and
confer is not required where a party fails to attend a deposition or to produce
documents.  Plaintiffs do not provide
legal support for Garcia’s nonappearance at the March 8th deposition or for the
late cancellation.  Plaintiffs withhold
alternative dates for Garcia’s deposition because Ford did not provide a date
for its corporative representative’s deposition, but no legal authority
supports this argument.  Sanctions are
proper.
 
ANALYSIS
An oral deposition shall be scheduled for a
date at least 10 days after service of the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd.
(a).)  A properly served deposition
notice is effective to require a party or party-affiliated deponent to attend
and to testify, as well as to produce documents for inspection and copying.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party . . . without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document .
. . described in the deposition notice, the party giving notice may move for an
order compelling deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production . . .
of any document . . . described in the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)¿ The motion must set forth both facts showing good cause
justifying the demand for any documents and a meet and confer declaration.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (b)(1), (b)(2).)¿ 
 
A motion to compel production of documents
described in a deposition notice must attach declarations with facts showing
“good cause” for inspecting the requested documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, (b)(1).)  “Good cause” exists where the specific facts
show the documents are necessary for the demanding party to prepare for trial
and to prevent surprise.  (See Associated
Brewers Distributing Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 587.)
 
As with Ford’s previous motion to compel
plaintiff Sosa’s deposition, neither party’s moving papers or supporting
declarations address the issue of “good cause,” or lack thereof, for the
requested documents. 
 
Ford properly noticed Garcia of the
depositions at least ten days before the deposition dates.  Ford noticed Garcia on September 18, 2023 for
a November 21, 2023 deposition.  Ford
noticed Garcia on November 20, 2023 for a January 23, 2024 deposition.  Garcia’s counsel objected to these dates and
Ford’s requests for production, and did not provide alternative dates until
January 2024.  Ford noticed Garcia on
January 26, 2024 for a deposition on the agreed upon date of March 8,
2024.  On March 7, 2024, Plaintiffs
unilaterally decided Garcia would not attend the March 8th deposition until
Ford scheduled Plaintiffs’ PMK deposition with Ford’s corporate
representative.  Garcia did not attend
the March 8th.  When Ford asked
Plaintiffs for alternative dates, Plaintiffs did not respond.
 
Plaintiffs argue Ford refused to cooperate
and resolve this dispute informally, but the moving papers show that between
September 2023 and May 2024, Ford attempted to set alternative deposition dates
at Plaintiffs’ convenience.  Plaintiffs state
no legal basis for Garcia’s refusal to appear at the March 8th deposition or to
provide alternative dates.  A party may
not withhold discovery responses or refuse to attend a deposition in order to
force the opposing party to comply with its own deposition requests.  If Plaintiffs wish to compel Ford to set a
deposition date for its PMK, Plaintiffs should file a motion seeking a court
order to do so.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant Ford
Motor Company’s motion to compel Plaintiff Isabelle Garcia’s deposition and
production of documents.
 
Sanctions
Ford requests $560.00 in monetary sanctions
against plaintiff Isabelle Garcia and her attorney of record.  (Lally Dec., ¶ 9.)  This amount covers the time spent preparing
this motion and a $60.00 filing fee.  Plaintiffs
do not oppose.
 
The court may impose sanctions against a
“party-affiliated” deponent who fails to appear or produce the request
materials requested in the deposition notice. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subds. (a), (g)(1), 2025.480, subd.
(j).)  The court must impose monetary
sanctions “against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust” or the prevailing party failed to make reasonable
efforts to resolve the issues.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (g)(1), 2023.030, subd. (a).)   
 
The Court finds the requested sanctions are
reasonable.
 
Accordingly, the Court awards Defendant Ford
Motor Company $560.00 in monetary sanctions.
 
ORDER
Defendant Ford Motor Company’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Isabelle Garcia’s deposition and production of documents is granted.
 
1.  Plaintiff Isabelle
Garcia is ordered to appear for a deposition on a mutually agreed upon date
within 21 days of the date of this order.
 
2. 
Plaintiff Isabelle Garcia and her counsel of record are ordered to pay Defendant
Ford Motor Company sanctions in the total amount of $560.00.  Plaintiff Isabelle Garcia and her counsel are

twenty (20) days of the date of this order.
 
Defendant Ford Motor Company to give notice.
