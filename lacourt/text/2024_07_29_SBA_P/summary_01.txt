And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The demurrer challenges the third and fourth causes of action, alleging that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court finds that the FAC lacks sufficient facts to establish premises liability, as it is unclear how Rexford possessed, managed, or controlled the premises. Additionally, the FAC fails to show that Rexford failed to exercise due diligence in its hiring, retaining, or supervising practices, making it unclear how Rexford could be held liable. The Court sustains the demurrer and grants the Plaintiff 20 days leave to amend.
