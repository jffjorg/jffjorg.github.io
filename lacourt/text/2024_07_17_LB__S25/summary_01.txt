And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' arguments and evidence presented in this case, including the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, breached its warranty obligations and failed to properly repair a 2022 Mercedes-Benz Metris. The defendant has moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the RISC contains an arbitration provision that requires the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration.

The court has considered the applicable laws and cases, including the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, California Code of Civil Procedure, section 1281.2, and the FAA. The court has also considered the parties' arguments and evidence, including the RISC and the FAA.

After careful consideration, the court finds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable to this matter. The court also finds that the defendant has not demonstrated that it is a third-party beneficiary covered by the arbitration provisions in the RISC.

Therefore, the court denies the defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration.
