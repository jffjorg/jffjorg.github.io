And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant, XMJ Fashion, Inc. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., filed the complaint alleging a breach of promissory note, and the defendant failed to timely answer. The plaintiff submitted a declaration and supporting documents, but the Judge found that the plaintiff did not comply with all the requirements for a default judgment. Specifically, the Judge noted that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient information to support its request for attorneys' fees. As a result, the Judge denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the request with the required information.
