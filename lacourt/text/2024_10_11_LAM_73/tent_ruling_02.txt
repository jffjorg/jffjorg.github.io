Plaintiff
submitted the declaration of Humberto Matz, the Vice
President of Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Matz Decl., ¶ 1.) Matz provided a summary of the case and attached the
executed promissory note between the parties reflecting the terms and
conditions of the agreement. (Matz Decl., ¶¶
4-7, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff also submitted the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Eric
Jun, stating that Plaintiff calculated the prejudgment interest at 10% per
annum from January 4, 2024 to August 27, 2024. (Jun Decl., ¶ 4.) Thus,
Plaintiff claims $53,382.06 in total accrued interest. 
 
However,
while Mr. Jun requests an award of attorneys fees in the amount of $11,037.83,
it is unclear how Plaintiff calculated this amount. (Jun
Decl., ¶ 5.) It is unclear if Plaintiff is requesting attorney fees pursuant to
Local Rule 3.214 or California Code Section 1717. If Plaintiff is seeking an
award of reasonable attorney fees under California Code Section 1717, Plaintiff
must provide more information in order for the Court to determine the
reasonableness of the fees. Mr. Jun states his hourly rate is $500.00. (Jun Decl., ¶ 5.) However, he does not provide any basis for
the reasonableness of his rate, he does not include the amount of hours he
expended on this case, or submit billing or any other evidence of his claimed
hours. Thus, the Court does not find Plaintiff has provided adequate support
regarding its request for attorney fees. 
 
Since
Plaintiff has not complied with all the requirements, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
