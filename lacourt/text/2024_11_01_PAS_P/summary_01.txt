* "The Court finds that Plaintiffs conflate Grandtag's role as manager of GT Madison and Grandtag's own business activities."
* "The fact that Grandtag holds a managerial position in GT Madison does not imply that Grandtag, a Hong Kong-based company, has itself established systematic contacts within California."
* "Grandtag's use of California's creditor process and speculating that Rene Leung may maintain a bank account in California for Grandtag falls short of establishing that Grandtag purposefully availed itself of the forum's benefits."
