  Case Number:  22STCV13261    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  26 Background
 
On April 20, 2022, Plaintiffs Total Management Services America,
Inc., Global Data Innovators, Inc., Takako Shimakage, and Mayo Ono
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant declaratory relief action against
Defendants E-Shop Labo LLC (“E-Shop”), Miwa Tamura (“Tamura”), and Keisuke
Shimada (“Shimada”)(collectively “Defendants”). 
On April 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants.  The FAC asserts six causes
of action for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Intentional
Misrepresentation, (4) Promissory Estoppel, (5) Quantum Meruit, and (6)
Declaratory Relief. 
Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Total Management Services
America, Inc. (“Total”) filed the present motion against Defendant E-Shop on
November 17, 2023. No opposition has been filed, but no proof of service
accompanies the motion. 
Legal
Standard  
“Any party may
obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the action written
interrogatories to be answered under oath.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a propounding party is not
satisfied with the response served by a responding party, the former may move
the court to compel further interrogatory responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
Discussion 
This court on October 24, 2023, granted Plaintiff Total’s
prior motion to compel further as to Form Interrogatories No. 15.1 and 50.1,
among others, from Defendant Keisuke Shimada, reasoning that greater
specificity was required for Defendant E-Shop’s identification of responsive
documents, including Bates page numbers. (See 10/24/2023 Order.)
Plaintiff here seeks to compel further responses to the same interrogatories
from Defendant E-Shop, reasoning that E-Shop’s responses are essentially
identical to those already found deficient for Shimada. (Motion at pp. 6–7.)
Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $2,700.00 against Defendant’s
counsel, representing six hours of attorney work at $450 per hour. (Motion at
pp. 7–8.)
There is merit to Plaintiff’s argument. Similar responses
have already been found inadequate by prior order of this court. “Answers must
be complete and responsive. Thus, it is not proper to answer by stating, ‘See
my deposition’, ‘See my pleading’, or ‘See the financial statement’. Indeed, if
a question does require the responding party to make reference to a pleading or
document, the pleading or document should be identified and summarized so the answer
is fully responsive to the question.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784.) 
However, it is doubtful whether the present motion was
served. The motion is unopposed, but no proof of service accompanies the motion
or has since been filed with the court. “Proof of service of the moving papers
must be filed no later than five court days before the time appointed for the
hearing.” (CRC Rule 3.1300, subd. (c).) 
CONCLUSIONS
AND ORDER 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further is DENIED for lack of
service.
