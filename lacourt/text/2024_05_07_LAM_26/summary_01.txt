And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by the court in response to a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories from Defendant E-Shop Labo LLC. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Total Management Services America, Inc. on November 17, 2023, but no proof of service accompanies the motion. The court grants the motion, but only because it was not properly served. The court notes that similar responses to interrogatories have been deemed inadequate in the past, and that the responses from Defendant E-Shop were essentially identical to those previously found deficient. The court also notes that the motion was unopposed, but that the lack of proof of service renders the motion incomplete.
