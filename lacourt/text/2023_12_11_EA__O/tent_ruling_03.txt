WALMART
STORES, INC.’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF PROCESS is DENIED.
 
Background
 
This is a
negligence case. 
 
On June 13,
2023, Plaintiff Emilia Moreno filed suit against Defendants Walmart, Inc.
(“Walmart”) and Julio Panduro (“Panduro”) for general negligence.[1]
 
On August 30,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of Summons (POS) indicating that
Walmart was served at its 1275 N. Azusa Avenue Covina, CA 91722 store via
substituted service on 8/23/2023 by serving “Vanessa A. - assistant manager.”
That same day, another POS was filed indicating that a registered process
server served Walmart at CT Corporation Systems 330 North Brand Boulevard,
Suite 700 Glendale, CA 91203 on 8/24/23 by serving “Sarai Marin - Intake
specialist for CT Corporation Systems, agent for service of process.” 
 
On September
25, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion.
 
On November
27, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition.
 
As of 12/5 at
10 AM, no reply has been received (due 5 court days before hearing [12/4])
 
Legal
Standard
 
Defendants
brings forth the motion on two grounds: (1) pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure (CCP) section 418.10 on the grounds that the summons and
complaint were not properly served and (2) in that Plaintiff’s Service of
Process was not compliant with the statutory authority under California Rules
of Court (CRC), Rule 3.110(b). (Notice of Motion p. 2:2-5.)
 
In turn, “[a]
defendant, on or before the last
day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may
for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of
the following purposes: (1)
To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over him or her.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10 subd.,
(a).)[2]
 
“In the
absence of a voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance
with the statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that
court’s personal jurisdiction over a defendant. When a defendant challenges
that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff
to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts
requisite to an effective service.” (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426.)
 
As for CRC
Rule 3.110(b), it requires a Plaintiff serve all Defendants with proper summons
and complaint (service of process) and file it with the court within 60 days of
filing the complaint. 
 
Discussion
 
The issue presented on this
motion is whether service is improper if a plaintiff fails to file proof of
service of the summons and complaint within 60 days of filing the complaint. 
 
For reasons to be discussed below, the court denies Defendant’s
motion.[3]

 
First,
according to Defendant’s own citation, “summons must comply substantially
with statutory requirements in order for service of summons to constitute
effective service.” (Motion p. 3 (emphasis added), citing MJS Enterprises, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 555, 557.) “It is axiomatic that strict compliance with the code's
provisions for service of process is not required.” (Ramos v.
Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1442,
emphasis added.) For example, substantial compliance occurs when the person to be served in fact
actually received the summons (i.e., authorized person was received but
plaintiff merely did not mail one of the persons to be served. (Id. at
p. 1443.) 
 
Here, despite the reason stated in the notice and a header in the
motion, there is no discussion
nor analysis that the motion is brought on the grounds of purported improper
service (i.e., presumably that service was not made in compliance with section 416.10, which governs service upon
corporations). (See also Opp. p. Motion p. 2 [“The sole apparent
basis for the present motion to quash is failure to comply with Rules of Court,
Rule 3.110(b). The moving papers fail to address any inadequacy of the method of
service.”].) For example, there is no
argument that the summons and complaint was received by an unknown employee of the corporation who is not a
person specified in section 416.10 (id. at pp. 1443) or there is no argument that an improper
person (e.g., someone aside from agent for service of
process or the president, chief executive officer, or other head of the
corporation) was served. Therefore, as Defendant is not disputing actual
receipt of the summons, service was in substantial compliance with the
statutory scheme. 
 
Second, to the extent that Defendant appears to argue that the CRC
are statutes, it has offered no analysis. To the contrary, the rules adopted by the
Judicial Council are promulgated under constitutional authority. (Helbush v.
Helbush (1930) 209 al.758, 763.) The CRC are adopted by the Judicial
Council of California under constitutional authority. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule
1.3 [Authority].) Therefore, as CRC are not statutes, that renders the service
in complete compliance with the statutory scheme for service of summons
and complaint. 
 
Third, even if Plaintiff did not comply with the CRC by failing to file
the POS within 60 days of filing the complaint, Defendant has not provided any authority that a court
must grant a motion to quash based on said grounds. (See also Opp. p. 4:11-14.)
In fact, as noted by Plaintiff in opposition, CCP section 583.420 provides for
discretionary dismissal if service is not effected within two years. Thus, to
dismiss the case by means of a failure to quash for a plaintiff’s failure to
file within 60 days does not comport with the prescribed statutory mechanism.
Even then, the two-year dismissal is discretionary (unlike the CCP section
583.210’s mandated dismissal where service is not effected within three
years of the filing of the lawsuit). 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s service of Process upon Defendant Walmart on August 24, 2023 is
deemed effective. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion to quash service of process from Plaintiff is DENIED.
