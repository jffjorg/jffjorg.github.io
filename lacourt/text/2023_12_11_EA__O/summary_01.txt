```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the City of El Monte's application for default judgment without prejudice. The court is unclear whether the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) is a viable cause of action with the facts presented. The judge notes that damages are not recoverable under the UCL, and that the only remedies available are injunctive relief and restitution. The judge also states that restitution is limited to either "money or property that defendants took directly from plaintiff" or "money or property in which plaintiff has a vested interest." The court allows the plaintiff to file a supplemental brief at least 10 court days before the hearing if they wish to argue that the UCL is a viable cause of action.
