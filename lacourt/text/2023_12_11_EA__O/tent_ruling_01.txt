  Case Number:  20PSCV00381    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
The City
of El Monte’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice. Should
UCL be a viable COA with such facts, the court will allow Plaintiff to
file a supplemental brief at least 10 court days before the hearing. 
 
Background
 
This is a
nuisance action. Plaintiff City of El Monte (“Plaintiff”) alleges the following
against Defendants CHUN C. Li and ALICE LI (Li Defendants): In 2019, the city
police executed a search warrant and seized marijuana. On that basis, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants engaged in illegal commercial marijuana activities at
the property.[1]

 
On June 9,
2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint for the ABATEMENT, INJUNCTION, EQUITABLE
RELIEF, AND CIVIL PENALTIES. 
 
On December
31, 2020, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint naming Shi Chang Chen as
Doe 1. 
 
On May 12,
2021, Li Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Chen, who was the tenant on
the property. 
 
On April 27,
2023, Plaintiff dismissed the Li Defendants. 
 
On May 26,
2023, default was entered against Chen.[2]
 
On July 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment. 
 
On July 14,
2023, the court denied the default judgment application without prejudice. 
 
On November
3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant application. 
 
Plaintiff has addressed and cured some of the court’s
previous defects. However,
whether damages under the 4th COA for Unfair Competition Law (UCL) are
recoverable remains unclear. 
To state a cause of action under Business & Professions
Code § 17200, a plaintiff must allege (1) a business practice, (2) that is
unfair, unlawful or fraudulent; and (3) an authorized remedy. 
As explained by the California Supreme Court in Korea
Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134: 
 
An action under the UCL is not an all-purpose
substitute for a tort or contract action.’ [citation omitted]. Instead, the act
provides an equitable means through which both public prosecutors and private
individuals can bring suit to prevent unfair business practices and restore
money or property to victims of these practices. As we have said, the
‘overarching legislative concern [was] to provide a streamlined procedure for
the prevention of ongoing or threatened acts of unfair
competition.’ [Citation omitted]. Because of this objective, the remedies
provided are limited. While any member of the public can bring suit under
the act to enjoin a business from engaging in unfair competition, it is well
established that individuals may not recover damages.’ [Citation].
 
(Id. at p. 1150) (emphasis added). 
 
Injunctive relief and restitution are the only remedies available
under the UCL; damages cannot be recovered. (See Korea Supply Co.,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1144 [“While the scope of conduct covered by the UCL is
broad, its remedies are limited. [Citation omitted]. A UCL
action is equitable in nature; damages cannot be recovered.”]); see also Bank
of the West v. Sup. Ct. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1266 [Damages are not
available under section 17203, which incorporates the broad, statutory
definition of unfair competition. “The only nonpunitive monetary relief available under the
Unfair Business Practices Act is the disgorgement of money that has been wrongfully obtained or,
in the language of the statute, an order ‘[r]estor[ing] ... money ... which may have been acquired
by means of ... unfair competition.’”]; see also Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.App.4th 163, 179 [Under the UCL, prevailing plaintiffs “are generally
limited to injunctive relief and restitution.”].) 
 
As clearly stated by the Korea
Supply court, restitution is limited to either “money or property that
defendants took directly from plaintiff” or “money or property in which
[plaintiff] has a vested interest.” (Korea Supply, supra, 29 Cal.4th at
pp. 1146-47.) For example, disgorgement of profits exist in circumstances
wherein a defendant is ordered to disgorge the rents collected on
properties owned by a plaintiff (see e.g., People ex rel. Harris v.
Aguayo (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 1150) or wherein an employer is ordered to restore
unpaid wages to its employees and former employees because once earned, those
unpaid wages became property to which the employees were entitled (Cortez
v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163). 
 
Here, Plaintiff has not alleged nor
is arguing that Defendants wrongfully took marijuana that belonged to
the City such that disgorgement from the sale of that marijuana would be
permissible. Rather, it is an amount based upon statutory penalties. When statutory remedies are
adequate, equitable relief under the UCL is precluded. (Prudential
Home Mortgage Co. Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1249.)

 
In short, it isn’t apparent from the pleadings whether UCL is
even a viable COA with such facts. 
 
Therefore, damages under the UCL are precluded. 
 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the application is again denied without prejudice. Should UCL be a
viable COA with such facts, the court will allow Plaintiff to file a supplemental brief
at least 10 court days before the hearing.
