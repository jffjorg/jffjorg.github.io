And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Walmart's motion to quash service of process. The motion was filed by Walmart, Inc. and Julio Panduro, who argue that the service of process was not proper. The Judge denies the motion, finding that the service was in substantial compliance with the statutory scheme. The Judge notes that strict compliance with the code's provisions for service of process is not required, and that substantial compliance occurs when the person to be served in fact actually receives the summons. The Judge also finds that the rules of court are not statutes and therefore do not need to be complied with. The Judge concludes that the service of process upon Walmart on August 24, 2023 is deemed effective.
