And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the motion to disqualify counsel, David Welch, from representing the plaintiff, Bespoke Funding 2021A LLC. The defendants, Grupo Flor Corporation, et al., sought to disqualify Welch due to his alleged conflicts of interest, including his previous service as de facto legal counsel for Grupo Flor and his receipt of confidential financial information for the company. However, the court found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that Welch's previous representation of clients adverse to Grupo Flor was substantially related to the current litigation. The court also noted that Welch represented clients on the opposite side of the table from Grupo Flor, which further reduced the likelihood of any conflict of interest.
