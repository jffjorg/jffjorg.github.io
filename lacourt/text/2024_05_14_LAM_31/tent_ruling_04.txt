MOTION
TO COMPEL ARBITRATION
      


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
            On June 21, 2023, Plaintiff
Suzanne A. Lee filed this Song-Beverly action against Defendant American Honda
Motor Co., Inc., arising out of the leasing of an allegedly defective 2022
Honda Civic.  The lease agreement is
signed by the dealership, Ocean Honda of North Hollywood, and Plaintiff.  The agreement has an arbitration clause.
            On July 5, 2023, Plaintiff
served Defendant with the Summons and Complaint.
            On August 3, 2023,
Defendant filed its Answer to the Complaint.    
            On November 28, 2023,
Defendants filed a Case Management Statement indicating it would file a motion
to compel arbitration.
On December 14, 2023, Defendant filed this Motion
to Compel Arbitration.  
            No opposition has been
filed.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
            Under both the Federal
Arbitration Act and California law, arbitration agreements are valid,
irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such grounds that exist at law or
equity for voiding a contract.  (Winter
v. Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)  The party moving to compel arbitration must
establish the existence of a written arbitration agreement between the parties.
 (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.)  In ruling on a motion to compel arbitration,
the court must first determine whether the parties actually agreed to arbitrate
the dispute, and general principles of California contract law help guide the
court in making this determination. (Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire Health Care
Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 534, 541.)¿ 
            Once petitioners
allege that an arbitration agreement exists, the burden shifts to respondents
to prove the falsity of the purported agreement, and no evidence or
authentication is required to find the arbitration agreement exists.  (See Condee v. Longwood Mgt. Corp. (2001)
88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.) However, if the existence of the agreement is
challenged, “petitioner bears the burden of proving [the arbitration
agreement's] existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v.
Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413; see also Espejo
v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
1047, 1058-1060.)¿¿¿ 
            “With respect to the moving
party's burden to provide evidence of the¿existence¿of an agreement to
arbitrate, it is generally sufficient for that party to present a copy of the
contract to the court.” (Condee, supra, 88 Cal.App.4th at p. 218;
see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330 [“A petition to compel arbitration or
to stay proceedings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.2 and
1281.4 must state, in addition to other required allegations, the provisions of
the written agreement and the paragraph that provides for arbitration. The
provisions must be stated verbatim or a copy must be physically or
electronically attached to the petition and incorporated by reference”].) Once
such a document is presented to the court, the burden shifts to the party
opposing the motion to compel, who may present any challenges to the
enforcement of the agreement and evidence in support of those challenges.
[Citation]” (Baker v. Italian Maple Holdings, LLC¿(2017) 13 Cal.App.5th
1152, 1160.)¿ 
III.       DISSCUSSION
            Defendant moves to compel
Plaintiff’s claims to arbitration.  Here,
the lease agreement contains an arbitration provision.   In
part, the arbitration provision provides as follows: 
1.     
Either you or we may choose to have any dispute between
us decided in arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.
2.     
If a dispute is arbitrated, you will give up your right
to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you
may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any
consolidation of individual arbitrations.
3.     
Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are
generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we
would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
Further, the arbitration provision applies to “any
claim or dispute, … between you and us or our parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, employees, officers, agents, representative, predecessors,
successors or assigns … (ncluding any such relationship with third parties who
do not sign this Lease) ….”  (See Zandi
Decl., Exh. A, § 26.) 
 
            The court finds that
Defendant has met its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement that covers Plaintiff’s claims with third parties such as Defendant.¿  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  As such, Plaintiff fails to present any evidence
or argument in support of a defense to this motion.
IV.       CONCLUSION 
            The unopposed Motion to Compel
Arbitration is GRANTED.¿ The action is stayed pending completion of
binding arbitration. 
            The court sets a Status Conference
re: Arbitration for November 14, 2024, at 9:00 am.  
            Defendant to give notice.
Dated:   May 14, 2024
