PETITION
TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioners
Grandma Investments, LTD, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On January 24, 2024, Petitioners, Grandma Investments, Ltd.,
Aloha Finance, Ltd., Bolt Ventures Ltd., FCA Capital Ltd., and Rocio Trading
Corporation, filed a Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award against Respondent,
RT Features U.S., LLC (“RT Features”).  The
Petition is redacted.
 
            On January
25, 2024, Petitioners filed a Motion to File Portions of Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award Under Seal.  The court
granted the unopposed motion on April 11, 2024. 
 
            On April 15,
2024, Petitioners served Respondent with Notice of Hearing for the Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award.
 
            Petitioners
now move for an order confirming the contractual arbitration award issued by
arbitrator, the Honorable Marc Marmaro (Ret.) (“Arbitrator Marmaro”) against
Respondent. 
 
The Petition is unopposed. 
  
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Once
arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when
confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”¿ (O’Hare v. Municipal
Resource Consultants (2003) 107¿Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)¿ Any of the parties
may file a petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct
and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc.,¿§§¿1285, 1286; EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood,¿Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)¿“It is well settled that
the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California
Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)¿ “Neither
the trial court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the
dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor
may we correct or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual
error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”¿ (EHM Productions, supra,
at p. 1063-64.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Petitioners seek an order confirming the arbitration award issued
on December 4, 2023, and as modified on January 8, 2024. 
 
An arbitrator’s award is enforceable only after being confirmed
by a court of law. (O’Hare, 107 Cal.App.4th at p. 278.)¿ “An award that
has not been confirmed or vacated has the same force and effect as a contract
in writing between the parties to the arbitration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
1287.6.)¿ Thus, the court must first evaluate and confirm the initial
arbitration award.¿¿        
A.   
Filing
Requirements (CCP § 1285.4)¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition
under this chapter shall:¿ 
¿ 

Set forth the substance of or
     have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner
     denies the existence of such an agreement.¿ 


Set forth the names of the
     arbitrators.¿ 


Set forth or have attached a
     copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if
     any.”¿ 

¿ 
Here, Petitioners submit the written Final Award and
modification to the Final Award issued by Arbitrator Marmaro. (Redacted Pet., Attachment
8(c).)  Petitioners also submit a copy of the arbitration agreement
between the parties.  (Redacted Pet., Attachment 4(b).)  Petitioners have satisfied the filing
requirements.¿ 
 
However, the court notes that Petitioners seek to confirm a
Final Award amount that is not consistent with the modification to the Final
Award.  For this reason, and as noted
elsewhere in this ruling, the court cannot confirm the Petition.
¿¿¿ 
B.    
Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party
to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided
in the agreement.”¿ In addition, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§
1288, 1288.4.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Here, Petitioners indicate at Attachment 9 of the Petition
that the Final Award was served on December 4, 2023, and the modification to
the Final Award was served on January 8, 2024.  (See Redacted Pet., Attachment
9.)¿ However, there are no documents showing the date or manner of
service.  Accordingly, the court cannot determine
whether the Final Award and modifications to the Final Award were served on
Respondent, and further, whether this Petition is timely.¿ 
¿ 
C.    
Service of
the Petition, and Notice of Hearing (CCP § 1290.4)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, the statute
governing proper service of this motion states, in pertinent part:¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time
and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition
is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement
for the service of such petition and notice.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner
in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be
made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been
served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State
shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an
action.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Here, Petitioners served Respondent with a copy of this
Petition and notice of Petition on April 15, 2024 by personal service. 
Petitioners demonstrate that the Petition was properly served.¿¿ However,
as discussed above, defects in the Petition and the lack of proof of service of
the Final Award and modification to the Final Award prevent the court from
confirming the Petition at this time.
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the Petition is CONTINUED to June 24, 2024. 
Petitioners are ordered to submit an amended Petition consistent with
the modified Final Award and proof of service of the Final Award and
modification of the Final Award by Arbitrator Marmaro.  Petitioners are further ordered to submit a
proposed judgment.
 
            Moving
party to give notice.  
                                                                                                            
DATED: May 13, 2024
