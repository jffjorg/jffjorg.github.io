And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision made by Judge Kerry Bensinger regarding a petition to confirm an arbitration award. The case involves Grandma Investments, LTD, et al. (Petitioners) and RT Features U.S., LLC (Respondent). The Petitioners seek an order confirming the arbitration award issued on December 4, 2023, and as modified on January 8, 2024. The Judge notes that the Petition is unopposed and that the Petitioners have satisfied the filing requirements. However, the court cannot confirm the Petition due to defects in the Petition and the lack of proof of service of the Final Award and modification to the Final Award. The Judge orders the Petition to be continued to June 24, 2024, and requires the Petitioners to submit an amended Petition consistent with the modified Final Award and proof of service of the Final Award and modification of the Final Award.
