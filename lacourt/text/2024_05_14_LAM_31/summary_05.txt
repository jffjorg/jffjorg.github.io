```

And here is the summary text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger's tentative ruling states that the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default is moot because the filing and service of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) opened the default entered on November 30, 2023. The Judge concludes that the FAC constitutes a matter of substance, and therefore, the Defendant must either obtain a stipulation to set aside default or file another motion to set aside the default entered on April 30, 2024.
