And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this case, the court has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The defendants had filed a demurrer and motion to strike the complaint, which is set to be heard on June 25, 2024. The court finds that the case is not yet at issue and that the defendants need time to conduct discovery and file any dispositive motions. The court has continued the trial date to July 7, 2025, and has also continued all deadlines and discovery cut-offs to that date. The moving party is required to give notice of the new trial date."
