The court's tentative ruling is that CCP § 1290.6 is inapposite to the case at hand, as it concerns the timeliness of responses to a Petition to Confirm, not the timeliness of a Petition to Vacate. The court also declines to opine on the reasoning or legal error of Arbitrator Claiborne's decision. The case is scheduled for further hearing, with the court's final ruling to be issued at that time.
