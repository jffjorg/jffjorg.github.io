MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Ann Turkel
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff, Alathel Real Estate
Investments, LLC, filed this breach of contract action against Defendant, Ann
Turkel, alleging Defendant failed to pay monthly lease payments for Plaintiff’s
premises located at 10550 Wilshire Blvd, #1004, Los Angeles, CA 90024.  The Complaint seeks to recover $48,000 in
damages, plus interest, attorney’s fees and costs.
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with the
summons and complaint by personal service. 
 
On November 30, 2023, the clerk of the court entered default
against Defendant. 
 
On February 5, 2024, Defendant filed this Motion to Set Aside
Default on the Complaint.  The hearing
for the motion was scheduled for May 14, 2024.
 
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (FAC).  The FAC seeks
to recover $184,500 in damages, plus interest, attorney’s fees, and costs.
 
On March 24, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with the
Summons and FAC by personal service.
 
On April 30, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against Defendant on the FAC.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside
Default is MOOT.  “”It is settled by a
long line of decisions that where, after the default of a defendant has been
entered, a complaint is amended in matter of substance as distinguished from
mere matter of form, the amendment opens the default, and unless the amended
pleading be served on the defaulting defendant, no judgment can properly be
entered on the default. [Citations.] The reason for this rule is plain. A
defendant is entitled to an opportunity to be heard upon the allegations of the
complaint on which judgment is sought against him. His default on the original
complaint is limited in its effect to that complaint, and if by amendment a
matter of substance is added, he should be given the opportunity to contest the
same before any judgment is given against him on account thereof. The law,
therefore, requires that the amended pleading shall be served on all the
adverse parties, including defaulting defendants.” (Cole v. Roebling
Construction Co. (1909) 156 Cal. 443, 446, 105 P. 255.)”  (Ostling v. Loring (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 1731, 1743.)
 
Here, the filing and service of the FAC opened the default
entered on November 30, 2023, against Defendant.  However, after Defendant did not file a
responsive pleading to the FAC, default was again entered against Defendant on
the FAC.  Therefore, because Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default targets the entry of default on November 30, 2023,
the Motion is MOOT.  Defendant must
either obtain a stipulation to set aside default or file another motion to set
aside the default entered on April 30, 2024.
 
The motion is taken off calendar.
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.
