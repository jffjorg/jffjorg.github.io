MOTION
TO CONTINUE TRIAL



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Defendants
Wai Chi Fang and Tusey Yuh Huang 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiffs
Richard Hernandez, Greg Hernadez, Daniel Hernandez, and Eric Hernandez
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiffs Richard Hernandez, Greg Hernadez, Daniel
Hernandez, and Eric Hernandez are tenants of the residential property located
at 122 N. Lincoln Avenue, Unit M, Monterey Park, California, 91755 (the
“Subject Property”).  Defendants Wai Chi
Fang and Tusey Yuh Huang own and operate the Subject Property.  On January 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
Complaint against Defendants alleging various habitability violations at the
Subject Property.  
 
On February 19, 2024, Plaintiffs served Defendants with the
Summons and Complaint.  Defendants filed
a Demurrer and Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint on March 26, 2024, which
are set to be heard on June 25, 2024.  
 
             On April 9, 2024, Defendants filed this Motion
to Continue Trial.  Defendants seek an
order continuing the trial date of September 16, 2024 to March 17, 2025, or as
soon thereafter, and to set all statutory deadlines to the new trial date.
 
            Plaintiffs
filed an opposition.  Defendants replied.
 
This is the first request for a trial continuance in this
matter.
 
II.           LEGAL STANDARD FOR MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(b) outlines that “a party seeking a continuance of the date set for
trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must
make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte
application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting
declarations.  The party must make the motion or application as soon as
reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.” 
Under California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332(c), the court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  Circumstances that may indicate good cause
include “a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents,
or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.”  The court should
consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as
proximity of the trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether
all parties have stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of
justice are served.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants argue
good cause exists to continue the trial date because the case is not yet at
issue.  As Defendants explain, they only
recently appeared in this action by filing a Demurrer and Motion to Strike on
March 26, 2024.  The Demurrer and Motion
to Strike are set for hearing on June 25, 2024. 
As such, Defendants seek a trial continuance to allow Defendants to
conduct discovery, file a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication, and
have that motion heard before trial.  
 
            Plaintiffs
oppose a continuance because this case was filed on January 13, 2023 and trial
has been set for almost a year.  The
argument lacks merit.  Plaintiffs served
Defendants with the Summons and Complaint on February 19, 2024—which is less
than three months ago.
 
            Based on
the foregoing, a trial continuance is warranted.  Given that Defendants recently appeared in
this matter and their Demurrer and Motion to Strike are pending, the case is
not yet at issue.  Defendants are
entitled to conduct discovery and, if they so choose, to file a dispositive
motion with sufficient time to be heard before trial.  Further, there have been no other continuances
of the trial date.  For these reasons,
the court finds good cause exists to continue the trial date.         
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion is GRANTED.  The Final Status Conference scheduled for September
4, 2024 is CONTINUED to June 23, 2025 at 10:00 AM.  The Jury Trial
scheduled for September 16, 2024 is CONTINUED to July 7, 2025 at 8:30 AM. 
All discovery cut-off dates, all pretrial deadlines including discovery,
expert, and motion cut-off dates are continued to the new trial date of July 7,
2025.
 
Moving party to give notice.
