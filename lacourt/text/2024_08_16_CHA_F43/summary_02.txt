Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff's claims are barred by the litigation privilege, are uncertain and lack specificity, and do not plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for kidnapping, fraud, concealment, negligence, wrongful imprisonment, personal injury, emotional stress and duress, loss of personal property, loss of income, loss of time in Div. 50 program, and loss of record in Div. 50 program. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff has not fulfilled his burden of proving a reasonable possibility to amend his complaint and therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
