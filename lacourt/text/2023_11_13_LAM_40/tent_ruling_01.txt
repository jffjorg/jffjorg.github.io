Background
Pleadings
In Case No. 20STCV27665, Plaintiffs—Sandra
Norlund individually and as a trustee—sue the Norlund Defendants and Nominal
Defendant Nancy Hymas pursuant to a July 29, 2020 First Amended Complaint that
alleged claims of (1) Judicial Foreclosure, (2) Fraud, and (3) Interference
with Prospective Economic Advantage.
The Fraud and Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage claims were stricken by Department 40 on April
13, 2021, based on a representation by Plaintiffs that only the Judicial
Foreclosure cause of action remained, i.e., an election of remedies. This
election of remedies was also noted by the court of appeal in its decision in
Case No. B316527, indicating that Plaintiffs had taken the position they were
no longer pursuing her tort claims, but still pursuing all their claims as
stated in the first cause of action, including a claim for damages for alleged breach
of a settlement agreement. (See Norlund v. Norlund (February 9, 2023)
2023 WL 1844051, *6 (Unpub.) It should be noted that California Rules of Court,
rule 8.1115 subdivision (b)(1) permits citation to an unpublished opinion when,
as here, “the opinion is relevant under the doctrines of law of the case, res
judicata, or collateral estoppel.”
The claims arise from allegations
that Richard Norlund, Nancy Hymas (sister to Richard), and Sandra Norlund
(sister-in-law to Richard and Nancy, husband deceased) were the trustees of Trust
A and B of the Norlund Family Trust dated March 16, 1987 and that, on or about
April 11, 2019, after litigation between these individuals in Butte County,
California, the parties reached a settlement agreement. Pursuant to that
agreement, the trustee of these trusts would sell real property known as 14924
and 14930 Arrow Highway, Baldwin Park, California (the Subject Properties) to
Richard Norlund in exchange for a deed of trust and promissory note worth $1.47
million to be assigned to Sandra Norlund and Nancy Hymas, among other terms.
Richard is then alleged to have defaulted on the promissory note by failing and
refusing to pay Sandra the agreed upon $7,668.22 per month required by the note
and to have breached the settlement agreement by modifying the terms of the
deed of trust so that it referred to a different promissory note. Specifically,
Richard is alleged to have changed the date of the promissory note appearing on
the deed of trust—which meant the date of the promissory note on the deed of
trust did not match the date on the promissory note assigned to Sandra and
Nancy—and to have recorded the altered deed of trust without Sandra’s approval.
Sandra further alleges that Richard, by refusing ‘to provide the valid Deed of
Trust,’ breached the settlement agreement’s term to provide Sandra with
appropriate documentation to allow her to obtain a Lender’s Policy of Title
Insurance. Sandra alleges that Sharon Norlund conspired with Richard to alter
the deed of trust.
Motion Before the Court
On August 27, 2020, Plaintiff
Sandra Norlund recorded a notice of pendency of this action (lis pendens
notice) on the Subject Properties with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s
Office.
On August 26, 2021, the Court
granted a June 10, 2021 motion for summary judgment by the Norlund Defendants.
On September 27, 2021, the Court
denied a motion for reconsideration by Sandra Norlund.
On November 10, 2021, judgment was
entered.
That same day, Sandra appealed the
judgment.
On November 12, 2021, the Norlund
Defendants filed a motion to expunge the lis pendens notice based on the grant
of summary judgment, with Sandra opposing the motion on November 23, 2021 and
the Norlund Defendants replying to the opposition on December 1, 2021.
On December 8, 2021, the Court
granted the motion and expunged the lis pendens notice based on the grant of
summary judgment.
On February 9, 2023, the court of
appeal reversed the grant of summary judgment with instructions that this Court
deny the June 10, 2021 motion by the Norlund Defendants.
On April 14, 2023, the court of
appeal returned remittitur to this Court.
On May 18, 2023, based on the
outcome of the appeal, Plaintiff filed a motion to re-record a lis pendens
notice on the Subject Properties, which the Norlund Defendants expressly
declined to oppose on June 12, 2023, subject to a reservation of rights.
On June 26, 2023, based on the
outcome of the appeal, the Court granted Sandra Norlund’s May 18th motion.
On October 5, 2023, the Norlund Defendants
filed a motion to (1) expunge the new lis pendens notice on the Subject
Properties, (2) require Sandra Norlund to post an undertaking, or (3) expunge
the lis pendens notice by allowing the Norlund Defendants to post an
undertaking. The motion also seeks fees and costs.
On October 25, 2023, the Court
signed a stipulation and proposed order by the parties to continue the hearing
on the October 5th motion.
On October 30, 2023, Sandra Norlund
opposed the Norlund Defendants’ motion.
On November 3, 2023, the Norlund
Defendants replied to the opposition.
The Norlund Defendants’ motion is
now before the Court. 
The Court notes that this motion
only seeks to expunge the lis pendens that was filed in the lead case, as
Defendants contend that the lis pendens that was filed in the related case, 23
STCV19070, which was recently transferred to Los Angeles from Butte County, has
already been expunged. (Mot. at p. 7.)

Motion
to Expunge Lis Pendens
Legal Standard
A lis pendens is a recorded
instrument titled Notice of Pending Action that is recorded in the office of
the county recorder where land is located and gives constructive notice of a
pending lawsuit affecting title to described real property. (Gale v.
Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1395.)
“A party to an action who asserts a
real property claim may record a notice of pendency of action in which that
real property claim is alleged.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.20.) Anyone having an
interest in the property affected by a lis pendens, whether or not a party to
the pending lawsuit, may move to expunge the lis pendens any time after it is
recorded. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.30.)
A lis pendens may be expunged on
any of the following grounds: (1) defects in the statutory service and filing
requirements; (2) the complaint does not contain a real property claim; (3) the
claimant cannot prove the probable validity of the real property claim by a
preponderance of the evidence; and (4) “adequate relief” can be “secured to the
claimant by the giving of an undertaking.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.23, 405.31,
405.32, 405.33; McKnight v. Superior Court (Faber) (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d
291, 303 [recognizing defective servicing and filing requirements as grounds
for expungement].)
The motion may be made even while
an appeal is pending. (Peery v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d 837,
842.) On a motion to expunge a lis pendens after judgment against the claimant
and while an appeal is pending, the trial court must grant the motion unless it
finds it more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse the judgment.
(Amalgamated Bank v. Superior Court (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1015.)
Order Expunging Lis Pendens
Notice: GRANTED.
The Norlund Defendants seek an
order that will (1) expunge the new lis pendens notice on the Subject
Properties, (2) require Sandra Norlund to post an undertaking, or (3) expunge
the lis pendens notice by allowing the Norlund Defendants to post an undertaking.
The motion also seeks fees and costs.
A. Expungement
Generally
The Norlund Defendants generally
seek expungement on three independent grounds: (1) Plaintiffs Sandra Norlund
failed to plead a real property claim (Code Civ. Proc. §405.31); (2) the claim
filed lacks probable validity (Code Civ. Proc. §405.32); and (3) the Sandra
Norlund Plaintiffs are in breach of an April 18, 2022 Court order requiring
their cooperation in the Subject Properties’ sale. (Mot., p. 7.)
A. Failure to State
Real Property Claim
In their motion, the Norlund
Defendants argue that the judicial foreclosure claim alleged in the FAC is not
a “real property claim” for the purposes of a lis pendens notice. (Mot., pp.
11-12; see Code Civ. Proc., § 405.20.) A “real property claim” involves a cause
or causes of action in a pleading that, if meritorious, affect (a) title to, or
the right to possession of, specific real property or (b) the use of an
easement identified in the pleading, other than an easement obtained pursuant
to statute by any regulated public utility. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.4.) The
Norlund Defendants rely on Urez Corp. v. Superior Court (1986) 190
Cal.App.3d 1141 (Urez) for the proposition that a deed of trust does not
give the beneficiary any interest in title of possession of real property, for
which reason the beneficiary is only a lienholder on the property. The Norlund
Defendants also rely on Civil Code section 2888 for the proposition that a lien
does not transfer title to real property. Under this framework, if a deed of
trust is only a lien on the property, then the judicial foreclosure claim does
not involve title or possession of the Subject Properties. (No easement rights
are involved in this action.) (Mot., pp. 11-12.)
In opposition, Sandra Norlund
argues that a deed of trust affects title, compared to a mortgage, which
operates under a lien theory, citing Robin v. Crowell (2020) 55
Cal.App.5th 727 (Robin). Elsewhere, Sandra relies on Kaiser
Industries Corp. v. Taylor (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 346, 352 (Kaiser)
and Aguilar v. Bocci (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 475, 477 (Aguilar).
Sandra also argues that judicial and non-judicial foreclosure on a deed of
trust is proper when there has been a default, that a default has occurred
here, and that judicial foreclosure is the proper claim because Plaintiff
cannot proceed with a non-judicial foreclosure in light of the deed of trust
not being enforceable (discrepancy of note date) and in light of the lack of
title insurance. Plaintiff notes that a different deed of trust was recorded in
the Norlund Defendants’ counsel’s favor—Rick Edwards, Esq.—on January 13, 2022.
(Opp’n, pp. 7-10.)
In reply, the Norlund Defendants do
not address Robin. Instead, the Reply focuses on distinguishing Kaiser
and Aguilar. The Norlund Defendants otherwise focus on Urez.
(Reply, pp. 6-8.)
The Court finds in favor of the
Norlund Defendants.
A review of Urez, Robin,
Kaiser, and Aguilar shows that only Urez involved issues
relating to a lis pendens notice. In Urez, the plaintiff held a second
trust deed that was extinguished by the foreclosure of the first trust deed.
The purchaser at the foreclosure was a corporation formed by the defaulting
owner. (Urez, supra, 190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1143-1144.) The
complaint alleged causes of action for fraud in the formation of the
corporation, for a declaration that the plaintiff held a beneficial interest in
the property, and for the imposition of a constructive trust. (Id. at p.
1144.) The Urez court found that the action did not support a lis
pendens, noting that the case was “essentially a fraud action seeking money
damages with additional allegations urged to support the equitable remedies of
a constructive trust or an equitable lien.” (Id. at p. 1149.) The court also
held that “allegations of equitable remedies, even if colorable, will not
support a lis pendens if, ultimately, those allegations act only as a
collateral means to collect money damages.” (Id. at p. 1149.)
Here, the FAC involves a judicial
foreclosure claim that appears to only act as a collateral means to collect
money damages. Indeed, the relief sought for the first cause of action involves
special damages, general damages according to proof, interest and other
incidental damages, attorney fees, punitive damages, costs of suit, a court
order mandating the sale of the Subject Properties so that the proceeds can be
used to pay Sandra Norlund, and other relief as the Court deems just and
proper. (FAC, Prayer, ¶¶ 1-8 at p. 18.) All these forms of relief involve money
damages. Even the order forcing a sale of the Subject Properties involves a
collateral means to collect money damages because the specific relief
requested, though equitable, is intended for the sole purpose of selling
property for a monetary return that will be used to pay Sandra Norlund’s
damages. Such relief is not a proper ground for a lis pendens notice. (Urez,
supra, 190 Cal.App.3d at p. 1149 [“[A]llegations of equitable remedies,
even if colorable, will not support a lis pendens if, ultimately, those
allegations act only as a collateral means to collect money damages”]; see also
id. at p. 1145 [“[A]n action for money damages alone will not support a
lis pendens”]; BGJ Associates v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
952, 967-968 [same]; Allied Eastern Financial v. Goheen Enterprises
(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 131, 132-134 [same].
The Norlund Defendants’ motion is
thus GRANTED.
B. Lack of Probable
Validity
The Court need only reach the probable
validity of the judicial foreclosure cause of action if it is a real property
claim, which the Court has determined it is not. (See discussion at Section
I.A. supra; see also Code Civ. Proc. §405.32.)
C. Breach of Court
Order
Whether Sandra Norlund’s alleged
breaches of an April 2022 court order merits expungement of the lis pendens
notice has been mooted by the determination above at Section I.A.
II. Order Requiring
Sandra Norlund to Post Undertaking
The question of whether Sandra
Norlund should be required to post an undertaking if she states a real property
claim with probable validity has been mooted by a determination that Sandra
Norlund has not stated a real property claim for lis pendens purposes.
III. Expungement
Based on Norlund Defendants Posting Undertaking
The question of whether the Norlund
Defendants may be allowed to post an undertaking for the purpose of expunging
the lis pendens notice on the Subject Properties has been mooted by a
determination that Sandra Norlund has not stated a real property claim for lis
pendens purposes.
Sanctions: DENIED.
The court shall direct that the
party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.38.)
Here, the Court finds that
colorable arguments were made by both sides, such that the Norlund Defendants
filed their motion in good faith (e.g., citing Urez) and Sandra Norlund
opposed the motion in good faith (e.g., citing caselaw and arguing the probable
validity of her claims based on default and other breaches of the settlement
agreement or the promissory note).
The Court thus DENIES sanctions as
requested by the Norlund Defendants in their moving papers and by Sandra
Norlund in her opposition. 
Conclusion
Defendants Richard L. Norlund and
Sharon K. Norlund’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is GRANTED.
The Court EXPUNGES the lis pendens
notice recorded by Sandra Norlund on 14924 and 14930 Arrow Highway, Baldwin
Park, California.
The corresponding Request for
Sanctions is DENIED.
Sandra Norlund’s opposition request
for sanctions is likewise DENIED.
