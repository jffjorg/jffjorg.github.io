Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to expunge the lis pendens notice filed by the Norlund Defendants. The Court finds that the judicial foreclosure claim alleged in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is not a "real property claim" for the purposes of a lis pendens notice. The Court relies on the case of Urez Corp. v. Superior Court, which holds that a deed of trust does not give the beneficiary any interest in title or possession of real property, and that a judicial foreclosure claim that only acts as a collateral means to collect money damages will not support a lis pendens notice.

The Court also finds that the plaintiff, Sandra Norlund, has not stated a real property claim with probable validity, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 405.32. Therefore, the motion to expunge the lis pendens notice is granted.

The Court denies the request for sanctions filed by the Norlund Defendants and the opposition filed by Sandra Norlund, finding that both parties made colorable arguments and acted in good faith.
