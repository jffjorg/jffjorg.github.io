And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion of Sanaz Imani, counsel for Roya DeStefanis, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed because Roya DeStefanis terminated the representation of Mesriani Law Group and all of its attorneys on January 26, 2024, but refuses to sign a substitution of attorney form. However, the judge notes that counsel has not complied with the rules of court by filing a proposed order on form MC-053 and has not shown proof of service of the moving papers. The judge orders counsel to give notice and file a proof of service of the motion. The court also reminds counsel that the Final Status Conference is set for March 19, 2024, and trial is set for April 3, 2024.
