And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that even if the motion to reopen discovery was not timely, the Court must consider the necessity of additional discovery, the diligence of the party seeking to reopen discovery, and whether permitting the discovery will prevent the case from going forward on the trial date. The Court has decided to reopen discovery for the sole purpose of hearing the instant motion, as the plaintiff has asserted that the defendants designated supplemental experts contrary to statute, and the plaintiff acted diligently in bringing the motion. The plaintiff's counsel had also attempted to meet and confer with the defendants' counsel unsuccessfully. The Court will consider the California Code of Civil Procedure, ยง 2024.050, subdivision (b), in making its decision.
