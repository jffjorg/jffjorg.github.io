MOTION
 
On November 28, 2018, Plaintiff Chad Keller (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Joshua Franklin and Darryl Franklin (“Defendants”)
for negligence arising from a motor vehicle accident. At a trial setting
conference on December 3, 2020, trial and all related dates were scheduled for
July 21, 2022. 
 
On July 20, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application
and continued trial to November 8, 2022. 
 
On October 6, 2022, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial
and all related dates to March 1, 2023. 
 
On January 27, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued
trial and all related dates to May 15, 2023. 
 
On April 27, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial
to September 27, 2023. All discovery was closed except for the completion of
expert witness depositions to be completed on or before September 1, 2023. The
pre-trial motion cut off remained in effect except for motions related to
expert discovery.
 
On September 15, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued
trial and all related dates to January 12, 2024. According to the stipulation,
the parties required more time to complete expert depositions of the total 24
expert witnesses that were designated in this case. (9/15/23 Stip. ¶ 1.) 
 
On December 27, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued
trial and all related dates to February 21, 2024. According to the stipulation,
the parties required more time to complete expert depositions of the total 24
expert witnesses that were designated in this case. (12/27/23 Stip. ¶ 1.) 
 
On February 6, 2024, pursuant to oral stipulation, the Court continued
trial to March 5, 2024, with all discovery to remain closed. (2/6/24 Minute
Order.)
 
On February 14, 2024, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued
trial and all related dates to April 2, 2024. According to the stipulation, the
parties required more time to complete expert depositions of the total 24
expert witnesses that were designated in this case. (9/15/23 Stip. ¶ 1.) The
Court indicated that there would be no further continuance.
 
            Plaintiff now moves to strike
Defendant’s second supplemental designation of expert witnesses. No opposition
has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 2034.300:¿ 
¿ 
Except as
provided in Section 2034.310 and in Articles 4 (commencing with Section
2034.610) and 5 (commencing with Section 2034.710), on objection¿of any party
who has made a complete and timely compliance with Section 2034.260, the trial
court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is
offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to do any of the following:¿¿ 
¿ 
(a) List that witness as an expert under Section
2034.260.¿¿ ¿ 
(b) Submit an expert witness declaration.¿¿ 
(c) Produce
reports and writings of expert witnesses under Section 2034.270.¿¿ 
(d) Make
that expert available for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section
2034.410).¿¿ 
¿ 
A supplemental expert witness may be used to designate
counter experts in response to a designated subject.  
 
(a) Within
20 days after the exchange described in Section 2034.260, any party who engaged
in the exchange may submit a supplemental expert witness list containing the
name and address of any experts who will express an opinion on a subject to be
covered by an expert designated by an adverse party to the exchange, if the
party supplementing an expert witness list has not previously retained an
expert to testify on that subject.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.280)
 
The subject experts are rebuttal witnesses on a designated
subject. Supplemental lists cannot be used to designate experts on new
subjects. (Fairfax v. Lords (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1026-1027; Basham
v. Babcock (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1723.)  
 
A party’s
supplemental expert designation is proper where (1) the party seeking to
supplement its expert designation complied with its disclosure obligations; (2)
there is no indication it acted unreasonably or engaged in gamesmanship; and
(3) there is no prejudice to the other party.¿ (Du-All Safety, LLC v.
Superior Court (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 485, 498.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an
initial matter, Plaintiff asks the Court to reopen discovery for the limited
purpose of hearing this motion. (See Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v.
Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, [requiring the
court to follow Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 before hearing a
discovery motion past the discovery cutoff].) However, in light of the parties’
February 14, 2024 stipulation, the motion is timely.[1]
 
Turning to the merits, Plaintiff
asserts that the parties simultaneously disclosed experts in response to
exchanged demands on March 27, 2023. (Dembowski Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) On January
22, 2024, Defendant served a supplemental disclosure. (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. B.)
Therefore, it appears that Defendants did not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2034.280(a) since the supplemental
disclosure took place more than 20 days after the initial exchange. There is no
indication that Defendants filed a motion for leave to augment their expert
witness list. Defendants do not oppose this motion. 
 
Therefore,
because Defendants supplemented their experts past the 20-day deadline, the
motion to strike is granted. Since this is dispositive, the Court will not
address Plaintiff’s remaining arguments. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike Defendants’ Supplemental
Expert Designation.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
