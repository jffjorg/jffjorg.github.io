And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, David Meza, age 12, filed on December 15, 2023. The court denied the petition due to several reasons. Firstly, the court denied a previous petition filed on August 25, 2023, for failing to attach medical records regarding the claimant's injuries. Secondly, the petition was again filled out improperly, including item 10, which must contain the gross settlement offered to the claimant, and item 11, which should not include the amount offered to the claimant. Additionally, the petition did not include an attachment explaining the reasons for the apportionment of the settlement between the claimant and each plaintiff. The court also noted that the moving party should not mark item 8a(4) in the Order (MC-351), as it refers to other disbursements from the claimant's settlement, not disbursements from other settlements in this case. The court denied the petition and ordered the moving party to give notice.
