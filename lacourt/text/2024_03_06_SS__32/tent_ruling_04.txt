None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On May 8, 2020, Plaintiff Bertha Fierro (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint for negligence and premises liability against Defendants White
Memorial Medical Center dba Adventist Health White Memorial (erroneously sued
as White Memorial Medical Plaza) and Adventist Health System/West (erroneously
sued as System West Adventist Health) (collectively, “Defendants”).
 
On October 1, 2021, Defendants filed an answer.  
 
On September 11, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion
for summary judgment. 
 
Judgment for Defendants was entered on January 5,
2024.  
 
On January 9, 2024, Defendants filed and served notice of
the entry of the judgment.  
  
On January 19, 2024, Defendants filed and served
electronically, its Memorandum of Costs (forms MC-010 and MC-011), claiming $4,074.90
in costs.  
 
On February 2, 2024 Plaintiff filed the instant motion to tax
Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (Code
Civ. Proc. section 1032, subd. (b).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subd. (c)(2), allowable costs “shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.”¿Subdivision (3) requires: “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount.”¿“Items not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) There is no requirement that copies of bills,
invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the
memorandum. Only if the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs
must supporting documentation be submitted. (Bach v. County of Butte
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) 
 
On a motion to tax costs, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost item was reasonably
necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and
its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because the right to
costs is governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to award costs
not statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) “The court’s first
determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the item, and
whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting
party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.) The objecting
party does not meet this burden by arguing that the costs were not necessary or
reasonable, but must present evidence and prove that the costs are not
recoverable. (Litt v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, the filing of both Defendants’ Memorandum of
Costs and Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax Costs are timely under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700. 
 
Next, as Plaintiff did not “recover any relief against”
Defendants, Defendants are the prevailing party in this action. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Defendants are therefore entitled to recover their
costs. 
 
Plaintiff seeks to tax $1,880.25 from Defendants’
memorandum of costs in item 1, which seeks $2,794.75 for filing and motion
fees. Plaintiff argues that $1,880.25 consists of third-party convenience fess
which fall outside of Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(14) and rush
and courtesy filing fees in violation of section 1033.5(c)(2). 
 
Filing and Motion Fees 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(14) allows costs
for “[f]ees for the electronic filing or service of documents through an
electronic filing service provider if a court requires or orders electronic
filing or service of documents.” Additionally, section 1033.5(c)(2) states that
“[a]n award of costs shall be subject to the following: . . . Allowable costs
shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than
merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” 
 
Here, the values appear reasonable on the face of the
memorandum. Plaintiff argues that most of Defendant’s filing costs originate
from fees charged by Nationwide Legal, a third-party filing vendor. Plaintiff
argues Defendants could have directly filed with the Court through Judicial
Technology for a nominal fee. (Motion, 3.) However, Plaintiff does not cite to
any law to support that only the baseline electronic filing fees are
recoverable. Section 1033.5(a)(14) specifically provides for “fees for the electronic
filing or service of documents through an electronic filing service provider.” Therefore,
Plaintiff fails to show that any additional charges that Defendant incurred for
electronically filing papers, via its provider, were unreasonable. 
 
However, Plaintiff also challenges costs for courtesy
copies on 10/27/21, 4/19/23, 5/9/23, 5/11/23, 8/25/23. Pursuant to the Court’s
Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures, courtesy copies are required for Ex
Parte Applications, Motions for Summary Judgment, Oppositions to Ex Parte
Applications and Motions for, Oppositions to, and Replies to Oppositions to
Motions for Summary Judgment, and must be submitted
directly to the Court.  (Super. Ct. L.A.
County 8th Amended Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures ¶ 9C.) 
 
The courtesy copies that Plaintiff contests were for ex
parte applications, and a summary judgment motion, except May 9, 2023, which
appears to be for a motion to advance the summary judgment hearing. (See Memo.
Costs, Invoice #57395.) Thus, the costs for
courtesy copies of the ex parte applications and summary judgment motion are
permitted. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(4)
[“Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may
be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.”].) According to Defendants’
Attachment 1g in the Memorandum of Costs, $45.95 was charged for the May 9,
2023 motion to advance the summary judgment motion, which according to invoice
#57395, pertained to courtesy copies. Defendants do not oppose this motion.
Therefore, the Court strikes $45.95 in costs since courtesy copies for a non-
ex parte application or summary judgment motion are not recoverable under
section 1033.5. 
 
Accordingly, the Court grants in part the motion to strike only
$45.95 in costs (“5/9/23 Notice of Motion to Court (Nationwide Legal)”). The remainder of Plaintiff’s motion is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is granted in part and denied in part. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
