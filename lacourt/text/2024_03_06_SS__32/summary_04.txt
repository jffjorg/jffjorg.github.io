And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to tax costs filed by Plaintiff Bertha Fierro, and the memorandum of costs filed by Defendants White Memorial Medical Center and Adventist Health System/West. The court finds that the filing and motion fees claimed by Defendants are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and are therefore recoverable. However, the court does strike $45.95 in costs for courtesy copies related to a non-ex parte application, as these costs are not recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The court grants in part the motion to strike only this amount, and denies the remainder of Plaintiff's motion. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change if the parties are unable to reach a resolution and a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling.
