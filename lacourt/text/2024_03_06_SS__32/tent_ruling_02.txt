Even if the motion was not timely, in determining whether to reopen
discovery, the court must consider the necessity of and reasons for the
additional discovery, the diligence or lack thereof by the party seeking to
reopen discovery in attempting to complete discovery prior to the cutoff,
whether permitting the discovery will prevent the case from going forward on
the trial date or will otherwise prejudice any party, and any past continuances
of the trial date. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b).) Here, since it is
asserted that Defendants designated supplemental experts contrary to statute,
and that Plaintiff acted diligently in bringing this motion, the Court would
reopen discovery for the sole purpose of hearing the instant motion.
Plaintiff’s counsel also provides a declaration that she attempted to meet and
confer with Defendants’ counsel unsuccessfully. (Dembowski Decl. ¶ 5.)
