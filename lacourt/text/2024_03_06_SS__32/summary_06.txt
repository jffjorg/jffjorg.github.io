**Facts**

* Plaintiff Demetra Lipkins filed a complaint against Defendants Elisa Enriquez and Does 1 to 25 alleging causes of action for negligence, negligence per se under Civil Code section 3342, and strict liability for a dog bite.
* On May 5, 2021, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint, substituting Jeffrey Abernathy and Laura Abernathy as Does 1 and 2 respectively.
* Defendants Jeffrey Abernathy and Laura Abernathy (Defendants) argue that they did not own the subject dog, had no actual or constructive notice of the dog, and that Plaintiff cannot prove causation.

**Legal Analysis**

* The court analyzed the elements of negligence, strict liability, and negligence per se, and found that there is no evidence creating a material triable issue of fact regarding actual knowledge.
* The court held that there is no duty of care to protect a third party from a tenant's dog unless the landlord has actual knowledge of the dog's dangerous propensities.
* The court concluded that Defendants had met their burden in showing that they had no notice of the subject dog and that there is no evidence to establish a triable issue of fact.

**Order**

* The court grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.
* Defendants shall file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
* Moving Defendants shall provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.

**Intentions**

* The court intends to issue a final order adopting the tentative ruling as the order of the court unless a party submits a written opposition or request to appear at the hearing.

**Significant Statements**

* "Actual knowledge can be inferred from the circumstances only if, in the light of the evidence, such inference is not based on speculation or conjecture."
* "One way to set forth a fact is 'to introduce evidence tending to show an opponent's denial of the existence of the fact is to be disbelieved, that is, evidence challenging the credibility of his denial.'"
* "If a party takes the affirmative step of testifying that he denies any knowledge about a certain topic it is possible to introduce evidence bearing on the credibility of that denial."
