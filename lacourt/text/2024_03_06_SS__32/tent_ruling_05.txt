BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Rasier-CA, LLC
(Defendant) moves to deem admitted Requests for Admissions, Sets 1, 2, 3, to
Compel Plaintiff Farida Amer’s (Plaintiff) Response to Form Interrogatories, Sets
1, 2, 3 and Special Interrogatories, Sets 1, 2, 3, and to Compel Plaintiff’s
Response to Request for Production of Documents, Sets 1, 2, 3. Plaintiff does
not oppose.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to
respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party
relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, if a party fails to
serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Code Civ. Pro §
2031.300 (b).) The party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand unless the court finds that the
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance or
party’s failure was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a)(1)- (2).) 
 
If a motion to compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290(c); Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).) Further, “[t]he court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant asserts that it served Request for Admissions, Set One,
Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Production of Documents, Set One on Plaintiff on August 16, 2023. (Tate
Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) The responses were due on September 19, 2023. (Id. ¶ 3.) 
 
On August 29, 2023, Defendant served Request for Admissions, Set Two, Form
Interrogatories, Set Two, Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two on Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. 2.) The responses
were due October 2, 2023. (Id. ¶ 5.) 
 
On September 5, 2023, Defendant served Request for Admissions, Set
Three, Form Interrogatories, Set Three, Special Interrogatories, Set Three, and
Request for Production of Documents, Set Three on Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. 3.)
The responses were due October 9, 2023. (Id. ¶ 7.) 
 
Plaintiff has not responded and has not filed an opposition to this
motion. Therefore, the motion to deem admitted and motions to compel are
granted.  
 
Defendant
requests $1,870.95 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of
record for each separate motion, representing an hourly rate of $265.00 and $82.20
for the filing and rescheduling fee. (Id. ¶ 12.) The Court finds sanctions are
warranted because Plaintiff has failed to respond. However, the amount
requested is excessive due to the type of motions at issue and the fact no
opposition was filed. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,918.80
(1.5 hours of attorney time to file and appear at the hearing, plus the $82.20
filing fee, times four motions).           
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Deem Admitted Request for
Admissions, Sets 1, 2, 3 is GRANTED. Defendant’s Motion to Compel Form
Interrogatories, Sets 1, 2, 3, Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories, Sets
1, 2, 3, and Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Request for Production
of Documents, Sets 1, 2, 3 are GRANTED. Plaintiff shall serve verified
responses without objections within 10 days.
 
The Court further GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and her counsel of record in the reduced amount of $1,918.80.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days
of the date of this order.
 
Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
