And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Cross Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that Cross Complainants failed to allege compliance with the Government Claims Act prior to filing the cross complaint. The judge notes that Cross Complainants did not timely present a claim to the City of Glendale Fire Department and did not file a petition for relief under Government Code section 946.6(c) before filing the opposition to the motion. The judge also rejects Cross Complainants' argument that the doctrine of laches applies against Cross Defendants for waiting seven months to file an answer to the cross complaint. The judge orders Cross Complainants to amend their cross complaint and serves it within 30 days.
