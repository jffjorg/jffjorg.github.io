```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendants' Supplemental Expert Designation. The motion is granted because Defendants supplemented their experts past the 20-day deadline. The Court notes that the parties' February 14, 2024 stipulation allows the motion to be timely. The Court finds that Defendants did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.280(a) since the supplemental disclosure took place more than 20 days after the initial exchange. Since this is dispositive, the Court will not address Plaintiff's remaining arguments. The Court orders that Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
