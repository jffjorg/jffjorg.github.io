TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


March
  6, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV23095




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Roya DeStefanis’ Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Roya DeStefanis’ (Plaintiff) counsel of
record, Sanaz Imani (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because Plaintiff has terminated the
representation, but refuses to sign a substitution of attorney form. 
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel
states the instant motion is filed for the following reason: “On January 26,
2024, Plaintiff Roya DeStefanis terminated the representation of Mesriani Law
Group and all of its attorneys. ("Exhibit A") On January 30, 2024,
despite Plaintiff terminating Mesriani Law Group from her representation, she
refused and continues to refuse to sign off on a substitution of attorney form,
thereby requiring the filing of this motion.” (MC-052.) 
 
However, Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and MC-052
but has not filed/lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form
MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.)  Counsel
has also not included the dates, times, locations, and subject matter of all
future proceedings in this case. Moreover, Counsel has not shown proof of
service of the moving papers (MC-051, MC-052, MC-053) on all parties who have
appeared in the action, and Plaintiff. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) Finally, the Final Status Conference is set for March 19, 2024 and
trial for April 3, 2024.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
 
            Moving
party is to give notice and file a proof of service of such.
