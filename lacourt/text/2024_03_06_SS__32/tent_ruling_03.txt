CASE NUMBER:


19STCV20094




MOTIONS:  


Petition
  for Minors Compromise 




MOVING PARTY:


Petitioner Nora Meza




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed
  



 
 
The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, David Meza, age 12, filed December 15, 2023. The
Court does not approve and DENIES the petition based on the following reasons:
 
The Court denied a previous petition,
filed August 25, 2023, for failing to attach medical records regarding
claimant’s injuries in item 6 and records of treatment in items 7 and 12. (Min.
Order, 9/12/23.) In that petition, Petitioner stated in item 7 that Claimant
received treatment at St. Francis Medical Center. In an amended petition filed
September 27, 2023, Petitioner stated in item 6 that Claimant “[s]ustained
bruises to his legs and knees, no treatment heal on it’s own.”  
In the instant petition, Petitioner states in item 6 that
“Plaintiff, a minor, walking on crosswalk, was injured from the car
impact accident.” 
 
Petitioner filed a declaration on
February 22, 2022, declaring under penalty of perjury that she has personal
firsthand knowledge that Claimant is fully recovered from his injuries. The
Court finds this is sufficient evidence of Claimant’s current condition. 
 
However, item 10 is again filled out
improperly. Item 10a must contain the gross settlement offered to Claimant.
According to 10c, this value is $8,000 and must be written in 10a (not $18,500,
which is the total amount of settlement to all plaintiffs). Accordingly, 10b
should only include “Violet Mary Campos $8,000.” 
 
Again, item 11b(1) should not include
the amount offered to Claimant, but to all other plaintiffs or claimants.
Similarly, item 11b(5) should not include Claimant’s name or amount. Therefore,
the amount in 11b(1) should be $10,500. Also, Petitioner did not include
attachment 11b(6) to explain the reasons for the apportionment of the
settlement between Claimant and each plaintiff. (Min. Order, 11/2/23.) 
 
Petitioner checked item 14a, and therefore should not
fill out any values under 14b. 
 
Also, in the Order (MC-351), Petitioner should not mark
8a(4). This item refers to other disbursements from Claimant’s settlement, and
not disbursements from other settlements in this case.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
