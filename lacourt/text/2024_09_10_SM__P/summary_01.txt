This tentative ruling by the judge addresses several issues related to a demurrer filed by defendant Justin Smith against plaintiff Chun's amended complaint. The court has already sustained Chun's demurrer to Smith's cross-complaint with leave to amend. Smith's demurrer to Chun's complaint is MOOT due to the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice on August 30, 2024.

Regarding the intentional tort cause of action, the court finds that Smith's allegations are conclusory and lack specific facts, and that Chun is protected by Code of Civil Procedure §47(2) for reporting wrongdoing to law enforcement. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.

Regarding the fraud cause of action, the court finds that Smith's allegations are conclusory and lack specific facts, and that the amended pleading fails to meet the requirements for pleading fraud. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.

Regarding the punitive damages cause of action, the court finds that Smith's allegations are conclusory and lack specific facts, and that the causes of action are both sustained without leave to amend, making this issue MOOT.

Overall, the court is sustaining the demurrer to Smith's amended cross-complaint, without leave to amend, due to Smith's failure to provide specific facts to support his claims.
