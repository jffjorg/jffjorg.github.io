Poulton v. Network
Capital Funding, Case No. 23SMCV01332 
Hearing Date:
September 10, 2024 
Plaintiff Poulton’s
Motion to Lift Stay and Restore Case to Civil Active List, Request for Fees and
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff Poulton
claims defendant employer Network Capital Funding constructively terminated him
in retaliation for complaining about working conditions, illegal practices and
deceptive recruitment techniques. The court stayed and ordered the parties to
binding arbitration per the employment agreement. Poulton moves to lift the
stay and restore the case to the civil active list. 
 
Poulton moves to
lift the stay, arguing Network Capital failed to make timely payments for the
arbitration costs, per Labor Code §§1281.97 and 1281.98. In employment or
consumer arbitration, if arbitration agreement requires drafting party to pay
certain fees and costs before arb. can proceed, and such fees/costs are not
paid within 30 days of due date, drafting party “is in material breach . . .
and waives right to compel arbitration.” Calif. Arb Act (and C.C.P, including
§1281.97), will be implied into agreement, if otherwise silent on these issues.
Espinoza v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th761. 
 
In opposition,
Network Capital contends §1281.97 is preempted by the FAA as the terms of the
agreement provide the FAA governs, rather than state law, citing Hernandez
v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222, 231, reh'g
denied (June 3, 2024). 
 
The parties’ agreement
provides “Any arbitration proceeding under this agreement shall proceed under
and be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) because both I and the
Company are engaged in interstate commerce. To the extent they are not contrary
to the FAA, the procedures of the California Arbitration Act (“Act”) shall also
apply.” Gafa Decl. Ex. B. pp. 1-2.
 
Based on this, the
court could conclude the parties intended the FAA to govern, and where it would
not conflict with the FAA, the CAA would also apply. Noting both the FAA and
CAA support arbitration of disputes, the court finds no reason to lift the
stay. 
 
Network Capital
argues the delay in payment is de minimis. Poulton argues Labor Code §§1282.97
and 1281.98 provide no exceptions for late payments. Payment were due February
13 and April 23, 2024. Peter Decl., Ex. A & D. Payments were received March
4 and May 6, 2024. Id. Ex. C. 
 
Payments made two-three
weeks past their initial due dates does not equate to a material breach. As
there is a strong public policy in favor of upholding arbitration agreements, a
brief delay in payment does not require the court to find a waiver of the right
to arbitrate. As the motion is DENIED, no sanctions are appropriate.
