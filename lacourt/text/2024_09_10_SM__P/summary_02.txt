And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay and restore the case to the civil active list, as well as the defendant's opposition to the motion. The plaintiff argues that the defendant failed to make timely payments for arbitration costs, and therefore waived its right to compel arbitration. The defendant argues that the delay in payment is de minimis and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the arbitration agreement.

The court finds that the parties intended for the FAA to govern the arbitration agreement, and that the California Arbitration Act (CAA) would also apply where it does not conflict with the FAA. The court concludes that the brief delay in payment does not constitute a material breach, and therefore the stay should not be lifted. The motion is denied, and no sanctions are appropriate.
