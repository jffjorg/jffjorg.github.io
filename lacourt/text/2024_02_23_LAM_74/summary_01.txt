And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yamamoto v. Johnnie Kennedy Farms, Jr. regarding a demurrer to the defendant's answer. The plaintiff, Takuma Yamamoto, argues that the defendant's answer is uncertain due to illegible handwriting and lacks sufficient facts to support a defense to the plaintiff's breach of contract claim. The court disagrees, finding that the defendant's answer is not uncertain and that it raises the plaintiff's failure to perform under the contract as a defense. The court also notes that the defendant's labeling of the answer as a "Response to Summons" rather than a "Response to the Complaint" does not render the answer uncertain. Therefore, the court overrules the plaintiff's demurrer to the answer.
