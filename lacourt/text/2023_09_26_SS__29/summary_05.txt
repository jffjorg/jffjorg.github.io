**Summary in English:**

The tentative ruling concerns the motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs Jora, Janet, and Vredj Malaky filed by S. Martin Keleti. The motion was continued for approximately 30 days so that counsel can file an updated MC-052 and MC-053 for each motion. According to the court, the proposed orders filed by counsel were improper because they did not specify all upcoming dates set for hearings or other proceedings. Additionally, the attorney declaration was internally inconsistent, as counsel stated that he had confirmed each client's address within the past 30 days, but also mentioned a communication breakdown with all three clients and had no recent communication with two of them. The court noted that the determination of whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.
