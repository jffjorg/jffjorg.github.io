## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petitions to approve the compromise settlements for Mari Harutyunyan and Maneh Harutyunyan. The ruling states that while the petitioner addressed most of the issues raised in a previous minute order, two remain unresolved: 

1. **Incomplete Information:** Item 15 in the petitions is blank.
2. **Lack of Declaration:** Although the petitions request $1,875 in attorney fees, there's no declaration from the attorney explaining how this fee was determined based on the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c).

Therefore, the petitions are denied without prejudice, meaning the petitioner can resubmit them once these issues are resolved.

**Case Number:** 22STCV24920

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Department:** 29

**Tentative Ruling**

The Petition to Approve Compromise of Mari Harutyunyan and Petition to Approve Compromise of Maneh Harutyunyan are denied without prejudice. The court is considering the following issues:

- Item 15 in the petitions remains blank.
- Although the petitions seek attorneys’ fees to be paid from the settlement in the amount of $1,875.00, there is no declaration of counsel addressing the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c).

The legal standard for a petition to approve a minor's compromise is governed by California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, et seq. and California Probate Code, Sections 3500 and 3600 et seq. If an action is pending and settlement is effectuated prior to trial, the minor's compromise must be approved by the court (Code Civ. Proc. § 372). The trial court is authorized to approve and allow payment of reasonable expenses, costs, and attorney fees in an action concerning the compromise of a minor's claim (Prob. Code § 3601(a)).

Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(a), the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney's fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability. The court must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made (Cal. Rules of Court, R. 7.955, subd. (a)(2)).

The petition must include a declaration by the attorney addressing the factors set forth in Rule 7.955(b)(2) that are applicable to the matter before the Court (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c)).

The ruling is denied without prejudice, and counsel for the petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
