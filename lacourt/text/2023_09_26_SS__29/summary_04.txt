And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the petitions to approve the compromise of Mari Harutyunyan and Maneh Harutyunyan without prejudice. The petitions were filed to approve the compromise of a minor's claim, but the court has identified several remaining issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, the court has not received a completed Item 15 in the petitions, and the petitions do not include a declaration by the attorney addressing the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c). The court will not approve the petitions until these issues are resolved.
