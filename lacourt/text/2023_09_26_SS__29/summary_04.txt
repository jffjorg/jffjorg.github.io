## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petitions to approve the compromise settlements for Mari Harutyunyan and Maneh Harutyunyan. The ruling states that while the petitioner addressed most of the issues raised in a previous minute order, two remain unresolved: 

1. **Incomplete Information:** Item 15 in the petitions is blank.
2. **Lack of Declaration:** Although the petitions request $1,875 in attorney fees, there's no declaration from the attorney explaining how this fee was determined based on the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c).

Therefore, the petitions are denied without prejudice, meaning the petitioner can resubmit them once these issues are resolved.
