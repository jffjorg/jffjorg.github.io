 Case Number:  22STCV24920    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
The Petition
to Approve Compromise of Mari Harutyunyan (the “Mari Petition”) and Petition to
Approve Compromise of Maneh Harutyunyan (the “Maneh Petition”) are DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
A petition to approve a minor’s
compromise is governed by California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, et
seq. and California Probate Code, Sections 3500 and 3600 et seq.
If an action is pending and settlement is effectuated prior to trial, the
minor’s compromise must be approved by the court.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The trial court is authorized to approve and
allow payment of reasonable expenses, costs, and attorney fees in an action
concerning the compromise of a minor’s claim. 
(Prob. Code § 3601(a); Curtis v. Estate of Fagan (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 270, 277-279; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 373.5 (“The
reasonable expenses of the guardian ad litem, including compensation and
counsel fees, shall be determined by the court and paid as it may order, either
out of the property or by plaintiff or petitioner”).)
 
Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, Rule 7.955(a), “unless the court has approved the fee agreement
in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and
allowing the amount of attorney's fees payable from money or property paid or
to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.”  The Court must give consideration to the
terms of the agreement between the attorney and minor’s representative and
“must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at
the time the agreement was made.” (Cal. Rules of Court, R. 7.955, subd.
(a)(2).) California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b)(2) sets out
nonexclusive factors the court may consider in determining the reasonableness
of attorneys’ fees in connection with a petition for minor’s compromise.  Under California Rules of Court, Rule
7.955(c) the petition must include a declaration by the attorney addressing the
factors set forth in Rule 7.955(b)(2) that are applicable to the matter that is
before the Court.
 
Discussion 
 
Here, the Court
finds that there are still some issues remaining as to the Petitions.  The Court identified certain issues in its August
15, 2023 minute order, and Petitioner has addressed most (but not all) of those
issues.
 
The remaining
issues are (1) Item 15 in the Petitions remains blank; and (2) although the
Petitions seek attorneys’ fees to be paid from the settlement in the amount of
$1,875.00 (Petitions at Item 13), there is no declaration of counsel addressing
the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c).  
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The Petition to Approve
Compromise of Mari Harutyunyan and Petition to Approve Compromise of Maneh
Harutyunyan are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
Counsel for
Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
