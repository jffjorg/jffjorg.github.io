 Case Number:  21STCV21554    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
Defendant’s motions are GRANTED.
 
Background 
 
This case
arises out of an alleged vehicle accident between Plaintiff Paige Herbert
(“Plaintiff”) and Defendant William Hannaford (“Defendant”) on July 28, 2019
near the intersection of Los Coyote Diagonal and Carson Street in Long Beach,
California.  
 
On June 9,
2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1 through 10 asserting
causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.  On October 15, 2021, Defendant filed his
answer. 
 
As it
relates to the matters before the Court on September 26, 2023, Defendant propounded
the following discovery on May 9, 2023: (1) Requests for Admission (Set One);
(2) Special Interrogatories (Set Two): and (3) Request for Production of
Documents (Set Two).  (Wells Decls., ¶¶
2, 5 & Exhs. A.)  As of the date of
filing, no responses had been received. 
(Id., ¶¶ 4, 6.)
On August 15, 2023,
Defendant filed a total of five discovery motions, the following three of which
are set for hearing on September 26: (1) motion for an order deeming admitted
the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One); (2) motion
for an order compelling initial responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two): and (3) motion for an
order compelling initial responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set
Two).  Defendant also seeks sanctions in each
motion.
Plaintiff has not filed any
response to these motions.
The Court is aware that the
two other discovery motions filed on August 15 are set for hearing on September
27, 2023.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party
may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall” make the order that the truth of the matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion [to deem admitted the matters contained in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and
no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories,
“the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for
production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
 
On May 9, 2023, Defendant served (1) Requests
for Admission (Set One); (2) Special Interrogatories (Set Two): and (3) Request
for Production of Documents (Set Two). 
(Wells Decls., ¶¶ 2, 5 & Exhs. A.) 
Plaintiff has not responded.  (Id.,
¶¶ 4, 6.)
Defendants has made a sufficient showing in support of
each of its motions.  Accordingly, all
three motions are GRANTED.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are also granted.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel initial responses (or to deem the truth admitted of the
matters specified in requests for admission), and the economies of scale
associated with filing parallel discovery motions, the Court award sanctions in
the amount of $322.50 per motion, calculated as 1.5 hours of attorney time per
motion, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $175 per hour, plus the $60
filing fee.

The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion and DEEMS ADMITTED the truth of the matters specified in
Requests for Admission (Set One).
