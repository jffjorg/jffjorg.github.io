And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to serve the defendant by publication or posting without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed a verified complaint alleging causes of action for trespassing, property damage, and emotional distress, and had previously been served by mail with the summons and complaint. However, the plaintiff's requests for entry of default were rejected due to inconsistencies in the dates of service and the failure to provide proof of receipt. The plaintiff then filed a motion to serve the defendant by publication or posting, citing that they had been unable to personally serve the defendant at their place of residence in Brownwood, Texas. The judge found that the plaintiff had not made the required showing for publication notice, as they had a valid out-of-state address for the defendant and could have served them by mail notice with a return receipt requested. The judge ordered the plaintiff to refile their motion, but required them to submit admissible evidence showing that they had used all reasonable efforts to serve the defendant by means other than by publication, including mail notice, substitute service, and personal service, and that they had exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to identify the defendant's current address.

**English Summary:**

The Judge denied the Plaintiff's request to serve the Defendant by publication. The Judge found that the Plaintiff didn't demonstrate enough effort to locate the Defendant for service, especially since he seemed to have a valid address for Defendant outside of California. 

The denial is "without prejudice," meaning the Plaintiff can re-file the request. However, the Plaintiff must provide more evidence showing they tried all reasonable methods to serve the Defendant, including mail service with a return receipt request, and made a genuine effort to find his current address.  The Plaintiff is expected to meet the same standards as a lawyer representing themselves in court.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for service by publication or posting without prejudice. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, Albert Gregory Pinto, trespassed and broke into the plaintiff's home on two occasions, but the plaintiff has been unable to personally serve the defendant. The plaintiff filed multiple requests for entry of default, which were rejected due to inconsistencies in the dates of service and failure to provide proof of receipt.

The judge found that the plaintiff's motion did not contain a memorandum of points and authorities as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.113(a). However, the judge will still address the merits of the motion.

The judge ruled that the plaintiff did not make the required showing for publication notice. The court found that the plaintiff had a valid out-of-state address for the defendant, which means that the defendant can be served by mail notice with a return receipt requested.

The denial is without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile with admissible evidence showing that they have used all reasonable efforts to serve the defendant by means other than by publication, including mail notice, substitute service, and personal service, and that they have exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to identify the defendant's current address.

## Tentative Ruling Summary 

**Case Number:** 22STCV06463
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** 29

**Parties:** 
* **Plaintiff:** Salaheddine El Moqaddem
* **Defendant:** Albert Gregory Pinto

**Background:**

* **February 22, 2022:** Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging trespassing, negligent trespassing, property damage, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress against Defendant.
* **April 8, 2022:** Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating Defendant was served by mail.
* **May 3, 2022:**  Plaintiff's first request for entry of default was rejected due to the alleged service occurring before the summons was issued.
* **May 3, 2022:** Plaintiff filed another proof of service and a second request for entry of default, which was denied due to inconsistencies in service dates, lack of proof of receipt, and incorrect court form usage.
* **June 2 & June 15, 2022:** Additional requests for entry of default were rejected.
* **August 21, 2023:** Plaintiff filed a motion to serve by publication or posting, claiming they were unable to personally serve Defendant at his residence in Brownwood, Texas.

**Legal Standard:**

*  Service by publication requires establishing that the defendant cannot be served by other reasonable means. 
*  Plaintiff must demonstrate they took "those steps which a reasonable person who truly desired to give notice would have taken under the circumstances."

**Discussion:**

* The Court found Plaintiff did not meet the required showing for publication notice.
* Plaintiff appears to have had a valid out-of-state address for Defendant, allowing for service by mail with a return receipt requested.

**Ruling:**

* The motion for service by publication or posting is **denied without prejudice**.
* Plaintiff may refile, providing admissible evidence of:
    * Using all reasonable efforts to serve Defendant by other means (mail, substitute service, personal service).
    * Exercising reasonable diligence in identifying Defendant's current address. 


**English Summary:**

The judge is denying the Plaintiff's request to serve the Defendant by publishing a notice in a newspaper. The judge believes the Plaintiff has not shown enough effort to find the Defendant's current address and serve him in other ways, like sending a letter with a return receipt requested.  

The judge is giving the Plaintiff another chance to ask for this type of service, but they must provide better evidence that they have tried everything else to find the Defendant and serve him with the lawsuit papers.
