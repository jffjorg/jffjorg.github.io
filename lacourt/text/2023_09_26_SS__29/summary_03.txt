And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to serve the defendant by publication or posting without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed a verified complaint alleging causes of action for trespassing, property damage, and emotional distress, and had previously been served by mail with the summons and complaint. However, the plaintiff's requests for entry of default were rejected due to inconsistencies in the dates of service and the failure to provide proof of receipt. The plaintiff then filed a motion to serve the defendant by publication or posting, citing that they had been unable to personally serve the defendant at their place of residence in Brownwood, Texas. The judge found that the plaintiff had not made the required showing for publication notice, as they had a valid out-of-state address for the defendant and could have served them by mail notice with a return receipt requested. The judge ordered the plaintiff to refile their motion, but required them to submit admissible evidence showing that they had used all reasonable efforts to serve the defendant by means other than by publication, including mail notice, substitute service, and personal service, and that they had exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to identify the defendant's current address.
