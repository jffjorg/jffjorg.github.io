And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a civil case. The case involves a vehicle accident between the plaintiff, Paige Herbert, and the defendant, William Hannaford, on July 28, 2019. The defendant has propounded discovery on the plaintiff, including requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. However, the plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery, and the defendant has filed motions to compel responses and to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission.

The judge grants the defendant's motions, deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission admitted, compelling the plaintiff to respond to the special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and imposing monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel for their failure to respond to discovery. The sanctions amount to $967.50, which is calculated as $322.50 per motion, multiplied by three motions.
