This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a civil case. The case involves a vehicle accident between the plaintiff, Paige Herbert, and the defendant, William Hannaford, on July 28, 2019. The defendant has propounded discovery on the plaintiff, including requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. However, the plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery, and the defendant has filed motions to compel responses and to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission.

The judge grants the defendant's motions, deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission admitted, compelling the plaintiff to respond to the special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and imposing monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel for their failure to respond to discovery. The sanctions amount to $967.50, which is calculated as $322.50 per motion, multiplied by three motions.

##  Summary of the Tentative Ruling

This tentative ruling grants three discovery motions filed by Defendant William Hannaford against Plaintiff Paige Herbert. The motions relate to Plaintiff's failure to respond to requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents within the required 30-day timeframe.  

The judge finds that Defendant has adequately demonstrated Plaintiff's non-compliance and, as a result, deems the truth of the matters in the requests for admission admitted. The judge also compels Plaintiff to provide timely responses to the interrogatories and requests for production.

The judge has awarded sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney, Robin E. Paley, in the amount of $967.50 ($322.50 per motion) for the unsuccessful opposition to the discovery motions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a series of discovery motions brought by the defendant, William Hannaford. The motions seek to compel the plaintiff, Paige Herbert, to respond to discovery requests propounded by the defendant on May 9, 2023. The defendant's requests include requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery requests and grants the defendant's motions. The judge also awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $967.50, broken down into $322.50 per motion.

The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant, written responses to the defendant's special interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days of notice of this order. The judge also orders the plaintiff and counsel to pay the sanctions to the defendant.

The judge notes that the defendant's showing in support of the motions is sufficient, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process. The judge applies the civil discovery act and awards sanctions accordingly.

**Case Number:** 21STCV21554

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Plaintiff:** Paige Herbert

**Defendant:** William Hannaford

**Background:**

This case stems from an alleged vehicle accident between the plaintiff and the defendant on July 28, 2019, in Long Beach, California. The plaintiff filed a complaint on June 9, 2021, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. The defendant filed his answer on October 15, 2021. On May 9, 2023, the defendant propounded discovery requests, including Requests for Admission (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set Two), and Request for Production of Documents (Set Two). As of the date of filing, no responses had been received.

**Legal Standard:**

Parties must respond to requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents within 30 days. Failure to respond may result in deemed admissions, orders to compel responses, and monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act.

**Discussion:**

The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests served on May 9, 2023. The defendant has made a sufficient showing in support of the motions. As a result, all three motions are granted. The defendant's requests for sanctions are also granted, with sanctions in the amount of $322.50 per motion, calculated as 1.5 hours of attorney time per motion, multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $175 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee.

**Order:**

The court grants the defendant's motion and deems admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One). The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified, code-compliant, written responses to the defendant's Special Interrogatories (Set Two) and Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) within 30 days of notice of this order. The plaintiff and counsel of record, Robin E. Paley, Esq., are ordered to pay monetary sanctions to the defendant under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $967.50 within 30 days of notice of this order. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
