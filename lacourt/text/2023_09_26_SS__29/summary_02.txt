And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a civil case. The case involves a vehicle accident between the plaintiff, Paige Herbert, and the defendant, William Hannaford, on July 28, 2019. The defendant has propounded discovery on the plaintiff, including requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. However, the plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery, and the defendant has filed motions to compel responses and to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission.

The judge grants the defendant's motions, deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission admitted, compelling the plaintiff to respond to the special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and imposing monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel for their failure to respond to discovery. The sanctions amount to $967.50, which is calculated as $322.50 per motion, multiplied by three motions.

##  Summary of the Tentative Ruling

This tentative ruling grants three discovery motions filed by Defendant William Hannaford against Plaintiff Paige Herbert. The motions relate to Plaintiff's failure to respond to requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents within the required 30-day timeframe.  

The judge finds that Defendant has adequately demonstrated Plaintiff's non-compliance and, as a result, deems the truth of the matters in the requests for admission admitted. The judge also compels Plaintiff to provide timely responses to the interrogatories and requests for production.

The judge has awarded sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney, Robin E. Paley, in the amount of $967.50 ($322.50 per motion) for the unsuccessful opposition to the discovery motions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a series of discovery motions brought by the defendant, William Hannaford. The motions seek to compel the plaintiff, Paige Herbert, to respond to discovery requests propounded by the defendant on May 9, 2023. The defendant's requests include requests for admission, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery requests and grants the defendant's motions. The judge also awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $967.50, broken down into $322.50 per motion.

The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant, written responses to the defendant's special interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days of notice of this order. The judge also orders the plaintiff and counsel to pay the sanctions to the defendant.

The judge notes that the defendant's showing in support of the motions is sufficient, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process. The judge applies the civil discovery act and awards sanctions accordingly.

Summary:
This is a tentative ruling in case number 21STCV21554 regarding a vehicle accident that occurred on July 28, 2019. Plaintiff Paige Herbert filed a complaint against defendant William Hannaford on June 9, 2021, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. Defendant filed an answer on October 15, 2021. On May 9, 2023, defendant propounded discovery requests, which plaintiff did not respond to. Defendant then filed discovery motions on August 15, 2023, seeking an order deeming admitted the truth of requests for admission, an order compelling responses to special interrogatories, and an order compelling responses to requests for production of documents. Defendant also seeks sanctions in each motion. As plaintiff did not file any response to these motions, the court grants defendant's motions and orders plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant, written responses without objection within 30 days of notice of this order. The court also grants defendant's request for sanctions in the total amount of $967.50.
