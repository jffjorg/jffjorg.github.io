 Case Number:  23VECV00753    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00753 Garcia v Anderson [TENTATIVE] ORDER:   Defendant Lauren Anderson’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form  Interrogatories, Set Two, is DENIED. Defendant Lauren Anderson’s Motion to Compel Responses to  Special Interrogatories, Set Two, is DENIED. Defendant Lauren Anderson’s Motion to Compel Responses to  Request for Production, Set Three, is DENIED. Defendant Lauren Anderson’s Motion to Deem Request for  Admissions, Set One, Admitted is DENIED. Introduction  In four separate motions, Defendant Lauren Anderson  (Defendant) moved to compel Plaintiff Adalid Torres Garcia (Plaintiff) to  initially respond to form interrogatories, set 2 (FI), special interrogatories,  set 2 (SI), request for production, set 3 (RFP), and for an order to deem  request for admissions, set 1 (RFA) admitted.   Each motion requested monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the  separate amounts of $760.00 for the FI motion, $900.00 for the SI motion, $900.00  for the RFP motion, and $900.00 for the RFA motion. Plaintiff’s opposition was due April 24, 2024.  Despite proper service of all the motions,  Plaintiff did not file an opposition to any of the motions. Discussion  Defendant moved to compel initial responses.  (Code Civ. Proc. secs. 2030.290, 2031.300,  and 2033.280.)  Defendant submitted that  the all discovery demands were served upon Plaintiff.  (Heather Seigler (Seigler) Decl. par. 2, Exh.  1.)  Plaintiff requested and was granted  an extension to respond.  The deadline to  respond was extended to January 22, 2024.   (Seigler Decl. par. 3, for all motions.)   On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff served objections to the FI, SI, RFP, and  RFA. (Seigler Decl. par. 4, Exh. 2 for all motions.)  Defendant argued that verified responses were  not served. Despite Defendant’s contention otherwise, Plaintiff served  proper responses on January 22, 2024 by way of the objections.  Objections are a valid response.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2030.210, 2031.210,  and 2033.210.)  Plaintiff’s responses to  all discovery demands only consisted of objections.  A response that only contains objections need  not be signed/verified by the party to whom the discovery was directed.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2030.250, 2031.250,  and 2033.240.)    Responses only  consisting of objections need not be verified.   (Blue Ridge Insurance Co., v. Superior Court (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d  339, 344.)   Plaintiff’s counsel signed the objections/responses.  Because a valid response was served,  Defendant’s motion under Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2030.290, 2031.300,  and 2033.280 is improper because these statutes only apply to instances where no  valid responses were served.  Because  valid responses were served, Defendant was required to file a motion to compel  further responses.   Because Defendant moved under the incorrect statutes,  Defendant failed to meet their initial burden.    All four discovery motions, as well as their requests for  monetary sanctions, are DENIED. I__________________________________________[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Lauren Anderson’s Motion to Compel a Vehicle Inspection is
DENIED.Introduction Defendant Laruen Anderson (Defendant) moved to compel
Non-Party/Deponent Marco Heredia-Estrada’s (Deponent) compliance with a vehicle
inspection demand, including computerized testing.  Defendant requested $1,050.00 in monetary
sanctions against Deponent.Procedure The motion was served by electronic transmission/e-mail to
Attorney Macauley Ekpenesi, counsel for Plaintiff Adalid Torres Garcia.  The proof of service (POS) does not show any
service of the motion upon Deponent.  The Court further noted that Non-Party
Deponent is not shown to be represented by Mr. Ekpenesi.  Without proper service of the motion upon
Deponent, Defendant failed to provide Deponent with proper notice and
opportunity to be heard.  Without notice
and opportunity to be heard, any ruling on the instant motion would be
void.  Further, the Court noted that Defendant’s Notice of Motion
and the Points and Authorities relied upon Code of Civil Procedure, section
2031.310 as legal grounds to support the motion.  The statutory authority is inapplicable
because the statute only applies to parties to the action.  Deponent is expressly shown to be a
non-party.Defendant’s Inspection Demand/Deposition Subpoena was served
upon Deponent at 15918 Parthenia Street, North Hills, CA 91343 (Parthenia
Address).  (Heather Seigler (Seigler)
Decl. par. 3, Exh. A.)  However, within
Defendant’s own evidence, there are facts showing that the Parthenia Address is
not the Deponent’s residence.  (Seigler
Decl. par. 4, Exh. B.)  Defendant did not
present any facts to show that the Parthenia Address was Deponent’s current
residence.  Without facts contradicting
the facts presented in Defendant’s own motion regarding Deponent’s residence,
Defendant failed to show that the inspection demand/deposition subpoena was
properly served.













The motion for vehicle inspection is DENIED.Clerk to give notice.
