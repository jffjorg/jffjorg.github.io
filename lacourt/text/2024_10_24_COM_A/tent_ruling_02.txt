[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
AND REQUEST FOR DISMISSAL 
 
       The complaint alleges
a claim for negligence arising from an automobile collision causing injury to
Plaintiff. On June 4, 2024, the court granted Defendant’s motion to compel
responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for
production of documents ;and imposed monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. (Mot.
Ex. A). Defendant served Plaintiff with the court’s order on June 7, 2024.
(Mot. Ex. B). Defendant timely served this motion on Plaintiff by mail. Plaintiff
did not comply with the court’s order and did not oppose this motion. 
        Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for
punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to
prevent unfairness resulting from the lack of information. (Midwife
v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64.) 
       The type of
sanction imposed should be “appropriate to the dereliction,” and tailored to
accomplish the discovery sought. (Do
It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin &
Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 35.) There are two prerequisites
for the imposition of a discovery sanction: “(1) there must be a failure to
comply [with a valid discovery order] . . . and (2) the failure must be
willful.” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal. App. 3d 96, 114.) Despite
imposition of monetary sanctions, Plaintiff did not provide discovery
responses. 
       Plaintiff’s
failure to respond to discovery propounded by Defendant and failure to comply
with the court’s order are abuses of the discovery process warranting
terminating sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) 
       Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
