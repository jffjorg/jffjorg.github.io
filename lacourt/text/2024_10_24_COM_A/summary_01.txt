And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' six motions to compel further responses from the defendants, GD Midea Air Conditioning Equipment Co., Ltd. and Wuhu Maty Air-Conditioning Equipment Co., Ltd., to written discovery requests. The defendants had filed identical, boilerplate objections to each request, despite being given extensions of time to respond. The judge finds that the defendants' responses were deficient and that the plaintiffs are entitled to monetary sanctions. The defendants are ordered to provide further, verified, complete responses to all requests at issue within 10 days. The judge also imposes monetary sanctions of $1,700 in fees and costs of $180 against each defendant and their defense counsel, jointly and severally, payable to the plaintiffs within 10 days.
