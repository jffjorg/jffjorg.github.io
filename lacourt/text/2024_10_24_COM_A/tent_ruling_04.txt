 Amber Hendree v. Santander Consumer USA dba Chrysler Capital & Lithia Motors,
 Inc., et al.
October 24,
2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING
 DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH 30 DAYS LEAVE TO
AMEND
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The action
arises from Plaintiff’s purchase of a vehicle on March 9, 2023, from Costa
Mesa-CHD (“Dealer”), who allegedly assigned the finance contract to Defendant,
Santander Consumer, USA, Inc. dba Chrysler Capital (“Chrysler Capital”). The first
amended complaint alleges that Defendants allegedly misrepresented the finance
contract terms, engaged in fraudulent debt collection practices, and wrongfully
repossessed the vehicle.  Plaintiff
alleges 29 causes of action for statutory violations and related common law
claims. 
       Chrysler
Capital demurs to all 29 causes of action on grounds that Plaintiff’s
allegations are conclusory and do not allege facts to support the conclusions.
Defendant timely filed and served the demurrer on Plaintiff and the Dealer. No
opposition has been filed. 
II.     
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th
1702, 1706.) In testing the complaint’s sufficiency, the court must assume the
truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations as well as facts that can be
reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded facts. The court may also
consider matters properly subject to judicial notice. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
       The court may not consider contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.) Plaintiff is
required to allege facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause of
action. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81
Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer. (Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th
1112, 1126.)
       Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity that is
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  Whether the Plaintiff will be able to prove
the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d
605, 609–610.) 
       A demurrer may also be sustained if a
complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual
allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
       A pleading is required to assert general
allegations of ultimate fact. Evidentiary facts are not required. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47; Lim
v. The.TV Corp. Internat. (2002) 99 Cal. App.
4th 684, 690.) However, unlike federal courts, California state courts are not
a notice pleading jurisdiction, and notice alone is not a sufficient basis for
any pleading. California is a fact pleading jurisdiction. Merely putting an
opposing party on notice is not sufficient. (Bach
v. County of Butte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d
554, 561; see Diodes,
Inc. v. Franzen (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d
244, 250.)
III.   
DISCUSSION
1.     
Claims for violations of statute are required to
be alleged with specificity. 
   Where a claim is
based entirely on statutory liability, “it is indispensable that [plaintiff] plead
facts demonstrating [the] right to recover under the statute. The complaint
must plead every fact which is essential to the cause of action under the
statute. (Green
v. Grimes-Stassforth Stationery Co. (1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 52, 56.) If
the statute contains a limitation in the clause creating and defining the
liability, plaintiff must “negative” the limitation in the complaint. (Id.)

   The claims
falling within this category are the 1st cause of action for
violation of Plaintiff’s civil rights under 42 USC § 1983; 3rd cause
of action for violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”), 4th
cause of action for violation of the Unfair Competition law (Bus. and Prof Code
§ 17200, 5th cause of action for violation of Civ. Code, § 1788
(Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices (“RFDCPA”), 6th cause of Truth
in Lending Act (“TILA”), 7th cause of action for violation Federal Debt
Collection Practices Act, the 8th cause of action for predatory lending, 9
cause of action for failure to perfect the security interest, 11th
cause of action for fraudulent transfer of a security interest, 12th
cause of action for identity theft, 13th cause of action for filing
a “fraudulent return,” 14th cause of action for fraud and false
statements on a tax return, 15th cause of action for violating the
Consumer Credit Reporting Act, the 16th cause of action for
violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices, 22nd cause of
action wrongful repossession by breach of peace, the 23rd cause of
action for grand theft, 25th cause of action for forgery, 26th
cause of action for violations of the Securities Act, 
    Plaintiff does not identify the elements of
each statute at issue or specific acts engaged in by Defendant constituting a
violation. All allegations are conclusions of law. 
   With respect to
the section 1983 civil rights claim, Plaintiff does not allege facts to support
the assertion that Defendant was operating under color of state law, or the
manner in which Plaintiff’s 14th amendment rights were violated.
Plaintiff concludes without facts that Defendants’ actions “clearly” deprived
Plaintiff of her constitutional rights. (FAC, ¶¶ 3, 5:12-16.)
   With respect to
the TILA claim, Plaintiff did not allege actionable conduct on the part of
Defendant, only the Dealer. 
   The CLRA claim also
fails as it does not allege that Plaintiff complied with the pre-filing notice
requirement at least 30 days before filing a CLRA damage claim. (Morgan
v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1259.
Plaintiff did not allege that she notified Defendant and demanded correction,
repair, or replacement of the goods. (Id.;  Civ.
Code, § 1770.)
   Plaintiff does
not allege what “deceptive practice” is prohibited by statute or facts
demonstrating the misconduct that Defendant purportedly engaged in. (FAC, ¶5.) 
   With respect to
the UCL violation, Plaintiff did not allege with “reasonable particularity” the facts supporting the statutory elements
of the violation. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619 [Where Plaintiff did not identify the
statutory scheme which was allegedly violated and the particular facts
supporting the violation].)  To the
extent the UCL claim is based on underlying statutory violations, it is equally
deficient as the underlying claims are not alleged with specific facts. 
   Plaintiff does not identify specific acts of
misconduct that constitute predatory lending as identified in Finance Code,
section 4973. 
2.     
The fraud and fraud-related claims are not
alleged with factual specificity. 
       The claims falling
in this category are the  2nd
causes of action for fraud, 11th cause of action for fraudulent transfer
of a security interest, 14th cause of action for fraud and false
statements on a tax return, 17th cause of action for fraudulent
representation or concealment of facts, 21st cause of action for
false or misleading advertising, and the 24th cause of action for fraudulent
concealment 
       Fraud claims require specific allegations
of facts to support the following elements: (1) a misrepresentation, (2) made
with knowledge of its falsity, (3) Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff,
i.e., induce Plaintiff’s reliance, (4) Plaintiff justifiably relied on the
misrepresentation, (5) causing damage. (Nagy v. Nagy (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1262, 1268.) 
       Plaintiff’s general
and conclusory allegations do not meet these standards. 
3.     
Plaintiff alleges claims that are not recognized
causes of action 
       The 18th
cause of action fall for failure to include an arbitration clause in the
alleged contract falls within this category. The 19th cause of
action for willful neglect to arbitrate appears to be  claim for breach of contract, however,
material terms of the contract are not alleged, and it also conflicts with the
18th cause of action for failure to include such a clause. 
       The 27th
claim for unjust enrichment is not a cause of action but is an equitable
principle that underlies “various legal doctrines and remedies.” (County
of San Bernardino v. Walsh (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 533, 542.)
Plaintiff must allege the “receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the
benefit at the expense of another.” (Lectrodryer
v. Seoulbank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726.) A person is enriched
if the person receives a benefit (any type of advantage) at another's expense. (First
Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662.) The
claim does not allege facts. 
       The 28th
cause of action for equitable estoppel must be “especially pleaded in the
complaint with sufficient accuracy to disclose facts relied upon.” (Chalmers
v. County of Los Angeles 175 Cal.App.3d 461, 467 (1985).) This claim is
devoid of any facts. 
4.     
The common law claims are inadequately alleged. 
       The 10th
cause of action for conversion, 20th cause of action for breach of
contract and the 29th cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress are not supported by any facts.  A claim for conversion requires allegations
describing Plaintiff’s ownership interest at the time of the conversion and
Defendants’ wrongful act or dispossession of Plaintiffs’ property rights. (Moore
v. Regents of University of California (1990)
51 Cal.3d 120, 136.) The basic elements are (1) the plaintiff's ownership
or right to possession of personal property; (2) the defendant's disposition of
the property in a manner that is inconsistent with the plaintiff's property
rights; and (3) resulting damages. (Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
       A claim for
breach of contract must allege the material terms verbatim or by alleging its
legal effect. Plaintiff may also attach a copy of the contract as an
exhibit.  (Holly Sugar Corp. v.
Johnson (1941)  18 Cal. 2d 218,
225;  Twaite v. Allstate Ins. Co.
(1989) 216 Cal. App. 3d 239, 252. The FAC fails to meet any of these
requirements. 
       The intentional infliction of emotional
distress claim concludes that Defendant engaged in outrageous conduct. To
prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, plaintiff
must allege facts showing (1) extreme and outrageous conduct with the intention
of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional
distress, (2) Plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress, and (3)
actual and proximate causation. (Christensen
v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903.) The allegations are
conclusory, and Plaintiff’s allegations of Defendant’s alleged misconduct are
either vague, non-specific, or non-existent. 
IV.    CONCLUSION
       Based on the foregoing, the demurrer to
the entire first amended complaint is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to amend. (Colvig v. RKO General, Inc. (1965)
232 Cal.App.2d 56, 69–70
[noting the “well-established rule that, even where the defect is one of
substance, a demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if there
is a possibility that subsequent amendments will supply omitted allegations and
the plaintiff has not had a fair opportunity to so amend."].)
