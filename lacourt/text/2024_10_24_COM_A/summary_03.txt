And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to determine the fair market value of the real property and send a buyout notice to all parties. The plaintiff and defendant, George Moa, each own an undivided, one-half interest in the property. The City of Lynwood recorded liens against the property, and the plaintiff and city signed a stipulation acknowledging the superiority of the liens. The plaintiff requests that the court determine the fair market value of the property, but the court finds that there is no evidence demonstrating that the evidentiary value of an appraisal is outweighed by the cost of the appraisal. The court also finds that the plaintiff's witness, Aaron Montelongo, is not qualified as an appraisal expert. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion and orders that the fair market value of the property be determined through an appraisal by a licensed and disinterested real estate appraiser.
