And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and request for dismissal. The Plaintiff failed to comply with the court's order to provide discovery responses, despite being served with the order and being subject to monetary sanctions. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order and respond to discovery propounded by the Defendant was an abuse of the discovery process, warranting terminating sanctions. The Judge noted that discovery sanctions should be used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery and prevent unfairness resulting from a lack of information, and that the sanction imposed should be tailored to accomplish the discovery sought. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order and respond to discovery was willful and that terminating sanctions were appropriate. As a result, the Defendant's motion is granted and the case will be dismissed.
