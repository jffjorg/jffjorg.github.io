And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication. The motion is denied due to the defendants' failure to comply with the California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1350(d) and (h) regarding the format of their separate statement. The separate statement fails to identify the cause of action related to each issue and includes material facts not pertinent to the disposition of the motion. The court also sustains the plaintiff's objections to certain declarations and deposition transcripts. The motion for summary judgment is denied, and the motion for summary adjudication is denied as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action. The defendants are required to give notice of the court's ruling.
