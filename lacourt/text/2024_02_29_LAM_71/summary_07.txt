And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel filed by Giandomenic Vitiello, Edison Downtown's counsel. The motion is granted because Vitiello has submitted the required forms and has provided a declaration stating that there is a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and such a motion should be granted if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. Therefore, Vitiello will be relieved as counsel for Edison Downtown upon filing proof of service on his client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
