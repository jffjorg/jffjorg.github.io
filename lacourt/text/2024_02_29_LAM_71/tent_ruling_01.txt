EOK JIN KIM,  
  
         vs.
 
JISUK KIM, et al.


 Case No.: 
  20STCV24190
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 29, 2024



 
Defendants Jisuk Kim’s and Chris J. Lee’s motion
for summary judgment of Plaintiff Eok Jin Kim’s second amended complaint is
denied.   
Defendants Jisuk Kim’s and Chris J. Lee’s motion
in the alternative for summary judgment adjudication is denied as to the 1st
and 2nd causes of action.

 
Defendants Jisuk
Kim (“Jisuk”) and Chris J. Lee (“Lee”) (collectively, “Defendants”)[1]
move for summary judgment of Plaintiff Eok Jin Kim’s (“Eok Jin”) (“Plaintiff”) second
amended complaint (“SAC”).[2]  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §437c.)
Defendants move
in the alternative for summary adjudication of three issues with regard to the
two causes of action: (1) Jisuk and Lee are entitled to judgment as a matter of
law because Plaintiff never conveyed or reserved a life estate; (2) Plaintiff
cannot prevail on his cause of action for financial elder abuse; and (3)
Plaintiff cannot prevail on his cause of action for quiet title to all or any
part of the real property that is the subject of this action.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2.)

Plaintiff’s 2/15/24
evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Jisuk Kim (“Jisuk”) are sustained
as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, and
overruled as to No. 17. 
Plaintiff’s 2/15/24
evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Chis Lee (“Lee”) are overruled as
to Nos. 1 and 2.
Plaintiff’s
2/15/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Gary A. Laff (“Laff”) are sustained
as to Exhibits 6 and 8.
Plaintiff’s
2/15/24 evidentiary objections to deposition transcript exhibits are overruled.
 
CRC Violations
CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) provides that when
multiple causes of action, issues or defenses are presented for summary
adjudication in one motion, each cause of action, issue or defense to which the
motion is directed must have a separate section heading indicating the issue
number, cause of action, and specifying the issue. The headings must be
followed by two columns.  (CRC,
Rule 3.1350(d); see CRC, Rule 3.1350(h) [illustrating format
for separate statements in a motion for summary adjudication].)  Failure to comply with the requirements for
filing a separate statement may in the trial judge’s discretion constitute a
sufficient ground for denial of the motion.  (C.C.P. §437c(b)(1).)
Defendants’ separate statement is in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(h) because it fails to follow the format
required for submitted a separate statement. 
Further, Defendants’ separate statement fails to identify the cause of
action related to each issue in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(d).  (See, e.g., Defendants’ Separate
Statement, Issue No. 1.)  Further, CRC,
Rule 3.1350(d)(2) states the separate statement should include only
material facts and not any facts that are not pertinent to the disposition of
the motion.  Defendants’ separate
statement fails to address material facts at issue in the SAC and instead
addresses issues that are not material, or not at issue in SAC.  
Finally,
Defendants’ memorandum of points and authorities fails to cite to the numbered
separate statement and instead cites to individual pieces of evidence.  Defendants’ failure to cite to the separate
statement in its argument provides the Court no assistance in determining if
the separate statement includes the cited evidence used to support Defendants’
argument.  
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and
alternatively motion for summary adjudication is denied on the basis their separate
statement is defective.

2023, Defendants filed the instant motion. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on February 15, 2024.  Defendants filed their reply on February 22,
2024.

motion for summary judgment is denied.
Defendants’
motion in the alternative for summary adjudication is denied as to the 1st and
2nd causes of action.
