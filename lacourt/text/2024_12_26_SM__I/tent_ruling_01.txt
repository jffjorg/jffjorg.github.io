  Case Number:  21SMCV01441    Hearing Date:   December 26, 2024    Dept:  I At the last hearing, the court set forth various questions
that it had concerning the amount of fees and the amount of money the named
plaintiff was getting in light of the relatively small total settlement.  No supplemental papers have been filed.  The motion to approve the settlement is
therefore DENIED without prejudice if the parties elect to file a response to
the court’s questions.  Otherwise, the
court will re-set the trial date. 
Because the matter is on calendar for January 3, 2025, that would seem
to be an appropriate time to discuss how best to go forward.
