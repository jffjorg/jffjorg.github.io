Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by defendants 5600 Gateway and H.B.D. The motion seeks judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the plaintiff, Marlo Hempstead, has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact in support of his claims for negligence, negligent hiring, premises liability, and assault and battery. The defendants have presented evidence that they do not employ security guards on the property and that the incident in which Hempstead was shot occurred on neighboring property, not on the defendants' property. The plaintiff has failed to oppose the motion, and therefore, the defendants have met their burden to show that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court if the parties neither submit nor appear at the scheduled hearing.
