And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Dale Thompson, who is 13 years old. The petition was filed on January 25, 2024, and the proposed settlement is for $22,000, with $4,000 going to Dale Thompson and $1,000 for attorneys' fees. The petition is denied due to the lack of attachments, specifically a declaration from the attorney explaining the basis of the request for attorney fees and a copy of the written attorney fee agreement. Additionally, the attorney must identify each party and explain the relationship between the parties. The petitioner must file a new petition curing these defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date, scheduled for March 11, 2024.
