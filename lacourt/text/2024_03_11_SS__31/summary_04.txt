And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling finds that Plaintiff Edgar Esturban's motion to compel ZLS Trans Inc. to respond to special interrogatories is moot since ZLS has already served responses prior to the hearing. However, the Court does impose sanctions against ZLS and its counsel for serving the responses late, ordering them to pay $560 to Plaintiff within 20 days. The ruling also notes that the parties should meet and confer to reach an agreement and that the Court may take the motion off calendar if parties do not submit or appear at the hearing.
