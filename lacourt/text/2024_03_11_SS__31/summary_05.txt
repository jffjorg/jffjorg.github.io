And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted a motion filed by Counsel, Igor Fradkin, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Felix Roth. Counsel claims that the plaintiff is no longer responsive to his attempts at communication and no longer follows his advice, making it impossible for Counsel to continue representing the plaintiff. The trial is currently set for May 2, 2024, and the judge believes that there is sufficient time for the plaintiff to seek new counsel or prepare before the trial. The judge orders Counsel to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. Unless all parties submit to the tentative ruling, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
