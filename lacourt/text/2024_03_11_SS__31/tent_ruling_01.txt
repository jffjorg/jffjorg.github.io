Additionally, a copy of the written attorney fee agreement must be provided in Attachment 14a.   Lastly, because the attorney is representing another party involved in this matter, Item 18 requires an Attachment 18a (identifying each party and explaining the relationship.).   Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
