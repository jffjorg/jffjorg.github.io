Demurrer to Complaint and Motion to Strike 
 
The court has
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
The hearing on
the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Aracely Santoyo is
CONTINUED to Tuesday, June 4, 2024 at 8:30 AM in this department so that the
parties can engage in meet and confer discussions. Defendant has not satisfied
the meet and confer requirement pursuant to CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5. 
 
Background
            This
is an action arising from the alleged wrongful possession of a mobilehome. On
October 11, 2023, Plaintiff Judith Collie (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
Claim and Delivery against Defendant Aracelly Santoyo. 
            On
December 14, 2023, a Notice of Related Case was filed indicating that the
instant action was related to Aracely Santoyo v. Judith Collie, et al.,
LASC Case No. 21STCV07423 (the “Underlying Action”), which was filed on
February 25, 2021 and is pending in Department 45 of this Court. 
            On
January 17, 2024, Defendant Aracely Santoyo (“Defendant”), who indicates that
she was erroneously sued and served as “Aracelly Santoyo,” filed and served the
instant demurrer to the Complaint, as well as a motion to strike. 
            On
February 1, 2024, the Court issued an order deeming the instant action and the
Underlying Action as related cases with the Underlying Action being the lead
case. (02/01/24 Minute Order.) 
On April 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed a combined opposition to the demurrer and motion to
strike, to which Defendant replied on April 25, 2024. 
 
Judicial Notice
            The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code
§§ 452 and 453. 
 
Meet and Confer
            Before
filing a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 430.41, 435.5.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer” or to grant or deny a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41,
subd. (a)(4), 435.5.)
            In
support of the demurrer and motion to strike, counsel for Defendant, Yasmine
Tabatabai (“Tabatabai”), provides a declaration. Counsel declares the
following: on January 17, 2024, she sent correspondence to Plaintiff explaining
that in the interest of time, Defendant would need to file her Demurrer and
Motion to Strike with the Court, and provided Plaintiff with the legal and
factual grounds in support thereof so the parties could discuss. (Tabatabai
Decls., ¶ 3.) Counsel indicated that she would be willing to take the motion
off-calendar if Plaintiff agreed to dismiss her Complaint within a reasonable
time (by 5:00 PM on January 24, 2024). (Tabatabai Decls., ¶ 3.) Counsel states
that she has and will continue to make good faith attempts to meet and confer
with Plaintiff to discuss the Demurrer and Motion to Strike and to resolve the
issues raised in the motions prior to the hearing. (Tabatabai Decls., ¶ 3.) In
her supplemental declaration in connection with the reply brief, Ms. Tabatabai
does not set forth any meet and confer efforts. 
            The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement has not been met as there was not a meet and confer
discussion in person, by telephone, or by video conference. Based on the
declaration of counsel, no meet and confer discussions have occurred between
Ms. Tabatabai and Plaintiff, who is representing herself in pro per.
Thus, the meet and confer requirement has not been satisfied. 
            Due to the meet and confer
requirement not being met, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the demurrer and
motion to strike. The Court continues the hearing on Defendant’s demurrer and
motion to strike to Tuesday, June 4, 2024 at 8:30 AM in this department. The
Court orders the parties to meet and confer in compliance with CCP §§ 430.41
and 435.5. Defendant is ordered to file a declaration satisfying the meet and
confer requirement at least five court days before the continued hearing date. 
            This department strictly enforces
the meet and confer requirement prior to ruling on a demurrer or motion to
strike. As such, due to the insufficient meet and confer, the Court will not
assess the merits of the demurrer or motion to strike at this time. 
 
 
It is so
ordered.
