Valadez v. Becerra, et al.DEMURRER
(CCP §§ 430.31,
et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Martin
Becerra’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Jonathan Valadez (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the instant action
against Defendant Martin Becerra (“Defendant”) on March 14, 2024. Defendant
filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint on May 2, 2024. The Demurrer was
initially set for hearing on June 10, 2024 at which time the matter was
continued to allow Defendant to demonstrate service of the moving papers and
notice of hearing. (Minute Order, 06/10/24.) Defendant filed proof of service
of the Demurrer and new hearing date on July 26, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Meet and Confer Decl.,
filed 05/02/24.) Defendant demurs to the Complaint for failure to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) 
 
The Complaint does not
allege any cause of action by name. Rather, it provides an incoherent set of
facts that appear to hold Defendant responsible for Plaintiff’s loss of income
following an arrest. (Compl., pp. 1-2.) However, even those allegations are not
entirely clear. There is also a statement that Defendant has been verbally
harassing Plaintiff, but no connection between this harassment and damages
Plaintiff allegedly sustained is set forth. Based on the foregoing, the
Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and the
Demurrer is sustained on that basis. 
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.) Plaintiff has not filed an opposition
to the Demurrer demonstrating is possible to correct the defects noted above.
Leave to amend is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Martin
Becerra’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
