ANALYSIS:
 
On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff Urban Therapies
Distribution, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
breach of contract and common counts against Defendants Treehouse Botanicals
Corporation (“Defendant Treehouse”), Ariel Mehrban (“Defendant Merhban”), and Jillian
Goldsmith (“Defendant Goldsmith”). Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint on December 20, 2023. On June 11, 2024, Defendant Treehouse brought a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production, Set Two, and Request for Sanctions on August
5, 2024. Defendants filed an opposition on August 30, 2024 and Plaintiff
replied on September 10, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Upon
receipt of responses to discovery requests, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that the
responses are evasive, incomplete, an objection is without merit or too
general. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) A motion for an order
compelling further responses shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2)) and notice of the
motion shall be given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the
parties have agreed in writing, or the party requesting the order waives any
right to compel further responses (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
Defendant
served responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two,
on July 12, 2024, respectively. The instant motion was timely filed less than
one month later. However, the Motion is not accompanied by a separate statement
of the discovery items in dispute. Despite referring to a separate statement in
support of the Motion, no such document was filed or served. Accordingly, the
Court will continue the hearing on the Motion to allow for the filing and
service of moving and opposing separate statements.
