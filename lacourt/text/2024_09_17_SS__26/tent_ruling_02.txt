ANALYSIS: 
 

On July 25, 2022, Plaintiff Elias
Zepeda (“Judgment Creditor”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants
Bungalow 40, LLC, Houman Arasteh, and Santa Monica Hudson Associates Limited
Partnership (“Judgment Debtor SMHALP”). Default judgment was entered against
Judgment Debtor SMHALP on October 10, 2022 in the amount of $4,000.00
principal, $800.00 attorney’s fees, and $427.90 costs. (Default Judgment,
10/10/22, ¶6.) 
 
On April 18, 2023, Judgment
Creditor filed a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgment of Credit,
and Declaration of Accrued Interest in the total amount of  $1,184.40. (Memo of Costs, filed
04/18/23, ¶1.) Of these costs, $1,000.00 were for post-judgment attorney’s
fees. (Ibid.) Judgment Creditor filed a second post-judgment Memorandum
of Costs on September 28, 2023, seeking an additional $1,000.00 in attorney’s
fees and $14.20 for e-filing. (Memo of Costs, filed 09/28/23, ¶1.) On October
16, 2023, Judgment Creditor filed a writ of execution. 
 
Judgment Debtor SMHALP filed a Motion For Order Requiring
Acknowledgement Of Satisfaction Of Judgment And For Attorney Fees on May 22,
2024. That Motion was denied on July 18, 2024. (Minute Order, 07/18/24.)
Judgment Debtor SMHALP filed the instant Motion to Tax Costs on July 3, 2024.
Judgment Creditor filed an opposition on July 26, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Debtor SMHALP moves to tax the costs from Judgment
Creditor’s Memorandum of Post-Judgment Costs, filed on June 13, 2024. The
Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.070 on the
grounds that the request for post-judgment attorney’s fees through a memorandum
of costs is improper. The Motion admits that it was brought five days late. A
motion to tax post-judgment costs must be filed within ten days of service of the
memorandum of costs. (Code of Civ. Proc., §
685.070, subd. (c).) The Court has discretion to allow a late filed
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The
case to which Judgment Debtor cites explains that the Court is entitled to
provide relief pursuant to the discretionary provision of Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). (Douglas v. Willis (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 287, 290-292.) Discretionary relief is available for mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).) 
 
Judgment Creditor contends that discretionary relief is unavailable
because Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake in filing the Motion late was not
excusable. Plaintiff’s counsel explains that they relied on the 15-day deadline
applicable to motions to tax pre-judgment costs set forth in Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1). (Motion, Browne Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Judgment Creditor
points out that a mistake of law must not be one that falls below the standard
of care in practicing law and argues that failing to follow a black letter rule
does. (Citing State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 611; Anderson v. Sherman (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 228, 238.)
The case law regarding the Court’s exercise of discretionary relief is well
established:
 
“A party who seeks relief under section
473 on the basis of mistake or inadvertence of counsel must demonstrate that
such mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect was excusable because the
negligence of the attorney is imputed to his client and may not be offered by
the latter as a basis for relief.” (Generale Bank Nederland v. Eyes of the
Beholder Ltd. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1399, 72 Cal.Rptr.2d 188.) In
determining whether the attorney's mistake or inadvertence was excusable, “the
court inquires whether ‘a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar
circumstances' might have made the same error.’ ” (Bettencourt v. Los Rios
Community College Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276, 228 Cal.Rptr. 190, 721 P.2d
71, italics added.) In other words, the discretionary relief provision of
section 473 only permits relief from attorney error “fairly imputable to the
client, i.e., mistakes anyone could have made.” (Garcia, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th
at p. 682, 68 Cal.Rptr.2d 228.) “Conduct falling below the professional
standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to properly advance an
argument, is not therefore excusable. To hold otherwise would be to eliminate
the express statutory requirement of excusability and effectively eviscerate
the concept of attorney malpractice.” (Ibid.)
 
(Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28
Cal.4th 249, 258.) As Judgment Creditor points out, the rule regarding the
deadline to file a motion to tax costs for post-judgment costs is clearly set
forth in the moving statute and is indicated on the post-judgment memorandum of
costs itself. Judgment Debtor’s attorney, therefore, has not shown that relief
from the late-file Motion to Tax Costs is available.
