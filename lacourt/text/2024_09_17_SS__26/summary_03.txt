And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Fox Hills Auto, Inc. dba Airport Marina Ford's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admission admitted. The Judge orders Defendant Karen Diaz to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of the order. The Judge also awards sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $2,640.00.

The Judge's ruling is based on Defendant's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests, which constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The Judge notes that there is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before filing a motion to compel initial responses or a motion to deem requests for admission admitted. However, the Judge denies the motion to deem requests for admission admitted because Defendant's responses to the requests for admission were in substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220 and were served prior to the hearing date.
