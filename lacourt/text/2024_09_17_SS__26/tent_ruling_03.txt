ANALYSIS:
 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff Fox Hills Auto, Inc. dba
Airport Marina Ford (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Karen Diaz (“Defendant”). (Motions, Gubernick Decl., Exh. 1.) To date,
Defendant has not served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶2.)
Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One,
Admitted; and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (3) Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions; and (4) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions, on July 25, 2024. 
 
The Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One,
Admitted, was set for hearing on September 10, 2024. The Motion to Compel Responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (3) Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions, were set for hearing on September 12, 2024. Finally, the Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions
was set to be heard on September 17, 2024. 
 
On September 9, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the
Motions and responses to the discovery requests. At the hearing on September
10, 2024, in light of the late opposition, the Court continued all the Motions
to be heard together on September 17, 2024. (Minute Order, 09/10/24.) 
 
Discussion
 
Motions to Compel Initial Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, Sets One
 
Defendant’s responses to the discovery requests were not
timely served within 30 days of service. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260,
subd. (a); 2031.260, subd. (a); 2033.250, subd. (a).) The responses were served
on September 6, 2024, almost five months after the discovery was propounded.
(Responses, filed 09/09/24.) There is no requirement
for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses
can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can
be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) There is no authority cited in the opposition for relief
from the discovery motions based on service of discovery responses days before
the hearing on the motions to compel initial responses. Based on Defendant’s
failure to timely respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to
an order compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests
without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure
to timely respond to the interrogatories and requests for production constitutes
a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Under a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are granted against Defendant in the amount of $1,980.00 based on three
hours of attorney time billed at $600.00 per hour, plus $180.00 in filing fees.
(Motions, Gubernick Decl., ¶5.)
 

Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted
 
Likewise, there is no requirement for a prior meet and
confer effort before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) However, a motion to deem requests for admission admitted shall be
denied if the Court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Defendant’s
responses to the Requests for Admission, Set One, are in substantial compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220 and were served prior to the
hearing date. Accordingly, the Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One,
Admitted, is denied. Sanctions must be awarded with this Motion, however, as
mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c). An
additional $780.00 in sanctions is awarded against Defendant.

Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions,

Plaintiff Fox Hills
Auto, Inc. dba Airport Marina Ford’s (4) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission,
Set One, and Request for Sanctions is DENIED WITH RESPECT TO DEEMING THE
