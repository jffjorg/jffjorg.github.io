And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Motion to Tax Costs filed by Santa Monica Associates Hudson, Ltd. (Judgment Debtor SMHALP) because it was filed late. The motion was filed five days after the deadline, and although the court has discretion to allow late-filed motions, Judgment Debtor SMHALP failed to show that the late filing was excusable. The judge found that Judgment Debtor's attorney's mistake in filing the motion late was not excusable because it was a failure to follow a clear and well-established rule regarding the deadline for filing motions to tax post-judgment costs.
