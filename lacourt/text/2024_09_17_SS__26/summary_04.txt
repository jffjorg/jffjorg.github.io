And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's renewed motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The plaintiff, Aaron Sayles, had previously filed a motion to compel arbitration against the defendants, Westlake Service, LLC, Hudson Insurance Company, and Las Playas Auto Sales Inc. However, the judge denied the initial motion, and the plaintiff has now filed a renewed motion. The judge has found that the renewed motion does not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which requires a party seeking reconsideration to show new or different facts, circumstances, or law. As a result, the judge lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the prior ruling. The judge has set an order to show cause regarding the plaintiff's request for entry of default and default judgment for September 30, 2024.
