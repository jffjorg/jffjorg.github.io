Discussion

 
Petitioner moves
pursuant to Civil Code section 786.88 for an order enjoining Respondents from
continuing violations of the rules of Petitioner’s Mobile Home Park, HiLeah
Village Mobile Home Park (“the Park”), located at 1560 S. Otterbein Avenue,
Rowland Heights, California. (Pet., ¶¶2-3.) Respondents’ Mobilehome is located
on Space 36 of the Park. (Ibid.) Respondents’ violations include improperly
storing items outside of the Mobilehome and on the Premises, failing to
maintain the condition of the Mobilehome and accessory structures, failing to
maintain the landscaping, and hanging laundry outside of the Mobilehome. (Id.
at ¶10.) This conduct violates the parties’ Rental Agreement at paragraphs 12,
and Park Rules at paragraphs B1, B2, B3, B6, C4, D3. (Id. at ¶¶9-10 and
Exh. 2.) 
 
Petitioner
requests an injunction against Respondents prohibiting further violations and
an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Id. at pp. 9:20-10:11.)
 
Legal Standard
 
The Mobilehome Residency Law (“MRL”) gives management an
injunctive relief remedy for violations of reasonable park rules and
regulations. (Civ. Code, § 798.88.) Specifically, management may obtain a
restraining order against a continuing or recurring violation of any
“reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, § 798.88, subd. (b); Rancho
Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1139,
1142.) At the time of the hearing, the court shall issue the injunction if it
finds by clear and convincing evidence the existence of a continuing or
recurring violation of a “reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, § 798.88,
subd. (d).) The duration of the injunction may not exceed three years. (Civ.
Code, § 798.88, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
Although the moving statute does not provide for a specific
notice period, Respondents are entitled to reasonable notice prior to issuance
of an order on the Petition. (See Menefee & Son v. Dent. of Food
&Agriculture (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 774, 781.) Failure to give notice is
a violation of due process. (Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754,
757.) Petitioner filed proofs of personal service on September 3, 2024 that
state Respondents were personally served on August 24, 2024. (Proofs of
Personal Service, ¶3.) Therefore, Petitioner has provided Respondents with
reasonable notice. 
 
Substantively, the Petition is supported by declarations and
exhibits documenting the parties’ contractual relationship and Respondents’
violations of the Park rules. Specifically, the declarations are of the Park’s Maintenance
Supervisor, Cecilia Fernandez, and Resident Manager, Martha Plata. Plata
declares that Respondents have resided at the Park since September 2006, pursuant to a written Rental Agreement.
(Pet., Plata Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 1.) The
Park’s Rules and Regulations are incorporated into the Lease agreement. (Id.
at ¶3 and Exh. 2, ¶12.) Respondents have been in violation of the lease
agreement at paragraph 12 and the Park Rules at paragraphs B1, B2, B3,
B6, C4, D3 since October 2023 and thereafter. (Id. at ¶4; Fernandez
Decl., ¶¶5-6 and Exhs. A-B.) Specifically, Respondents have improperly stored items
outside of the Mobilehome, have damaged stairs that need to be repaired and
recarpeted; have overgrown plants on the Premises; and have items blocking
access to the utility pedestal (Plata Decl., ¶¶4-5 and Exhs. 3-4; Fernandez
Decl., ¶¶5-6 and Exhs. A-B.)
 
Petitioner issued two seven-day notices to comply with Park
Rules to Respondents on October 30-31, 2023 and April 11, 2024. (Pet., Plata
Decl., Exhs. 3-4.) All the violations remain ongoing as of the filing of this
Petition. (Pet., Plata Decl., ¶11.) The Petition, therefore, provides clear and
convincing evidence of Respondents’ violations of the Park’s reasonable Rules
and Regulations. Nor have Respondents filed any response to the Petition. 
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Pomona
Islander, LP dba Pomona Islander Mobile Home Park’s Petition for Permanent Injunction is GRANTED. PETITIONER IS TO FILE A
PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give
notice.
