And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Fasica Shiferaw's motion to vacate an earlier order. The motion was filed on August 28, 2024, but it was not accompanied by proof of service demonstrating that the motion papers and notice of hearing were served on the defendant. Additionally, the motion was not filed at least 16 court days prior to the hearing date, as required by law. Furthermore, the motion did not include a memorandum of points and authorities, as required by the California Rules of Court. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to provide a memorandum was an admission that the request was without merit and cause for its denial.
