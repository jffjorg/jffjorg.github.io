And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Martin Becerra, has filed a demurrer to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Jonathan Valadez. The demurrer is based on the argument that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has reviewed the complaint and agrees with the defendant's argument. The complaint is unclear and does not provide a clear cause of action. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint and has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's case will be dismissed unless they can file a new complaint that satisfies the requirements of the law.
