Shiferaw
v. United Checker Cab Co-Op, et al.MOTION
TO VACATE ORDERTENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Fasica Shiferaw’s Motion to Vacate Order is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Fasica Shiferaw (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for motor
vehicle negligence against Defendant Administrative Services Cooperative, Inc. (erroneously
sued as United Checker Cab CO-OP) (“Defendant”) on April 5, 2022. Defendant
answered the Complaint on January 23, 2024. On August 7, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, Sets One, and Request
for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 08/07/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Order on August
28, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion is not accompanied by any proof of
service demonstrating service of the motion papers or notice of hearing on Defendant.
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Nor was the Motion filed at least 16 court
days prior to the hearing date, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
1005.
 
Finally, the Motion is not
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The
memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(b).) The Motion, however, cites no legal authority in support of
the request for relief. (Motion, pp. 3:1-5:4.) Indeed, Plaintiff’s failure to
provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the
[request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Fasica Shiferaw’s Motion to
Vacate Order is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
