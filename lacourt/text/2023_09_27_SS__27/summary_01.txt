And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling in the case of Judi Hughes v. Alvin S. Friedman (Case No. 20STCV29543). The case involves a dog bite and a motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The Plaintiff, Judi Hughes, initially sought punitive damages but was denied by the Court after the Defendant, Alvin S. Friedman, filed a motion to strike punitive damages. The Plaintiff now seeks to reassert a request for punitive damages and add new factual allegations to support the request.

The Court considered the legal standard for allowing amendments to pleadings and the requirements for a motion to amend a pleading. The Court noted that public policy dictates that leave to amend be liberally granted, but that the Court should consider whether the proposed amendment is sufficient to state a valid cause of action or defense.

The Court found that the proposed first amended complaint is moot because the Defendant will file a motion to strike the proposed amendment if the Court grants the motion, and the trial date is less than 30 days away. The Court continued the trial date to allow the Defendant to file a motion to strike and to conduct further discovery.

The motion for leave to file an amended complaint was denied as moot. The Court directed the parties to give notice of the ruling.

## English Summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger issued a tentative ruling in the case of *Judi Hughes v. Alvin S. Friedman*.  Plaintiff Hughes originally sued Defendant Friedman for dog bite injuries and initially sought punitive damages.  The judge previously struck the punitive damages claim because Hughes hadn't provided enough evidence to support it.

Hughes now wants to amend her complaint, adding back the punitive damages request with new supporting information.  Defendant Friedman objects, saying he needs time to file a new motion to strike the amended complaint if it's allowed.

Judge Bensinger intends to continue the trial date to give Friedman time to file his motion. As a result, the judge declared Hughes' motion for leave to amend as moot.

ruling:

- the trial date will be continued to allow Defendant to file a motion to strike the proposed first amended complaint

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling for a case between Judi Hughes (plaintiff) and Alvin S. Friedman (defendant). The case is about injuries arising from a dog bite. The plaintiff initially sought punitive damages, but the court granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages in January 2021. On August 18, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add punitive damages, which the defendant opposes. However, the judge has ruled that the motion is moot because the trial is set to begin in less than 30 days, and if the plaintiff is granted leave to amend, the defendant will file another motion to strike the punitive damages request. The judge is inclined to continue the trial date to allow the defendant to file a motion to strike and conduct further discovery. Therefore, the motion for leave to amend is denied as moot.
