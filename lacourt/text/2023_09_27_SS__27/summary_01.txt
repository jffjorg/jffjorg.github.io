And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling in the case of Judi Hughes v. Alvin S. Friedman (Case No. 20STCV29543). The case involves a dog bite and a motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The Plaintiff, Judi Hughes, initially sought punitive damages but was denied by the Court after the Defendant, Alvin S. Friedman, filed a motion to strike punitive damages. The Plaintiff now seeks to reassert a request for punitive damages and add new factual allegations to support the request.

The Court considered the legal standard for allowing amendments to pleadings and the requirements for a motion to amend a pleading. The Court noted that public policy dictates that leave to amend be liberally granted, but that the Court should consider whether the proposed amendment is sufficient to state a valid cause of action or defense.

The Court found that the proposed first amended complaint is moot because the Defendant will file a motion to strike the proposed amendment if the Court grants the motion, and the trial date is less than 30 days away. The Court continued the trial date to allow the Defendant to file a motion to strike and to conduct further discovery.

The motion for leave to file an amended complaint was denied as moot. The Court directed the parties to give notice of the ruling.
