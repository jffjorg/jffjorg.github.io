And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants summary adjudication to High Note, Inc. on the issue of whether Frontline Protection, Inc. owed a duty to provide security services and secure High Note's location. The court finds that the evidence shows that Frontline Protection, Inc. had a duty to provide at least one armed security guard and to secure High Note's location. The court denies summary adjudication on the other three issues, as they are not issues of duty, affirmative defense, claim for damages, or issue of duty.
