MOTION
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe I (“Plaintiff”) moves to consolidate this case with
related case number 23SMCV01272 for all purposes.  The motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:
 
When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
            Per Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g),
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”  (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) 
Once the Court relates the cases, the Court may consolidate the actions
and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e] a common question of law or
fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
            Here, the Court ordered the cases
related on December 20, 2023, so the motion is procedurally proper.  (See December 20, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
            However, the Court does not find
that consolidation would be in the best interest of the parties or promote
judicial economy at this juncture.  While
Plaintiff contends the two cases “share common questions of law and fact, arise
out of the same or substantially identical factual scenarios, and involve the
same defendants and principal actors,” ultimately, the cases involve separate
incidents experienced by separate plaintiffs. 
While there will be some, minimal overlap with respect to the common
defendants, ultimately, the factual circumstances underlying each plaintiff’s
claim, though similar in type, will largely involve facts and circumstances
unique to each plaintiff.  
 
            To the extent factual or legal
determinations made in one case apply with equal force to the other, the principles
of res judicata and collateral estoppel will adequately protect judicial
resources and mitigate the risk of inconsistent rulings.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate this case with related
case number 23SMCV01272 is denied.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
