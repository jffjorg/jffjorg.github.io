Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision made by Judge Michael E. Whitaker in the case of 23SMCV02619. The case concerns a dispute between neighbors over allegedly overgrown trees on Defendant Connie Chein's property, which obstruct the view from the property of Plaintiffs Skye Hoppus and Mark Hoppus, as trustees of the Rollo Tomassi Trust.

Defendant Connie Chein filed a demurrer, arguing that Plaintiffs failed to join a necessary party, Southpac Trust International, Inc., as co-owner of Defendant's property. However, the Judge ruled that the demurrer is untimely and that Defendant did not establish a good faith attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiffs prior to the deadline.

The Judge also ruled that the property is owned by Defendant and Southpac as co-trustees of the Connie Chien Inter Vivos Settlement, and therefore, Southpac is not a necessary party to the litigation. As a result, the Judge overruled the demurrer and ordered Defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint by February 16, 2024.

The Judge noted that while the demurrer was late-filed, the law strongly favors disposition on the merits, and the Judge exercised discretion to consider the demurrer.
