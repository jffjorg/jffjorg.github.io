BACKGROUND
 
On August 25, 2023, the Court
entered judgment in favor of Defendants and Cross-Complainants California
Physicians’ Service dba Blue Shield of California and Blue Shield of California
Life & Health Insurance Company (“Defendants”), following a non-jury trial
that commenced on May 31, 2023 before the Honorable Alison Mackenzie.
 
On July 17, 2023, the case was
reassigned to the Honorable Michael E. Whitaker, who took over as the judicial
officer in Department 207 of the Beverly Hills Courthouse.  Nonetheless, on August 3, 2023, Judge
Mackenzie issued the Court’s Final Statement of Decision.  (See August 3, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
On September 14, 2023, Defendants filed
a memorandum of costs, and on September 26, 2023, Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant
Advanced Orthopedic Center, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moved to tax costs.  
 
Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal
of the judgment on September 11, 2023, which the appellate court dismissed on
December 26, 2023, but reinstated on January 24, 2024.  
 
On January 11, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Have Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax Costs Heard by Trial
Judge Alison Mackenzie.  Plaintiff
opposes the motion and Defendants reply. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Appeal
 
            As a
threshold issue, “[t]he filing of a notice of appeal does not divest the [trial
court] of jurisdiction to determine ancillary or collateral matters which do
not affect the judgment on appeal.”  (Silver
v. Gold (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 17, 26.) 
A motion to tax costs made after the entry of final judgment is such an
“ancillary or collateral matter[]” which does “not affect the judgment on
appeal.”  (Hennessy v. Superior Court
of California in and for City and County of San Francisco (1924) 194 Cal.
368, 371-372; Hoover Community Hotel Development Corp. v. Thomson (1985)
168 Cal.App.3d 485, 487.)  
 
Thus, although Plaintiff’s appeal
has been reinstated, it does not divest the Court of jurisdiction to determine
issues pertaining to Plaintiff’s pending motion to tax costs.
 
Motion
 
Defendants move to have Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs, which would otherwise be heard by the current judicial
officer presiding over Department 207, heard instead by Judge Mackenzie, who oversaw
the non-jury trial.  However, the only
authority Defendants cite in support of their position are cases standing for
the general proposition that the trial court has discretion to award certain
costs.  Defendants do not cite to any
authority either requiring or authorizing the Court to have the issue of costs
be determined by another judicial officer than the one currently assigned to
the department where the case is pending. 

 
Plaintiff suggests in opposition
that this is an “ill-disguised CCP § 170.6” peremptory challenge to the
presiding judicial officer, which Defendants deny in the reply.  Moreover, as Plaintiff points out, the legal
authority underlying a motion to tax costs does not require that the judicial
officer who issued the ruling also hear the motion to tax costs, as is the case
with motions for reconsideration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1008.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, absent authority either
requiring or permitting the Court to have the pending motion to tax costs heard
by the judicial officer who presided over the trial, the Court denies
Defendants’ motion.  Plaintiff’s pending
motion to tax costs shall be heard by the judicial officer presiding over
Department 207 on the date of the hearing.
 
Defendants shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
