And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has released a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases, 23SMCV01131 and 23SMCV01272. The motion was unopposed and sought to consolidate the cases for all purposes. The judge analyzed the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 and Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g), which provides that cases may be consolidated when they involve a common question of law or fact. The judge noted that the cases were already related on December 20, 2023, and that the motion was procedurally proper. However, the judge denied the motion to consolidate, finding that while the cases share some common questions of law and fact, they ultimately involve separate incidents and unique factual circumstances. The judge concluded that the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel would adequately protect judicial resources and mitigate the risk of inconsistent rulings.
