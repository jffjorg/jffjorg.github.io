[1] The Unlawful Detainer complaint was originally
brought on behalf of a different entity, but was later amended to be brought on
behalf of the Eislers.


[2] Because Plaintiff does not cite to any specific case
numbers, the Court cannot independently evaluate Plaintiff’s characterization
of the circumstances surrounding the purported dismissal of her claims in other
cases.  


[3] Plaintiff contends in reply that there remain two
causes of action at issue.  While the
Court denied Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion as to the sixth cause of action,
that cause of action was subsequently dismissed in connection with Defendants’
demurrer.  Thus, the only cause of action
remaining at issue is the twelfth.
