And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied Plaintiff Yazmin Ortiz's motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint, which sought to add new causes of action and revive causes of action that were previously dismissed with prejudice. The judge found that Plaintiff had not demonstrated any new factual allegations against the defendants, and that the proposed supplemental complaint was improper because it sought to expand the theories of liability from one to thirty-two on the eve of trial, which would severely prejudice the defendants. The judge also noted that Plaintiff's failure to properly assert theories of liability within the relevant statute of limitations did not create a countervailing prejudicial interest.
