The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this Unlawful Detainer case, following an original filing and subsequent amendment to bring the complaint on behalf of the Eislers. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff does not provide specific case numbers to support their characterization of the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of claims in other cases. The Court has denied the Defendant's anti-SLAPP motion, but one of the causes of action was subsequently dismissed in connection with the Defendant's demurrer. As a result, only one cause of action remains at issue, the twelfth. The Judge intends to further consider the case before issuing a final ruling.
