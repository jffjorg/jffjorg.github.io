And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by the defendants to have the plaintiff's motion to tax costs heard by Judge Mackenzie, who presided over the non-jury trial. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the judge has jurisdiction to determine the issue without having to hear it again. The court rules that it will deny the motion, as there is no authority requiring or permitting the court to hear the motion to tax costs by the judicial officer who presided over the trial. The motion to tax costs will be heard by the judicial officer presiding over Department 207 on the date of the hearing.
