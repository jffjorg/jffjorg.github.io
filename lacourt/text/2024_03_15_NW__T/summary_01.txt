And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants, Arpy Gouloomian and RP&A LLC, are seeking $24,456.25 in attorneys' fees and $1,326.30 in costs. The plaintiff, Minas Michael Avsharian, has opposed the motion. The judge has granted the motion for attorneys' fees at a reduced amount of $18,812.50, but has denied the motion for costs. The judge found that the defendants are the prevailing parties and are entitled to attorneys' fees, despite the plaintiff's arguments that the fees are excessive. The judge also reduced the hourly rate from $650 to $500 per hour, and found that the hours expended by the defendants' counsel were reasonable. The judge did not consider the request for costs because it was improperly placed before the court.
