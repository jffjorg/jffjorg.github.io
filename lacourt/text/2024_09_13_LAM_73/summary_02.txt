And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents filed by the plaintiff, Hasmik Ghazaryan. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant, General Motors LLC, to provide code-compliant responses to certain requests for production of documents.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents Nos. 1-3, 9, and 14-16, which seek information related to the repair of the plaintiff's vehicle and the defendant's warranty policies. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents Nos. 37-72, which seek information about similar complaints made by other owners of vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the plaintiff's vehicle.

However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents Nos. 31-33, which seek information about the defendant's technical hotline and customer loyalty programs. The judge found that these requests were overbroad and did not specify the subject and time period of the requested documents.

The defendant is ordered to provide code-compliant responses to the granted requests within 30 days.
