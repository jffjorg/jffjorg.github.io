BACKGROUND
 
On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff Hasmik Ghazaryan filed the instant
action against Defendant General Motors, LLC. 
 
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on September 12,
2023, alleging the following causes of action:
1.     
Breach of lmplied Warranty of Merchantability under The
Song-Beverly Act
2.     
Breach of Express Warranty under The Song-Beverly Act
3.     
Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200
 
The FAC alleges the following. On November 28, 2020, Plaintiff
leased a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, VIN 24 3GCPWCEK3MG 131465 (hereinafter
referred to as the "Vehicle"). (FAC, ¶ 5.) Plaintiff has presented the Vehicle to Defendants for
repairs of defects, malfunctions, misadjustments, and/or nonconformities
related to: (a) the "Check Engine" warning light illuminating on six
(6) separate occasions; (b) the illumination of the "Check Gages"
warning light; (c) the EV AP system causing poor acceleration; (d) the Vehicle on two (2) separate occasions producing a
popping/rattling noise; (e) erratic and 2 surging RPMs; and (f) the
transmission slipping. (FAC, ¶ 11.)
However, Defendants or their representatives failed to conform the Vehicle to
the applicable warranties because said defects, malfunctions, misadjustments,
and/or nonconformities continue to exist even after a reasonable number of
attempts to repair was given. (FAC, ¶
13.)
 
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents Nos. 1-3,
9, 14-16, 31-33, and 37- 72, arguing:
·       Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Request Nos. 1-3, 9,
14-16, 31-33, and 37- 72.
·       Defendant’s
responses are not code compliant
·       The Documents
Requested Are Relevant And Discoverable
·       Defendant’s
general objections regarding burden of production are not well-taken given
Defendant’s obligations under federal law to maintain the requested records
·       Sanctions are
warranted. 
 
Defendant filed an opposition, arguing:
·       Plaintiff did
not meet and confer in good faith
·       The Court
should sustain Defendant’s objections.
·       Plaintiff
Seeks Documents that GM Has Already Produced
·       Plaintiff
Does Not Need All Recalls, Technical Service Bulletins, or Special Service
Messages
·       Plaintiff
Does Not Need Information Concerning GM’s Internal Investigations, and/or
Analysis of the “Defects” Alleged in Their Complaint
 
Plaintiff filed a reply, arguing:
·       Plaintiff met
and conferred in good faith
·       Defendant
Fails To Justify Its Objections or Refusal To Provide Code-Compliant Responses
·       The Documents Sought Are Relevant And Discoverable
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Motions to
compel further responses must always be accompanied by a meet-and
confer-declaration 
A motion to
compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the motion to show that the material
sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify
discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated
Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also
CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence).) 
 
A motion to
compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents
(“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion to
compel a further response to a request for production must be noticed within 45
days of the service of the response, or any supplemental response, or on or
before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing.  Otherwise, the propounding party
waives any right to compel further response to the inspection demand. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)  The motion must also be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of any issue presented by it. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).) Finally, a motion to compel further responses to
inspection demands must be accompanied by a separate document that sets forth
each item to which further response is requested and the factual and legal
reasons for compelling it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).)  
 
B.      Meet and
Confer
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel states he sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant's counsel
regarding deficiencies with the discovery responses at issue. (Kim Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff’s counsel states the
parties met and confirmed telephonically on March 6, 2024 and that he sent a
follow up email on March 8, 2024. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) However, Plaintiffs’ counsel states Defendant has not
responded. (Kim Decl., ¶ 12.)
 
The Court
finds the moving party has met its meet and confer obligation. Accordingly, the
Court will consider the merits of the motion.
 
C.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Request Nos. 1-3, 9,
14-16, 31-33, and 37- 72.
 
a.       Request Nos. 1-3,
9, 14-16
 
Request Nos.
1-3 seek the repair orders, documents related to repair procedures, repair
manuals, and warranty repairs regarding the Subject Vehicle.
 
Request No. 9
seeks recall documents and special service messages (including TSBs and services bulletins) related to the
Subject Vehicle.
 
Request Nos.
14-16 documents related to statements about and communication related to the
Subject Vehicle. 
 
Plaintiff
contends the information sought relate to pre-litigation opportunities to
conform the Subject Vehicle to the applicable express warranties that Plaintiff
gave Defendant, as well as the communications and information relied upon in
any investigation of Plaintiff’s pre-litigation claims. These repair
opportunities form the backbone of any Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
matter.
 
Defendant
asserts it produced the available responsive documents and directed Plaintiff
to specific documents among its production as responsive to these particular requests. Defendant also objects
to these Requests to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade
secret information. Yet, Defendant states that “in the spirit of compromise, GM
will also agree to supplement its document production pursuant to a protective
order and produce its Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual; its policies and
procedures used to evaluate lemon law claims and repurchase requests made under
the Song-Beverly Warranty Act during the relevant period and as it relates to
Plaintiff and the Subject Vehicle; and other customer complaints within GM’s
ESI database that are substantially similar to Plaintiff’s complaint(s)
concerning the alleged defects, for vehicles purchased in California of the
same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle.” (Def’s Separate Statement,
p. 5.)
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to why the information
sought in these requests is necessary and relevant to his case. To the extent
Defendant asserts a privacy privilege, it must submit a privilege log
identifying the documents and the grounds for establishing protection for the
determination of the applicability of such privilege. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240(c)(1) [“If an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim
that the information sought is protected work product, the response shall
provide sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits
of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.”].)
 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to request for production
of document Nos. 1-3, 9and 14-16.
 
b.      Request Nos.
31-33
 
Request Nos.
31-33 concern documents related to Defendant’s technical hotline, given that Defendant
was contacted regarding the issues with the Subject Vehicle.
 
Request No.
31 seeks “All DOCUMENTS relating to the Customer Call Center, including but not
limited to, all flow charts, processes, and/or scripts.”
 
Request No.
32 seeks “All DOCUMENTS relating to any Customer Loyalty Program or After
Warranty Assistance Program that YOU had in effect during the RELEVANT TIME
PERIOD.”
 
Request No.
33 seeks “All DOCUMENTS related to the Technical Hotline.”
 
Defendant
argues these requests are overbroad. The Court agrees. “Omnibus” descriptions
in requests for documents are improper. (Flora Crane Serv., Inc., v. Super.
Ct. In & For City & Cnty. of San Francisco (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d
767, 786). “The unlimited characteristics of such a description may impair or
destroy exactitude so that the custodian of the records is not reasonably
apprised of what he must produce.” (Id. at 787). Here, requesting “all
documents” related to Defendant’s call center, programs and technical hotline
without sufficiently specifying the subject and time period appear to be
overbroad. 
 
The Court DENIES
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to request for production of
document Nos. 31-33.
 
c.       Request Nos.
37-72
 
These
requests concern similar complaints made by other owners of vehicles of the
same year, make, and model as the Plaintiff’s vehicle.
 
Defendant
argues the information sought is irrelevant. Specifically, that information
about other vehicles, concerns and complaints are not relevant and beyond the
scope of Plaintiff’s causes of action. 
 
Plaintiff
argues that this information is relevant and may serve as proof of the
existence of a defect or nonconformity, as well as Defendant’s knowledge of widespread warranty problems and Defendant’s
failure to act despite this knowledge.
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause as to why the information
sought in these requests is necessary and relevant to his case. The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to request for production
of document Nos. 37-72.
 
DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to the Requests for
Production of Documents, Nos. 1-3, 9, 14-16, and 37-72 is GRANTED. Defendant shall provide
code-compliant responses within 30 days.
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to the Requests for
Production of Documents, Nos. 31-33 is DENIED.
