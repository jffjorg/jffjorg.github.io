 “This case arises from Defendants’ failure to honor their agreement to pay Willat a contractually-required bonus payment in connection with the sale of Willat’s former home, located at 9120 Oriole Way, Los Angeles, California (the ‘Property’). . . . Willat sold the Property at a discount, based on Defendants’ promises to develop and resell the Property [ ] and to then share a percentage of the proceeds with Willat pursuant to a Bonus Agreement between Willat and the Buyer. [ ] Defendants had no intention of making a bona-fide effort to develop and resell the Property. . . . Because of their conduct, Defendants now assert that the Buyer cannot afford to pay even the minimum bonus payment under the Bonus Agreement.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 2-5.)  Plaintiff Boyd Willat now seeks to compel further responses from Defendant 9120 Oriole Way, LLC as to his form interrogatories, set one, and special interrogatories, set one.   Previously, the Court denied identical motions, without prejudice, because Defendant promised to provide supplemental responses.  It seems Defendant never provided the promised responses. Because there is no opposition, the Motions are granted.  Further responses are to be provided within 30 days.  The Court awards the requested sanctions in the amount of $2,000.
