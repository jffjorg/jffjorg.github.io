Case #23CHCV00860
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 9/14/23.
 
MINOR: Yazmin Adwani
PARENT: Jeanette Adwani
DEFENDANT: Mariana Ashamalla
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: This action arises out of a
motor vehicle collision that occurred on 4/28/21.  Minor plaintiff Yazmin Adwani (Minor) was a
passenger in a vehicle driven by her mother, Plaintiff Jeanette Adwani, which
collided with a vehicle driven by Defendant Mariana Ashamalla.  As a result of the collision, Minor suffered
insomnia, headaches, neck pain, back pain and chest pain.  Minor received chiropractic treatment and has
completely recovered from the injuries.  
 
THE SETTLEMENT: Defendant Mariana Ashamalla will
pay $9,000.00
 
MEDICAL BILLS: $3,669.00 (total); $2,000
(reduction)
 
ATTORNEY FEES: $2,250.00
 
COSTS: $232.19
 
AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO MINOR: $4,517.81
 
RULING: Based on the following defects, the
petition is denied without prejudice:
 
(1)  No. 10.c. in
the petition is not completed.
 
(2) No.12a.(2), (4) and (5) are not completed.
 
(3) The amount of reduction of medical expenses is not
clear.  The petition indicates the total
of negotiated, contractual, or statutory reductions is $2,000.  When $2,000 is deducted from the total $3,669
of medical expenses, $1,669.00 remains to be paid.  However, the petition indicates that
$2,000.00 is to be paid from the proceeds of the settlement.  (See Petition, No.12.a.(3),
(b)(5)(i)(C)-(F), No.16.b.; Suri Decl. ¶8; proposed Order, N.8.a.(3)).
 
(4) The petition indicates that the attorney is not
representing any other party and does not expect to receive attorney fees from
any other party.  (See Petition,
No.17(e), (f)).  However, the attorney
also represents the Minor’s mother and, presumably, expects to receive attorney
fees from the $9,000.00 settlement to the other party, presumably the Minor’s mother.  (See Petition, No.11.(b)(1); Suri
Decl. ¶3).
 
(5) The petition requests that a guardianship of the
estate of the minor be appointed and the settlement funds be paid or delivered
to that person.  (Petition,
No.18.b.(1)).  If petitioner is truly
seeking to have a guardianship of the estate appointed, separate probate
proceedings must be initiated for such an appointment before this settlement
can be approved by this Court.  
 
However, it appears that the marking of No.18.b.(1) may
have been a mistake as Attachment 18(b)(2) regarding placing money into a
blocked account is attached and an order to deposit money in a blocked account
has also been submitted.  (See also
proposed Order, No.8.b(1), 9).  If
petitioner meant to mark No.18.b.(2), the error must be corrected in an amended
petition.  
 
(6) The Complaint indicates that the action is brought on
behalf of the minor through her guardian ad litem, Jeanette Adwani.  However, no order appointing Jeanette Adwani
as minor’s guardian ad litem has been filed. 
Jeanette Adwani must be appointed as the Minor’s guardian ad litem in
order to compromise the claim on her behalf. 
See CCP 372(a)(1), (3). 
Also, the petition does not have the guardian ad litem box marked
whereas the proposed order does.  (See
Petition, No.1; Proposed Order, No.2)
 
(7) Although the proposed order indicates that notice has
been given as required by law, there is no proof of service for the
petition.  (See proposed Order,
No.5).
