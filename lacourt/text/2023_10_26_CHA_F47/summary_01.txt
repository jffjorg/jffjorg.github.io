Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to compromise the claim of the Minor, Yazmin Adwani, without prejudice due to several defects in the petition. The petition failed to complete certain sections, including the reduction of medical expenses, and did not provide proof of service for the petition. Additionally, the petition did not provide a clear explanation of the attorney fees and costs, and the guardian ad litem box was not marked. The judge also noted that the petition indicates that the attorney fees will be paid from the settlement proceeds, but the petition does not explain how the fees will be distributed. The judge ordered the parties to correct these defects and resubmit the petition in order to consider the compromise of the claim.
