ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Abbie
L. Lill; Emily Salinas; Miguel Fuentes; Does I through V. 
 
Defendant Lill filed an Answer on June 7, 2023. 
 
            Defendant Lill filed the instant
Motion for an Order Seeking Leave of the Court to File a Cross-Complaint (the
“Motion”) on June 14, 2024. No opposition has been filed.   
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Leave
to amend is permitted under the Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (a) and section 576. The policy favoring amendment and resolving
all matters in the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case in which
denial of leave to amend can be justified. . ..” “Although courts are bound to
apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at
any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this
policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party
. . .. [citation].  A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
            A
motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply with the procedural
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a supporting
declaration to set forth explicitly what allegations are to be added and where,
and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered warranting the
amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The motion must also
include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered amendment, (2) specifications
by reference to pages and lines the allegations that would be deleted and
added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect, necessity and propriety of
the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for delay. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).)
 
III.             
Discussion

 
Defendant Lill seeks leave of court to file an amended Cross-Complaint seeking
equitable indemnity and declaratory relief against Emily Salinas and Miguel
Fuentes. (Mot., p. 3.) 
 
The Motion, however, does not comply with all requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. Specifically, Motion does not identify the pages
and line numbers where allegations would be added, deleted, or modified. Defendant
Lill’s counsel’s supporting declaration also does not state when he discovered
the information, the effect, or why it is necessary. 
 
As a final note, the Motion fails to provide a courthouse address.  Thus, the Notice is defective.   
 
Thus, the hearing will be CONTINUED so that Defendant Lill may correct
these errors. 
 
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Lill’s request for leave of court to file an
amended Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED TO ____ at _____ a.m. in Department 25 at
the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. At least 16 court days before the next scheduled
hearing, Defendant Lill must file and serve supplemental papers addressing the
issues discussed herein. 
 
Failure to do so may
result in the Motion being placed off calendar or denied.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
