And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment without prejudice. The case is no longer an unlawful detainer action, but an ordinary civil action for rent. The notice period for the motion was insufficient, as it was filed without giving the required 75 days' notice to the defendant. The judge notes that the case is now proceeding as an ordinary civil action, and the time period for a motion for summary judgment on the issue of rent owed would follow the ordinary civil time period rather than that of an unlawful detainer action. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
