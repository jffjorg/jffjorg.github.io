And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment filed by Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The motion is unopposed and seeks to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $1,925.00 due to Defendant Latrise Simpson's breach of the Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment.

The Court finds that it has authority to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to Hines v. Lukes, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. The parties signed the Stipulation and explicitly requested that the Court retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.

The declaration of Plaintiff's counsel sets forth the terms of the Stipulation and indicates that Defendant has breached the agreement by failing to bring payments current. The Court determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement.

Based on the foregoing, the Court grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment.
