And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant/Cross-Complainant's request for leave to file an amended Cross-Complaint is continued to a later date. The Defendant must file and serve supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed in the ruling at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. The Defendant's motion does not comply with all requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, and therefore the hearing is continued to allow the Defendant to correct these errors. The Judge notes that the Defendant's motion fails to provide a courthouse address, making the notice defective.
