 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 25, 2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint alleging a single cause of
action for Subrogation against Defendants Latrise Simpson (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 to 10. The Complaint arises from Defendant colliding with the vehicle of
Plaintiff’s insured. 
 
On December 3, 2020, Defendant filed an Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On July
12, 2022, a Notice of Settlement was filed. 
 
On August 18, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for
Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach (the
“Stipulation”). The Stipulation provides the following: this action shall be
dismissed without prejudice. (Stipulation, ¶ 1.) Defendant shall pay $6,467.95,
which is the settlement amount, in full settlement of this action.
(Stipulation, ¶ 2.) According to the Stipulation “[a]n initial payment of
$4,667.95 shall be made by September 1, 2022 by Defendant’s insurance carrier,
Progressive Insurance; then, beginning November 1, 2022, monthly payments of
$50.00; then beginning May 1, 2023, monthly payments of $75.00; then beginning
November 1, 2023, payments of $100.00 shall be made with all subsequent
payments being due on the same day of each month thereafter until the
settlement amount is paid in full.” (Stipulation, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Stipulation provides that the parties stipulate that
the Court retain jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to CCP § 664.6.
(Stipulation, ¶ 3.) If Defendant fails to make a timely payment, then such
failure is a material breach. (Stipulation, ¶ 3.) Any costs are capped at
$500.00 pursuant to the Stipulation. (Stipulation, ¶ 3.) 
 
On August 24, 2022, the Court entered an Order for
Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach (the
“Order”), which dismissed this action without prejudice in its entirety but
allowed the Court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to
CCP § 664.6. (08/24/22 Order.) 
 
On April
12, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant unopposed Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment. As of July 5, 2024, the motion is unopposed. Any
opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at least
nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Enforcing
the Stipulation    
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by entering
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Hines
v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. “[I]f the parties to
pending litigation enter into a settlement either in writing signed by the
parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. “The court
retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even after a
dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of jurisdiction
before the dismissal.” Ibid. “Such a request must be made either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” Ibid. 
“A court ruling on a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the parties entered
into a valid and binding settlement.” Ibid. “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms.” Ibid. “The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’
declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to.” Ibid.
“If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable
settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly
provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” Id. at p. 1183. “It is widely recognized that the courts are not at
liberty to revise an agreement under the guise of construing it.” Series AGI Est Linn of Appian Group Investors
DE, LLC v. Eves (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 164. A prevailing party is entitled to its costs in
any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).) A prevailing party is a party with a
net monetary recovery. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).) “Except as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties.” (CCP § 1021.) 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Harlan M. Reese, Esq. (“Reese”), provides a declaration. Counsel declares
that: on August 17, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into the Stipulation.
(Reese Decl., ¶ 2; Ex. A.) On August 24, 2022, this action was ordered
dismissed with reservation to vacate and enter judgment upon breach. (Reese
Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. B.) Defendant’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment of
$4,667.95. (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant made monthly payments pursuant to the
Stipulation totaling $375.00; however, Defendant has since defaulted on
payments. (Reese Decl., ¶ 5.) Pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation, on or
about March 14, 2024, Plaintiff mailed Defendant a letter regarding the missed
payments; however, Defendant failed to cure the default. (Reese Decl., ¶¶ 6-7;
Ex. C.)   
Plaintiff seeks to set
aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $6,467.95, less the
later payments of $5,042.95, plus court costs of $500.00, which amounts to
total judgment in the amount of $1,925.00. (Reese Decl., ¶ 8.) The court costs
consist of $370.00 for filing the Complaint, a $79.50 service of process fee,
and a $60.00 motion fee. (Reese Decl., ¶ 7.) 
 The
Court finds that it has authority to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to Hines
v. Lukes, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. Plaintiff and
Defendant signed the Stipulation. The Court also has jurisdiction to enforce
the Stipulation as the parties explicitly requested—and furthermore agreed—that
the Court would retain jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. The Court
furthermore determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding
agreement. The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel sets forth the terms of the Stipulation
and indicates that Defendant has breached the Stipulation. 
 
The Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment is therefore
GRANTED. 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
