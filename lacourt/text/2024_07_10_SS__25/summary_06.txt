Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to reclassify the case from limited jurisdiction to unlimited jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Aracely Llerenas, was involved in a motor vehicle accident on February 4, 2021, and has since suffered chronic pain and requires additional medical treatment. The plaintiff's damages are estimated to exceed $25,000, which is the jurisdictional limit for a limited civil action. The defendant argues that the motion is untimely and without good cause, but the court finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the delay and that the case is incorrectly classified. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to pay the reclassification fee of $140.00. The case will be reclassified to an unlimited civil jurisdiction matter.
