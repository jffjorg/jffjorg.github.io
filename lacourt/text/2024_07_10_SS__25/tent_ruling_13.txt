ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal Standard & Discussion
In unlawful
detainer actions, Code of Civil Procedure § 1170.7 provides that “A motion for
summary judgment may be made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving
five days notice. Summary judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis
as a motion under Section 437c.”  
Here, the issue
of possession has become moot, and the case has become an “ordinary civil
action” in which the landlord may seek damages. (Motion, 5:18-22; Fish Construction
Co. v. Moselle Coach Works, Inc. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 645, 658.) As
this is no longer an unlawful detainer case, but an ordinary civil action,
there is insufficient notice. CCP section 437c(a)(2) provides that “[n]otice of
the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the
action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c(a)(2); see Cuff v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. (2013)
221 Cal.App.4th 582, 596.) If the notice is served by mail to an address within
the State of California, the 75-day period is increased by 5 days. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(2).) The Court lacks power to change the notice and
filing periods of section 437c. (See McMahon v. Superior Court (2003)
106 Cal.App.4th 112, 115-18; see also Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 758, 765-66 (discussing McMahon and reversing judgment
for failure to provide notice by the statutorily required minimum time period);
Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 299.) Parties may
stipulate to waive the statutorily mandated minimum notice period. (See Credit
Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital v. Danning, Gill, Diamond & Kollitz (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1301; Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank (1995)
40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1014.) 
The case
qualifies for § 1179a trial precedence only when possession is in issue (CCP §
1179a). Thus, if the tenant has permanently vacated (returned possession to the
landlord) after commencement of the unlawful detainer, the action is not
triable on the “summary” calendar and not entitled to precedence under CCP §
1179a; it becomes an “ordinary civil action.” (Civ.C. § 1952.)
This is
supported by the rationales in Fish Construction Co., supra, and
Lynch, supra, which Plaintiff cites to in its moving papers, as the summary
procedures in an unlawful detainer action has been removed and the action is
proceeding as an ordinary civil action for rent. Accordingly, the time period
for a motion for summary judgment on the issue of the rent owed and not
possession would follow the ordinary civil time period rather than that of an
unlawful detainer action. 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff Croft Plaza
Apartments Homes LLC Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.  Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
