And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vasquez v. Sherman Pointe, outlining the court's decisions on several motions.

Firstly, the court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production. Specifically, the court granted the motion as to RFP nos. 22 and 23, requiring the defendant to provide a verified, Code-compliant response without objection and produce the declarations or "face" page of every insurance policy that may provide coverage in this matter.

Secondly, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory #4.1, requiring the defendant to provide a verified answer without objection to Form Int. #4.1 and its subparts.

Finally, the court imposed monetary sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, Ronald Whitaker, in the amount of $1,250 for discovery abuse without substantial justification and failure to meet and confer in good faith. The court ordered the defendant to pay the sanctions by June 14, 2024.
