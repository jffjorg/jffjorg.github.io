  Case Number:  23VECV01666    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01666 Vasquez v Sherman Pointe
Tentative ruling:
The propounding party may bring motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production if it believes the responses received are evasive or incomplete or if the objections raised are meritless or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2030.300(a) and 2031.310(a).) 
As to RFP motions, the motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2031.310(b)(1).)  The motions must be accompanied by good faith meet and confer declarations and separate statements and must be brought within 45 days of service of the responses, unless stipulated in writing otherwise.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 2030.300(c) and 2031.310(c).)  Plaintiffs showed good cause for RFP nos. 22 and 23 because Defendant’s insurance policies are allowed discovery demands based upon the claims made in this action.  Plaintiffs further submitted a declaration showing a good faith meet and confer effort, and a submitted a separate statement.  The motion is also timely filed per the parties’ stipulation.  (Darhoush Zolfaghari Decl. par. 9, Exh. G.) 
Plaintiffs’ presented good cause for the orders requiring Defendant to further respond.  Without an opposition from Defendant, Defendant failed to meet their burden to show that the objections were merited.
Plaintiff's motion to compel further response and production to RFP Set. #1: Grant in part as to No. 24 and No.26. The response is not Code compliant.  No documents were identified and no documents were produced.  No opposition was filed.  The court orders defendant to provide a verified, Code compliant response without objection and produce the Declarations or "Face" page of every insurance,  including excess and umbrella, policy which may provide coverage in this matter, whether or not a claim was tendered and/or denied, within 10 days.
The court finds that the amount requested is excessive.  This was a simple motion, not opposed, for a limited amount of discovery and no reply was necessary.
Monetary sanctions are awarded pursuant to CCP section 2023.010 in the sum of $1,250 as a reasonable fee for this motion against defendant Sherman Pointe, Inc. and its counsel Ronald Whitaker, jointly and severally, for discovery abuse without substantial justification, and failure to meet and confer in good faith.  Payment shall be made by 6/14/2024 to the Client Trust Account of ZOLFAGHARI LAW FIRM, PC, 333 City Boulevard West, 17th Floor, Orange, California 92868.
