 Case Number:  23STCV18514    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  55 I.                   
Tentative Ruling
 Defendant’s Motion for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED
in the amount of $ 3,600.
 
II.                   
Background
 
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (“Plaintiff”)
filed suit against RISH INVESTMENTS, INC., as motel owner, and GAZI MONIRUL
ISLAM (“Defendants”) due to Defendants’ alleged failure to abate nuisances at
the motel including prostitution, assaults, and other violent crimes. 
 
On 1/26/24, the Court issued an order that (1) Defendant
RISH INVESTMENTS, INC. (“Defendant”) pay $2,880.00 in monetary sanctions to
Plaintiff on or before 2/23/2024, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280(c),
and (2) on or before 2/23/2024, Defendant serve initial responses, and produce
documents, without objections, and in full compliance with the California
Discovery Act, CCP §2016.010 et seq., as to the form interrogatories,
special interrogatories and requests for documents served by Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff brings a motion for monetary and issue
sanctions on the ground that Defendant disobeyed the Court’s 1/26/2024 order.
Defendant opposes the motion. Defendant also filed an unauthorized sur-reply,
which the Court strikes.

Analysis
 
a.   
Applicable
Law
 
The Court may, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney and after opportunity for hearing, impose monetary, issue,
evidence, or terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d).) Conduct
subject to sanctions includes, but is not limited to, failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd.
(d).)  The purpose of discovery sanctions
is not to punish. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238
Cal.App.4th 1164, 1193.) 
 
“Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Young v.
Rosenthal¿(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119 citing¿Deyo¿v.¿Kilbourne¿(1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793;¿Newland v. Superior Court¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
608, 613.)  
 
Evidence or issue sanctions may be imposed only after
parties violated discovery orders compelling further responses, except in
exceptional circumstances, including where there was sufficiently egregious
misconduct regarding a failure to respond to discovery, or a prior discovery
order would be futile. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct.¿(2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1428.) “The discovery statutes thus ‘evince an incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.’ (Citation.) To avoid sanctions, the
burden of proving that a discovery violation was not willful is on the party on
whom the discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co.¿(1977)
66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.) 
 
b.   
Monetary
Sanctions 
 
Plaintiff seeks $,3,600 in monetary sanctions in
addition to issue sanctions against Defendant. The Court already sanctioned Defendant
$2,880.00 for failing to respond to the requests for admission in a timely
manner. The Court also previously ordered Defendant to serve verified responses
to the discovery propounded by Plaintiff. Given defense counsel’s statements
that he failed to provide timely responses due to illness, the Court gave
Defendant extra time, to 2/23/2024, to pay the sanctions and serve the discovery.
But as Defendant acknowledges in the opposition, to date no sanctions have been
paid and no verified discovery responses have been served. Despite not complying
with the Court Order, defense counsel has found time to file 14 federal
lawsuits since January. (Plaintiff’s Notice and Request for Judicial Notice.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks $3,600.00, which consists of a $360
hourly rate with 10 hours of work it believes are reasonable attorney’s fees
for the work performed on the instant motion. The Court agrees that this amount
of monetary sanctions is appropriate and reasonable, given the longstanding and
repeated failure on the part of Defendant to comply with its discovery
obligations. Defendant’s opposition consists of a long explanation of various family
medical issues suffered by defense counsel’s family. While defense counsel’s
personal issues are unfortunate, they simply do not excuse his utter failure to
comply with his client’s discovery obligations. And defense counsel’s claims
that he has been unable to focus on this case rings hollow given the numerous
cases he has filed since this Court issued its 1/26/2024 order. Indeed, just in
this case, defense counsel managed to litigate the notice of removal in federal
court this spring yet could not get around to serving any discovery responses
or pay the sanctions for the late RFA responses. 
 
c.    
Issue
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court impose various issue
sanctions related to the issues in this case. Given that four months have
passed since the initial discovery was due, monetary sanctions have not gained
compliance, and Defendant has refused to respond to emails regarding the court
order, Plaintiff contends that issue sanctions are appropriate and just.
 
As discussed
above, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions due to
Defendant’s noncompliance with the 1/26/2024 Court order, which constitutes
discovery abuse. The Court favors an incremental approach to sanctions, especially
given defense counsel’s claims of various family issues. The Court therefore denies
the request for issue sanctions without prejudice. Defendant and Defendant’s
counsel need to understand that continued disregard of this Court’s order—i.e.,
not paying the sanctions and not serving the discovery—will result in the Court
inviting Plaintiff to seek further, more severe sanctions. 
 
IV.                   
Conclusion



Plaintiff’s Motion for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED
in the amount of $3,600. The Request for issue sanctions is denied without
prejudice.
