And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,600. The judge found that the defendant failed to comply with a previous court order to pay monetary sanctions and serve discovery responses. Despite the defendant's claims of family medical issues, the judge found that the defendant's failure to comply with the court order was not justified. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for issue sanctions without prejudice, warning that continued disregard of the court's order may result in more severe sanctions in the future.
