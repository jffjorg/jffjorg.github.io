And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's Motion for Attorney's Fees. The Defendant, The Jing Wang, seeks attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the lease agreement, which provides for the awarding of fees to the prevailing party. The Plaintiffs, Mi Young Kim and Yoo S. Kim, failed to file opposition to the demurrer and failed to file a further amended complaint. The Court dismissed the case with prejudice on March 27, 2024, making the Defendant the prevailing party.

The Judge finds that the Defendant is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs, and calculates the fee based on the lodestar method, which takes into account the number of hours reasonably expended and the reasonable hourly rate. The Defendant claims to have incurred $10,625.50 in attorney's fees and $845.93 in costs to date, with an anticipated additional $3,002.00 in attorney's fees and $21.78 in costs. The Judge finds the rate to be reasonable and well-supported, and grants the motion for attorney's fees.
