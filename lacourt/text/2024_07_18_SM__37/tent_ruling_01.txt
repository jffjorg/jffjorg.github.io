Background
 
On February 1, 2024,
Stringcandy LLC and Stephanie Matthews (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against
the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (“AFM”);
Musicians Union of Las Vegas, Local No. 369 and Does 1 to 20. 
 
The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges six
causes of action:
1)    
Fraud;
2)    
Breach of Contract;
3)    
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; 
4)    
Declaratory Relief; 
5)    
Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage (“IIPEA”); and 
6)    
Breach of the Duty of Fair
Representation. 
 
Defendant AFM demurs to the FAC. Plaintiffs oppose the
Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Plaintiff
Stringcandy is a California limited liability corporation that operates in the
music industry as a business that hires musicians and other music professionals
to perform musical services for a variety of musical productions.  Plaintiff Matthews, acting in her capacity as
a managing member of Plaintiff Stringcandy, engaged in negotiations for a new
collective bargaining agreement with LOCAL 369. 

 
Defendant
AFM demurs to the FAC on the basis that the action is preempted by the National
Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) and the Labor-Management Relations Act (“LMRA”).
In opposition, Plaintiff concedes that demurrer should be sustained as to the
second, third, fourth, and sixth causes of action but asserts that the first
cause of action for fraud and the fifth cause of action for IIPEA are not
preempted by federal law. (Opposition at p. 4:14-21.) In addition, Plaintiffs
request leave to amend the declaratory relief cause of action to allege that
disciplinary proceedings violate the bylaws of Defendant AFM. (Opposition, at
p. 4: 21-23.) 
 
A.        First
Cause of Action - Fraud
 
The
fraud cause of action alleges that Defendants “concealed facts” prior to the
signing of the 2023 Collective Bargaining Agreement (“2023 CBA”). (FAC, ¶
33-35.) Had Plaintiffs known about the “concealed facts”, Plaintiff “would have
behaved differently.” (FAC. ¶ 38.) After the 2022 CBA ended, on December 21,
2022, while the parties were in negotiations for the 2023 CBA, Defendants without
Plaintiffs’ knowledge, instructed its members to file labor grievances to be
filed against the Plaintiffs until after the signing of the 2023 CBA. (FAC, ¶¶
9, 10, 13, 19, 20.) 
 
Four
grievances were filed by former musicians (the “Grievants”) who worked on the
2022 “Weekends with Adele” residency shows but were excluded from the 2023
shows. (FAC, ¶¶ 10-12.) The four Grievants contend that Plaintiffs’ failure to
hire them “constituted wrongful termination, notwithstanding the LOCAL 369’s
written authorization of the specific list of individuals who would be hired to
perform services under the 2023 CBA.” (FAC, ¶ 19.) Plaintiffs assert that
Defendants knew Plaintiffs “would not have agreed to the terms of the 2023 CBA
or the LPH-LV Contract if Plaintiff MATTHEWS was aware of the Concealed Facts.”
(FAC, ¶ 15.)  In December 2023,
Defendants caused Plaintiffs to be placed on Defendants “Do Not Work For List”
resulting in in Plaintiffs not being able to hire musicians from AFM or render
any musical services. (FAC, ¶ 32.) 
 
Defendant
AFM maintains that their alleged fraudulent conduct falls within the purview of
the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 158. The court agrees. The NLRA imposes on the parties
the “mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of
the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours,
and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an
agreement, or any question arising thereunder[.]” (29 U.S.C.A. §
158(d).) Hence, the NLRA prohibits “bad faith bargaining during the
contract negotiations.” (N. L. R. B. v. Royal Plating & Polishing
Co. (3d Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 191, 194.) 
 
The
court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs’ allegations of fraud based on
concealment occurring during and after the negotiations of the 2023 CBA are
actions that fall outside of the purview of the NLRA and are unrelated to the
parties’ obligations to bargain in good faith. “[The NLRA supersedes state law if
‘it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State
purports to regulate are protected by [s]ection 7 of the National Labor
Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under [s]ection 8.’ ” (Jackson v. Teamsters Local Union 922 (D.D.C. 2014) 991
F.Supp.2d 71, 78 citing  San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, Millmen's Union, Local 2020 v.
Garmon (1959) 359 U.S. 236, 244 (Garmon). ) In
other words, if the subject of the labor dispute relates to “an activity [that]
is arguably subject to [section] 7 or [section] 8 of the Act, the States as
well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the
National Labor Relations Board.” (Gorman, at p. 245.) Therefore, the
NLRA preempts the jurisdiction of state and federal courts when the conduct
pertains to activities “arguably” subject to the NLRA. (See Amalgamated
Ass'n of St., Elec. Ry. and Motor Coach Emp. of America v. Lockridge
(1971) 403 U.S. 274, 284.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs fail
to explain how misrepresentations made during the collective bargaining process
pertain to activities not regulated by the NLRA or relate to conduct that is “
‘merely peripheral
concern of the Labor Management Relations Act . . . (or) touched interests so
deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of
compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had
deprived the States of the power to act.’ ” (Farmer v. United Broth. of
Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local 25 (1977) 430 U.S. 290,
296–297.) Plaintiffs cite no case law finding that fraud claims related to the
collective bargaining process fall outside the jurisdiction of the NLRA. 
 
Meanwhile,
Defendant AMF relies on Kolentus v. Avco Corp. (7th
Cir. 1986) 798 F.2d 949, where the 7th Circuit found fraud claims
related to the misrepresentations and omissions about a plant closure made “at the time of
negotiating and entering into the collective bargaining agreements and the
pension agreements” was conduct preempted by the NLRA. (Id. at p. 960.)
“The fraudulent conduct
alleged by the plaintiffs clearly is of far more than “peripheral concern”
under the NLRA. Insuring that employers and employees bargain with each other
in good faith is of central importance under the Act.” (Id. at p. 961.)
 
Similarly,
in Serrano v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Co. (6th Cir. 1986) 790 F.2d 1279, the 6th Circuit found that allegations of “fraud in the
announcement of the decision to rebuild the coke plant, fraud in the execution
of the announced plan to rebuild, and fraud in negotiations with the Union at
other coke plant” were preempted by federal labor law. (Id. at p. 1282.)

 
Failure of an employer to bargain in good faith about
terms and conditions of employment is not peripheral to the concerns of federal
labor law; rather, it strikes at the heart of one of the basic concerns of that
law. Unless the fraud claims bring this case within an exception, the Garmon preemption doctrine applies.
 
(Id.
at p. 1287.)
 
Good faith bargaining is a core concern of the Labor
Act, not a matter of only peripheral concern. Eroding the Board's jurisdiction
over claims involving a failure to bargain in good faith will inevitably
eviscerate the Labor Act and all that it has accomplished. Consequently, we do
not believe that the employees' claims fit into any recognized exception to the
Garmon preemption doctrine.


(Parker
v. Connors Steel Co.
(11th Cir. 1988) 855 F.2d 1510, 1518.) 
 
Plaintiffs
fail to explain how the Defendants’ intent to have the Grievants file labor
grievances after the signing of the 2023 CBA is a “peripheral concern” and is
not an activity “arguably” subject to the NLRA. Plaintiffs further fail to show
that the remedies requested in their Prayer for Relief, such as a request for
an injunction and damages, can be awarded by this court and are not precluded
under the 2023 CBA. Lastly, Plaintiffs fail to show that allegations of fraud
related to the bargaining of the 2023 CBA is not premised on bad faith
bargaining conduct and is conduct that falls outside the purview of the NLRA
such that no charge can be filed with the NLRB. 
 
Therefore,
the demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
            B.        Fifth
Cause of Action – Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage
(IIPEA)
 
The FAC alleges that agents or
employees of Defendants made representations to representatives of the
“Weekends with Adele” that Plaintiff had wrongfully terminated member of LOCAL
369 and had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”).
(FAC, ¶¶ 26- 27.) The FAC further alleges that Grievant Yunior Lopez
deliberately listed the physical address for “Weekends with Adele” production
office on the grievance Charge Against Employer to damage Plaintiff’s
reputation with clientele, and that the conduct was ratified by Defendants.
(FAC, ¶ 27-29.) Plaintiffs maintain that by providing the address for “Weekends
with Adele” as the address for Plaintiffs on the charges before the NLRB,
Defendants disrupted the economic relationship between Plaintiff and the production
entities for “Weekends with Adele.” (Fac, ¶¶ 62-64.) The FAC further asserts
that Defendants “intentionally publishing false and defamatory statements about
Plaintiffs in its March 2023 newsletter” and made these false and defamatory
statements “to representatives of the ‘Weekends with Adele’ production company”
resulting in the Plaintiffs being unable to contract with their prospective
business relationships. (FAC, ¶ 68.) 
 
“The five elements for intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage are: (1) an economic
relationship between the plaintiff and some third party, with the probability
of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's knowledge of
the relationship; (3) intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to
disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5)
economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the
defendant.” (Youst v. Longo (1987) 43 Cal.3d 64, 71, fn. 6.) Defendant
AFM similarly maintains that publicizing a labor dispute to third parties is a
protected activity under the NLRA and that any determination that the labor
dispute was false is left to NLRB to determine. (See Edward
J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. and Const. Trades Council
(1988) 485 U.S. 568, 584 [publicity of labor dispute permitted under the
NLRA].)
 
Defendant AFM further
maintains that the fifth cause of action is prohibited by section
301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act (“LMRA”), 29 U.S.C. § 185, because to
resolve the dispute it would require the court to determine the truth or
falsity of the statements made to “Weekends with Adele” production team, which
would require analyzing the CBA. 
 
Section
301 is on its face a jurisdictional statute, under which “[s]uits for violation
of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing
employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or
between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of
the United States having jurisdiction of the parties.” 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). Soon
after passage of the LMRA, the Supreme Court ruled that § 301 authorized the
federal courts to develop a federal common law of CBA interpretation.
[Citation.] The Court subsequently held that this federal common law preempts
the use of state contract law in CBA interpretation and enforcement.
[Citation.]


(Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways Inc. (9th Cir. 2001) 255 F.3d 683, 689.)
 
A claim for intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage (“IIPEA”) requires that the
interference be wrongful by some legal measure other than the interference
itself. (Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11
Cal.4th 376, 378.) “[A]n act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful, that
is, if it is proscribed by some constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common
law, or other determinable legal standard.” (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed
Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1159.)
 
The court finds that the determination of whether Defendants’
conduct was wrongful by some legal measure requires that this court interpret
the CBA, and such action is preempted by the LMRA. Alternatively, the
determination of a legal wrong by Defendants would require that the court
determine that Defendants failed to act in good faith while negotiating the
CBA, but such a finding is preempted by the NLRA. (See
Lumber Production Indus. Workers Local No. 1054 v. West Coast
Indus. Relations Ass'n, Inc. (9th Cir. 1985) 775 F.2d 1042, 1048
[“[I]f a crucial element of a state court action is identical to an element of
an unfair labor practice that is arguably covered by the NLRA, then the state
action is preempted.”]; see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. United
Food & Commercial Workers Internat. Union (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th
194, 213 [Walmart’s trespass claim was “deeply rooted in local
law, thus warranting a departure from Garmon
preemption.”].)


To the extent that the Plaintiffs assert
that the LMRA does not apply to expired CBA agreements, the FAC asserts that
the labor grievances were submitted after the Plaintiffs signed the 2023 CBA
and that the “false and defamatory
statements about Plaintiffs” were made in a March 2023 newsletter, meaning that
the 2023 CBA governed the parties labor relationship at the time the statements
were made. (FAC,
¶¶ 19, 68.) Accordingly, the court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs’ claims are
not subject to the LMRA because the claims are based on an expired CBA. 


The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained
without leave to amend. 
 
C.        Fourth Cause of Action – Declaratory
Relief
 
To state a declaratory relief claim,
the plaintiff must allege a proper subject of declaratory relief and an actual
controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the party’s rights or
obligations.  (See CCP § 1060; Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC
(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909.) 
 
Plaintiff requests leave to amend the fourth cause of action
to request a judicial determination that the current disciplinary proceedings
commenced by Defendant AFM violated Plaintiff Mathews' due process rights. 
 
The demurrer to the fourth cause of action for declaratory
relief is also sustained because it is derivative of the first and fifth causes
of action. (See Ball v. FleetBoston Financial Corp. (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800.) The FAC is devoid of facts challenging the
disciplinary process of Defendant AFM and the Plaintiffs fail to show that
AFM’s disciplinary policies exist separate and apart from the 2023 CBA and that
a present controversy exists between the parties that can be adjudicated under
state law without the need to interpret the 2023 CBA or determine that AFM
violated the NLRA. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
fourth cause of action is sustained. However, as the declaratory relief cause
of action is capable of amendment and as this is Plaintiff’s first demurrer,
leave to amend the fourth cause of action is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
AFM’s demurrer to the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action
is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer to the fourth cause of action
for declaratory relief is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff is
granted 10 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint
for August 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant AFM to give notice.
