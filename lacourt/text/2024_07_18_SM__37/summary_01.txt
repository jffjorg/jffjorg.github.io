And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, American Federation of Musicians, et al. The defendant demurred to the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, alleging that they are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and the Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA). The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer to these causes of action without leave to amend.

The court also sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief, but grants plaintiff leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for August 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and orders the defendant to give notice.

The court's ruling is based on its finding that the claims are preempted by the NLRA and LMRA, and that the issues raised in the lawsuit are better suited for resolution by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) rather than the state court. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for declaratory relief, as the issue of whether the defendant's disciplinary proceedings violated the plaintiff's due process rights is derivative of the NLRA and LMRA.
