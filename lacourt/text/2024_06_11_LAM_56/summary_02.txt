English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the Paya Defendants to the affirmative defenses in the Answer of Krebs to the Cross-Complaint. The court finds that the meet and confer requirement has not been met, but this does not necessarily mean that the demurrer will be sustained. The court also finds that the Answer of Krebs lacks sufficient facts to support the affirmative defenses and is overly conclusory. The court sustains the demurrer of Paya Defendants to the first through twenty-fifth affirmative defenses and grants 20 days leave to amend the Answer.
