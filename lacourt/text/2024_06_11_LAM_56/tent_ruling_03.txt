BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from alleged wrongful actions concerning a property located at
3033 Beverly Glen Circle, Los Angeles, CA 90077 (the “Property”). On November
18, 2021, Plaintiffs Dr. Payam Vahedifar and Shadi Vahedifar (collectively

Paya aka Bahram Paya, as an individual and trustee of The Paya Family 2003
Revocable Trust; Bita Paya as an individual and trustee of The Paya Family 2013
Revocable Trust; The Paya Family 2013 Revocable Trust, an entity form unknown;
Nina D. Hunt; S&A Realty Corp.; and Simco Pacific Corp. (collectively
“Defendants”), as well as DOES 1 through 100, alleging causes of action for:
(1) violation of California Civil Code, Section 1950.5; (2) statutory
fraud or deceit; (3) intentional misrepresentation; (4) negligent
misrepresentation; (5) fraudulent concealment; (6) negligence; (7) negligence per
se; (8) conversion; (9) breach of fiduciary duty; (10) breach of contract;
(11) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (12)

seq.; (13) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (14) negligent
infliction of emotional distress; (15) unjust enrichment and restitution; (16)
intentional interference with contractual relations; and (17) conspiracy to
breach contract and to interfere with contractual relations. 
            
            On February
7, 2022,  Defendants and Cross-Complainants
Brian Paya aka Brian Bahram Paya aka Bahram Paya, as an individual and trustee
of The Paya Family 2003 Revocable Trust; Bita Paya as an individual and trustee
of The Paya Family 2013 Revocable Trust; and The Paya Family 2013 Revocable Trust,
an entity form unknown (collectively, the “Paya Defendants”), filed a
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs and ROES 1-100, alleging causes of action
for: (1) negligence (2) conversion; and (3) violations of California contracting
licence laws. 
            
            Also,
on February 7, 2022, Paya Defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
            On May
22, 2023, Paya Defendants filed and served an Amendment to the Cross-Complaint,
which identified Charles Krebs (“Krebs”) as Roe 1.  
 
            On March
18, 2024, Krebs filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint, which set forth 25
affirmative defenses.  
 
            On March
22, 2024, Paya Defendants filed and served the instant unopposed demurrer to each
affirmative defense set forth in the Answer of Krebs to the Cross Complaint filed
by Paya Defendants.   
 
DISCUSSION

            “A
party against whom an answer has been filed may object, by demurrer . . . to
the answer” on the grounds that: “(a) [t]he answer does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense” or “(b) [t]he answer is uncertain.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (a)-(b).)
 
            The
determination whether an answer states a defense is governed by the same
principles which are applicable in determining if a complaint states a cause of
action. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725,
732.) A demurrer reaches only the contents of the pleading and such matters as
may be considered under the doctrine of judicial notice. (Ibid.) “[A]
demurrer does not . . . admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law alleged in the pleading.” (Ibid.) In assessing a demurrer to the
answer, “each so-called defense must be considered separately without regard to
any other defense.” (Id. at p. 733.) An answer must not set forth mere
legal conclusions but must articulate facts averred as carefully and with as
much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and are alleged
in the complaint. (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 367, 384.) 
 
            Although
courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to
support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California
Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
Issue No.1: The Lack of Meet and Confer Efforts 
             Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, before filing a demurrer, “the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading . . . for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41, subd. (a).)  
An insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            Counsel
for Paya Defendants, Brian Paya (“Paya”), declares in support of the demurrer
that his “office received the Answer on March 22, 2024, and did not have the
opportunity to engage in any meet and confer with Charles Krebs regarding his
woefully defective Answer.” (Paya Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
            Here,
the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has not been met. Counsel
for Paya Defendants declares that there were no meet and confer efforts prior
to filing the instant demurrer. The Court will not overrule the demurrer based
on the lack of meet and confer discussions. The Court, however, reminds the
parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil
Procedure. 
 
Issue No.2: Sufficiency of the Affirmative Defenses
            Paya
Defendants demur to each of the 25 affirmative defenses set forth in the Answer
of Krebs to the Cross-Complaint. 
            
Initially, as to uncertainty, the
Court does not find that the Answer is uncertain because it is not so unclear
where Paya Defendants are not apprised of the issues that must be met. (Bacon
v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 605.) Thus, the Court OVERRULES the
demurrer of Paya Defendants to the Answer of Krebs on the grounds of
uncertainty.
 
The Court has reviewed each
affirmative defense and finds that Krebs has set forth only conclusions and
does not articulate any facts. Additionally, given that the demurrer is
unopposed, Krebs has conceded to the arguments raised therein under Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215. 
 
            Although
the demurrer is unopposed, the Court does not find that there exists no
reasonable possibility that Krebs can successfully amend his Answer. 
 
            The
Court therefore SUSTAINS the demurrer of Paya Defendants to the first through
twenty-fifth affirmative defenses in the Answer filed by Krebs with 20 days
leave to amend. 
            
Moving
Parties ordered to give notice of this ruling.
