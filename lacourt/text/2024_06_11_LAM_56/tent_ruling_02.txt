BACKGROUND
             On October 26, 2021, Plaintiff Jason Sydney
(“Plaintiff”) filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against
Defendants Humboldt Brand Cannabis Company, Inc.; HB Business Solutions, Inc.;
Reuven Sherr; Yvonne Sherr; Ronald Sherr; Nicholas Pirrung; and DOES 1-100
(“Defendants”), inclusive, alleging 15 causes of action for Fraud, Breach of
contract, California Labor Code Violations, Unlawful Business Practices – Cal.
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, Declaratory Judgment, Intentional Interference
with Contractual Relations, and Intentional Interference with Prospective
economic Relations. 
            
On
July 28, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants filed a Stipulation Re Voluntary
Dismissal With Retention of Jurisdiction Under Cal. Code of Civil Procedure
Section 664.6. Subsequently, this action was dismissed with prejudice on August
2, 2023. 
 
On
May 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement. A timely opposition would have been filed on or before May 29, 2024;
none has been filed.             
 
DISCUSSION
            Pursuant the Code of Civil Procedure
Section 664.6: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed
by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,
for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”   
 
“Because
of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6
is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.” (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction,
Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37;Critzer v. Enos (2010) 187
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1262.) In ruling on a motion under § 664.6, the trial judge
may receive oral testimony, or may determine the motion upon declarations
alone. (Corkland v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) Where the
agreement was reached at a court hearing, the court can resolve the dispute on
the basis of its own notes or recollection of what was agreed to (as well as
any transcripts of the proceedings). (Richardson v. Richardson (1986)
180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.) 
 
Enforce Settlement
            Plaintiff moves for an order
enforcing a valid, written Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual General
Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) on July 9, 2023. 
 
Generally,
courts lose subject matter jurisdiction when an action is voluntarily
dismissed. (Hagan Engineering, Inc. v. Mills (2003) 115 Cal.App.4th
1004, 1009.) Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 provides the authority for
the Court the retention of personal jurisdiction to enforce the settlement “if
requested by the parties.” The stipulation as to jurisdiction must conform to
the same requirements necessary for enforcement of the settlement agreement. (Wackeen
v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440.) It is not enough simply to
provide for a retention of jurisdiction in the settlement agreement. (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 918.)
Instead, the request to retain jurisdiction must be filed with the court: “the
parties could have easily invoked section 664.6 by filing a stipulation and
proposed order either attaching a copy of the settlement agreement and
requesting that the trial court retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 or a
stipulation and proposed order signed by the parties noting the settlement and
requesting that the trial court retain jurisdiction under section 664.6. The
process need not be complex. But strict compliance demands that the process be
followed.” (Ibid.; see Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960,
966-968 [no subject matter jurisdiction to enforce settlement per CCP § 664.6
because parties failed to ask court to retain jurisdiction before case
dismissed.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff and Defendants entered into the Settlement Agreement, which required
Defendants to pay Plaintiff a sum of $150,000.00 payable in two installments,
in exchange for the release of all claims by Plaintiff against Defendants. ((Rome
Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.) The first payment of $50,000.00 was to be paid within two
days of receiving an Employee Retention Tax Credit or by January 7, 2024. (Id.)
The second payment of $100,000.00 was to be paid within two days of receipt of
any tax refund other than the Employee Retention Tax Credit or by July 7, 2024.
(Id., ¶4.) The Settlement Agreement also provides for attorneys’ fees
and costs incurred in connection with the enforcement of its terms. (Id.,
¶9, Ex. A.)
 
Pursuant
to Section 4 of the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff and Defendants expressly
agreed that this Court would retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms, as
follows: “The Parties agree that the Court will retain jurisdiction to enforce
this Agreement pursuant to Civil Procedure Code section 664.6 or by any other
procedure permitted by law in the appliable court.” (Id., ¶3, Ex. A.) The
Settlement Agreement was signed by all the parties. (Rome Decl., ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s Request for Dismissal form also requested
the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section
664.6. (Request for Dismissal entered 8/2/23.) 
 
Defendants
have failed to make any of the payments as required under the Settlement
Agreement. (Id., ¶5.) Plaintiff has sent multiple emails to Defendants
requesting the required payments. (Id., ¶¶7-8, Exs. B-C.) Enforcement of
the Settlement Agreement is warranted under Code of Civil Procedure Section
664.6. 
 
            Therefore, the motion to enforce
settlement agreement is GRANTED in the amount of $150,000.00 plus $5,250.00 in
attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
