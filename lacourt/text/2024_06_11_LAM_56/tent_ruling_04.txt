BACKGROUND
             On May 4, 2022, Plaintiff O.B. (“Plaintiff”)
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District and DOES 1 through 25 (“Defendants”), alleging
the following causes of action: (1) Negligence and (2) Negligent Hiring,
Retention, and Supervision. Trial is currently set for February 3, 2025.
            On May 10, 2024, Defendant Los

JUDICIAL NOTICE 
             The District request judicial notice of the
following: (1) Petition of Writ in Roe #2 v. Superior Court, No. B334707
(SBCSC No. 22CV05157) on the constitutional issue of AB 218 and the gift clause
dated January 25, 2024 – Ex. 1; (2) California Second District Court of Appeal
Request to real parties in interest for informal response to petition for writ
in Roe #2 v. Superior Court, No. B334707 (SBCSC No. 22CV05157) dated
March 27, 2024 – Ex. 2; (3) Order of Dismissal in O.B. v. Los Unified School
District, Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. 21STCV05971
(hereinafter “the LAUSD Action”) by the Hon. John J. Kralik dated April 29,
2024, on defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings to plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint – Ex. 3; (4) Ruling by the Hon. John J. Kralik dated April
29, 2024, on defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint – Ex. 4; and
(5) Transcript of November 1, 2023 Hearing on Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in re: the instant
matter – Ex. 5.
 
            The request for judicial notice is
GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code Sections 452, subdivision (d), (h), and 453 (except
as to the truth of the matters stated therein). 
 
DISCUSSION
            “Except as provided in Sections
917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, the perfecting of an appeal
stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from
or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 916, subd. (a).) 
 
A
trial court proceeding affects the effectiveness of an appeal if “the possible
outcomes on appeal and the actual or possible results of the proceeding are
irreconcilable” or “the very purpose of the appeal is to avoid the need for
that proceeding.” (Varian Med. Sys., Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal. 4th
180, 190.) Furthermore, the court must consider: “(1) whether the stay
applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits;
(2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3)
whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties
interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.” (Nken
v. Holder (2009) 556 U.S. 418, 426.)
 
Motion for Stay
The
District moves to stay this present lawsuit pending resolution of review and
decision arising from a Petition for Writ filed by District filed in the Second
District Court of Appeal, Division Six (the “Appellate Court”) concerning the
constitutionality of Assembly Bill (“AB”) 218. 
 
            The Court recognizes that the writ petition
pending before the Appellate Court, while it challenges the ruling of a trial
court in Santa Barbara County and not a judgment or order made by this Court,
it does relate to the same issue as was raised in this Court, i.e., the
constitutionality of AB 218. 
Nevertheless, the writ process is much quicker than that in the case of
appeals, such that this Court anticipates that the Appellate Court will rule
relatively soon.  Trial in the instant
case is not until February of next year. 
If in fact no ruling is made by the Appellate Court until closer to the
trial date, or if the ruling of the Appellate Court results in a Petition for
Review in the California Supreme Court, then the District may bring an ex
parte application to continue the trial. 

 
            Therefore, the motion for stay of
proceedings is DENIED and the Motion to continue trial is also DENIED, but without
prejudice.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 11th day of June 2024
