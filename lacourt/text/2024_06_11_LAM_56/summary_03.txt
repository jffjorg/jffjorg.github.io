```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the Paya Defendants to the affirmative defenses set forth in the answer filed by Charles Krebs. The court finds that the meet and confer requirement has not been met, but does not overrule the demurrer based on this lack. The court also finds that the answer is not uncertain and that Krebs has not articulated any facts to support his affirmative defenses. The court sustains the demurrer and gives Krebs 20 days to amend his answer. The court reminds the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure.
