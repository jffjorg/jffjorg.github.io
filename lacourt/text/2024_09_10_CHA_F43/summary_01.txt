And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to terminate a stay of judgment in a case involving Macaria Beltran, Trustee of the MCB Trust, and Patrick Graham. The stay was put in place pending an appeal, which has now been resolved in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not received a rental payment from the defendant since December 2023 and is seeking to enforce the court's judgment. The court has determined that there is no longer a legal basis for the stay and has granted the plaintiff's motion to terminate the stay. The plaintiff may now enforce its judgment against the defendant.
