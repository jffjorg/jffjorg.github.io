And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment without prejudice due to their failure to file a proposed responsive pleading with their motion. The defendants, Bimmerhead Werx LLC and Jessie Rueckel, argued that they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and that the entry of default and default judgment was the result of surprise. They also argued that the service of summons was not statutorily compliant and that the default judgment is void because Defendant Bimmerhead Werx was not properly named in the complaint.

The plaintiff, George Matar, opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants failed to show that the judgment was entered by surprise and that they have failed to demonstrate that the default and default judgment was caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The plaintiff also argued that the defendants' motion is not accompanied by an answer or other responsive pleading as required by CCP § 473(b).

The judge noted that the law favors hearings on the merits, and therefore, any doubts as to the application of section 473, et seq., should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to comply with the procedural requirements of CCP §§ 473(b) and 473.5, which require that a copy of a proposed answer or other responsive pleading be filed with the motion to set aside default. As a result, the judge denied the defendants' motion without prejudice.
