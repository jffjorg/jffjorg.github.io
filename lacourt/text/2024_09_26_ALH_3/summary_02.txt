And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that the complaint was not signed by the attorney, as required by law, and that the plaintiffs had almost two months to rectify the issue. The defendant also moved to advance the hearing date on the motion to strike and the concurrently-filed demurrer. The judge found that the defendant's motion to strike was unopposed, and therefore granted it, ordering the complaint to be stricken without prejudice. The judge also noted that without an operative pleading, the demurrer and motion to trial preference were moot. The judge's ruling is tentative, and the parties must indicate whether they intend to submit to the ruling by emailing the court.
