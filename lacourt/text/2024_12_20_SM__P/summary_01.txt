And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on defendant James' motion for reconsideration of the court's findings that a settlement agreement between plaintiff Rowley and other former defendants did not apply to defendant James. James argues that the court overlooked language in Rowley's motion for summary judgment against James' cross-complaint, which allegedly indicates that the settlement agreement applied to James as well. However, the court has determined that James was neither a party nor an intended beneficiary of the settlement agreement, and therefore the agreement did not apply to James. The court has also found that James' arguments are unavailing because they are unsupported by citations, speculative, and insufficient. As a result, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
