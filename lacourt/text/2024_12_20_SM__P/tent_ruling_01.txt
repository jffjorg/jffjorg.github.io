Rowley v. James, Case no. 21SMCV00336
Hearing date December 20, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion for Reconsideration
Defendant
James moves for reconsideration of the court’s findings that a settlement
between plaintiff and other former defendants did not apply to defendant James,
pursuant to CCP 1008. Defendant argues the court overlooked language in
plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment against James’ cross-complaint which
allegedly indicates the settlement agreement applied to James as well. James
argues a motion to set aside deemed admissions is pending and as such the court
should reconsider its findings.
CCP
1008 requires new facts or new law. Defendant essentially argues the court
ruled erroneously. Defendant’s arguments are unavailing. The court determined
defendant was neither a party nor an intended beneficiary of the settlement
agreement. Min. Order 12/12/24; Min. Order 11/18/24; Min. Order 10/22/24; Min.
Order 9/18/24. Plaintiff did not release his claims against defendant. No new
facts or law was alleged. Defendant’s arguments are unsupported by citations,
speculative, and insufficient. DENIED.
