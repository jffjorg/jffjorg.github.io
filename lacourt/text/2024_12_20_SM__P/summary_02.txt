And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a case involving Jadidi, a condominium owner, who is suing the Azzurra Homeowners Association for violating CC&Rs, private nuisance, and negligence. The defendant argues that Jadidi failed to provide responsive answers to discovery requests and did not include a separate statement in opposition to the motion, as required by law. The judge agrees with the defendant, finding that Jadidi's response to a judicial council form interrogatory was factually devoid and failed to establish facts in support of Jadidi's allegations. The judge also notes that Jadidi did not provide a separate statement of undisputed facts or underlying evidence in support of the claims. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that Jadidi has failed to meet its burden of proving there is a question of material fact.
