The court's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel further deposition testimony of Daniel Sydney Andrews will be granted as to the questions regarding Plaintiff's contributory negligence. The court also intends to grant the motion as to the question about when Plaintiff retained an attorney in this case. Additionally, the court will allow Plaintiff's counsel to present his explanation for the withholding of evidence at the hearing. The court is inclined to continue the hearing if new matters are raised that Defendant would be entitled to reply. As for the sanctions, the court notes that it is inclined to hear Plaintiff's counsel's arguments during the hearing to discuss the reasoning behind why evidence has not been provided and why such objections were given during the deposition. The court will defer to Plaintiff's counsel on whether the delay and/or withholding of evidence in this case has to do with the recent birth of his child.
