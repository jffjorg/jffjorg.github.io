And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion by Defendant Rolls-Royce Motor Cars NA, LLC, et al for attorneys' fees in the amount of $61,545. The motion is based on the dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint. The judge notes that the Defendant incurred costs and expenses in defending against Plaintiffs' claims, including filing four demurrers and propounding written discovery. The judge is inclined to continue the motion to allow Plaintiffs to file an opposition, unless they are submitting to the amounts requested. The judge notes that the Defendant's time entries for the second, third, and fourth demurrers seem excessive and may be unreasonable. The judge will hear oral argument at the hearing and then finalize the tentative ruling.
