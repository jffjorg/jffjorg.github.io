            [1] Although
the Real Parties-in-Interest have filed a notice of joinder, it lacks a
memorandum of points and authorities.  See
CRC 3.1113.  As such, it is merely a
cheerleading effort with no effect on the merits.


            [2]
Respondents request judicial notice of (1) the ODA (RJN Ex. 1); and (2) the Order
Modifying Decision of Director of Industrial Relations to Correct Clerical
Error in Clemons (RJN Ex. 2).  The
requests are granted.  Evid. Code
§452(c).


            [3] The
court agrees that essential facts are missing for the first through third causes
of action.  Richter fails to identify
what confidential information is in the ODA, alleges discrimination based on
race and national origin but never indicates the basis and manner of
discrimination, and alleges bias without providing concrete facts.  Dem. at 6-7.


[4] The
court need not address whether individual Respondents have quasi-judicial
immunity.  Dem. at 8-9.
