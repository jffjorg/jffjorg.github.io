[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
FIRST AMENDED
  VERIFIED PETITION FOR APPROVAL FOR TRANSFER OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
  RIGHTS BY AND BETWEEN S.B., TRANSFEROR, AND BENTZEN FINANCIAL, LLC,
  TRANSFEREE, PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA INSURANCE CODE
  §10134 ET SEQ.
 



 
Background
On November 28, 2023 in this action,
Petitioner Bentzen Financial, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a Verified Petition for
Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights by and Between
S.B., Transferor, and Petitioner, Transferee, pursuant to California
Insurance Code section 10134, et seq.
On December 7,
2023, Petitioner filed a First Amended Verified Petition for Approval for
Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights By and Between S.B.,
Transferor, and Petitioner, Transferee, pursuant to California
Insurance Code section 10134, et seq. Petitioner
requests that the Court approve the transfer of certain structured settlement
payment rights by and between Shawn Becerrada
(“Payee”)
and Petitioner pursuant to Insurance Code section 10134,
et seq.
On January 3,
2024, the Court issued a minute order concerning the instant petition, which
provides, inter alia, that “the
First Amended Verified Petition is continued to February 6, 2024 so Petitioner
can file an Amended Declaration and provide the requisite notice.” On January
30, 2024, Petitioner filed a “Supplemental Exhibit ‘H’ to First Amended
Verified Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights.” 
On February 6, 2024, the Court issued an
Order continuing the hearing on the First Amended Verified Petition again. The
Court continued the hearing to March 12, 2024, so that “Petitioner can provide
the requisite notice.” (February 6, 2024 Order at p. 3:22.) On February 7,
2024, Petitioner filed a “Notice of Continued Motion for Order Approving
Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights…” No opposition to the instant
First Amended Verified Petition has been filed. 
Discussion

In the above-referenced February 6, 2024
Order, the Court noted that “it still does not appear that Petitioner has provided ‘[n]otification that any interested party is entitled to support,
oppose, or otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or
by counsel, by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in
the hearing,’ or ‘notification
of the manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition
must be filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the
transferee’s notice, in order to be considered by the court.’ (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(J)-(K).)” (February 6, 2024 Order at p.
3:14-19.) 
As set forth
above, on February 7, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of the continued March
12, 2024 hearing on the petition. The notice states, inter alia, that “you are entitled
to support, oppose, or otherwise respond to the transferee’s application,
either in person or by counsel, by submitting written comments to the court or
by participating in the hearing,” and that “you have been provided with
notification of the time and place of the hearing and of the manner in which
and time any written responses to the application must be filed, which may not
be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s notice, in order to be
considered by the court.” (Petitioner’s February 7, 2024 Notice at p. 2:8-14.) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds
that Petitioner has corrected the defects identified in the Court’s February 6,
2024 Order. The Court also finds that Petitioner has corrected the defects
identified in the Court’s January 30, 2024 Order on the instant First Amended
Verified Petition. 
Conclusion
Based on
the foregoing, the First Amended Verified Petition is granted. Within
five days of this hearing, Petitioner shall file and serve a proposed order. 
Petitioner
is ordered to provide notice of this order.
