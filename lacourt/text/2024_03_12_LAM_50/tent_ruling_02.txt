  ORDER RE:  
 
PETITIONS TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF
  PENDING ACTION (3)



            
            Background
            On March 8, 2022,
Plaintiffs Jose Barbosa Hernandez[1];
Maria Del Altamirano Salinas; Haide Rubi Barbosa Altamirano; Luis Miguel Salado
Jimenez; Michelle Barbosa; Rene Eliced Lopez Guardado; Noah Abel Barbosa, a
minor by and through his Guardian Ad litem, Jose Barbosa Hernandez; Joshua
Daniel Orejel, a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Haide Rubi Barbosa
Altamirano; and Zoe Bella Salado, a minor by and through her Guardian Ad Litem
Haide Rubi Barbosa Altamirano (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action
against Defendants H&Y Investments, dba H&Y Investments LP; Yu Lian C.
Lee; and GPK Group, Inc. 
            The Complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) violation of Civil Code section
1942.4, 
(2)
tortious breach of the warranty of habitability, (3) private nuisance, (4) Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq.,
and (5) negligence. 
            The parties have reached a settlement in this matter.
Haide Rubi Barbosa Altamirano as Petitioner for Claimants Joshua Daniel Orejel
and Zoe Bella Salado, and Jose Barbosa Hernandez as Petitioner for Claimant
Noah Abel Barbosa (jointly, “Petitioners”), now petition for the Court’s
approval of the settlement on behalf of the Claimants. 
            Discussion
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated with court
approval. (Prob. Code, § 3500.) The petition
must be verified by the petitioner, must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, and
must be prepared on judicial council form MC-350. (CRC 7.950.)
Each of the petitions are prepared on Form
MC-350 and are verified by the Petitioners. However, the Court notes that Item
14 of each of the petitions is blank. 
            Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
petitions and approve the compromise, subject to Petitioners correcting the
defect identified above, and subject to Plaintiffs’ examination of Petitioners
at the hearing.  
 
Petitioners are to
give notice of this ruling.
