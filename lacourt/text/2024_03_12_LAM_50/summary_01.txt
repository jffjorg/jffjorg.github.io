And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the First Amended Verified Petition for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights filed by Bentzen Financial, LLC (Petitioner) and S.B. (Real Party In Interest). The Petitioner had previously filed a Verified Petition and a First Amended Verified Petition for approval of the transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights from S.B. to Petitioner. The Court had previously issued orders continuing the petition due to deficiencies in the notice provided by Petitioner. However, Petitioner has since corrected these defects by providing adequate notice to interested parties. As a result, the Court finds that the Petition is granted and orders Petitioner to file and serve a proposed order within five days of the hearing.
