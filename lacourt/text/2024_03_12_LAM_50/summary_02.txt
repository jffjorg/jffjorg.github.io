Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petitions to approve the settlement of the minor's claims and has tentatively ruled to grant the petitions, subject to the petitioners correcting the defect in their petitions and subject to the plaintiffs' examination of petitioners at the hearing. The judge notes that the petitions must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, as required by Probate Code section 3500. The judge intends to approve the compromise, but will do so only after the petitioners have corrected the defect in their petitions and the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to examine them.
