Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff 99 Shopping Center LLC's motion to enforce the settlement with Defendants So Cal Development 1, LLC and Ginny Lin. The parties entered into a settlement and stipulation on August 1, 2023, which required the Defendants to pay Plaintiff $100,000.00 in $2,500.00 monthly installments. However, the Defendants failed to pay the Judgment Amount and Plaintiff sent a written notice of default on December 12, 2023. Since the Defendants have not cured the default, Plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the full Judgment Amount, less any payments made and received. The judge also awards Plaintiff attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $1,230.00.
