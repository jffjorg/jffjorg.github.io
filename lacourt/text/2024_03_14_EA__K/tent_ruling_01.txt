Legal Standard
“If parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the 
court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by 
the parties, the
court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until 
performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 664.6, enforcing the settlement and entering judgment in accordance
with the terms of the settlement.
On or about August 1, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a
written “Stipulation and Mutual Release Agreement” (“Settlement”). (Truong
Decl., ¶¶ 2 and 3, Exh. 1)[1].
Simultaneously with said Settlement, Plaintiff and Defendants executed a “Joint
Notice of Settlement and Stipulation for Dismissal” (“Stipulation”), which was
entered by the court on August 1, 2023.[2](Id.)
Plaintiff’s counsel Tiffany Truong (“Truong”) sent a letter to Defendants on
August 2, 2023 with final copies of the Settlement and filed Stipulation. (Id.,
¶ 3, Exh. 1.)
Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement, Defendants agreed to pay
Plaintiff, jointly and severally, the total sum of $100,000.00 (“Judgment
Amount”), in $2,500.00 monthly installments, beginning on October 31, 2023 or
within 90 days of the Effective Date[3]
and continuing no later than the last day of each successive month thereafter
until paid in full. (Id., ¶ 3, Exh. 1, ¶ 3).
Paragraph 4 of the Settlement provides as follows:
Entry of Judgment Upon Default.
Upon a failure to timely tender payment 
as described in the foregoing
Paragraphs of this Agreement (a ‘Default’), and 
after giving Defendants seven (7)
business days written notice to cure the 
Default, upon the failure of
Defendant to cure, Plaintiff shall then be entitled 
to enter judgment for the full
Judgment Amount, less any payments that have 
been previously been made and
received, and shall have no obligation to 
consider the judgment in the Civil
Action satisfied until it is paid in its entirety. 
Plaintiff shall be entitled to file
an ex parte declaration of noncompliance 
describing the Default, the giving
of notice and the failure to cure, requesting 
that judgment against Defendants,
jointly and severally, and in favor of 
Plaintiff enter for $100,000.00,
less any payments made and received, plus 
any associated filing fees or costs
associated with filing said ex parte, and the 
court shall enter judgment for said
sum forthwith. Defendants shall be jointly 
and severally liable for entry of
any judgment entered against them under this 
Agreement. 
 
(Id., ¶ 3,
Exh. 1, ¶ 4.)
On December 12, 2023, Truong sent written notice of default
to Defendants, advising therein that no payments had been received and
requesting that default be cured within 7 business days. (Id., ¶ 5, Exh.
2.)[4] Truong
has not received any response to her letter and Defendants have not submitted
any payment, as of the date of Truong’s declaration. (Id., ¶ 5; see also
Chiang Decl., ¶ 3.)
Further, Paragraph 11.5 of the Settlement provides as
follows:
Attorneys’ Fees. If any
party to this agreement commences a judicial 
proceeding to enforce any provision
of this Agreement or is required to defend 
a judicial proceeding commenced by
any party to this Agreement, the 
unsuccessful party or parties shall
pay to the prevailing party or parties all of 
his or its litigation costs,
expenses and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in 
the action, including appellate and
postjudgment proceeding. 
 
(Id., ¶ 3,
Exh. 1, ¶ 11.5).
Truong requests attorney’s fees and costs of $1,230.00
[calculated as follows: 2.6 hours preparing December 12, 2023 letter,
corresponding with client re: default and preparing motion at $450.00, plus $60.00
filing fee].
The motion is granted. Plaintiff is awarded
attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $1,230.00.
