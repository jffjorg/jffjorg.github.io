Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is rejecting Lessee's argument that the Settlement is not enforceable because it was signed by a person lacking authority to sign on behalf of Plaintiff. The judge finds that Lessee's argument is not supported by any legal authority or evidence that would refute the authority of Victoria Chiang to sign the Settlement on behalf of Plaintiff. Additionally, the judge finds that Lessee's counsel never responded to the Notice of Default in Settlement and that the Settlement was signed by the correct entity name. The judge also notes that the "Effective Date" of the Settlement is the later of the date of execution by Plaintiff or Defendant.
