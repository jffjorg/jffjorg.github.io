Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment/special adjudication. The plaintiff, Ling Chen, brought an action against the defendants, Zihan Geng, Bo Tai Group (BTG), and Yong Han, alleging causes of action for breach of oral contract, breach of written contract, money had and received, money lent, and unjust enrichment. The defendant, Zihan Geng, moved for summary judgment/special adjudication on the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action.

The judge found that the defendant had met her burden of showing that the second cause of action for breach of written contract had no merit. The defendant had signed a personal guarantee for the second loan agreement under duress and had no interest in BTG, the borrower. The judge also found that the plaintiff could not establish her third, fourth, and fifth causes of action for money had and received, money lent, and unjust enrichment, respectively, because the defendant had not received any of the money loaned and had no access to the accounts that received the money.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standards set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 437c, which requires the moving party to show that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action. The judge also cited relevant case law, including Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center, Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., Gaggero v. Yura, and Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center.
