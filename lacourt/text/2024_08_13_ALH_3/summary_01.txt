And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Dilys Jones, as trustee of the Louis Petrie Separate Property Trust, to the Second and Third Causes of Action in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Café on Lemon, Inc. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the complaint to support the claims of intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic relations.

The judge finds that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to support the claims and sustains the demurrer. The judge also grants Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff to serve verified responses to special interrogatories.

The judge notes that Plaintiff's opposition brief was late and that the arguments made in the brief are irrelevant. The judge also finds that Plaintiff's claims for interference with prospective economic relations are based on a breach of contract, rather than tort, and that the alleged interference is the same conduct underlying the breach of contract.

The judge has set a hearing for August 13, 2024, at which the parties may appear to argue the matter. If the parties do not submit on the tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the judge may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
