Defendant Transamerica Life Insurance
Company (“Defendant”) (erroneously sued as “Transamerica Occidental Life
Insurance Company”) filed two motions relating to its first set of Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One (“RPD Set One”) served on both plaintiffs,
Suzanne Dunaians and Deanne Bilemjian (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). On April
11, 2024, Defendant sought an order compelling Plaintiffs Suzanne Dunaians and
Deanne Bilemjian (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) to produce documents in
compliance with their respective responses to RPD Set One, specifically
requests for production (“RFP”) Nos. 16-17, 24-29, 34, 37, 46-47, 51-53, and
56-57 directed to Suzanne Dunaians and RFP Nos. 16-17, 24-27, 31, 34, 43-44,
48, 50-51, and 54-55 as directed to Deanne Bilemjian. 
Also on April 11, 2024, Defendant filed
a motion to compel Plaintiffs further responses to RPD Set One on the grounds
that Suzanne Dunaians provided improper responses to RFP Nos. 18-20, 46, 54,
and 57, and Deanne Bilemjian provided improper responses to RFP Nos. 18-20, 43,
52, and 55. Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs have failed to produce all
responsive documents. 
Defendant seeks sanctions against
Plaintiffs and their counsel of record. 
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition brief arguing that Defendant’s motion seeking further responses is
untimely. On July 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition brief arguing that
Defendant’s motion to compel compliance is untimely. Plaintiffs also claim that
they have produced responsive documents to the best of their ability. 
Timeliness
A motion to compel a further response
to discovery must be filed within 45 days of the service of the response, or
any supplemental response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, sub. (c).) Subject to certain inapplicable exceptions,
“[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to o any act or make any response
within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which
time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be
extended after service by electronic means by two court days.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) Electronic service is deemed complete “at
the time of the electronic transmission of the document or at the time that the
electronic notification of service of the documents is sent.” (Id.,
subd. (a)(3)(A).) 
Plaintiffs’ Second Supplemental Responses
at issue were served on February 22, 2024, by electronic mail. The 45-day
deadline falls on April 8, 2024. With an extension of 2 court days, this motion
should have been filed by April 10, 2024. Therefore, the motion to compel
further, which was filed on April 11, 2024, is untimely. 
Defendant contends that the 45-day
period did not begin running until February 27, 2024, because a document is not
considered served until 5 days after it has been deposited in the mail. But the
responses were not served by mail and in any event, section 1013(a) of the Code
of Civil Procedure provides that “[s]ervice is complete at the time of the
deposit.”  
Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs’
responses improperly include objections which were waived due to their untimely
initial responses. If Defendant believed that the objections were invalid,
Defendant was obligated to timely move for an order compelling a further
response. As set forth above, Defendant failed to do so. 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion to compel
further responses is DENIED. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in
the amount of $1,050 consisting of 3 hours at Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate
of $350, payable within 30 days.
In contrast, there is no deadline to
bring a motion compelling compliance with production of discovery consistent with
a party’s statement of compliance. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320.) Accordingly,
the Court proceeds to analyze the merits of Defendant’s motion to compel
compliance. 
          B. Motion
to Compel Compliance
Defendant moves for Plaintiffs’
compliance with their responses to Nos. 16-17, 24-29, 34, 37, 46-47, 51-53, and
56-57, as directed to Suzanne Dunaians, and RFP Nos. 16-17, 24-27, 31, 34,
43-44, 48, 50-51, and 54-55 as directed to Deanne Bilemjian. Plaintiffs argue
that this motion should be denied as they have complied to the best of their
ability. The documents which are still allegedly withheld include documents
evidencing lost rent, contractor loans, tax penalties, withdrawals from
retirement accounts, loan originating documents, and documents relating to
Deanne Bilemjian’s individual account.  In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs argue
that their document production is sufficient. This argument is belied by their
simultaneous claim that they are in the process of obtaining information and
additional documents from other sources, including Raffi Bilemjian, the trustee
of “the operative family trust.” Based on this admission that outstanding
documents have not yet been produced, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
compel compliance in its entirety.  Plaintiffs
are ordered to comply with their statements of compliance within their initial
responses as well as their supplemental responses within 30 days. 
The Court imposes sanctions against
Plaintiffs in the amount of $2,510 consisting of 7 hours at a reasonable rate
of $350 and a filing fee of $60, payable within 30 days.
