And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff, Georgia Durante, is seeking to compel Hyundai Motor America to produce further responses to her request for production of documents. The plaintiff alleges that Hyundai's discovery responses were inadequate and that the company is attempting to dodge its discovery obligations. The judge has determined that Hyundai's filing of a motion to compel arbitration has stayed the discovery process pending the resolution of the motion. The judge has therefore continued the motion to compel further responses until October 4, 2024, and has ordered Hyundai to give notice of the ruling.
