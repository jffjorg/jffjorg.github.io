And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving an automobile collision between Liana Ordaz (plaintiff) and Levon Anayan (defendant). Empire Fire and Marine Insurance Company (intervenor) has intervened in the case, claiming that the collision was staged to defraud their insurance companies. The defendant has filed a motion for protective order to exclude recorded statements made to Empire from evidence, citing attorney-client privilege. The plaintiff has filed a discovery request seeking information from the intervenor. The judge has granted the motion for protective order, but only for the limited purpose of responding to the current discovery requests from the plaintiff. The judge has not opined on the validity of the defendant's attorney-client privilege claim and has not issued an order that prevents the disclosure of the existence of the recorded calls. The case is continued to August 20, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. or any date thereafter upon stipulation of counsel.
