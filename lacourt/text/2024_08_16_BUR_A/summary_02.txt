And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies THC's motion to authorize Adult Protective Services (APS) to disclose investigative reports concerning the deceased father of the plaintiff, Anita Aslanyan. The motion is procedurally defective because THC did not cite to or argue disclosure under the Public Records Act, and did not properly notice the involved public agency. The judge also notes that the Freedom of Information Act is not applicable to California public agencies. The motion was brought without serving a deposition subpoena on APS, and the judge finds that the procedural defects render the motion defective.
