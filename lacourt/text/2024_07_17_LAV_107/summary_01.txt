```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

This court rules that the arbitration agreement presented by the defendant is not enforceable. The agreement does not comply with Section 1295's requirements and is an adhesion contract that is unconscionable. The court also finds that the plaintiff has raised sufficient evidence of the costs of arbitration and the plaintiff's inability to pay them, which makes the arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
