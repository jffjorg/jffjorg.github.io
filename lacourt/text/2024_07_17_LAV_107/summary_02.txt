And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Dennis Schroeder. The demurrer was filed in response to the first amended complaint brought by the plaintiffs, Kristopher Lamberson, Dante Santana, and Jordan Cox. The plaintiffs alleged causes of action for bad faith retention of a security deposit and breach of contract.

The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs will not be allowed to refile their complaint. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Lease agreement between the parties requires mediation of disputes before bringing legal action. The plaintiffs did not attempt to mediate their disputes before filing the complaint, and therefore, the defendant is entitled to demur to the complaint.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiffs' efforts to pursue mediation were inadequate or non-existent. The judge has cited several cases in support of its ruling, including Charles J. Rounds Co. v. Joint Council of Teamsters No. 42, which held that a plaintiff who fails to pursue mediation before bringing a lawsuit may be barred from pursuing the lawsuit.
