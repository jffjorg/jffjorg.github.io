PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S DISCOVERY ORDER DATED MAY 22, 2024,
AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Maria Hernandez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Kia
America, Inc.
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a
Song-Beverly action.  On December 29, 2023, plaintiff Maria Hernandez
(Plaintiff) filed a motion to compel defendant Kia America, Inc. (Kia), to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents
(RPD), Set Two, Nos. 49 and 51.
 
            On May 22,
2024, the court granted in part Plaintiff’s motion as to RPD No. 51.  Kia was directed to provide a further
response to RPD No. 51 within 30 days of the court’s order.  However, Kia did not provide a further
response.
 
            On August 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Kia to comply with the court’s May 22,
2024, order.  Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions against Kia and its counsel.
 
            On October
30, 2024, Kia filed an opposition.  
 
            On November
5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
            As a
threshold issue, Kia indicates it served a further response to RPD No. 51 on
October 29, 2024.  Plaintiff acknowledges
receipt of the responses.  Accordingly,
the motion is MOOT.  The court proceeds
to consider the request for monetary sanctions
              
 
 
II.        DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions against Kia and its
counsel.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the
discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct
such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection
to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿ 
      Kia argues sanctions
are not warranted because Kia complied with the court’s May 22, 2024, order by
serving further responses on October 29, 2024. 
(Pratty Decl., ¶ 7.)  Kia explains
the reason further responses were only recently served because “it took much
longer than expected to assemble and sift through the records to obtain
responsive documents. To the extent that KA could formulate a reasonable search
of its electronically stored information regarding the Vehicle, production of
the information involves more than a simple stroke of the keys. Someone with
technical expertise has to review and analyze the potential matches to
determine whether any particular “match” actually had any conceivable relation
to Plaintiff’s complaints. KA’s attorneys would then have to review the data to
determine whether it was actually responsive to Plaintiff’s Request(s).”  (Pratty Decl., ¶ 6.)  
In reply, Plaintiff argues Kia had anywhere from four months (counting
from the court’s, May 22, 2024, to the filing of this motion) to thirty months (counting
from April 2022, when Plaintiff propounded the discovery request) to provide a
response to RPD No. 51.
      The court finds the imposition of some sanctions
is warranted. Kia waited until the day before its opposition was due to serve
the further response.  Further, there is
no evidence to show Kia communicated the challenges it was experiencing in complying
with the May 22, 2024, order. 
Accordingly, the court imposes sanctions of $510, consisting of one hour
at Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate, and $60 in filing fees.  
      However, the court declines to impose sanctions
against Kia’s counsel.  “[W]hen a party
seeking sanctions against an attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of
the discovery process, the burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he
or she did not recommend that conduct.  (Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81.)  As discussed above, counsel explains the
difficulties in sifting through the records and obtaining responsive documents.  Kia’s counsel did not counsel the discovery
abuse.
III.         CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
to compel compliance is DENIED as moot. 
 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.  Sanctions are imposed against Defendant Kia
America, Inc. in the sum of $510, to be paid to Plaintiff, by and through her
counsel, within 30 days of this order. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
