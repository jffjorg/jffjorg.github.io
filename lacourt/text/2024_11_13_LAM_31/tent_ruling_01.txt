PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 664.6

Jessica Stevens and Frederick Stevens
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On June 19, 2019, plaintiffs Jessica Stevens and Frederick
Stevens (Plaintiffs) initiated this “lemon law” action against defendants NBA
Automotive, Inc. dba Nissani Bros. Chevrolet (NBA Automotive), TD Auto Finance,
LLC, Merchants Bonding Company, and General Motors, LLC.  The operative pleading is the Third Amended
Complaint which alleges causes of action for (1) Violation of the Consumers
Legal Remedies Act, (2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act,
(3) Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., (4) Fraud and
Deceit, (5) Negligent Misrepresentation, and (6) Violation of Vehicle Code §
11711, et seq.
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiffs and NBA Automotive settled
Plaintiffs’ claim.  The Settlement was
memorialized by a signed Settlement Agreement. 
On February 1, 2024, the court dismissed the action and retained
jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 664.6.  
 
Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, NBA Automotive was
required to pay Plaintiffs $15,000 within 30 days of signing the Settlement
Agreement.  NBA Automotive failed to make
the payment.  
 
The Instant Motion
 
             On August 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this Motion
for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6.  Plaintiffs also seek attorney’s fees.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD  
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.¿ If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
In hearing a section 664.6 motion, the trial court may
receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment.¿ (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)¿ The court may interpret the terms and
conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561,
566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed
to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810).¿ The party
seeking to enforce a settlement “must first establish the agreement at issue
was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally
before the court. [Citation.]”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that a letter confirming the essential
terms of a settlement agreement was not a “writing signed by the parties”
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section 664.6].)¿
 
III.      DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiffs argue NBA Automotive breached its obligations
under the Settlement Agreement.  Specifically,
NBA Automotive failed to pay Plaintiffs $15,000.00 within 30 days after signing
the Settlement Agreement.  (Compendium of
Exhibits (COE), Ex. 1, ¶ B.2; Barry Decl., ¶ 6.)
 NBA Automotive, having not filed
opposition, does not present any evidence or argument to the contrary.  Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an order
entering judgment against NBA Automotive.
¿ 
Plaintiffs also request an award of reasonable attorneys’
fees.  Under the Settlement Agreement, in
the event of litigation between the parties in respect to the Settlement
Agreement or any provision thereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover from the other party their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  (COE, Ex. 1, ¶ 17.)  Given
the court’s ruling that NBA Automotive breached the Settlement Agreement, the
court further finds an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs is
proper.  Plaintiffs request $1,668 in
attorneys’ fees and $60 in costs associated with filing this motion for the
total sum of $1,728.  (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 8,
10.)  The court finds the request is reasonable.  The court will add the $1,728 in attorneys’
fees and costs to the overall judgment.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ unopposed Motion for Entry of
Judgment is GRANTED.  Judgment is entered for Plaintiffs and against
Defendant NBA Automotive, Inc. in the total sum of $16,728.   
 
Plaintiffs to give notice.
