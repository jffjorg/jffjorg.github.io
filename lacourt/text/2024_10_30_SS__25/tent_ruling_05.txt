On May 15, 2024, plaintiff Pacific Rejuvenation Medical (Plaintiff) filed the  complaint against defendant Fouzia Almarou (Defendant), alleging that Defendant  failed to pay money owed to Plaintiff.   The complaint was served by  personal service on May 24, 2024, to the address at 6460 Balboa Blvd., Apt 4,  Van Nuys, CA 91406 (the Balboa Address). Defendant did not file a responsive  pleading. Default was entered on June 27, 2024, and default judgment was  entered on August 12, 2024.    On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the instant motion to set aside/vacate judgment. No opposition has been filed.   II.                  Legal Standard    There are four bases upon which a defendant may seek to set aside a  default judgment: (1) relief for “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable  neglect under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), (2) the  default judgment was void as a matter of law, (3) lack of actual notice under  Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, subdivision (a), or (4) equitable relief  for “extrinsic fraud or mistake.”   “When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party  in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered  against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of  motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the  action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable  time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a  default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or  her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)    “A notice of motion to set aside a default or default judgment and for  leave to defend the action shall designate as the time for making the motion a  date¿prescribed by¿subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and it shall be accompanied  by an affidavit showing under oath that¿the¿party's lack of actual notice in  time to defend the action was not caused by his¿or her¿avoidance of service or  inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve and file with¿the¿notice a copy of  the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (b).)    “Upon a finding by the court that the motion was made within the period  permitted by subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of actual notice in time  to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or  inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default or default judgment on  whatever terms as may be just and allow the party to defend the action. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (c).)   III.               Discussion    Defendant moves to set aside the  judgment on the basis that she was never served. Defendant submits an affidavit  and evidence that at the time of service on June 26, 2024, she did not live at the  Balboa Address, having moved out on September 28, 2023. Defendant contends that  she therefore could not have been personally served at that address, and her  failure to respond was therefore not caused by her avoidance of service or  inexcusable neglect. Defendant does not state how she came to learn about the  lawsuit. No opposition has been filed.   Defendant’s motion was filed On  October 7, 2024, 102 days after entry of default on June 27, 2024. This is  within the time limit provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5,  subdivision (a). Judgment was entered on August 12, 2024. Defendant’s motion  falls within the time limit provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5,  subdivision (a).   However, Defendant has not filed a  proof of service of her motion on Plaintiff. Proof of service of moving papers  is required under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1300.   Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s  motion to set aside the judgment is CONTINUED to January 6, 2025 at 10:00  a.m. in Department 25 of Spring Street Courthouse, located at 312 North Spring  Street, California 90012.     IV.               Conclusion & Order   For the foregoing reasons,  Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment entered on 08/12/2024  is CONTINUED TO JANUARY 6, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at  the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE, located at 312 North Spring Street Courthouse.    At least 16 court days before the  next scheduled hearing, Plaintiff must file and serve supplemental papers  addressing the issues discussed herein. Failure to do so may result in the  Motion being placed off calendar or denied.                   Moving  party to give notice of ruling.
