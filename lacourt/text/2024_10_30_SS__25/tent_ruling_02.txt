ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            This
case arises from an alleged breach of an attorney-client retainer agreement
between Plaintiff Salisbury Group, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Defendant Natale
Mercuri (Defendant). According to the complaint, Defendant was billed for legal
services and costs relating to the scope of Plaintiff and Defendant’s
attorney-client retainer agreement, and Defendant has failed and refused to pay
the legal bills. (Compl., page 3.) 
 
            On
January 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging causes
of action for (1) breach of contract, and (2) common counts.
 
            On
October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to deem admitted
Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, set one. 
 
            On
October 17, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. 
 
            On
October 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            “Any party may obtain
discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action admit
the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of
fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission
may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)  “Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party
can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue
this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in
substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280(c).)
 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to deem
admitted Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, set one
(RFAs) that was served upon Defendant.

 
            Here,
on August 22, 2024, Plaintiff served upon Defendant via email Plaintiff’s RFAs.
(Salisbury Decl., ¶ 9; Exhibit A.) Thus, the last day to serve verified
responses to the RFAs was September 24, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
did not receive Defendant’s responses and Defendant did not request an
extension of time to respond. (Id. at ¶¶ 10-11.) Defendant argues that
he was not properly served with Plaintiff’s RFAs because the email address used
for electronic service was incorrect, but the email address Defendant suggests is
the correct email address is the same email address Plaintiff used for
electronic service. (Frey Decl., Exhibit A.) 
 
Defendant
also provides that the failure to timely respond to Plaintiff’s RFAs was due to
Defendant’s counsel’s inadvertence. (Sanders Decl., ¶ 5.) Upon discovering the
mistake, Defendant filed the responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs. (Id. at
Exhibit B.) Thus, Defendant is in substantial compliance prior to the hearing
of the instant motion. 
 
Therefore, the Court
DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted its RFAs that were served upon
Defendant. 
 
IV.             
Sanctions

 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), provides, in part: “It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary . . . on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”
 
While sanctions
would mandatory against Defendant because Defendant did not timely serve the
responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs, Plaintiff is representing her own law firm and
thus would be considered an attorney who litigates in propria persona. With
respect to sanctions, pro se litigants may not recover attorney’s fees as a
discovery sanction. (Kravitz v. Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
1015, 1020.) Thus, Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery sanctions.
 
However,
pro se litigants may recover reasonable expenses actually incurred, including
computer-assisted legal research, photocopying, transportation, or any other
identifiable expense. (Id. at p.1022.) Plaintiff declares that she
incurred the following costs in filing the motion:
 
-         
Filing
fee: $60.00
-         
E-filing
costs for the motion: $10.50
-         
EFM
filing fee: $4.50
-         
E-service
costs for the motion: $1.00
-         
E-filing
costs for the reply to response to the motion $10.50
-         
EFM
filing fee for the reply: $4.50
-         
E-service
costs for the reply: $1.00
 
This totals $92.00. The Court finds
this reasonable, and awards Plaintiff the full costs
incurred in bringing this motion.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER:
 
For the
reasons stated above,
 
Plaintiff Salisbury Group, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Admitted
Its Request for Admissions, Set One is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for Monetary Sanctions
is DENIED. Plaintiff’s Request for Costs incurred is GRANTED in the amount of
$92.00, payable to Plaintiff within 15 days of this Court’s order. 

 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
