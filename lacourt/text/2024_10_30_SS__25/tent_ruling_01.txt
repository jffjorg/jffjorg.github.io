ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
            On January 20, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(Plaintiff) filed an action against Defendant Karen Matranga
(Defendant) for subrogation, stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant
and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance policy. (Compl. ¶
6.).  Plaintiff compensated the insured
for claimed damages in the amount of $10,853.03 and filed the instant claim
against Defendant for allegedly causing the damages.  (Ibid.)  
 
On March 28,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate
and Enter Judgment Upon Breach (Stipulation), signed by both parties, to
dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for
the settlement amount of $8,390.05.  On November
2, 2023, the Court dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the
Stipulation.
 
On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment (Motion).  
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
CCP
§ 664.6, provides a summary procedure that enables judges to enforce a
settlement agreement by entering a judgment pursuant to the terms of the
parties’ settlement.  In particular, the
statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms
of the settlement.  If requested by
the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary
dismissal of an action or special proceeding terminates the court’s
jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los
Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary nature,
strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to
invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for
the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the
same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed
necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request
must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been
dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request
must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97
Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here, the
parties signed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter
Judgment Upon Breach (Stipulation) containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 and to
enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in the event of
default.  (Stipulation ¶ 3.)  Prior to the dismissal of this action, the
Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at p. 3.)  The Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated that it “shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (04/16/2024 Order.)
 
The Court finds that the
Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this
action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation
Agreement filed on March 28, 2024, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed
to dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for
the settlement amount of $8,390.05 (Stipulation ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendant’s
insurance carrier would make an initial payment of $4790.05, which was made on
June 19, 2023. (Ibid.) Subsequently, Defendant would make a payment of
$600.00 by April 1, 2024, and then beginning on May 1, 2024, Defendant would
make sixty (60) monthly payments of $50.00 until the settlement amount is paid
in full. (Ibid.)  
 
The Stipulation
also provides that in the event Defendant fails to make timely payments,
Plaintiff will mail a letter to Defendant regarding the default.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  If Defendant does not remedy the default
within 14 days of receiving notice, “then plaintiff will be entitled to have
any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered for the settlement
amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any costs associated with
entering the judgment not to exceed $500.” 
(Ibid.)  The declaration of
Plaintiff’s counsel shall be sufficient proof for judgment to be entered.  (Ibid.)
 
On July 9, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion for an order to vacate the dismissal and
enter judgment against Defendant. According to Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a one-time payment of $4,790.05; however, Defendant
failed to make any payments. (Espinosa Decl. ¶ 4.) On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff
mailed Defendant a default letter regarding the missed payments; however,
Defendant has not made any payments.  (Id.
at ¶¶ 5-6, Exhibit C.)
 
Plaintiff seeks
to have the dismissal set aside and judgment entered against Defendant in the
amount of $4,100.00 as follows: $8,390.05 (settlement amount), minus $4,790.05 (payment
made by Defendant’s insurance carrier), plus $500.00 (court costs).  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  The court costs consist of $370.00 complaint
filing fee, $80.00 service of process fee, and $60.00 motion fee.  (Id. at ¶ 8.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant defaulted
on payments and has not made any additional payments after Plaintiff sent
notice.  Thus, a valid
and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set
Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  Dismissal entered on April
16, 2024, is vacated, and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against
Defendant for $4,100.00 as follows: principal amount of $3,600.00 plus court
costs of $500. 
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  
 
The Dismissal entered on April 16, 2024, is hereby set aside
and vacated, and Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
Total amount of $4,100.00, calculated as follows: Principal amount of $3,600.00,
plus Court Costs in the amount of $500.00. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
