Here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a breach of contract case between Pacific Rejuvenation Medical (Plaintiff) and Fouzia Almarou (Defendant). The Defendant is moving to set aside a default judgment entered on August 12, 2024, alleging that she was never served with the complaint. The Defendant claims that she did not live at the address where the complaint was served on June 26, 2024, and therefore could not have been personally served. The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to set aside the default judgment to January 6, 2025. The Plaintiff is required to file and serve supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed in the ruling at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.
