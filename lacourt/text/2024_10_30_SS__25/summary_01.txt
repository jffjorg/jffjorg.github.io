And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff) filed a motion to vacate the dismissal of its action against Karen Matranga (Defendant) and enter judgment against Defendant. The action was dismissed on April 16, 2024, on the basis of a stipulation agreement between the parties. The stipulation agreement provided that Defendant would make payments to Plaintiff in exchange for dismissal of the action.

However, Defendant failed to make the payments and breached the agreement. Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant, which the court granted. The court found that the stipulation agreement was valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6, and that Defendant had defaulted on payments.

As a result, the court entered judgment against Defendant in the amount of $4,100.00, which includes the principal amount of $3,600.00 and court costs of $500.00. The judgment is based on the settlement amount of $8,390.05, minus the payment made by Defendant's insurance carrier of $4,790.05, plus court costs.
