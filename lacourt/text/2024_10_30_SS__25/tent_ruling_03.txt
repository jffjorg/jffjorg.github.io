ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
This is breach
of contract case. On August 25, 2023, plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint against defendant Rares Crisan (“Defendant”),
alleging that Defendant failed to pay money owed to Plaintiff.
 
The complaint
alleges that the parties entered into an Indemnity Agreement in 2012, in which
Plaintiff provided a bond to Defendant in reliance on Defendant’s promise to
save Plaintiff harmless from any resulting loss. (Compl., ¶ 5.) Defendant breached
his obligations by refusing to reimburse Plaintiff upon demand, resulting in
damages in the amount of $5,200, plus interest, attorney’s fees, and costs.
(Compl. ¶¶ 8-9.) In 2021, the parties entered into a reimbursement agreement,
in which Defendant agreed to reimburse Plaintiff through monthly payments a
total amount of $9,955.12. (Compl., ¶ 11.) However, Plaintiff only received
payments under the reimbursement agreement in the amount of $1,800.) (Compl., ¶
13.)
 
On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for summary judgment, along with supporting declarations,
exhibits, and a statement of undisputed facts. 
 
Notice of the motion and supporting
papers have been served in compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure §
437(a)(2) on August 6, 2024.  
 
No opposition has been filed by
Defendant. 
 
II.                
Legal Standard 
 
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.  In analyzing such
motions, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3)
determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable,
material factual issue.”  Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.  Thus, summary judgment or summary adjudication
is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in
the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact
exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
CCP § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741. 
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate or establish
an essential element.  Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.”  Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.  A motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must be denied where the moving party’s evidence does not prove
all material facts, even in the absence of any opposition or where the
opposition is weak.  See Leyva v. Superior Court (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222
Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387. 
 
Once the moving party has met the
burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to show via specific facts that
a triable issue of material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense
thereto.  CCP § 437c(o)(2).  When a party cannot establish an
essential element or defense, a court must grant a motion for summary
adjudication.  CCP § 437c(o)(1)-(2). 
 
III.             
Request
for Judicial Notice 
A motion for
summary judgment “shall be supported by affidavits, declarations,
admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which
judicial notice shall or may be taken.” (California Code of Civil Procedure,
section 437c(b)(1).) Request for judicial notice must be made in a separate
document. (California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350(c)(5).) Judges cannot take
judicial notice of hearsay statements asserted in court filings, but can take
judicial notice of the existence of such documents. Johnson & Johnson v. Superior Court (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 757, 768; Williams v.
Wraxall (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 120, 130, fn. 7 (judges may take
judicial notice of the existence of court documents, “but cannot take judicial
notice of the truth of hearsay statements in decisions or court files,
including pleadings, affidavits, testimony, or statements of fact.”). Courts
can take judicial notice of the fact that complaints were filed, but not of the
truth of the statements contained in those. Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 471, 483.

Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint filed on October 17, 2023.  The Court GRANTS the request for judicial
notice. 
 
 
IV.             
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment on the basis that the undisputed evidence demonstrates Defendant has
no defense to the breach of contract cause of action alleged in the FAC. 
 
 To establish a cause of action for breach of
contract, the plaintiff must show: “(1) [t]he existence of a contract; (2)
plaintiff performed its obligations under the terms of the contract, or
plaintiff's performance thereunder was excused; (3) defendant breached the
contract; and (4) plaintiff suffered damages as a result of defendant’s breach.
(M.G. Chamberlain & Co. v. Simpson (1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 263.)”
 
Plaintiff
alleges that a written Indemnity Agreement exists between the parties and Defendant
failed to indemnify and reimburse Plaintiff for money paid out. [SSUF ¶¶ 1-3.]
Indemnity Agreement entered into between Plaintiff and Defendant identifies the
indemnity owed to Plaintiff. [SSUF ¶3] The surety reviewed the claim for
potential violations of the Business & Professions Code, and based on Plaintiff’s
review of the submitted documentation, it was reasonably clear that Defendant
was in violation of Section(s) 7109, and 7113. [SSUF ¶¶4-6]. Notice of the good
faith settlement was provided to Defendant dated April 15, 2021. [SSUF ¶¶5-6]. Plaintiff
issued payment to Claimant Galleria Kitchens & Baths in the amount of
$7,500.00 from the Bond [SSUF ¶6] and reminded R C Custom Cabinets and
Defendant of their indemnity obligations to indemnify and to hold Plaintiff harmless
and requested reimbursement of the Bond loss. [SSUF ¶¶6-9, 11-12]. 
 
Defendant was
aware of the payment to Claimant since Plaintiff notified Defendant of its
determination that liability for Claimant’s claim under the bond was reasonably
clear and financial damages incurred by Claimant. [SSUF ¶¶4-6]. Plaintiff further
notified Defendant after payment was made. [SSUF ¶7, 12]. Defendant agreed to
make payments to Plaintiff and then defaulted after only paying $1,800.00
towards the $7,500.00 loss. [SSUF ¶¶8-9,11-12]. 
 
ACIC has been
damaged in the principal sum of $5,200.00 plus interest at the legal rate from
the date ACIC paid the claim and attorneys’ fees and costs. [SSUF ¶13, 14]. The
total amount of interest that has accrued on the claim against Defendant’s bond
is $2,013.07. [SSUF ¶14].
 
 Defendant, in his responses to Plaintiff’s
requests for admission, admitted that he agreed to indemnify and reimburse
Plaintiff for any and all sums paid out under the bond and that he did not pay
Plaintiff the sum of $5,200 plus attorney’s fees and costs due under the bond.
(Exhibit List, Ex. 4.) Furthermore, Plaintiff has submitted as exhibits the
indemnity and reimbursement agreements made between the parties and signed by Defendant.
(Exhibit List, Ex. 3.) This establishes that a contract existed between the
parties, Defendant breached the contract, and Plaintiff suffered damages as a
result of Defendant’s breach. 
 
Plaintiff has
produced admissible evidence on each element of its causes of action for breach
of contract. [SSUF ¶¶ 1-36].  Therefore,
Plaintiff has carried its initial burden, and the burden now shifts to
Defendant to show that there is a triable issue of material fact.
 
Defendant has not filed any
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and has not filed any
evidence demonstrating a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, Defendant
has failed to carry his shifted burden. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.

Crisan is GRANTED.
