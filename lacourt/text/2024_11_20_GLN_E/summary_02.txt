And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Ally Bank, has not provided sufficient proof of service for its motion for a writ of possession. The plaintiff failed to file a proof of service for the moving papers, which is required by law. Additionally, the plaintiff's counsel appears to concede in the Case Management Statement that the parties named in the complaint have not been served. As a result, the court cannot determine if the defendant has received notice of the motion. Therefore, the court is denying the motion for a writ of possession. The court will hear argument on whether to continue the hearing.
