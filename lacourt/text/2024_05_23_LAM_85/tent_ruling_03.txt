also takes issue with Watson’s characterization that that it did not appear at Mr.
Nguyen’s deposition based on its view that it was unreasonable and
unnecessary.  The City contends that the
deposition was scheduled on short notice without consideration for the schedule
of the City’s counsel or the deponents. 
On January 15, 2021, the City filed an ex parte application for a stay
of discovery pending the City’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was
granted by the court.  Watson never
sought to take the deposition of Mr. Nguyen again.  


[2] Watson
seeks additional costs incurred since the filing of the Cost Memorandum of
$1,945.55 for additional legal research and document retrieval and $746.68 for
additional e-filings.  Taber Decl., ¶
26.  The City correctly replies that the
procedures for claiming and contesting costs are governed by CCP section
1034(a) and CRC 3.1700.  The request is
denied.
