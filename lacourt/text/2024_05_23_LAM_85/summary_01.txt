**Case Number:** 19STCP01720

**Tentative Ruling:**

The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has considered the relevant law and facts. The City's conduct in conditioning the approval of Watson's building permits on the annexation of the properties into the Carson CFD and payment of the special parcel tax is unconstitutional.

The Court finds that the City's actions violated Watson's constitutional rights, including its right to free speech and association. The Court further finds that the City's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and that Watson was forced to annex its properties against its will.

The Court grants Watson's petition for writ of mandate and orders the City to vacate its orders conditioning the approval of the building permits on the annexation of the properties into the Carson CFD and payment of the special parcel tax.
