And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for reconsideration filed by Paul Dawson, the Petitioner, to reconsider the court's denial of his Petition for leave to present a late claim against the Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles. The Judge finds that Dawson fails to satisfy the procedural requirement of providing an attorney affidavit stating the required elements of section 1008(a). Additionally, Dawson's new evidence does not show that the information was not available in the exercise of due diligence. The Judge concludes that Dawson's failure to timely present a claim was not excusable and that the new evidence concerns Housing Authority's knowledge and issues of agency, rather than excusable neglect in an effort to file a claim with Housing Authority.
