[1] The CUIAB’s request for judicial notice of
its decision (Ex. A) is granted.  Evid.
Code §452(c).  The request to judicially
notice a declaration from the California Office of Risk and Insurance
Management concerning the non-filing of a government claim (Ex. B) is denied.


[2] The CUIAB’s demurrer for Okon’s claim for
damages is both improper because it is not made for a cause of action and
unsupported by the allegations of the Petition or matter subject to judicial
notice.  As such, it is overruled.
