And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The City disputes Watson's characterization of the deposition of Mr. Nguyen, stating that it was scheduled on short notice without consideration for the schedule of the City's counsel or the deponents. The City also contends that Watson never sought to take the deposition again. Watson seeks additional costs of $1,945.55 for additional legal research and document retrieval and $746.68 for additional e-filings. However, the City correctly replies that the procedures for claiming and contesting costs are governed by CCP section 1034(a) and CRC 3.1700. The request for additional costs is denied.
