 Case Number:  23STCP04382    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  85 
Inyong Okon v.
California Unemployment Insurance Board, 23STCP04382


Tentative decision on demurrer:
sustained without leave to amend



 
            
 
Respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board
(“CUIAB”) demurs to the Petition filed by Petitioner Inyong Okon (“Okon”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition (entitled
“Notice”), and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            Petitioner
Okon filed the Petition against the CUIAB on December 4, 2023.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Okon
appeals from her being liable for repayment of $5400 in benefits.  The decision stated that she should provide
clarification of a birthdate discrepancy, as well as a birth certificate or
amended document, and submit it with her appeal.  She has finally received an amended passport
and can now prove her identity to show that the benefits were going to the
right person.  Okon has been under a lot
of stress from the Employment Development Department (“EDD”) and its continuous
reminder that she owes money.  She is
seeking monetary compensation of $30,000. 
She also requests that “they” stop the IRS from garnishing her money for
an overpayment she was entitled to; they already have taken $500.  
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            There
is no proof of service of the Petition on file.
 
B. Applicable Law
            A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleading alone and will be sustained where
the pleading is defective on its face. 
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP
§430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by
demurrer or answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is
timely filed within the 30-day period after service of the complaint.  CCP
§ 430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353,
1364. 
            A demurrer
may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading;
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to sue; (c)
There is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is
uncertain (“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible); (g) In an action
founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the
contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct; (h) No certificate was
filed as required by CCP §411.35 or (i) by §411.36.  CCP §430.10. 
Accordingly, a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds
for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially
noticeable matters.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (“Blank”)
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face of the pleading includes attachments
and incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v.
Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914.   
            The sole
issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the facts
pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v.
Superior Court, (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins,
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of plaintiff’s ability to
prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible difficulty in making
such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v.
Stewart Title Guaranty Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The ultimate
facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all facts that
may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v.
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance
v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates, (“Vance”) (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th
698, 709. 
            For all
demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the purpose
of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of
the meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the
specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide
legal support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The
party who filed the pleading must in turn provide legal support for its
position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how
the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal
insufficiency.  Id.  The demurring party is responsible for
filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer requirement has been
met.  CCP §430.31(a)(3).
            “[A] demurrer based on a statute of limitations
will not lie where the action may be, but is not necessarily, barred.
[Citation.] In order for the bar of the statute of limitations
to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on
the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows that the
action may be barred.” State ex rel. Metz v. CCC Information Services, Inc.,
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 413. 
            If a demurrer is sustained, the court may
grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as may be just and shall fix
the time within which the amendment or amended pleading shall be filed.  CCP
§472a(c).  It is an abuse of discretion to grant a motion for judgment
on the pleadings without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.  Dudley v. Finance
of Transportation (“Dudley”) (2001), 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 260.  However, in response to a demurrer and prior to the case
being at issue, a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended more than
three times, absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional facts to
be pleaded that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to
state a cause of action.  CCP
§430.41(e)(1).
 
C. Analysis
Respondent CUIAB demurs to the Petition filed by Okon.[1]  The CUIAB’s principal ground for demurrer is
that the Petition is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Unemployment
Insurance Code (“UIC”) section 410.  
 
UIC section 410 provides in pertinent part:
 
“A decision of the
appeals board is final….Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the right
of …any  party…to seek judicial review
from an appeals board decision shall be exercised not later than six months
after the date of the decision  of
the  appeals board….The appeals board
shall attach to all of its decisions where a request for review may be taken,
an explanation of the party’s right to seek such review.” (emphasis added).
 
The CUIAB’s decision at issue is AO-467000, which was a
consolidated appeal from two Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) decisions.  RJN Ex. A. 
In the first case (7358855), the issue was whether Okon was eligible for
benefits under UIC section 1253(a) beginning September 6, 2020.  Ex. A. 
The ALJ found good cause for Okon’s late appeal but denied her appeal on
the merits.  He found that she had
submitted a United States passport and California driver’s license with
different birth dates.  She was advised
to provide a corrected version of one of these two IDs with some other proof of
birth one month after the hearing. 
Nothing was received and the appeal was denied.  Ex. A.
In case (7358854), the issue was whether Okon was liable for
a $5,400 overpayment of benefits.  The
ALJ again found good cause for Okon’s late appeal but denied her appeal on the
merits.  Ex. A.  Since she had not shown eligibility, the requirement
of repayment was correct.  Ex. A. 
The CUIAB’s decision upheld the two ALJ decisions.  Ex. A. 
Although not dated, the decision has a mailing date of December 22,
2022.  Ex. A.  As a result, the decision was final on or
before that date.  The CUIAB complied
with UIC section 410 by attaching to its decision an explanation of Okon’s
right to seek judicial review.  Ex. A.
Okon did not file her Petition until December 4, 2023,
nearly a year after the CUIAB’s decision. 
The Petition is untimely under UIC section 410 and the demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend.[2]  If she now has the proper documentation,
Okon’s remedy lies with a new application to EDD for benefits.  Her overpayment and garnishment issues cannot
be remedied by this court.
 
D. Conclusion
The
demurrer to the Petition is sustained without leave to amend.  An order to show cause re:
dismissal under CCP section 581(f)(1) is set for June 6, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
